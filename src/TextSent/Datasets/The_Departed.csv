6.0~The Departed, go ahead and depart..please! thermann9 Sign in Permalink Not a terrible movie, but WAY overrated. Ridiculous dialog, predictable, and scenes that run on forever. Jack Nicholson overacts to such a degree that I laughed at several scenes that were supposed to be dramatic. And if I were the Boston State Police, I'd be furious at the depiction of unprofessional, irrational behavior exhibited by the central characters. Damon is a terrific actor, but seemed oddly miscast as a corrupt cop. I actually think Wahlberg would have been better as the morally bankrupt cop and Damon would have been better as the good cop with the anger management problem. So, not a bad movie, but I was terribly disappointed based upon the reviews and ratings listed here.
8.0~Nicholson newday98074 Sign in Permalink Jack dominates the film. He is so completely in charge every time we see him that the scene where he is killed seems a bit unreal. Wouldn't he have understood that the only reason this cop would have to keep him around would be that he knew something important? However quibbles aside this is a good, not great movie. It isn't close to Goodfellas or Godfather but it does tell a story, the acting is excellent and for the most part character motivation is on course. The psychiatrist is played as well as possible although she is the weak link and could have easily been omitted. If she was to be left in it would have been nice to see why she would act as she did. Worth seeing for Nicholson's performance.
10.0~synopsis macvader999 Sign in Permalink I suppose I was a little harsh in ranking The Departed a 7 out of 10 but whenever I watch a Martin Scorcese film I expect to see a great movie. I guess that's what happens when he's directed hits such as Goodfellas and Casino. Still, The Departed was an action-packed film that left me shocked (in a good way) as I left the theatre. The plot centers around Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) as a crooked police officer from Boston and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Dicaprio) as an undercover cop posing as a gangster in Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) gang. Basically, Costigan is recruited by Officers Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen) to become a mole within the Frank Costello crime operation. His work as a mole is totally clandestine with only Dignam and Queenan having any knowledge about his mission (to gather evidence to arrest Costello). Subsequently, Costello suspects that there's a spy on his crew and asks Sullivan, using his police power, to find out who the mole is. Unfortunately, for Sullivan, he doesn't have access to the records of undercover police officers and therefore has no knowledge of Costigan. To complicate the matter further, it is suspected that there is a mole within the police department and Sullivan is assigned to investigate such claims. Without giving away too many plot details, the rest of the film centers on Sullivan desperately trying to find the mole on Costello's crew while Costigan does the same for the police department. In general, the film was filled with much of what has made past Scorcese films so good, great acting, a solid plot, and a lot of action/bloodshed. In particular, I thought Matt Damon stole the show with a great (Oscar worthy?) performance as the suave yet cold Colin Sullivan. Also, Mark Walhberg was great in a supporting role as the bellicose Officer Dignam. Overall, I felt this was a great movie but still a tier (albeit a small one) below Scorese classics such as Goodfellas and Casino.
10.0~Stop Comparing angelshoney Sign in Permalink I can't understand why people keep comparing this moving to the original. This movie came from one that had a good story line and obviously the producer wanted to make his own. I haven't seen the original and nor do I care to. I think the majority of people have not seen the original so I don't think it's very fair to rate it b/c of some other movie. The acting in this movie was incredible. I couldn't believe my eyes through out the movie. I was in suspense the whole time. Dicaprio deserves an Oscar for his performance and the casting couldn't be better in the film. It was a completely different movie experience then any other movie i have seen, i felt as if i was part of this film and i was right going through the motions as the characters did. I don't know how i feel about the ending though. Maybe the DVD will have some alternate endings?
5.0~I beg you all to see the original version from HK gezhao Sign in Permalink I beg you all, especially those who vote > 8, please view the trilogy of "infernal Affair" (Wu Jian Dao) from HK before doing any judgment on anyone in Departed. I personally favorite staff in the movie, Jack, Matt, Leo, Martin. I have to say all actors are the best, also, the script. Director, i am so disappointed. The story and even most charming details are borrowed from the original version(the first installation of the trilogy, if you are interested, the following two are also the most excellent movies in HK movie history), however, Martin turned me down finally. No discussion on the reasons why the two mouse come to be themselves, (it has been a long way why they "departed"), please do not use only F-word to attract us, please don't regard everyone of us as fool. Matt is kind of no-brain to get all the info to Leo when they finally meet at the police office, and then became just a cold blood killer(still no-brain) to delete his files. is that make any sense, they looks like idiots there? Music is nice, but still a long way to the old one, which is much compatible to the atmosphere(which is also missing in this cut). And finally, the end is disappointed. where in the HK version, it is most exciting and moving 10 minutes during last 10 years. thanks!
6.0~Ridiculously overrated. OrrinBob Sign in Permalink Maybe it deserves a 7. It is quite to very suspenseful, with a valuably complex but not arcane plot, well-made, solidly acted (meaning in part that Jack Nicholson does not just re-enact his job as the Joker. DiCaprio was better in Blood Diamond.) The cast is indeed stunning. But right now it is ranked above such trivial fare as Citizen Kane, The Shining, North by Northwest, M, Vertigo, To Kill a Mockingbird, Eternal Sunshine, Bicycle Thieves...(citing only a few whose lower ranks make me want to vomit). I know I am beating a dead horse. It probably is, after all, better than Shawshank (dumb fanboy movie of the world, I guess), Cuckoo's Nest, Inception, Forrest Gump, and arguably 5 to 15 others in the top 46. But it has limited to no imagination and makes no contribution to film history. Its best picture Oscar should've gone to Pan's Labyrinth, or Volver, or conceivably The Lives of Others, or Letters from Iwo Jima, or Little Miss Sunshine--three to five other films to rank ahead of Departed. I haven't yet seen Infernal Affairs, so I can't make that comparison. But in a nutshell, I know Taxi Driver and Departed is no Taxi Driver (#68. Makes me nuts.)
1.0~Pathetic remake of a masterpiece PaulX7 Sign in Permalink The names that appear on the movie are just impressive: a great director (Martin Scorsese - I am a BIG fan of Goodfellas, taxi driver, Raging Bull just to name a few of his movies) and great actors (Di Caprio, Nicholson, Sheen, Daemon, Wahlberg), but the entire movie and the way how it was directed is just a total disappointment from beginning to end. Nicholson being overly cruel, Wahlberg being overly cynical and aggressive towards everyone (and why??), Di Caprio spending his time in the movie crying like a girl, Sheen inexistent... Also how can one believe that a stranger can earn a head of crime syndicate's trust in just 6 months, especially when that head of crime syndicate has the reputation of being very suspicious and doesn't trust people easily?? It looks to me that Scorsese was too ambitious, tried to do too much in a movie, and at the end, he just didn't deliver. I felt no sympathy or anger whatsoever for any single character in the movie. I am a BIG fan of Hollywood movies and Scorsese but for once, I prefer by far the original Hong Kong version, Infernal Affairs which is far better directed, more dramatic, where the psychology of the characters is far better developed (I actually felt sympathy for the undercover cop), and the story far more credible (it took the undercover cop several years to earn the crime lord's trust in the Hong Kong movie as opposed to a few months in The Departed). I now have the proof that even super talented directors and actors (whom you believe have nothing to prove anymore) with a huge budget are able to deliver a garbage...
2.0~Violent, pointless junk. Sorry, Marty! jt1999 Sign in Permalink Dear Marty: Well, you really blew it this time! Who the hell were you trying to please -- the teenagers who loved "Reservoir Dogs?" The infantile sadists who consider "Pulp Fiction" a masterpiece? What's the point in rehashing "Donnie Brasco" or "Prince of the City" and simply adding more violence? In fact, what's the point of the whole movie? That sooner or later we're all going to die, some of us by handguns? No kidding! "The Departed" is not only one of the most dreary, pointless, and ridiculously violent films ever to shame the silver screen, it represents a new low for one of America's greatest filmmakers -- you, remember?! What were you thinking? That you needed the paycheck? That you wanted to work with some great actors and your fave of the moment, Leo "he's no Howard Hughes" DiCaprio? Face it, Marty -- whatever you were thinking -- you should have thought harder! This is a cold, calculated, implausible film riddled with plot holes and worse, it has no heart. And what do we gain from it? Is there anyone out there who feels they've somehow benefited from it? If so, I'd like to meet them -- then recommend a good child therapist! Rather than a fascinating exploration of semi-psychotic behavior -- you know, the great films you used to make -- "The Departed" has nothing remotely interesting to say. It belongs in the cinema of juvenile nihilism carved out by an ex-video store clerk back in the last century (which I thought -- at least HOPED -- audiences had outgrown by now). Marty, remember when Cassavettes saw "Boxcar Bertha" and told you you'd spent a year of your life on a piece of s**t? Well, if he were alive today and saw "The Departed" he'd tell you the same thing -- and with good reason! "The Departed" isn't a Scorsese picture any more than "Boxcar Bertha" was. It's a sensationalist Tarantino knockoff with echos of "Goodfellas" and more than one Lumet film -- but with none of the humor, intelligence or compassion of any of those pictures. As far as the high-profile cast goes, Nicholson is no match for Pesci in the psychopathic sadist department, and Damon and DiCaprio, in all their one-note, tough guy splendor, are no match for Liotta or Depp. Sure, they're believable, but they're also deadly dull. Same with Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg, whose absurd character seems torn from a comic book. Vera Farmiga as the beautiful girl psychiatrist is sexy enough, but seems to be in a different movie -- one that actually has a connection to reality. The audience wants to connect with her, but since no one cares about any of the other characters (and unlike "Goodfellas," we're never quite sure WHO the main character is) we become as desensitized toward her as everyone else. Did anyone really care when Leo or Matt were killed? Did anyone shed as much as a tear? We CARED about Henry Hill, we CARED about Travis Bickle. You made us care, Marty -- With your genius, you made us love them! No one gives a rat's ass about Damon and DiCaprio. In fact I'd be willing to bet no one even knew Damon's character's name (Billy, was it?) until the end credits. Can you imagine, Marty, anyone watching one of your films in the 70s or 80s and not knowing Travis Bickle's name? Rupert Pupkin's? Jake LaMotta's? "The Departed" (and I'm only giving it a rating of 2 because I love you, man -- plus Ballhaus's cinematography was great) shouldn't be grouped with the rest of your films any more than "Bertha," it shouldn't be allowed to tarnish the real Scorsese pictures like "Taxi Driver" or "Mean Streets." To paraphrase one of your earliest efforts: it's just not you, Marty! More like the work of a cold-blooded punk who grew up on exploitation films and comic books (you sure Tarantino didn't ghost direct while you took a vacation?) Ultimately, it comes down to the script, and William Monahan (whoever he is) is no Paul Schrader, just as last time out, Josh Logan was no Mardik Martin. In order to be at your best, you've got to WORK with the best , right? So what's with all the 30 year-olds who haven't got a clue as to story structure,character development... who haven't a got a clue, PERIOD?!? All right -- relax and simmer down. It's not all bad news, I promise. And now that you've spent the last year of your life on a piece of s**t, it's time to get back on track, back to the stuff that matters -- like stories and characters people will actually care about (and I don't mean "The Aviator"!) As Harry Cohn, Jack Warner or any great studio chief might have said back before accountants started greenlighting films: give us characters we can love, stories we're fascinated by. Leave the comic book gunplay and Mexican standoffs to the 25 year-old Tarantino wannabes. You're too smart to be playing their brain-dead game, Marty! Too far along to stoop to their stupid level. And tell me this: what would John Huston have to say about this picture? What would Robert Aldrich? How about Howard Hawks? Or Stanley Kubrick?? You've lowered your standards, Marty, THESE are the people you've got to measure up to -- not a bunch of prepubescent Tarantino nerds who spend their lives on the Internet and playing video games! But don't worry, Marty -- I haven't lost faith. And please don't YOU lose faith, either. And if you have, think of the words of the great Lester Burnham, who in "American Beauty" wisely said something we should all remember: "It's never too late to get it back." Love, a Scorsese fanatic (in spite of it all)
1.0~Bad Taste PeteRoy Sign in Permalink I went to see the movie after I saw how high score it got in IMDb's top 250. After watching the movie I can say that I should not trust IMDb voters as much as I did in the past and I am using IMDb since 1999. This film is bad, it has no point, the story is not interesting, the characters are boring and in the end you go out with a bad taste. I will not watch this movie again and if you ask my opinion, I will tell you not to watch this movie unless you like seeing people getting shot in the head for 2 hours. The movie failed to make me sympathy with any character.
2.0~Scorsese never fails .... to disappoint. NewDivide1701 Sign in Permalink Overall, the Departed can be summed up in 2 words. "Taxi Driver." Meaning just like Taxi Driver, The Departed has incredible acting, a powerful story, that had a tonne of potential. But all of it came crashing down when Martin Scorsese directed, almost totally killing the movie. Rendering it boring, lame and impotent. The movie is about an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates a crime boss (Jack Nicholson) who is also looking for a corrupt cop (Matt Damon) who works for the crime boss (Nicholson). And the same corrupt cop (Damon) is looking for the undercover cop (DiCaprio). A simple case of hunter vs. hunter with ironically a powerful, yet impotent ending. When it comes to acting, specifically with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, and others, they probably would all be competing with each other for the Academy awards for best actor or best supporting actors. If the Departed were directed by anyone else, Quentin Tarantino, Bryan Singer, Michael Mann, Curtis Hanson, then the Departed most likely have limited competition for both best directing and best picture at the Academy Awards. But with Martin Scorsese at the helm, successfully diverting our attention away from the excellent acting and incredible story, he guaranteed himself a well deserved Razzie award for worst director and allowed a worst screenplay Razzie award as well. The brutality and the violence of the movie was very impotent and boring. Though having noticeable amounts of humour, thanks to the excellent acting and stories, they were almost totally overshadowed by the dullness of the movies poor pace, thanks to Scorsese. From the background, one person said that the the movie was confusing. And another said that it became more stressful, but felt like it was going nowheres. But if you can only focus on the story and the acting, the Departed is recommended. Actually, either just read the book or listen to the audio book with the actors doing the voices. But if you have to see the movie as a whole, watch something else, cause the Departed is a waste of time. Future note to Hollywood, let Scorsese set everything up, and leave him out of it after that. For story and acting alone, the Departed is definitely worth a 9/10. But with Martin Scorsese successfully putting in his infamous "going no wheres fast" feel to the movie, overshadowing everything else, give the departed ....... 2.5 out of 10.
1.0~Talent and tape wasted uzeus Sign in Permalink Talent and tape wasted. All the actors almost are top notch yet how can it fail to deliver on so many levels so frighteningly? Is it that perhaps Scorsese is now seriously getting old and losing it? Is it because the script gets nowhere? Or is it that even Nicholson cannot salvage this unfortunate movie from the baptism of criticism that it will get? Or is it Di Caprio who cannot shake off the novice look whatever character he portrays? Just another sad awful chapter in the saga of the withering directors work ( For reference please see The Black Dahlia by Brian De Palma). Cannot, in any way, be compared to the classics such as Scarface, Donnie Brasco, The Goodfellas, and the like. As for the Irish Mafia portrayed, I believe somehow something is amiss. Somehow, it lacks credibility, perhaps yearning too hard to be credited as tough as its Italian counterpart. And this movie being nominated for Oscars, that would be another thing coming...
6.0~Not the Best Movie Ever gcarreon Sign in Permalink First, I like to comment on the brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCarpio and Jack Nicholson. I'm not a film critic, but DiCarpio and Nicholson had the best lines and the best scenes in the whole movie. The scene in the restaurant where Leonardo pleads his case that he is not the "rat", while Jack Nicholson sniffs his wine glass, eats a bug, and pulls a gun out on DiCarpio was entertaining, gripping, and climatic. Mark Wahlberg also put in a great performance with the limited facetime he received in the movie. The movie had twisting plots that at times confused me, especially at the beginning where I actually didn't know if DiCarpio was undercover or not. The scenes that he busted up the two guys in the store and him selling cocaine with his cousin probably was the reason why I was confused for so long. I know that some movies are not suppose to be spoonfeed to the audience and sometimes it takes mentally looking back at scenes to figure details out. This I don't mind at all, it's rather interesting. Overall it was a good movie, I don't give it the credit that many give it because the past week I was hearing it was Scorsese's best film, but it was lacking what films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull had. What I'm saying is that the movies I mention above had the street elements involved which in turn described how the characters grew up and acted like they were. This movie didn't have that, it had the accents, but I feel it lacked the quality neighborhood addage that many of Scorsese's films have. I do recommend this movie, it has some of the best current actors at or near their peaks. You may want to keep the children and wife away though.
9.0~Must See greg-53682 Sign in Permalink Almost perfectly done movie. One of my favorite crime thrillers. Very good acting on top of great storytelling. A must see movie you won't regret watching.
9.0~An Adaptation Of "Infernal Affairs" Finally Wins Scrosese An Oscar? The Clueless Academy PeterTubbs Sign in Permalink "Infernal Affairs" is a superb film and so is this ingenious remake. I didn't think Scorsese could top two of his previous gangster masterpieces, "Goodfellas" and "Casino" but he has. This film has superlative performances by all the actors involved. The plot revolves around two moles, one who infiltrates South Boston's well known criminal organization and the other who infiltrates the police investigating the organization. Once it becomes known by both sides that these moles exist the cat and mouse fight for survival between the two begins. For years Scorsese worked with DeNiro which earned him a Best Actor Award for "Raging Bull". However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over. Recently he has taken DeCaprio, an excellent artist, under his wing and finally the favor was returned. At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors. This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle, authority, politics and corruption. This film has masterful acting, directing, cinematography, editing and screenplay. It is one of the finest in it's genre and a bravura film by Scorsese. Bravo Academy! You finally got it right.
1.0~Poor story, awful production. roneb Sign in Permalink What kind of medication, drugs, weed, or pills are the people who wrote and produced this movie on? If events depicted, characters portrayed are representative of what goes on in the USA, then the rest of the population of planet earth definitely would not be sane to emulate American behaviour and culture. The huge US movie industry has made many films which were great entertainment, "The Departed" was/is not one of them. This complex doublecross story was difficult to follow. Just a lot of blood thirsty people being nasty to each other. Shoot someone. Shoot anybody. Shoot everybody. Where does it stop? A movie never to be watched again, what a dud. The actors are not the problem,is not the actors, its the story and the scriptwriters and the production.
10.0~Oh captain, my captain....! lambiepie-2 Sign in Permalink The Departed is - a good film. It was more than what I expected, and even though many reviewers have stated there was much violence, I found that there wasn't as much as usual in the Martin Scorsese films of that genre. What was interesting that on many occasions, the violence does come from out of nowhere and sometimes, unexpected. The Deaparted is a story about 'who is who': law enforcement having an organized crime mole embedded in their department and the organized crime folks having a police mole embedded in their department - each racing against time to find out who is who. The performances of note do belong to Jack Nicholson (I do hope he does get an Academy Award nomination out of this!), Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson owned the role of Frank Costello - he was slimy, crazy, calm, sexual and murderous. Leonardo DiCaprio has turned into quite the serious adult actor and not the pin-up pretty boy little girls drooled over. In this film, he's tough, violent, emotionally hurt, confused and used. Matt Damon also deserves kudos's for being one of the best characters in this film for he was calm, cool, collective and a cold bald faced liar. The supporting cast was just as interesting: Alex Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Walhberg in roles that drove the story along in ways you couldn't fathom - and that's what makes this film watchable. There's a lot going on, even in this films' 2 and a half hours, but everything is leading to a tie-up in the end. Martin Scorsese brings his film team and film-making style to this project, which at times had me laughing at one minute and at other times in shock as to what was going on. The Boston area is captured very nicely here. But be warned, the language is hard in this film, as so the violence - and nothing is PC. Nothing. From the beginning of this film to the end, you'll know it. If you get offended easily, this is a film you might be uncomfortable with viewing. So I'll close by saying, up until viewing this film, I loved drinking cranberry juice for the fun of it. I guess I'll find another drink - captain, my captain.
3.0~Not Martin Scorsese's best film; lame towards end & unnecessary profanity as filler Michael Kenmore Sign in Permalink (Minor spoilers ahead, but nothing crucial) First off, I admire Martin Scorsese for his immense talent. I consider Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy his very best films, in terms of profound psychological affection as the result of masterly directing from the top-notch quality screenplays coupled with stellar actors, production design & cinematography. I enjoyed Martin's previous films Gangs of New York and The Aviator, despite the flaws. I went to the movies to see this film and was very let down by the problems laid out below: 1) Way too much profanity and vulgarity! I could have expected this as the movie is a gangster genre. Filler language become obvious whenever actors Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlburg speak dialogues. Don't get me wrong, profanity & vulgarity can be artful if written with the sharp-fine barb and spoken with mastered oratory as an actor embody the in-the-character expression with conviction. For example, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Full Metal Jacket. This film is right up there with The Last Detail, Scarface, Good Will Hunting and Made as the most colorlessly profane movies of all time that serve to irritate like fingernails scratching the blackboard from top to bottom in 45 degree angle. Filmmakers and screenwriters who over-utilize the F-word and demeaningly vulgar racial & sexual references to the extreme shoot their feet when it turns out nothing more than filler language that pad the mediocrely written & vapid screenplays that translate into even more annoying and vapid movies. 2) Bad acting across the board by Alec Baldwin & Marky Mark. Their so-called "acting" in screaming, cussing and assaulting are so over the top it's laughable. Not convincing at all. 3) The first hour is well-paced and tense. After that it went downhill in tedium with awful love triangle that go nowhere and is a plot device to pad the length. The action and twists towards the ending is stretching the reality to the point of having to suspend disbelief. Ludicrously plotted with marginal execution. At least clamshell cell phones have the starring role as the ingeniously written plot device to engineer the suspense. Alfred Hitchcock would have liked that idea if he were alive. 4) Jack sure can act like an evil mobster...at least in the first hour. Again, after that it went downhill with him acting like a clown fool and a prankster. Way to go for being out of character that pull the viewers out of the filmic world and see that Jack is just that -- Jack at his silliest in self-parody. 5) Final closing shot is unintentionally laughable for being so unsubtle Marty thought we the audience patrons are too dumb to get it so he stuck it in there. Even though the character in question seem to afford a very expensive luxury condo with no pests at all. Awfully stupid ending tied up in ludicrously complex double-triple-fourth crossing. I enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio's role as an undercover mole, he's right for the movie. However, Matt Damon is woefully miscast that made him unconvincing as the first-rate traitor. That actress who play a police psychiatrist is awful in failure to be convincing -- subpar acting trying to look too sweet and cute in angelic form amidst the carnage of brutal assaults & grisly mob murders. Martin Sheen could have done more, but he seemed too timid and meek of a police chief who meets the tragic fate -- on the setting of a television police drama. Fine cinematography and production design, but they should have tightened the pacing by cutting out the fat to make a lean & mean film. It drag on at times and whenever it drags they thrown in the train of F-bombs which is incredibly annoying after ten seconds. Not Martin Scorsese's best or better film. Apparently this is a re-make of the acclaimed Hong Kong film which I regret having never heard of but will make time to watch to judge that the original may be better in tightly edited pacing and high-octane suspense. ** 1/2
9.0~The Departed Review jte6451 Sign in Permalink "I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want the environment to be a product of me." - Frank Costello A remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, The Departed is once again yet another crime masterpiece that deals with identity and deception, and it's all done in such style that only Scorsese can pull off. Set in contemporary Boston, it follows Irish Mob boss Frank Costello who plants a mole within the Massachusetts State Police while, at the same time, the police sends an undercover cop to infiltrate Frank's organization. Eventually, both sides realizes what's going on and both moles race to identify each other before their covers are blown. In an age when remakes are often inferior to the original, there comes a remake where it takes the original concept and gives it its own unique style, and this is no exception. From its moving cameras, to its cinematography, Scorsese incorporates his own style into this film and gives it a gritty and tense feel to it. The editing, for the most part, moves at a steady and flowing pace, even if some moments where the editing moves frantically. The two major themes the movie deals with are identity and deception. Both moles are simultaneously trying to discover who each other are, but, at the same time, trying to blend into an environment they aren't originally from without revealing their true motives. It's also noted that both men, despite being different from each other, constantly competing in a similar manner is so clear and strong that it makes for some really intense moments. These intense and emotional moments wouldn't be possible without its star-studded cast, and each one delivers. Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a captivating performance as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon is great as Colin Sullivan, and, of course, Jack Nicholson, who might be the best performance in the movie, is outstanding as Frank Costello. Overall, The Departed is an excellent thriller. Emotionally gripping, thematic, and elegantly cinematic, it's one of Scorsese's best films and it's one of the best pieces of cinematic art. Final Verdict: 9/10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness.
4.0~Loose Ends, Unrealistic, Too Long makoz Sign in Permalink The movie had a shot at being good and maybe even great, but "The Departed" departs from reality, leaves loose ends, has outrageous plot holes, and is ultimately forgettable, rather than haunting. Let me outline it for you... Two kids grow up to be "Staties" (Mass State Troopers). One kid planted there by the mob (Matt Damon), the other kid chooses to be there as a revolt to his family (Leonardo DiCaprio). Both actors gave amazing performances. DiCaprio fits the image of a wise guy, and an eventual fall out - so he is placed undercover with the Mob (Led by Jack Nicholson -- also incredibly excellent). Damon (practically raised by Nicholson) as a mole in the state troopers constantly informs Niholson that he is about to be caught, thereby providing him with enough getaway time. DiCaprio of course keeps giving away Nicholson's position. Eventually, Both sides learn there is a mole and both sides ask Damon to figure it out. As such, Damon has a large conflict of interest in trying to find himself, and has no access to the under-covers who have been placed in the mob. Here's where the movie gets bad, stupid, sloppy, ugly.. whatever you want to call it... Damon starts dating a psychologist working for the police, and DiCaprio starts seeing the same psychologist as a patient. DiCaprio eventually ends up at her doorstep and sleeps with her. She has no apparent moral dilemma with the fact that she is cheating on her cop boyfriend and sleeping with who she thinks is a thug. Marky Mark -- great performance, and in the end, is completely wasted, and there is no explanation as to why he does what he does at the end of the movie. To make matters more confusing, Nicholson is also an FBI informant. Huh? This subplot was not needed and made no sense. I don't believe the FBI would have the highest man on the mob food chain on their payroll. Near the end of the movie, DiCaprio gives the psychologist an envelope and tells her to open it in two weeks or sooner if something happens to him. Well something does happen to him, and guess what? We never find out what is in the envelope. So, why did he give it to her? I just don't know. More sub-plot -- the psychologist gets pregnant. One might assume she is made pregnant to add conflict as to who's baby it might be. In the meantime, she shows an ultrasound and declares that it is a boy (which by the way, cannot be determined until about 16 weeks. So, why was she made pregnant? I don't know. As the movie moves along, you begin to think maybe there's a twist with the psychologist -- maybe she's running the show behind the scenes, but instead, we are just left hanging with nothing to take home. All this being said, the movie is entertaining but it's too long and eventually loses itself in it's continual unfolding subplots that go nowhere.
9.0~Great film sarum100 Sign in Permalink I finally saw this film the other day on DVD - for some reason I never got round to seeing it at the cinema...and I loved it. A smart, cat and mouse script, where the mice are both cats and the cats are both mice...a wonderful ensemble cast...and catchy, fast direction. Scorsese is often a director whom I admire far, far more than I enjoy - it's impossible not to be blown away by the styling and look of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull etc, but I can't say that watching them gives me a great deal of pleasure. Strangely, it's when he steps away from that iconic style that I love his films, rather than appreciating them in some distanced aesthetic sense.
10.0~An exquisite film... themegamanbeast2 Sign in Permalink When walking into the theater, I had low expectations for this film. However, this film made me see a side of myself I had never seen before. The brutality of the movie was indeed sickening, but was all in necessity to make the movie what it is. My friends and I had mixed reviews. Two of them thought the film was horrible and came out of the theater with headaches, while my other friend and I found the film a great one...one that would rock the ages. The music played in the background throughout the movie shifts from suspenseful to an Irish punk rock. This keeps the movie upbeat and really keeps the action going. Jack Nicholoson does an excellent job along with the rest of the cast. If you can stand the brutality, you will enjoy the film.
10.0~The Departed: An ode to the great William Shakespeare stefanbe Sign in Permalink For years, William Shakespeare has been regarded as the greatest writer in history and his works have been studied, analysed and influential ever since his quill first touched a sheet of paper. He had the ability to take familiar stories and turn them into something triumphant. He managed to enthrall audiences with his witty and fascinating dialogue and tales of star-crossed lovers and brave Moors, among others. This year, The Departed was honoured with the Academy Award for Best Picture and many that considered a triumph for Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest modern filmmakers still standing strong since he first came to prominence in the 1970's. However, I would not be surprised if Shakespeare was watching from above and applauding the win along with everyone else in the Kodak Theatre. After all, if he was a screenwriter in Hollywood, The Departed would certainly be a work of art he would produce. Unlike the typical action film that Hollywood likes to churn out every week or so, The Departed has actually an intelligent and well thought out plot that one needs to think in order to make sense of it all. Not surprisingly, this is due to it being heavily inspired by not only the Bard but also the Chinese film Infernal Affairs. Billy Costigan is a mole for the police who has been placed in the middle of the Irish Mafia of Boston, headed by the ruthless Frank Costello. Costello himself has placed an informant of his own in the police sector, Colin Sullivan trusted by the gangster since the boy's youth. Tensions run even higher when both learn of a mole on either side and with guns ablaze, the plan is to get them sniffed out. As the film's 152 minute running time comes to a close, identities are revealed, lives are lost and Scorsese adds another triumphant production to his filmography. Martin Scorsese, deservedly so receives the bulk of acclaim for The Departed as his eye for detail and clever camera-work is enough to make any film of his the heart of a film school course. Despite this being an American remake of an already great foreign production, Scorsese allows it to stand on its own and even surpass its inspiration. His talented ensemble of actors are also intelligent enough not to ham it up as they bring their characters to life easily. Leonardo DiCaprio sheds his pretty boy image, playing Costigan as the rebel who much like his actor wants people to forget his history and just see him for who he currently is. Matt Damon disappears into Sullivan and much like DiCaprio, plays a man leading a double life but not certain which one to choose. Jack Nicholson, always known for playing evil yet lovable villains portrays Costello as the ultimate of evil and a man you're cheering against and not for. However, the actor who gives the most enjoyable performance is Mark Wahlberg who plays a character who isn't even in the original. The film's writer William Monahan gives him some of the film's best lines and he delivers them with a sharp tongue. Wahlberg allows his f-words to be the most fun to listen to since the Canadian sung tune from South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut. As the film proceeds at its surprisingly fast pace, the film gets more and more exciting and us, the viewers, get more immersed and fascinated in the story. And then the last half-hour comes along and each character meets their demise, we're reminded of the triumphant finale Shakespeare wrote for Hamlet, his magnum opus. Each character, good and evil, dies and the audience laughs, not because it's ridiculous but because it's done in such a light tone. We gasp as blood gushes from their brains but even on the second viewing, when I knew a character's death was arriving, I couldn't wait for them to happen. I'm not a sick individual but it's so much fun watching one right after the other dropping down on the ground. And as Sullivan falls to the ground in the film's final scene and we watch a rat scurry on his window sill, we look back and want to see that last half hour again. Just for the fun of it.
1.0~This Movie Is COMPLETELY Overrated!!!!!!!!!!! josephmarkdavis Sign in Permalink Picture of the year my ass. It was completely mediocre and played like a made for TV movie from the 70's. The Boston actors can't even remember how to speak Southie and the "Whitey" character is not at all scary. This film does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as The Godfather. Even Godfather 3 was better than this. Leonardo DiCaprio believable as a mobster? Or as a tough guy cop? Come on. Same goes for Matt Damon. This did not deserve to win... at all. The Pursuit of Happiness, Letters From Iwo Jima and Pan's Labyrinth were all much better. So was The Last King of Scotland. So was every episode of the TV show Prison Break for that matter. It's time to stop the hype on this before we start getting remakes shoved down our throat.
1.0~Disturbing POS moorec64 Sign in Permalink The most disturbing piece of crap I've had the unfortunately pleasure of viewing in a long time. I'd rather watch StarShip Troopers. How many f-bombs and head shots can you stuff in a movie. I watched people walk out of the theatre and wonder why that couldn't be me. If you want to hear about 3 to 4 hundred f-bombs or graphic violence then this is your movie. What kind of graphic violence you may ask. Well if you like watching blood gush out of someone's head or see it splash all over the place not once or twice or even six times then don't pass up this opportunity. Geez what else can I describe to meet the 10 line requirement.
10.0~Scorsese's Oscar and this film's ending: as inevitable as a Greek Tragedy. javaman-7 Sign in Permalink Java Man Reviews "The Departed" (2006, R). Directed by Martin Scorsese. Written by William Monahan. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga. Running Time: 151 minutes This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com. OVERVIEW: Martin Scorsese, perhaps today's greatest living director, guides his grip truck through the mean streets again, this time steering into the Irish-American neighborhoods of South Boston. The first stop is the Massachusetts State Police induction ceremony, where two young recruits have earned their badges and are beginning their careers as cops. Ambitious Colin Sullivan (Damon) gets assigned to an elite investigative unit whose purpose is to bring down local crime boss Frank Costello (Nicholson). Street-smart but hot-headed Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) soon gets booted off the force and ends up as a confidant to the corrupt Costello. Screenwriter Monaghan quickly reveals that each man is actually a mole working for the other side, thus freeing Scorsese to dispense with suspense and get right to the exploration of these two complex characters. Along the way they are joined by other macho lawmen played by the likes of Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg. Adding a welcome female presence is Madolyn (Farmiga), a fascinatingly inept therapist who manages to develop a too-close-to-the-couch relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan. Scorsese and his crew build up the tension to its inevitable conclusion, which is reminiscent of Greek tragedy. REVIEW: 4 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS Early in the film, Colin Sullivan is being tempted from his youthful paradise by Frank Costello, king of the Boston underworld. Young Colin is played by a young actor, but there is no attempt to portray Costello as a younger man. This is one Scorsese's genius strokes. We immediately realize that Nicholson's Costello is ageless, just as Satan and his evil intentions are ageless. This is Nicholson's best scene and as the film progresses, he slips in and out of character (and Southy dialect) as he wanders between previous personas from The Shining and Batman. But that's no problem because this film has so much acting talent that it doesn't even need Jack in top form. DiCaprio and Damon give career-best performances, while such pros as Sheen and Baldwin do superlative supporting work. The most pleasant surprise comes from Wahlberg who is a revelation, and should have Mr. Scorsese direct all of his films. It has been noted that the former bad-boy based his character on a real-life Boston police officer who arrested him several times during his wayward youth. Farmiga, in the only prominent female role, capably keeps her head above water in this tidal wave of testosterone. The devil is in the details (so to speak) and Scorsese doesn't miss a trick. For example, Damon has a scene at a funeral where we see him with on-the-job facial injuries. Though the other characters don't notice, Scorsese's camera captures his twisted face in such a way that we see into his twisted soul. The screenplay takes the characters on a wild ride through the streets of Boston, but somehow we sense how most of them will end up--as victims of fate and inevitability. Scorsese has finally won his Oscar, as has the film itself. That, too, was inevitable.
7.0~Great film, but almost an exact copy of a greater film, namely Infernal Affairs sshriber Sign in Permalink If the plot of this film were original, which it isn't I would have given it a 9 out of 10. It was I think well acted, well put together in terms of cinematography, settings and sound. The original Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs) 2002 was I think a better film. It was better acted, more realistic, and less melodramatic. The scenario I found more coherent, less fragmented and with, surprisingly enough less superfluous violence. Also, in the original version two different women are involved and here just one. This change seemed contrived and unlikely. The ending of this film was fixed and not open ended as the original. I guess that is a matter of taste.
10.0~Scorsese goes back, once again to gangsterland. nived84 Sign in Permalink The Departed tells the story of two men working for the Boston state police; one is mole working inside the mob, and the other is a mole working for the Irish mob boss. Leonard DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, the cadet police officer sent undercover to infiltrate the Irish mob, which is headed by Frank Costello, played by the wickedly wonderful and outrageous Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the mole inside the police force that tips off Costello on the police's activity while trying to put him away. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg also star as police officers that are heading the investigation into putting Costello and his whole crew behind bars (or in a casket). Costigan works his way into the mob and Sullivan works his way up into the internal affairs unit of the state police, who is actually sent in to investigate who's been tipping off the mob. You can see a bunch of Scorsese's touches throughout the film; from his music selections (great use of Dropkick Murphys, but The Rolling Stones song is getting a bit old now), to long tracking shots and plenty of disturbing outbursts of violence; which hit you like a sledgehammer to face in the film's final moments. Where The Departed really shines are the performances. DiCaprio is great, and this is probably his best performance to date. Damon comes through, but he won't exactly blow you away, he usually delivers good work and he doesn't disappoint here. Nicholson is a scene stealing weasel that will probably be compared to, and loved much like Pesci's wild and crazy work in Goodfellas and Casino. Nicholson is perfectly cast and has a lot of fun playing a character so wildly evil and nefarious you just love to hate the son of a bitch. And what's up with Alec Baldwin? Seriously, when was the last time he was in a film this good, and seemed to be having so much fun. And Martin Sheen was also good, but he really wasn't given enough to do in my opinion. Whether or not Martin Scorsese will actually admit that his latest film, The Departed, is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller, Infernal Affairs, remains to be seen. I probably would have gotten a little bit more enjoyment out of The Departed had it actually been an original Scorsese film like Goodfellas or Casino, but this film pretty much follows the same exact plot as Infernal Affairs; beat for beat, up until the film's last minute twist ending which, no that I think about it actually does kind of make sense. Should you see The Departed in theaters? Yes, absolutely! Especially when you look at all the other amazingly craptastic movies playing in theaters right now you should definitely go out and see it, hell, see it just for the great performances; they alone are worth the price of admission. Actually the more and more I think about it, the more I love this movie. I'll definitely need to see it again, and if necessary again and again. I actually could see myself rating this one as a ten after multiple viewings.
6.0~Not as good as Infernal Affairs sbrdar Sign in Permalink Having seen Infernal Affairs, I had expectations that were perhaps unrealistic. The 2002 film from Hong Kong had action and depth. The writers of The Departed took an excellent story and expanded it. The additions made added nothing to the story, in fact they detracted from the main characters' struggles. The expansion of the mob boss character only served to highlight Jack Nicholson. While I enjoy Jack as much as the next person, the story is more about Costigan and Sullivan and their struggle with each other and their own demons. I will admit that the acting was very good. Unfortunately, a great cast does not necessarily mean a great movie. Scorsese was over the top in terms of the violence and side stories. All in all, I was very disappointed. I expect American audiences will be pleased enough.
10.0~loved it to death janicecarnevale Sign in Permalink i loved this movie. granted i have never seen the original version. I thought that the 2.5 hours passed pretty quickly, although the one scene about 2 hours in appears to be the climax but then its not and thats a little weird. i thought leo did an amazing job b/c i really forgot he was an actor. the editing was great and i don't think the "some years ago" at the beginning of the flick was confusing at all. clearly it is some years ago as matt damon is portrayed by a kid who is about 10 years old. the rest of the flick occurs about 15 years later (cell phones and all - oh no!). I will continue to highly recommend this movie to everyone i know.
8.0~Scorcese's back!!! banderson-25 Sign in Permalink A lot of critics were hailing this movie as one of Scorcese's best. I would have to agree. Although he will never top "Goodfellas" or "Raging Bull", Scorcese has managed to take a rather tired genre--mob movies--and breath new life into it. Of course, having about seven A-list actors in the cast would help any movie. Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen are solid, Ray Winstone is great in his biggest role to date, and Jack Nicholson and Leo DiCaprio deliver masterful performances. The weakest link in my opinion is Matt Damon, who comes across as rather stiff. The direction is pure Scorcese. The steadicam shots, the unexpected explosions of violence, and juxtaposition of humor and bloodshed--I was in Heaven. "The Departed" will probably get a few Oscar nominations. It might win one. For those wanting a break from the usual formulaic tripe, this is a true diamond in the rough.
9.0~"Heaven holds the faithful departed." classicsoncall Sign in Permalink With it's inventive twists and clever writing, I found "The Departed" to be an exceptional gangster film, with a couple of undercover rats (Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) working against each other on opposite sides of the law. For films like this I find it helpful to keep a scorecard, because after a while things start to get a little confusing regarding alliances, and every new revelation becomes a 'whoa' moment. Like learning that Irish Mafia chieftain Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is working the other side of the tracks as an FBI informant. And speaking of rats and Nicholson, did you get a load of that rodent impersonation he did? That was so priceless I had to do a couple of quick re-winds just to catch it more than once. It was one of those Nicholson 'Here's Johnny' moments that just cracked me up when I saw it. Storywise, I'm not naive enough to think this one was entirely credible; I happen to agree with other reviewers who call into question Billy's (DiCaprio) light speed infiltration of Costello's mob and the less than professional conduct of counselor Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) when she conducts an affair with Billy. But those are minor points I'm willing to overlook in the bigger picture. What I was more intrigued by were the double crosses throughout the story and nuances like the cat and mouse text messaging that clued Colin Sullivan (Damon) that Costello's gang had an informer on the inside. Very slick. Anyway, I like a good gangster flick and the characters and portrayals here are top notch. I especially liked Nicholson even if he didn't make it to the end of the picture. The finish will drop your jaw not once, not twice, but three times with it's unexpected turns, and will make you retrace your steps to reassemble the characters and their alliances. I thought it was very well done.
10.0~Rat on the Railing at the end nice touch! DavidHasselh0ff Sign in Permalink I consider myself a very discerning movie watcher, and am completely opposed to cheesy, Hollywood ridiculousness UNLESS it comes from Martin Scorsese. The guy could make an infomercial for spray on pubic hair and I would love it. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the Departed, and actually thought that the last shot of the rat on the railing with the government building in the background to be a perfect way to end things. Is this as a result of my devotion to Scorsese? I have read some posts that point out this scene as ridiculous, and I am just wondering what the consensus is on that particular issue? Alec Baldwin gave yet another incredible performance, almost on par with his movie stealing acting from Glengarry Glen Ross. The other thing I could see someone not hopelessly devoted to Scorsese taking issue with was the scene in which Costello's guy died on the couch before revealing Costigan as a bad guy. That seemed a little bit ridiculous. The violence in this film was done beautifully I thought, and yet I read some conments stating that the part where Martin Sheens character hits the ground and his blood sprays up on Costigan as looking fake. I could not disagree more, I though it looked quite realistic. Am i completetly blindfolded by my respect for Scorsese?
4.0~overrated and below Scorsese standards timmyj3 Sign in Permalink I rented this film to watch on Oscar night. Anticipating a classic Scorses film I was let down. While my opinion of Martin Scorses is and remains high I found too many issues to enjoy this film. Casting: I found the cast to be odd. Matt Damon is a perennial stiff and lived up to that rap again. Baldwin and Sheen are C list celebs and seemed more of a favor to someone that anything. I thought Nicholson was excellent along with Decaprio and Wahlberg. I didn't get the point of Vera Farmiga at all. I still cant believe that Scorsese cast this movie. It seems like this cast was put upon him. Screenplay: What a mess. What was all the cop killing at the end. Yeah that was pretty believable. What should have been a tightrope was more like a loose fishing line. I didn't buy the story almost from the start. While the movie should have focused on the gangsters we are treated to Matt and Vera playing house much of the time. This may be one of the worst screenplays of the last ten years in a highly acclaimed film. It was truly a mess. Acting: The problems started with the casting and continued with some poor performances. Matt is the new Harrison Ford. A one trick pony with almost no acting range. Vera should go back to TV bits. Sheen, Bladwin overact constantly. Jack was well Jack. I think the biggest problem for me was not concentrating on the gangsters more. I just don't find Damon, Sheen, Farmigo, Baldwin very interesting. As you can tell I wasn't impressed with the movie and I really wanted to be. I was concerned when I saw that Matt Damon was in the lead role. I really felt that Scorsese was looking for cash/fame/Oscar and took the bait. One of the old sayings is the masses are asses and I think this films popularity and awards confirm this. Wait for this clunker to show up on HBO or Showtime.
10.0~One of the very best films I have ever watched. d_e_a_n_k3 Sign in Permalink At first when they announced that Di Caprio was going to be the lead (or one of the lead) characters in The Departed, I was strongly against it. I hated the guy. I thought his acting was wooden at best and compared him to a poor man's Christian Bale. But after seeing him in this I have to change my view. He is outstanding, as is all of the cast, with exception of perhaps Martin Sheen who I think was perhaps miscast but still does a great job. But that's my only fault. This is Scorsese's masterpiece and I only hope that if they do make a sequel/prequel... that they don't bastardise what is truly a great film. The film has been called a shot-for-shot retelling of Infernal Affairs... but this doesn't begin to describe just how good this film is. Infernal Affairs is an amazing film, but The Departed takes the story to new places and does something that no film in the past five years has done... be re-watchable.
7.0~At least Decent. But Has Some Flaws. ShadowRomeo1784 Sign in Permalink My Personal Rating 7.5/10 - i don't think this film deserves an 8.5/10 score. martin scorsese is a decent director i liked his film "Shutter Island" the departed is a good film but some scenes are cheesy and unnecessary. the acting between Sheen, Nicholson, Damon, Dicaprio is good though. story is not that bad. just the cinematography is not that good, other than that it is an good film.
1.0~can you spell "deus ex machina"? childintime-1 Sign in Permalink Although I loathe a lot of what Hollywood does in films these days, I am willing to put up with much of it as long as the film pays off in the end. While there is much to admire in The Departed, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen, below the standards even of Training Day and John Q. I was quite mesmerized up to the point where Costigan discovers the truth about Sullivan. In spite of Scorsese's compulsion/obsession with every filthy aspect of human nature, I was very much enjoying the performances and the story. Then, it seems he or the screenwriter had a brainfart. In light of that fact, all of the excess of the film caused it to implode. In the ensuing vacuum, I could find no redeeming quality of the film at all. What does the story tell us? It wasn't true to itself at all. No one gained a thing. No redemption. No resolution. I am not an expert on films in any way. But it seems to me that when a story is developed on the strength of a collection of main characters, the story had better wind up focusing on the relationship between them. One by one, the supporting cast is eliminated. Then one of the three main characters is killed off. That leaves the two lead roles, and as far as I'm concerned, at this point it has to come down to the two of them. Whether it's a showdown or a meltdown, this film had to close with Costigan and Sullivan forcing the outcome. Instead, they are both eliminated with as little drama as if they were innocent bystanders. The fact that these events left as many questions as answers tells me that the director really didn't know what he wanted the story to say. The acting was superb, the story captivating, the suspense almost unbearable - what more could you want from a good movie? Well, as far as I'm concerned, without a good ending, all of the above amounts to little more than the hype that usually precedes a film, but in this case makes up the bulk of the film. Enough with the blood and guts, Mr. Scorsese, enough with the profanity and vulgarity - lets see if you can make a film that succeeds on its own merits. And in the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could convince the studio to refund my money.
9.0~A terrific film. Always worth watching. ejacobs23 Sign in Permalink Has there ever been a film with a better cast than this? I can't think of one. Comment if you can. The acting in this is amazing and every actor did their job. I think this is Leonardo's best performance. He did it so well and it was actually like he was the character and not actually performing. The music is awesome. Especially Shipping Up to Boston which is done by one of my all-time favourite bands @dropkickmurphys. The song was the perfect choice for the film and they played it at just the right times. The plot is ingenious and Scorsese directed it superbly. This film even managed to be better than Infernal Affairs, which is what this film was based upon. I love the opening scene with Jack Nicholson's monologue and it really set the film for what was to come. The film also had it funny moments (thanks to Mark Walberg). This film is extremely entertaining and I love the characters. There is nothing to complain about in this film and I could and probably will watch this over and over again. One of the best this century. I was actually sad when this film was finishing because I didn't want it to end. Acting: 10/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Entertainment Value: 10/10
1.0~Rip off! jappen-1 Sign in Permalink I thought I kind of liked Departed, despite its obvious continuity problems (surprising from such a supposedly amazing director), before I saw infernal affairs and realized what a blatant word for word, scene for scene, rip off this movie is. I'm giving Departed 1 star. Scorsese shows off his lack of creativity once again. I'll be giving Infernal Affairs 10 stars to compensate for other reviewers!! If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs I highly recommend it. You will not be able to help comparing it to Departed because it's all there- every scene! But it will be worth it to see what true originality and creativity look like. Tony Leung is one of the best actors in the world and though this is not his best film it is still well acted considering the Hollywood style of the movie.-Yes, I'm hating on Hollywood now. Scorsese obviously tried to fill his film (rip-off) with as many big name Hollywood stars as possible to compensate for the fact that he added nothing original to his movie. If imitation is the highest form of flattery then that's all the more reason to see Infernal Affairs. For those of you looking for an unbiased review of the Departed-sorry you're not getting it here. I just finished watching Infernal Affairs and all the tension and coolness I thought was in Departed was displayed so much better there- in it's original form. Oh, and did I mention that Infernal Affairs is an original- not that originality counts for much I guess. I don't mean to bash Scorsese completely. He does get props for recognizing that Infernal Affairs is a good original movie. But like the character in the movie- no spoiler here- Scorsese mimics something but does not become that thing. This has been his trade mark from the beginning.
1.0~My husband and I both disliked this movie MrsMEW259 Sign in Permalink My husband and I were prepared to really enjoy this movie, but could not get past the vulgar language. We don't enjoy a dialogue that has more words that start with "F" than any other word in the English language. Understand we're both in the construction business and are not prudes, but if you can't express yourself without using the "F" word, every other word, just don't talk. They used vulgar language so excessively I lost track of the point. I won't even comment on the visual violence! Enough already. We went to the movies to be entertained not grossed out. I, personally, have decided I will never attend a movie with these stars and this producer again. How can we expect our kids to NOT be violent when movies like this are the norm?
7.0~No reason to vote ayda-ayda Sign in Permalink I was excited to see the movie because of the cast and the story. I was very disappointed after 5th minute because it is the same exact copy of the movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS '. The scenes, the story, everything is the same. I would understand if they used the story as a base and made a movie out of it but I will not accept it if the only thing they changed is the cast. I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it's own. There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene. I will give my vote to the actors only because their performance ( especially Leonardo Di Caprio )was very good but that's all.
4.0~One Negative Vote (Spoilers) fdbjr Sign in Permalink This movie is sensational 95% of the way through. Di Caprio, whose skills as an actor are grossly underrated, is sensational, Damon is very good, and Jack Nicholson is endurable. (It would be nice to see a movie in which a director actually controls him, as Roman Polanski did in Chinatown. He is over-the-top now in every role, and sometimes it jars as it did here. Unfortunately, the 5 percent that fails is the last 5 percent of the movie. Did any of the critics who are extolling this movie notice that the ending is absolutely incoherent? Let me walk through it. 1. Costigan, the Di Caprio character, gives his girl friend an envelope that she is not supposed to open unless something happens to him. This is done with tremendous meaning and significance. It is, however, the last that is heard of the envelope. 2. Next, a cd arrives for her with an audio of an incriminating conversation between Sullivan (the Damon character) and Costello (Nicholson). Huh?? If Costigan was going to do this, why did he give her the envelope? And what became of it? Costigan explains that it was Costello's practice always to make tapes of conversations and store them at his lawyer's office. Costigan stole them and made the cd he sent the girlfriend. Huh?? This is the first we have heard of the lawyer, or the office, or the tapes. Why would a gangster do this? More to the point, how did Costigan know of it? None of this is explained. It all develops totally out of the blue in the last ten minutes of the movie. 3. Next Costigan lures Sulliavn up to a rooftop, and cuffs him, announcing his intent to arrest him. Huh?? Why didn't he send these incriminating cd's to the DA, or the police chief, or the Boston Globe? If what Costigan wants to do is arrest, why on God's green earth does he not just walk into the police station and show this mountain of evidence to somebody? More than this, Costigan has called to the scene a friend he went to the police academy with, with whom he exchanged a joke or two in one of the earliest scenes, two hours before. Huh?? Why him?? Why not Dignam (Mark Wahlberg's character) or - as mentioned - any regular police officer? 4. Costigan gets the cuffs on Sullivan, takes him down in an elevator, and without warning is shot through the head. Now you have to see the whole movie, but this is just script hari-kiri. As much as these Hollywood types like to flaunt their world-weary cynicism, this story requires a heroic ending. For two hours we have suffered along with Costigan, and di Caprio is really good. We do suffer. All of the emotional momentum is in that character's direction. There is an elementary principle of story telling violated here - you don't bump your protagonist off on a whim. 5. And boy, is this ever a whim. Costigan's killer turns out to be ANOTHER corrupt cop owned by Costello. Huh???? This movie is premised on the notion that there is ONE police mole, ONE gangster mole, and the two men are trying to find each other. We've been watching that story line unfold for two hours. The existence of a second insider throws doubt on nearly every scene that has gone before. (I am not going to go back and detail that point by point.) The second mole is so tangental that I could not recall him in a single scene before this sudden appearance. I could go on and on, for there are a couple of other twists every bit as bizarre and out of the blue as the ones described. But it is late, and you get the idea. I had the sense that someone on the Scorsese team could not stomach the obvious ending, where Costigan gets some sort of vindication and the girl. Well, that would be old-fashioned, but there are story lines that demand it, and this is one of them. In any case, it would be better than the absurd mish-mash of a climax that completely destroys the value of this movie.
2.0~Confusing and Adsurd spsl1993 Sign in Permalink I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my life. A great twist in a movie is one like "the Usual Suspects", where there were clues to the deception. In this film, the twists were just thrown out in mid air. Also, the entire "love story" angle was useless. Finally, having 3 or 4 or 5 endings was ridiculous. Sorry, one more thing, so who was the good guys, who are we rooting for? I wanted to love this movie so bad. But I wound up hating it. Sorry. One example of a useless scene. Jack Nicholson is in a porn movie theater and finds Matt Damon. Now, Matt Damon has essentially lived his life to protect and serve "mobster" Nicholson. What does Nicholson do? Threaten to take away his girlfriend. How I will never know? Then advise him he is not doing enough for him. HUH??????? Damon was so loyal to Nicholson you would have thought he was his father. Just another example of a scene where the writer and director tried too hard and simply failed.
9.0~Without a Doubt, The Movie of the Year in 2006 gavin6942 Sign in Permalink I saw The Departed last night, and already expecting a great movie I got even more: the BEST movie. I officially declare this the best movie of 2006, without a doubt. Jack Nicholson plays an Irish mafia boss, who is hunted by a rat in his mob. He also has a gang member who is a rat in the police department. The two rats do not know about each others' double identities. With Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and more... What is great is not just the great double embedded story, but the way the two chase each other without knowing who to target. And the acting is phenomenal. Jack Nicholson returns as a villain and is the most evil and ruthless he's ever been (compare to "Batman" or "The Shining"). DiCaprio is intense, and delivers some of the best fight scenes captured on film. You will believe assault can be an art form. Matt Damon is in top form. Wahlberg is the most Irish you'll ever see him. And Martin Sheen is the father figure he obviously wasn't in real life. I want to pay special attention to the music. Twice, they use the Dropkick Murphys' cover of Woody Guthrie's "I'm Shipping Off to Boston". Once when Leo goes to jail and again later when the mafia marches into battle. This tune is loud, intense and violent... pure perfection. Scorsese could have just used incidental music, but he knows when to get a modern rock song and this was one of those times. Go see this movie and love every minute of it, just like I did.
8.0~Another Gory, Raw Scorcese Picture Kate_Pafford Sign in Permalink I'm not a fan of Martin Scorcese, and I'm not really a fan of Gangster movies, but my husband really wanted to watch it. The acting was great, the story was good, I've seen the Chinese movie this was derived from which I also enjoyed. The plot is like molasses, you get sucked in by the situation. Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson have great chemistry and I would like to see them do another movie on a lighter subject. There was so many twists and turns that you can't help but get interested. All in all a good film, the end leaves you shocked and a little confused, but all in all a very good film, and the nominations were absolutely deserved. If your not into gangster movies but enjoy any of the main actors, you might want to check it out because the cast is first rate!
8.0~Boom mic and BAD photoshop work compositsketch Sign in Permalink Okay, great movie. Scorcese never lets you down, nor will this cast, and I almost had an anxiety attack I was so caught up in it. BUT.... Two weird, lazy technical errors: 1. In the first scene at the State Police Boardroom: The scene opens with a wide shot of the busy room, and i swear to you, I SAW THE FRIGGIN' BOOM MICROPHONE. There it was hanging down from above the center of the frame. 2. Check out some of the photoshop work in this film. Whenever they show that picture of the female lead/psychiatrist as a kid, it looks like CRAP! *Of course, there are also many continuity flaws...but a lot of people have mentioned that. Still a great film.
1.0~Come on! Where is the logic of it all? (Spoiler warning) jeanbal Sign in Permalink I love Scorcese, but, eh, this is the guy who also shot Gangs of New York of ridiculous fame. And this... piece of work is worst. Don't get me wrong, I liked a lot the first half hour of the movie. Even Nicholson is "good" and doesn't overplay his part in the beginning. Quite a miracle in itself for this decade! But then... where goes the plot? By the ending you get some unlikely situations that should have been "preserved" for the Da Vinci Code Crap: "So, he is the traitor? Well, I'm not going to tell anyone, I will send him a CD with a recording I don't have yet and I will bring him on the top of a building to... huh... to use the lift with to get to floor level and I... huh... will call my old academy friend... huh... to... huh... ask him to come so the 3 of us can use the lift! Yeah! Good idea! And we will shoot everybody, and I won't tell the police, and I won't tell the only officer who knows who I really am. Genius!" NONSENSE! The last 45 minutes are full of pretentious unbelievable "so called smart ideas". Try the original "Infernal Affairs". Even if it's not much glamorous, it definitely has "something". PS: and, BTW, don't you Damon is bland in this film?
9.0~Living a double life is not different either as a cop or a criminal when you are working undercover the-movie-guy Sign in Permalink (Synopsis) The city of South Boston has been taken over by the Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The Massachusetts State Police Department has set up the Special Investigations Unit to collect evidence and put Costello and his men in jail. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just graduated from the state police academy, and has been assigned to infiltrate Costello's gang by the unit chief. Billy joins the mob and begins to earn Costello's trust. Years earlier, Costello was able to get one of his men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), to infiltrate the state police. Colin is assigned to the Special Investigations Unit, the same unit that is trying to take Costello down. The only problem for the police is that Colin keeps Costello informed as to what the police are about to do. Eventually, the police and the mob discover that a mole has infiltrated their ranks. Each man is living a double life where one misstep will mean life or death if he is caught. (My Comment) This was a noteworthy movie with many memorable performances. Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil psychopath will get him an Oscar nomination. Several others probably will also be nominated for this film. The movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of crime. It shows what it takes to work uncover as a cop or as a criminal. Costello said, "does it matter who is holding a gun to your head, it is all the same." Both sides risk their lives every day. It is a long movie, but the time passes very fast. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 2:29, Rated R)(9/10)
9.0~Really Good Film and I Enjoyed It... jediah_1978 Sign in Permalink Most of life i have spent my time hating Leonardo DiCaprio and to be true i avoided all films that this man made, but lately i have seen a couple of films (because my wife likes him) that have rocked this belief. And this is a film that has now totally destroyed this and i'm starting to like the bloke, wouldn't go to the pub with him yet, but i feel i could tolerate him now. Clever film, a little spin on the normal undercover cop story line, and interesting to see that the bad people also have undercover people - and quite fun to see Matt being the bad guy (he is quite a scary bad guy). Mark during the film did not have many lines to learn as every other word out of his mouth was F**k so things were good for him, don't think he need to swear so much and in the end it just became funny to listen to him and i had no idea what he just said. Bits of the ending i did not see and was a little surprised by the scene in the lift and a little sad (in the past i would have been happy to see the guy get shot in the head). Good film, strong story line, well worth a go.
7.0~Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers dbborroughs Sign in Permalink Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden. The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole. The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes. Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical "Jackisms". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination. I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them. My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie. Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it. 7 out of 10.
8.0~Quite complicated but is a good one after all louis_luu Sign in Permalink This is the second time I watch this film and It again amazes me from start to the end. Billy and Colin Sullivan, the two main actors, ends up with both dead but they do really play a run and catch very well. Billy in role of an silent hero who has to give up the pride and honor of a police man to live as a life of crime. On the other hand, Colin shows his intellectual impasse when he realizes that the longer he wears this mask, the deeper he sinks his life in a swamp. There are several scenes I don't understand at all, for example the appearance of another police rat or what happens next with Madolyn, what is she gonna do with the envelop given by Billy. However, it is a good remake of Martin Scorsese. One minor thing, the end of this film is what I don't like most when the director let Dignam, a cop, kill Colin in a criminal but realistic way. It'd be better if Dignam would be the one who catches Colin finally and give the job back to law and justice. I think Colin did have an easy death.
3.0~Fine acting, but over-the-top with violence and vulgarity donboy Sign in Permalink Went to the movie mostly due to the attraction of so many big-name stars and a name director. Maybe it's my own fault for not knowing what a "true" Martin Scorcese film is like, but I sat through the film constantly asking myself (and my companions) why a pretty good story had to be laced with excessive foul language and enough violence and blood to fill at least 4 movies. These actors don't need this level of vulgarity to make a point. Properly used, civilized words can convey emotions and story lines far better than the 4-letter words this movie throws at you in virtually every scene. In our theater, most everyone had that look of "was all that really necessary" as we filed out. Too bad - it could have been so much better.
4.0~Totally copied from 'Infernal Affairs' vol. 1 (a HK Movie) xunxia Sign in Permalink Totally copied from 'Infernal Affairs' vol. 1 (a HK Movie) watch 'Infernal Affairs' vol.1 first!! much better than 'The departed' anyone here knows Andy Lau?? i give 4!

9.0~Better than Goodfellas? DrNo7025 Sign in Permalink Dare I? Dare I say it? This movie is better than Goodfellas. There, I said it. I saw this latest Scorsese film at an advance screening. Needless to say I was expecting a lot  more than I thought this director (of classics like Taxi Driver but lately of Gangs of New York) would deliver. I was very wrong. Though the exact plot is unimportant, The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy, and cop from robber, in present-day Boston. With a packed cast (which I need not mention) that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, the acting in the departed is stellar. Living-legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello. Nicholson's nuanced acting was so on-point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo. The Departed is nothing short of spectacular. Funnier that most comedies, Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement. Bravo, Mr. Scorsese; you have outdone yourself.
3.0~Should be called "The Retarded" Geeky Randy Sign in Permalink American remake of the successful "Internal Affairs" trilogy, about two men seeking out each other's identity; one is a cop that goes undercover as a mobster, the other, a mobster that goes undercover as a cop. Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their roles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask the crime-thriller clichés; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just really nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack Nicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but rather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of Irish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous good-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination. It was the only nomination that was well-deserve, the only nomination that didn't win and the only nomination that should have won. Won Best Picture, Editing and Adapted Screenplay. It should be called "The Retarded". *½ (out of four)
7.0~I saw this the first day it came out... 4 yrs ago in HK yunushasan Sign in Permalink I understand that Media Asia is probably really happy from the money for the copyright... but Scorsese i think actually copied Andy lau's directing style too much. For such a "good" director... why copy Andy Lau? Scorsese gets too much credit and was probably brought in just to attract actors and viewers. Watch Infernal Affairs first... then Departed.. you make the decision... this is not a special effects movie so the quality in movie is just as good if not better. Overall for those who have not seen the original, this movie is excellent... maybe if you do not watch the original you can save yourself the stress of comparing it to the original... much like movies that are based on books. But I am from Hong Kong... so I am partial.
4.0~Not as good as internal affairs b116480 Sign in Permalink I saw The Departed after everyone raved about how good it was. Frankly, I was disappointed. It's too Hollywood (over the top) and being from Boston the accents were HORRIBLE. Completely overacted. I felt compelled to write this review after I rented Internal Affairs. I'd like to start off first by saying that I had no idea what Internal Affairs was about. After about 30 minutes and seeing all the similarities, it was easy to see that The Departed is a poorly done remake of Internal Affairs. Sure it's not as sexy as the Hollywood version but the acting is so much better to the point that I was rooting for the undercover cop whereas when I watched the Departed, I was rooting for the mole. The Departed isn't a BAD movie, however watch Internal Affairs and once you get over the Hong Kong camera shooting style and cheesy romantic music, you'll see what real acting and a plot that makes sense is all about (The Departed was a little unclear at the end). Lastly, the ending of Internal Affairs is so much better.
10.0~Scorsese at the Top of His Game nycritic Sign in Permalink He's one of the few directors who have at least one movie within the top of the critics' lists during the Seventies, Eighties, Nineties, and now this decade. That's consistency in the quality of work, especially in an industry where directors come and go with one big hit, where they suddenly have slumps -- some lasting years and years --, and others make sporadic movies here and there. Martin Scorsese is also one of the few directors to tackle a theme that by now would have run its course: the Mafia movie because there can be only so much you can do with this type of film; however, Scorsese proves that there's still a lot of material that can be molded into compelling, edge-of-your-seat tales like the one he weaves here. Certainly not a "B" picture as he called it, yet it has all the elements of a B-picture: the seedy criminals, the sordid locations, the femme fatale, the overall feeling of despair and doom. It certainly is high noir, especially in the fact that all of the characters, to a degree, are under the shadow of this ultimate evil man, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and pretty much there is no escape, especially when Costello's deep ties that corrupt law enforcement come to light. The world of the men in THE DEPARTED is one where everyone is suspect and everyone is at danger of being "next". Even golden-boy Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a pawn of Costello since he was a child, can't escape this fact. Moving upwards, propelled by his good looks and extreme good luck, he's the ultimate patsy who is set from the get-go even as he tries darned hard to elude all evidence that links him to Costello and invisible man William Costigan (a hardened-looking Leonardo DiCaprio). Scorsese moves throughout his multiple plots with quite a bit of tentative yet explosive meandering. There is a lot going on through the initial portion of THE DEPARTED -- the first 15 minutes, approximately -- I became somewhat baffled he is setting up the intricate tableau which details those who are on the side of Good (represented by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and those who are on the side of Evil (Nicholson). Minor characters pop up here and there and at first there is no real reason as to why they are even there, but that becomes rather clear later on in crucial moments. It's fantastic, wickedly suspenseful, compelling storytelling that draws you in from its opening scenes, and its style indicates that somewhere within the folds of narrative, Sullivan and Costigan, opposites in every sense of the word (Sullivan has led a life of privilege under the aegis of Costello and is now the poster boy of success, rising fast within the police department; Costigan comes from a broken family and is trying to make amends with himself even when he will never become an official law enforcement entity -- he is "no man") will have to meet. The crux between them lies in Vera Farmiga who plays the woman caught. She is Costigan's therapist, but is also Sullivan's girl, and her character is tricky, since it balances being the girl who suspects something is wrong with her boyfriend and the professional who feels anger, then pity, and finally desire for her patient. Stylish, darkly funny (much of the humor coming from Nicholson's deadpan performance), extremely masculine (and what a cast of actors!) with an outstanding soundtrack (can anyone select songs like Scorsese for their movies?), THE DEPARTED is deservedly a winner, a masterpiece. It's exquisite to slowly chew on and then wash down with the most expensive wine.
7.0~Good, but Scorsese's least personal film ALauff Sign in Permalink In this, Martin Scorsese's least personal film to date, the director's typically freighted acts of ritualized violence are pared down to a simple, brutal efficiency. Gone is Travis Bickle's spiritually cathartic massacre of a compound full of pimps and dopers or Jake La Motta's masochistic bloody atonement versus Sugar Ray Robinson. The one-shot kills depicted here, shocking in their suddenness, are accompanied by the same splatter of brain fragment across pristine surface time and again. In their depersonalized sameness, these acts achieve something of a perfect uniformity to the dehumanized world in which they occur, where life is cheap and identity cheaper, each man an interchangeable cog in a bottomless existential chain game of cops and robbers. Yet this dedication to meaningless chaos saps the scenario of some of its complexity, particularly noticeable in Scorsese's relative lack of attention to moral and spiritual consequence, the rich exploration of which have solidified his legacy as a serious artist. So, what is at stake? Unlike in his best work, the answer is found in dismissed and belittled subjects. The disdainful treatment of the clergy provides a window into his methods, as he gives neither counterpoint nor context to an early scene in which two priests are accosted and verbally humiliated by a gang lord played by Jack Nicholson. The scene is treated as a blackly humorous anecdote, but the degrading treatment found here and elsewhere in the film, of a profession to which he's mostly shown unique respect throughout his oeuvre (the fact that he nearly became a priest cannot be ignored), suggests that he's in accord with Costello's coarse assessment. This denial of complexity turns up frequentlyincluding an incredibly poor final shot, the selection of which frankly puts his judgment in questionand suggests that what's truly at stake is commercial viability. If Scorsese's presentation borders on the reductive, the film is given ample weight and complexity through several fine performances and its crackerjack premise: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop trying to earn his stripes, moves up a Boston gangster's (Nicholson) food chain as Nicholson's surrogate son and lieutenant (Matt Damon) infiltrates the city police department. Both moles appear at first to be sympathetic, good men. But as Costigan clings tighter to the fragments of his true identity Damon begins to relish the freedom of his adopted one, eventually resorting to irredeemable measures to protect it. The story provocatively suggests that Costigan is a better cop as a criminal and Damon a more effective instrument for evil as a protected agent, a sly insinuation that the methods and conventions of the police and the underworld are not so dissimilar. Scorsese, to his credit, crafts many fine suspense sequences. The film is at its best when Costigan and Damon are pressed to work at cross-purposes on the same task, as in a drug deal between Costello and some Japanese buyers, when the imperiled moles clandestinely use cell phones to send signals to their respective teams. This scene, and two deeply upsetting deaths, fulfills the promise of the scenario, propelling it to near-greatness. The fact that it falls short may be attributable to Scorsese's indulgence of Nicholson's worst impulses, playing a multifaceted character as a dime-store Mephistopheles, thereby softening the story's profound emotional impact and coarsening its tone. As affecting as DiCaprio and Damon are, Nicholson plays it from the outside, relying on tired gamesmanship to undermine the narrative austerity. Just as Nicholson's failure to understand age-appropriateness paints him as an old man trying vainly to be a kid again, Scorsese's comparatively grown-up attempts at striking the right balance between the sacred and the profane are infinitely preferable to this stab at postmodern chic.
10.0~A Quick Review JoshtheGiant Sign in Permalink I was never one of those people who thought that Martin Scorsese had lost his touch. I just thought that as he had grown older his interests had changed, and that was completely fine. No because I believe this would not say that The Departed is Scorsese's comeback. The Departed is his best film since Goodfellas, and is a complete masterpiece. The performances are top notch. If Dicaprio isn't at least nominated I will be extremely mad. Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs, and I hope both get nominations. Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing. The rest of the cast are very good, but don't stand out in the amazing cast. The script is also great. The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well. I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score. Those Irish strings and bagpipes pipe at exactly the right time. The Departed is Scorsese's best in years, and truthfully one of his best ever.
1.0~STUPID "We are anti-Hollywood" Pictures jenloe-1 Sign in Permalink I have never commented on a movie before, but after finishing this film I am as upset as I have ever been about a movie (well maybe since The Break Up). The film had great acting that kept me on the edge of my seat. However, without giving away the ending, it left me very unsatisfied. The film just wanted to be "different" by being like every other piece of crap Hollywood has put out lately. The new formula seems to be fill it with the f bomb, throw in a lot of sex, filthy talk, and then throw in an unbelievably twisted unhappy ending. The following may spoil the ending somewhat: You know why happy ends worked for so long? The viewer felt satisfaction. The end of this movie will just leave you upset and wanting some sort of resolution. STUPID FILM Do not waste your time, go out and rent a classic, since Hollywood can no longer seem to produce something worth watching.
9.0~Scorsese Does It Again!!! rileymullins Sign in Permalink Certainly Martin Scorsese is in the Top 5 film Director's of all time! His ability to put out movie after movie with astonishing screenplays and unforgettable characters is unlike any other. The Departed is an amazing film, from its acting, to its script, to its portrayal of the Boston police and the Irish mafia, and to its shocking finale. ACTING: The acting in the film is superb. At first it's awkward with everyone having Irish accents and such but you learn to love it. Like all of Scorsese's pictures, The Departed is extremely well cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor indeed and may very well merit another Oscar nomination for his roll as an undercover in the Irish Mob, but nothing is certain with the Oscars. Mel Gibson wasn't even nominated for playing William Wallace in Braveheart, even though Nicolas Cage was more than deserving of his well earned Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas. Anyways back to The Departed. Matt Damon also delivers a strong role and possibly the best performance of his career. Is it just me or does Scorsese bring out the best in people? Everyone is already quite aware of Jack Nicholson's quality as an actor so I'll only say one thing. The personality he gives in his role as a criminal is surreal. There are still 3 actors who must be noted for making The Departed all that it is. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, and Alec Baldwin. Each of them giving unforgettable performances. They really stand out in the film and provide some humorous comments as well. STORY: From writer William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven and soon to be Jurassic Park IV) comes an engaging, thrilling, and powerful story about corruption within the Boston Police and its ties with the Irish Mafia. Two moles, one within the police force tipping off the mafia, and one with the mafia tipping off the police force play a frustrating game of cat and mouse to discover each other's identities. That's the basic story line. Throw in a little drama, some very entertaining dialogue, a couple gun fights, and a few well placed twists and turns and you've just seen The Departed. Do all of Scorsese's movies have great screenplays or is it just me? OVERALL: The Departed is a must see and will hopefully win at least a few Oscars this upcoming year. With a runtime of about 2 and 1/2 hours it keeps you engaged the entire time. It's basically rated R for language, a little sexuality, and some traditional Scorsese violence. Great acting, cinematography, screenplay, musical score pieced together nicely, and direction make The Departed an astonishing film.
1.0~Infernal Affairs is better mz_chelz Sign in Permalink I thought the original movie of it "The Infernal Affairs" was more entertaining than "The Departed". The Infernal Affairs had more actions and more emotional than The Departed. It was total copy cat of the Infernal Affairs. When Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to beat Matt Damon on the top of the building was lame. With the Infernal Affairs was awesome. Tony Leung(Leonardo) pointed his gun at Andy(Matt) and said, "Sorry, I'm a police officer." Later Andy killed Tony in the elevator that was great action. Unlike The Departed was really retarded. For the Infernal Affairs it's a 10/10! There is one thing that was good about The Departed was that there was Leonardo DiCaprio. He acted extremely well. Matt Damon doesn't know how to act. They should of had Brad Pitt instead. The performance would be more outstanding. They got lots of cheap actors for The Departed. For the Infernal Affairs, they got a lot of expensive actors. GO INFERNAL AFFAIRS!!!
1.0~Am I the only one?! ian-usher Sign in Permalink Sorry, thought this was very bad. Terrible story, have not seen Infernal Affairs but State of Grace and even the pilot of The Shield were far superior and credible. Wahlberg too weak for the role, his scenes with Baldwin and Damon were comical. Alec Baldwin, enough said... Nicholson overacting wildly the rat impression made me cringe. DiCaprio's performance was going OK until the line "I can't believe you are so vulnerable right now" - Vulnerability! couldn't see that emotion anywhere but it seemed I was supposed to, which made me question the whole performance. Matt Damon was actually quite good. Direction - the film looked good, sounded good but all to no avail when tied to such a poor story. Not trying to pick a fight just my opinion. Nearly every review has been positive surely someone else hated it?
8.0~Disappointed at theater, but after a second watch, changed my mind Ziya90 Sign in Permalink I was pretty disappointed with the movie when had watched it at theater for the first time (had difficulty in following the movie especially, found it too fast paced etc.) it was just a good movie, but months later, I watched it on DVD again and changed my mind almost completely. There is everything that a cop movie could include. Of course, this is not the best Scorsese film or my favorite Scorsese film, it is Taxi Driver, but a great movie. And people compare it with the original Asian version (they don't have to do), then they say hard things about this movie. I was disappointed not because of only one reason, but the most problematic thing in the movie was editing, the movie is one of the most exhausting movies ever made, if you ask me. It is like there is no break even to breathe, no break between the events, so a too exhausting experience like he first half of Bourne Ultimatum. The events run, run and run, any kind of method is not used. I don't like the movies has such editing, because you cannot assimilate things. As for the plot, despite this is not an original work, a new version, the story is brainwave, in other words, it is brilliantly written, it adapts 'the idea' almost excellently. I see The Departed as a crime epic, yes it is an epic, not like American Gangster which is pretty good, but usual. The actors. Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors, but the point is that may be because of his persona, may be because of Bourne trilogy, himself (and his character) is one of the factors that make the movie very good. Damon excellently reflects his character's two face. And his unbelievable actions throughout the movie. Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors too, but his acting is not overrated, great performance. In addition, his colorful, but at the same time maniac character, Costello is not likable, but very interesting and colorful. I am proud of Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg. Yes sometimes such things happen, a man comes and exhibits an unexpected and excellent performance. I don't like Mark Wahlberg honestly, but in this movie, he goes beyond himself. He is so funny and so serious also, his character. The battle of words scene between Dignam and Ellerby is the peak of Martin Scorsese movies, you know, in Martin Scorsese movies, characters are ribald and as I know, Casino was a record in terms of strong language. The scene was very funny and a bit shocking and makes a reference to Scorsese movies I believe. The best part of the movie, that deserves being in cinema anthology, starts when everything turns into a mess. Orders, coincidences and bad luck. I don't know why, but to witness the greatness of the movie, just watch this scene. It was one of the reasons that made me changed my mind. I don't know the disappointment reasons of other people, but it should not related to the script, acting or direction (except exhausting story telling), because this is a very well written, acted and directed movie with some bitter twists. The success of it comes from the details mostly and its complexity in the story. The movie has flaws, but not little flaws. For example the love triangle is so far fetched and unrealistic. They encounter at home, then have sex. There is an envelope matter which is weird. However, we can interpret it as silliness of Costigan. By the way, almost all the people around me complain about the ending. I have not any problem with the ending. What is the name of the movie? Plus, no uninteresting or dull character. Now it is time for Di Caprio. He raises his bar too. The situations he is in and his relationship with Costello are very exciting, very engrossing, but sometimes harsh and sad. Scorsese should have won the best director Oscar absolutely by The Taxi Driver first, but this is not a movie which I would complain or bother so that he won it by this.
3.0~just a sloppy remake of a topnotch movie lpa_713 Sign in Permalink I didn't like the movie at all, it's just a sloppy remake from the Chinese movie :Infernal Affairs from 2002.And the all star cast don't change nothing about it,the original is so much more in all aspects.I saw the original like two years ago and was so overwhelmed by the story,and by the way the cast acted.I became an immediate fan of the movie,and now two years later í was confronted with this Hollywood knockoff.And was very disappointed about it Mr Scorsese just took all the Chinese elements out and replaced it for western crap that doesn't make it automatically a good movie only because of the story & the cast.
10.0~Brilliant matt_man_22 Sign in Permalink By far The Departed is the best movie of 2006, this movie has everything you could ask for in a film, it has amazing storytelling, thrilling suspense, it has romance, Alec Baldwin also adds a little comedy to the film. The acting in this movie is truly incredible, Mark Whalberg should definitely get a supporting nomination, as well as Ray Winstone who is way underrated, and a brilliant actor. Scorsese will probably win the Best Director academy award which he most definitely deserves. The only movie I can see beating The Departed for best film is Flags of our Fathers, which should be amazing considering Clint Eastwood directed it, and Apocolypto which looks amazing. I recommend this to everyone 1st MUST SEE of 2006.
7.0~great if you haven't seen Infernal Affairs fraggerrock Sign in Permalink I was a skeptic. I saw Infernal Affairs for the first time a few months ago and thought it was an excellent movie. One of the best Asian flicks i've seen (and i've seen a lot of them). I thought "great....another American remake". There was a small glimmer of hope. It's Scorsese after all. I waited....great rotten tomatoes rating. Great IMDb rating. Was this the comeback of American cinema? I was excited. It was what a wanted. A great story, great actors (well...more on that later), and a great great director who understood the genre. Well...apparently, my guess is everyone that raved about this movie hasn't seen Infernal Affairs. This film, in no way, lives up to the original. I think, if you haven't seen the original, you would probably think this is the greatest film ever. The story is that clever, and Scorsese is that good. Unfortunately, it ALMOST all ways (not all...almost all) the Chinese movie betters this one. You would have thought Scorsese learned after Gangs of New York that Leo does not make a good tough guy. Guess not. I hope Leo plays to his strengths and take roles more similar to Catch Me if You Can or the Aviator. Martin Sheen's character is no where near as prominent as the Chinese flick. and in the end, as great as Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio are, they do not have the "coolness" factor that Andy Lau and Tony Leung brought. There were some correction of plot holes that were re-written to make more sense, but in general the plot changes were no good. Some scenes were done different to the original, but some scenes were done shot by shot. Unfortunately, even these copies scenes didn't deliver as powerfully as Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs had such a great "coolness" factor to it. And the chase/action scenes were executed in a way that built up WAY more suspense than The Departed. All that said, still a decent movie. But seriously.....if you've seen Infernal Affairs, don't expect this to live up to the hype it's been getting. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, I'll leave you with two options. 1) You are OK with watching non-Hollywood films and don't mind reading subtitles. By all means grab the Infernal Affairs DVD and watch this! 2) You hate reading subtitles and dislike non-Hollywood films. Watch The Departed and enjoy it. It is good.....but i fear only because the original story was good.
1.0~Sorry to see that Hollywood is out of ideas thesharkdude Sign in Permalink Having watched both "Internal Affairs" and "The Departed" I am thoroughly disappointed by the latter. I had no idea the two films had anything to do with each other, and the disappointment and boredom grew as scene after scene seemed like an American copy of a Chinese quality product (how is that for a change). More shocking is the overwhelmingly ecstatic reception of the Hollywood blockbuster, which, in my view, is fueled by a range of big names in acting, producing, and of course directing. It goes to show that creative talent has become rare in Hollywood, remakes hit the screen in an increasingly shortening interval, and good advertising and promoting count more than fresh ideas, or truly artistic values. Did I say there was no creativity in this movie? Well, I take that back. Hollywood being Hollywood, the genuinely dark ending of the Hong Kong masterpiece was obviously too bold for an audience that is more interested in watching the good prevail. Or at least leaving the theater safe in the knowledge that the bad won't walk free. Consequently, the ending is the only creative adaption to make the movie a little more digestible to ensure good reviews, and, more importantly, secure cash flow. "The Departed" would have been a good film. The pure fact that "Internal Affairs" exists, however, makes it feel like its only intention is to make money from a larger audience the Hong Kong original can appeal to.
10.0~Superb direction,awesome story...worth watchin again and again... arsalanzahid-1 Sign in Permalink I watched this highly anticipated movie last night on DVD...dint know what to expect because of 4 of the top people in movie....after watching this movie one gets the feeling why every movie has to end...so it ended but believe me...this movie gave me the best 150 mins of 2006....really gripping from start till the end and in the MIDDLE you just cant believe that this is really happening....leonardo di caprio has a change look in this character and will be much appreciated from his other roles...same goes for matt damon and mark wahlberg....and not to forget the great Jack nicholson....how he blends in with every one else and easily tell you how he is the best....i think this movie will be the best movie of 2006 winning at least 4-5 Oscars....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.....PEACE....
4.0~i don't think this is a great movie. as said by many. vijay_417 Sign in Permalink The movie is rushed and parts unexplained in the end, which leaves my experience unsatisfied. So the movie makes a dud for me. i don't understand how so many praises can be made for this movie , When it is a copy of a wholesome movie with scenes and dialogs copied to no avail. i would say that people have not understood or they normally don't enjoy the whole movie and they just like parts of it. or maybe people have just seen the movie because of the love for Martin Scorsese, who has been a great name in the film making world and delivered some of the most moving and realistic movies made up to date. But this was not what i was expecting from him. Loyalty has been a bias in many of the reviews of this rushed and inconclusive movie.
1.0~Crappiest movie of the Year. moviedouche1995 Sign in Permalink yet another boring gangster film from the incredibly overrated Martin Scorsese. Basically a rehashed film of infernal affairs, which also wasn't very good Even the star studded cast doesn't save this film hopefully all the stars will be able to recover their careers from this horrible flick. the only thing worse than the direction in this film is the editing. the film is choppier than the Atlantic ocean. if anyone could create a worse film than this, it would be James Cameron. if you want to see a good gangster film go see the Godfather 1-3 or Heat, had Scorsese directed his films like the for mentioned gangster films they would have been better than they are now. 3/10 stars
9.0~The script is strong but the acting is unforgettable leafsrule03 Sign in Permalink I have to admit walking into the theatre to see The Departed today I was extremely hyped. With all the positive feedback surrounding the movie, I was sure I was finally going to see that one great movie you normally get in a year, and it truly was for the most part for about 2 hours and 20 minutes. The acting deserves a 10/10 right across the board, generally all star casts don't work quite so well, but Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio displayed career defining performances (especially Dicaprio), and Alec Baldin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen deliver unforgettably great jobs in supporting roles, while Jack Nicholson gives his best performance in years. The one true critique I have is parts of the movie (especially the ending) come off as unnecessary and comedic, and Im not so sure that was what was meant to happen. The attempt in some places to create dramatic irony, or some shocking sequences and me and the better part of the theatre laughing in parts that we were really not suppose to laugh at. The script is very strong, but the acting is unforgettable, go see it and judge for yourself, as it took me the better part of the night to decide this movie was an 8/10 to me with definite 10/10 possibilities. Acting 10/10 Script 8/10 Overall 9/10
10.0~Best Scorsese Film. Period. fburke69 Sign in Permalink Oh my God. I can say without overstatement that I just saw the most gripping and entertaining American film to come out in at least the past ten years. I was lucky enough to get a pass to an advance screening of The Departed this past weekend in Boston. I wasn't sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all-star cast. From the moment the opening credits came up, the movie grabbed me by the neck, ripped me out of my seat and didn't let go until the final scene. Each performance is more masterful than the next. Damon was a tour de force as the lead, tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role. Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume. His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in, if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However, the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio. Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies, I found myself blown away by him in this. I'm not sure if it was the material he was given, or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor, or a combination of both, but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic. Every character is pitch perfect, every scene is right on the money. The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film. I don't want to give too much away, but I'm still shaken from the ride I was taken on. People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema. This is one of those spectacularly perfect times. Forget Taxi Driver. Forget Raging Bull. Forget Goodfellas. As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime, The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese's Master Work.
9.0~Now this is how a remake should be like. antra_chief Sign in Permalink Now this is how a remake should be like. Not too long ago I went with a friend to see this movie not exactly expecting much of it as it was a remake, and as they say, Hollywood version of an already great smash hit Asian movie tend to suck major ass. However that didn't stop me from going as the director of this piece of movie was no other than Martin Scorcese himself. A master director in my mind. I walked out of that cinema and thought, yep, this was actually better than the original. Infernal Affairs appear more stylised than The Departed. In fact the reason why I liked The Departed more is because of Scorcese's style and cinematography. TD appears more gritty and realistic than in IA. When I watched IA again, I just can't help but think that everything in it was just glamorised. Even the fight scenes, they just didn't shout 'gritty' to me. I'm blaming this on the use of colour and lighting. Most of the time the settings of the locales are in some sterilised environment with tall skyscrapers and buildings. The colours blue and silver seems to be the film's favourite which creates a more modern day feel to it. Scorcese is renowned for his usual dark settings. In TD it was more 50/50 imo but that didn't really bring me down. Some parts of TD where they show the pivotal scenes was actually portrayed more realistically and more believable than in IA. For instance the part where Martin Sheen's character fell from the rooftop seemed more realistic. No music was played to coincide with the scene and that is what makes it more believable, although I do have to say the presentation and portrayal of that particular scene in IA was tapping more on the emotional side with its use of a melodic song to go with that scene. In IA the film actually wants to go somewhere, as in it actually wants to move on to the next scene. Whereas in TD it primarily focuses on the development of the two moles. You could say that TD incorporates both IA1 and 2 into the frame. Some viewers may find that the development of these two characters tend to drag on a bit but I personally think that this sets a good ending with their minds being psychologically motivated in capturing and exposing one another. Like I said before, TD is more realistic so presentation wise, it wasn't 'perfectly' set out and co-ordinated in a fixed linear pattern compared to IA. But this is what I like about TD and Scorcese's style and cinematography. The fact that everything is hectic and fast paced shows how chaotic the world around them is and this is what he is exactly trying to convey to us. In IA it just seems like a more perfect world tbh. Everything seems so orderly and 'peaceful' in a way (even though its not). The music in TD also conveys to us how chaotic and gritty the world is. In some scenes we hear a piece of Irish song played and then it immediately cuts off afterwards. Again this shows how the world and the characters in this film isn't set out on a pre-destined path. The film wants to show us how life is unpredictable, it wants us to feel that there is an ulterior motive or a different agenda to any of the scenes. And this unable us to think what is going to happen next. However since I've seen the original version, I already knew whats going to happen but it is that what distinguishes itself from the original. I was surprised that it was an all star cast. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo Di Caprio, Jack Nicholson and Ray Winston. I just thought, woah, I really do hope that this movie will turn out to be a great movie. I didn't want them to pull a Troy on this one. And I wasn't let down. The cast were amazing. Great actors in the frame especially Ray Winston's character. But my initial thoughts on Jack Nicholson playing a mobster leader was a little sceptical. I always see him as a deranged serial killer or eccentric/madman. And thats what actually put me off in this film. I'm guessing its the smile on his face and his frizzy hair cut. It just shouted 'MADMAN' at me. Most of the time you usually get mobsters being displayed as a calm, cool headed, confident and authoritative fella. Here you seen him as your quite chubby womanising smooth talking uncle, if you have an uncle like that that is. He didn't really have that authoritative figure but hey, neither does IA's mob leader. It's more about the actions that they did, the dialogue they used which makes them appear sort of like a mob leader. But overall the whole movie was great. Watch the original if you get the chance and you can make comparisons for yourself. You may like the original more than this as some members on this board have already stated.
4.0~Under-written and under-whelming Gerald-8 Sign in Permalink This is one of those films out of the angst-school. Everyone runs around screaming obscenities at one another and there's lots of shooting and blood and it goes on much longer than it needs to. There's the core of a very good story here, with the double agent, double agent scenario. There could be a good, tight exploration here with the character structure and the woman linking them. But for me, there was nothing to explain why the woman was so attracted to either man which the plot kind of hinged on. And none of the characters were particularly well defined. The acting's okay, but Jack Nicholson can do roles like this in his sleep, it just calls for him to look charismatic and dangerous. It reminded me of the sort of plot you see on the BBC's 'Life on Mars'. Except that would have packed it with genuine intrigue and emotion into one hour. And with class. Class is ultimately what 'The Departed' lacked. (Classy film-making, not denied, but in terms of how the characters and story was portrayed). And if American cops really go around screaming obscenities and being so racist, sexist and homophobic all the time... well, that's not a very good advertisement for the Police Force is it?
1.0~Tale of two movies ichiga-1 Sign in Permalink The first half of this movie was fresh, interesting and absorbing, i was seriously in and enjoying it. But from the big shootout scene onwards it just lost the plot and it seemed like the writers, director and actors just wanted to go on to their next million dollar project and leave us to suffer. And suffer i did because the holes and unexplained sections of this trash just made the previous hour or two wasted. No need for the secret envelope, what was the Shrink doing at the funeral or even in the movie at all, and her involvement with DiCaprio's character was beyond belief, why did Sullivan put a tail on Queenan, why didn't the cops act when the gangsters turned up at the building??? The most insulting aspect of this movie is that it is a remake of a successful Honk Kong movie - so classic case of Hollywood ruining a good idea. Why do they have to keep doing it? Because people go to blockbuster opening weekends and make these guys a fortune. But why give Scorsese any awards for this tripe! That part I don't get.
4.0~Irish copy (dad) leplatypus Sign in Permalink This movie is similar to Pacino's movie Donnie Brasco but for one time we leave the NYC and Italian underworld for the Irish and Boston! Thus having Damon playing in it is interesting as he deepens his local ties from Will Hunting and in a way, his meeting with DiCaprio is the new generation confrontation of Pacino / De Niro. However, the pleasure doesn't go farther as this movie is just totally unbelievable: the new thug becomes close to the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the police rat, the policeman grows up with the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the criminal rat. With that, the movie just take fun to tell the most bad words and to show the most blood... All the characters are pathetic, badly played by the ordinary big names who does their same show over and over (Baldwin, Wahlberg, Nicholson who has absolutely no charisma as the boss!). The scenes with the shrink are totally useless and just add minutes to get a long movie! Sure many would praise it as it's a Scorcese but frankly, i won't watch it again while DB is much more engaging!
8.0~Excellent Rip-Off Webstuhl Sign in Permalink It is a wonderful movie, I really enjoyed watching, but it kind of makes me mad that it won 4 Oscars only because Scorsese "americanised" the story of infernal affairs. Of course Scorsese changed a lot. There's is some improvement. For Example : In Infernal Affairs every time somebody gets shot they play music, so the scene gets more "emotional". But I loved those silent killings at the end of TD. Then character development is a bit different. TD concentrates on relationship, whereas Infernal Affairs concentrates on the two mules and the way they become part of their environment. I think that this aspect is portrayed better in Infernal Affairs. The rooftop scene - In Infernal Affairs the rooftop scene is much cooler, much more intelligent. On the other hand, it is good that Scorsese changed it, because it wouldn't fit to the concept of the movie.
1.0~How the hell the AMPAS could possibly waste the 4 most important Oscars to this piece of crap ice_princess2610 Sign in Permalink No offense but it is so obvious that TD is far worse than IA: from the plot, the directing to camera and story-telling. The original lasts for less than 2h and it blows audiences' mind with intense and unexpected twists. This one has more than 2h and a half and the best it can do is re-telling the original'story without any improvements but even worse. I fell asleep after half of the film. The characters are very poor- developed. Leo's and Matt's character get the top-rank position in about 4 months?! I mean come on, are you kidding me? We're not kids to be fooled like that. In IA, Yan and Ming in IA took almost 10 years to earn their credibility in the workplace. Yan had to work undercover for many bosses and live the life of a true criminal: assaulting, drugging and killing. Not just hanging around and beating up some guys like Leo did. And since when a just graduated-fish like Matt's guy can become an inspector in matter of months. My goodness! Also, why was that stupid screen writer so fond of swearing? He made all character say bad words in every line of the script. This makes the movie sound cheap and low. Next time, if you want to look cool and play smart, stay out of dirty words please! You guys made Mark's character like a psycho when swearing every 5s and screaming like an idiot. Well, I guess that Academy Award Best Supporting Actor was to reward his ability to swear consistently in this stupid film. Shame on the AMPAS! I give 1/10 to Mr Scorsese for stealing the idea of another film and claiming that he were only inspired by it. Yeah, congratulations! He had earned Oscar for that.
4.0~That's It Hollywood, Just Keep Slaughtering Those Foreign Flicks ebossert Sign in Permalink Disclaimer: V for Vendetta should have won best picture of the year. One would think that I would just give up on Hollywood films. However, there is an occasional surprise. When it comes down to it, though, I must mirror the sentiment of my good friend Fletch: "I want to see the filth!" Okay, so how do you win an Academy award for best picture of the year? Well, you could make a movie about a mentally deficient idiot who takes a pivotal role in every major historical event for the past 40 years, have an overrated hack play the lead, and insert some repulsive underlying philosophy (i.e., submit to authority, or else!)  but that was already done in 1994. Things change, so 2006 requires a different strategy: (1) Take a fantastic screenplay from a Hong Kong film. (2) Add $83 million dollars to your budget. (3) Insert the word "f * c k" randomly 214 times into the script. (4) Eliminate all of the character/plot complexities to pander to the simple-mindedness of American audiences. (5) Completely purge any intelligent or subtle elements. (6) Add 40 minutes of dead weight. What do you get? You get the year's most pretentious feat of idiocy  The Departed. The biggest disappointment with this film is the dialogue and character interaction, which are vitally important in the creation of an effective drama. Scorsese implemented his patented "4-Letter-Word Guide to Juvenile Screenplays." Interestingly enough, I gathered the distinct impression that the insertion of these classless quotes was for no real purpose. This is evident in scenes where a particular character will make statements that seem to come from absolutely nowhere, as they have absolutely nothing to do with the scene up to that point. For example, Baldwin is preparing his police squad for a sting operation, only to then randomly tell Damon the following while talking really, really fast: "You want to have a smoke? You don't smoke, do you? What, are you one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go f * c k yourself." How the hell did Baldwin make the jump from police work to this? It makes no logical sense. Must be Scorsese's trademark film-making style. Clever man. The astuteness of these observations is mind-blowing. I wonder if it took longer than 5 seconds to adapt the original Hong Kong screenplay, or if they just used the "Replace" function in Microsoft Word to insert the word "f * c k" 214 times into the script. And yes, it was literally 214 times  I counted out of curiosity sake. I'm sure a middle school student could have done as much. As could be predicted by a Hollywood production, the storyline was rather dim-witted: (1) What's with the blatantly obvious tipoffs between Damon and Nicholson via cell phone. Don't the cops think it somewhat weird that Damon calls his "mother" or "father" to tell them his "friends are coming" immediately before a huge undercover operation? What the hell!? (2) The sting operation was devoid of any intelligence or cleverness on the part of the filmmakers. Nicholson gets away because  get this  the cops were too stupid to put cameras near the rear of the warehouse, even though they put them everywhere else. Wow. I can't think of a less scintillating "cat and mouse" game than that. (3) The scene between Martin Sheen and Nicholson is so fake. It's as if the filmmakers were faced with the fact that 70 minutes had passed without any tension between the protagonist and antagonist, and were thus forced to earn that tension with a 30-second superficial conversation replete with vulgarity. Bravissimo fellas. Too bad plot development takes much more effort than that. So the ending finally comes. In perhaps the most elementary use of symbolism since Forrest Gump's "feather" scene, Scorsese shows a rat teetering on the edge of a railing! How long did it take to think of that one? Oh yeah, and the soundtrack was horrible too. Don't even think of pawning this film off as an original idea. Half a dozen scenes were ripped directly from Infernal Affairs, only executed ineptly. All of the great suspense sequences were already written for Scorsese. All he did was obliterate a well-written and intelligent script by inserting a series of incompetent scenes with lots of explicit violence, sex talk, and 40 minutes of dead weight in the form of pointless, boring moments. Nice job, Marty. The Departed is totally mediocre as a stand-alone film, but it is helpful to beat a dead horse by quickly comparing it to the superior Hong Kong original. The original introduced one of the most interesting, complex characters I can remember. The mole within the police department is not a straight-up antagonist, as Damon was  but instead operated in a gray zone that provided some stunning scenarios and plot developments that transcend any crime thriller ever made. It created a truly unique character for the film to revolve around. The original was much more intelligent. There were scenes that required the viewer to think about what was going on. For example, the sting operation  a highlight of the film  was lengthy and subtle in it's portrayal of the moles and their communications with their bosses. Frankly, it rocked! Also, the relationships between the moles and their bosses were compelling and realistic, not over-dramatic. The Departed was made for people with an IQ of less than 50. Think of it this way, if you thought any scene in The Departed was halfway decent, it was done more intelligently and entertainingly in Infernal Affairs. So go to your local Blockbuster and rent the true classic that "inspired" a juvenile, pretentious knockoff.
9.0~The seamy side of the Megalopolis of the northeast USA Guam_Critic Sign in Permalink I rented this DVD in March 2007 after in won 2007 Oscars awards in Film Editing, Writing, Directing, and Best Picture. I watched it twice, with numerous "Replay" and "Slow" the second time. Yes, I recommend renting the DVD of "The Departed". To me it shows a realistic portrayal of the seamy side of the Megalopolis of the northeast USA. My father was raised in working-class Boston, and his description of the collaboration between corrupt police and organized crime matches what is shown in this film. Unlike the majority of American films, this is realistic. It shows how life in the traditional cities near Boston interacts with small-time criminals. In many parts of the USA, like new suburbs of the Sunbelt, mafioso tactics like shown in this film do not reach down to working class citizens. As shown by the Oscar awards bestowed by the entertainment industry, this film is an extraordinary achievement in the cinematic arts. My own time spent living in working-class neighborhoods of the old parts of NYC and Chicago shows this film has taking a boring scenario and spiced it up by showing the seamy background. This means understanding the complex dynamics of the denizens of countless neighborhood bars that function as restaurants and public meeting spaces. Guys like me are reluctant to enter these "pubs" because of the alleged fights that occur within, as shown in The Departed. It shows the positive side of the patronage for those families who do owe allegiance to local crime bosses.
10.0~Why are "Southie" films always so great? georgeh1981 Sign in Permalink OK, so I have an affinity for Boston, and a strange obsession with "Southie" or, the Irish area in South Boston. I personally have a list of My top ten movies of all time, based, primarily on their "re-watch-ability", their constant creeping into my mind, acting, how witty the dialogue is, and "other". I would be greatly surprised, if, ten years from now, I am not quoting this Scorcese masterpiece. The dialogue is so witty, and the characters so memorable, and the ending....ohhhhh, the ending! Mark Wahlberg, pound for pound, was the best character. However, the greatest line belongs to Mr. Alec Baldwin. In a high stress sequence where the Boston Police are onto the bad guys, Alec Baldwin, says to one of the other cops in rapid fire delivery, "Hey, I'm gonna have a cigarette..you want a cigarette?..what? You don't smoke?..What are you some kind of health nut?..Hey F&*% You!!!" If that doesn't translate well to print...go watch the movie, see for yourself. Damon is fantastic, DiCaprio is excellent, Nicholson is great, and no one in the cast is a liability, even the "love interest", which, I had read in some reviews was lackluster, I thought, was great. So GO watch this Movie, and if you love the dialogue, then go rent...NO BUY, Good Will Hunting, and the Boondock Saints (My other favorite Boston Movies) Oh, and don't forget Goodfellas!
10.0~Oh what a tangled web we weave. baumer Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese might be the only man in Hollywood who really doesn't have a misfire. I really can't think of any films he has done that weren't creative, ambitious, well acted and intriguing. With the exception of maybe Spielberg, there is no one his equal. This is just my opinion of course, but when you can say that you have done Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Aviator and now the Departed, who can really disagree? If it wasn't for the sheer perfection of Goodfellas, I think this would be his best film. The performances, the script and of course the direction are perfection personified. I think this is the best film of the year and this should finally be Scrocese's year to take best director. The Departed has Matt Damon playing Colin Sullivan, a young Irish boy who grows up in a Boston neighbourhood that is "run" by the local Irish mob. One day while eating at the local diner, he meets Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, and like a young Henry Hill in Goodfellas, he begins to do some work for the man. We then skip ahead perhaps 20 years later and now young Colin Sullivan is one of Frank's boys. He enters into police college where his intentions are to get into the police force to keep an eye on things for Frank. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan and he grew up in the mob's shadow. His father ran in those circles and so did his uncle Jackie. Both were respected men and Frank especially has a soft spot for both of them, who have since departed. Billy wants nothing to do with the life so he too enters into police college. Once he graduates, he is pretty much coerced into going under cover to infiltrate the mob. His background and connections are obviously of great value to the Boston police. The two men who recruit Billy are Dignam and Queenan, and they are played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, and again, in my opinion, they both give the best performances of their career. I know Sheen has been around forever, and he was amazing in films like Apocalyse Now, but he is just outstanding here. And then there is Wahlberg who really should win the best supporting actor this year. He is a scene stealer. He has scenes with every actor in the film and he is the best part of any scene he is in. In one scene, another cop , who just messed up an assignment, asks him who the hell he is. Wahlberg responds, "I'm the guy doing his job, you must be the other guy!" He is flawless in the film. The strength of the film is the action no doubt, but the script by William Monahan is multi-layered, labyrinth of a film. It is complex, and rich in character. Every few minutes there is another twist revealed. People that you thought were "good guys" or "bad guys" get painted with a shade of gray. Scorcese has a wide palette to stroke the canvas with and here he is Picasso at work. I truly can't find a flaw in the film and the 151 minutes fly by. The denouement is both shocking by Hollywood standards and because it is, it is also refreshing. I don't know of another film that can end like this one did and still find a way to please it's audience. The Departed is a miracle really. It has one of the best casts of the year, it is directed by a Hollywood legend and it is flawless. If Marty doesn't win this year, then you have to subscribe to the conspiracy theory. Babel is a joke, Iwo Jima is a very good film but this has to be the year of the Marty. This is both similar yet different to any other film that Marty has done. It feels a little like Goodfellas, but at the same time, it carves out it's own niche. I also think this is one of the best casts put together, and it is a treat to watch them work under the master. ***One final note*** It's great to see Marty get his Oscar. A very worthy win for both the film and the director. 10/10
6.0~An inferior remake of Internal Affairs heng-5 Sign in Permalink This movie is a remake of the Hong Kong hit film Internal Affairs. Unfortunately, this remake is a major letdown given the star casts and the director. First, there was lack of emotional development in the Departed. There were just too few emotional developments for Billy to explain his later actions. Then, the Departed introduced a major plot flaw that the undercover police Collin should have another police Dignam who could identify him. So the ending part where Billy telling Collin that no one could identify him was simply wrong. Consequently, the actions taken afterward made no sense. The ending of the Departed was also bad (compared to Internal Affairs) in that no sequels can be made as all main characters are dead. There was no rooms left for imagination. I would recommend watching Internal Affairs instead of watching this movie.
7.0~a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas Buddy-51 Sign in Permalink In Martin Scorcese's "The Departed," Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling "moles" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a "rat" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations. The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick "Infernal Affairs," finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, "The Departed" falls short of the "Goodfellas" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom. On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time. The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success. Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in "The Departed" - a kind of unity and focus that turned "Goodfellas" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in "The Verdict"). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against "Goodfellas." Moreover, even the violence in "The Departed" is handled much less effectively than it was in "Goodfellas." In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in "The Departed," the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film. Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to "Goodfellas," a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product. A good film but not a great one.
3.0~Poor execution ruined this. trancer96 Sign in Permalink I expected a lot from this movie based on its high IMDb rating and big names on both side of the camera but it just didn't work. Most it comes down to lazy execution; average acting, directing and script writing from people you expect better. This movie should have been a tense mole-hunt thriller but there was no attempt to give the viewer any suspense. There were no surprises and no reason to care about the fate of any of the characters. As if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack did nothing to help the atmosphere of the movie and the ending was rather unsatisfying. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend avoiding this movie - just don't expect anything great. Not a patch on the Hong Kong original.
7.0~Scorsese tries, almost succeeds, but fails in my eyes... kane4782 Sign in Permalink I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves. This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking, this should be OK, Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material, really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent, but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction. Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show, to be honest, he didn't really do much for me in the film, just his usual on screen persona (feisty, scary, loud). He fits the bill though, he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However, if you look at the original and compare it to Sam, you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing, because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next. Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters, his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan (Leo Di Caprio) and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however, Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam', I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version, however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story. The two leads were well cast, Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough, and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do, in acting terms, however he manages well with what he had. Having said this, neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau, from the original. The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense, towards the end. Overall, I gave this a 7, because it is a movie in its own right and being that, it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is, for me, the original is far better. The whole concept, suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment, the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot, as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia', but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese (eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope, changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen'). To conclude, if I was to take into account the original, I would have given this a 3.5/10, which may seem harsh, but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed, I would advise you to see the latter first, so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 (at the time of writing) for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide.
5.0~if THE DEPARTED is the movie fo the year then INFERNAL AFFAIRS is the worlds best movie mentalpersonna Sign in Permalink i am a huge fan of 'Infernal Affairs' when i heard that Hollywood were remaking it, i was a bit sceptical about it, then i heard it was being directed by Scorses i was excited. i sat there for the first half hour or so, thinking the original got this part over and done with in about 10 mins. The Departed just didn't have the suspense or the character development of the original. When Sheen died, you just didn't feel anything for him, and the shock factor that the original had was just not there. the character development in the original was great, as you genuinely felt for the characters went hey died, but in the departed it was like so what if you die. The ending of the departed was a bit of a joke, it was just too much, i think Scorses just thought 'i don't want to make a sequel or a prequel to this movie' - (didn't want to make another goodfellas). to those who say Scorses deserves best director or that the departed deserve best movie, must be kidding me. Infernal affairs didn't even get nominated for best foreign language movie. When it is certainly a cut above the Hollywood remake. I'm sure they'll be nominated but to win, i don't think so. however on the plus side, DiCaprio has probably produced his best work since 'Whats eating gilbert grape', and is certainly in with a shout for best actor. the movie alone is a gd movie, but compared to the original its just another unfulfilled remake So if you have only watched the departed, go and rent out/ watch on film four the original and then re-write your review because I'm sure it will be very different.
7.0~Doesn't live up to expectations whcb25 Sign in Permalink After coming out of the cinema yesterday, having watched The Departed I was in the mindset that it was good, not as good as the original Infernal Affairs but almost. However, when I was tossing and turning in my bed last night unable to sleep I had a longer think about it. The more I thought about it, the worse it seemed in comparison to the Hong Kong version. The problem that comes to mind with American remakes of Asian films seems to be that they are unable to leave anything to the imagination. The Departed last over 2 and a half hours which is over an hour longer than the original. Why? Primarily because they obviously didn't have any confidence in the audience to work anything out for themselves. (Understandable if they were thinking that most of the audience would be American i guess). The other reason that it lasted for so much longer, is because they tried to cram bits of all three of the HK Infernal affairs films into one. As well as that they fiddled around with little buts of the plot and characters. My one main criticism being the portrayal of Tony Lau's character by Matt Damon. In the original Infernal affairs you were never certain whether he was good or bad, and there was always the feeling that he may turn good in the end. Matt Damons character always appeared bad which spoiled the atmosphere of the film. I was trying to think if there was anything in The Departed that was better than Infernal Affairs. Its one slight saving grace is Jack Nicolson as the baddie, but hey everyone knows Jack Nicolson can play a bad guy!! And the music was kinda alright, what with Pink Floyd and all ~ but the music from the original was good too ... I'm not trying to say that it wasn't a good film. And I'm sure if I hadn't seen IA first I would have liked it just as it was. But in comparison HK wins hands down in my opinion. One last thing, I hear Scorcese has a reputation for violence, but was there really any need to have that much!
1.0~I thought it was boring... philip-300 Sign in Permalink I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations. I must say I wasn't very impressed. First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello's gang happened way too fast and wasn't very convincing, just like the infiltration of Leo's character in Gangs of New York. Mark Wahlberg's character Dignam felt really fake, the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position, same goes for Baldwin's character capt. Ellerby. The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e. very unlikely). They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster, stealing pocket change from some corner shop. I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can't say weather or not this was worse, but I would really think so. The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one. That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits.
3.0~If you take the original plot away xnebula Sign in Permalink What's left in this film if you take away the original plot developed in Infernal Affairs? Not much, I have to say. Excessive vulgarity only weaken the characters. Take the villain as an example. Comparing to Eric Tsang's portrayal of the mafia boss, Jack Nicholson's character lacked depth, unpredictability and bone chilling factor. Eric Tsang convinced us that the character was capable of coldly plotting such a scheme. Costello played by Nicholson was nothing more than just an ordinary mean Hollywood mob character. It's a joke for anyone who used more than 5% of their brains to think that a loud mouth like Costello could come up with a well thought of plot. Similar arguments can be applied to Matt and Leonardo's characters. They all lacked the intelligence of their original counterparts. All three of them are great actors. I love Matt in the Bourn movies. He's a perfect fit in them. Leonardo's great in Aviator. Jack was great in A Few Good Men and was evil in the Shinning. I have to say regrettably this is totally attributable to Martin Scorsese. Hollywood needs to work more on creativity instead of making remakes and then patting their own backs.
6.0~"Infernal Affairs" outclasses "The Departed" hk1973 Sign in Permalink I have been telling people (in this website and others) that don't compare "The Departed" with "Infernal Affairs", treat it as a new movie to watch. I watched it yesterday, disappointed... and also realized that you can't avoid comparing these 2 films if you have seen both. William Monahan was paid to rewrite the script, so he had to change it to show that he did some work, he did create something new... but ended up that he has removed some of the best scenes, best dialogs, best role from the original. The movie master Martin Scorsese, did the same thing, tried to tell the story in his own style, to prove that he doesn't need to follow others... ended up he over used a lot of blood, bullets and bad language. I bet most of the people who give high rating to this film have not seen "Infernal Affairs". If you are a big fan of Martin Scorsese, I advice you not to watch "Infernal Affairs". I swear, I'm not biased.
10.0~One of Scorsese's very best. advaitkamat Sign in Permalink How can you make a storyline that borderlines the implausible work? Ask Scorsese. The master director is no stranger to tackling preposterous story-lines that end up becoming some miraculous films. Take for example the masterful "After Hours", in which he demonstrated how you can take a ridiculous story and churn it into some kind of a classic with terrific storytelling. Now, with "The Departed", Scorsese concocts one of the very best films of his immaculate career. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a rookie cop, freshly recruited by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) as an informant to help them implicate the Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He is the perfect bait, partly because of his family's prior involvement in organized crime. Billy starts off slow, catching Costello's attention and slowly working his way up the mob and finally gaining his trust. Staff Sgt. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the endearing new officer in the SIU who has everyone's trust, including a psychiatrist Mandolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Also, he's Costello's surrogate son who is his mole in the police unit. At first, a simple act of loyalty on both sides quickly turns into a desperate battle for survival when both the men realize the need to locate the identities of each other while trying to keep their identity concealed. As always, it is a pleasure to watch a film where Scorsese protrudes and dissects a crime story with such glorious skill and fervor. Though I haven't seen "Infernal Affairs", I can safely state that "The Departed" is by no means a flimsy remake, given the uncanny skill with which the story is handled. Take for instance a well-written and superbly etched-out scene where Costello beguiles a young Sullivan by buying him comic books and groceries. It's an honest portrait of how the ingenuous turn into the gullible and Scorsese works wonders by giving it a little piquant twist with the dark humor. It's remarkable how a Hong Kong-based story can be transported to an American setting with such deft precision and William Monahan writes wonderfully, giving the characters enough time and feeling until they become someone you can relate to. The plot unravels with genuine disregard for what happens to everything irrelevant to the story, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker marvelously cuts and trims to keep it rife with violent tension. Peopled by some outstanding actors, the cast is to die for. If a Scorsese film stars the ever-magnificent Nicholson, you don't need another reason why it should warrant a viewing. Nicholson is dazzling as the slightly psychotic Costello and it's pure delight to watch him play a creepy mobster with devilish traits. DiCaprio and Damon likewise are excellent in their respective roles, bringing the urgency and desperation to their characters effortlessly. The rest of the cast is stellar, with Mark Wahlberg turning in a remarkable performance as the foul-mouthed tough cop Dignam, something, admittedly, I had not expected him to pull off. "The Departed" is Scorsese's best film since "Goodfellas" but it's not as good, sadly. But here is a film that respects its genre and it's one that's not all cops-and-guns but instead goes much deeply and illustrates with ruthless candor what circumstances force us to become.
7.0~Overrated - Disappointment minto-3 Sign in Permalink Summary: Well directed, excellent actors, OK plot.. I saw this movie a couple of days after I watched "The Usual Suspects" on DVD.. Compared The Departed is miles behind in both total quality and plot! Great humor, some nice violence.. Not the best photography I've seen and definitely not the most clever movie out there. But overall this is one of the best movies of this genre in 2006. Scorsese have done better before, but this is way better than Gangs of New York and some of his other later movies, and Hollywood in general.. Overall worth the money, but I miss an even more clever plot, nothing actually happened that I couldn't predict! Normally I don't mind sitting in the cinema for 2.5 hours: I actually don't now why, but "The Departed" felt a bit too long, Scorsese didn't engage me as much as I'd hoped..
5.0~Good But not quite ***SPOILER*** SammerAsker Sign in Permalink Oh well here we go aside from those Who make comparisons and just take The Departed as its own movie and a stated re-make of an original its a job well-done Acting = superior at most parts Directing = ( to Be honest ) Medium it lacked this unique flair for such a movie especially when you state that its a remake and the original was amazingly directed ( this is not really a bias opining ) Plot = great especially that Scorsese chose to have his own (very few ) twists and was actually good to take us off the comparison mode and at times i suspected he'll end the movie differently ( But oh well ) in general the movie had a great base the script was surprisingly good the overall movie atmosphere was entertaining so why would you ask for more !!! now lets get to business ( I mean comparison ) cons 1- if you're going to be faithful to the original; please don't make it too obvious and naive 2- the mirror character shown at "infernal affairs " 2 cops going to the same school apparently knew each other the way they met every now and then ( 2-3 times ) the character comparison from beginning to end was much better on IF ( i.e. Departed for some reason zoomed on Colin Sullivan character from childhood to cop- hood :P but with Billy Costigan they just thought the rotten cop funny insults was enough of a background :( , with no doubt showing the 2 main characters in apparel route in deferent direction was a better approach 3- Billy Costigan Madolyn relation was very important especially if you watched the trilogy while at the departed they just kept it romantic the main cop raw and how his relation was with the undercover cop was at some human level , was destroyed at the departed because simply The director thought of 2 cops great idea that will solve him allot of script issues along the movie 5- a bit expected even if you never watched the original , ( i.e. the second i saw the 2nd young cop i knew he was rotten ( just to be honest ) a naive script trick ) OK enough of insulting a good movie going back to the start just looking at the departed as its own unique re-make i would say its worth you're time whether you watched the original or not , its a very good movie with a great script ( except very few slips ) and of course a superior acting ( i mean look at the cast ) and a well-done directing ( i really wanted better but you know what they say ... ) as for the Oscars I'll say COME ON PEOPLE this will be really unfair please watch more movies 2006 has allot of great movie that deserves an Oscar more than the departed hmm and finally please f you think a movie is good it doesn't mean you rate it 10/10 I'm starting to feel that this really organized crime taking over the movie is hardly a 7 PLEASE BE FAIR
10.0~Scorsese's back nickzbekool Sign in Permalink without a doubt Scorsese's best film since "goodfellas".Set in Boston its a brilliant story of good cop,bad cop, and the mob. Leonardo Dicapio is riverting as a good cop who has to go to jail in order to be undercover going after a notorious mobster Costello(Nicholson). The only people that know about it are the 2 officers that ordered it, Mark Whalberg and Martin Sheen. Matt Damon is the seemingly good cop,but is bad. He knows Nicholson he does everything to keep Nicholson from getting arrested. But Nicholson discovers there's a rat in his mob. Matt Damon is with a shrink, who cheats with Dicaprio,she discovers what's going on with Damon. Jack Nicholson is amazing as a very vicious mobster. Dicaprio finds out that someone on the force is helping out Nicholson. Then they both meet, Damon and Dicaprio. Then Dicaprio finds out its Damon who's protecting Nicholson. Sheen gets killed by Nicholson's mob, they throw him from the balcony,Dicaprio feels bad,because Sheen was protecting him. .Brilliantly paced,artistic,very bloody and an amazing cast.
6.0~This movie is simply not one of Scorsese's great ones. dsocwell Sign in Permalink I went to The Departed last night on the strength of some of the reviews I'd read. And while it was a fairly good movie, it is not great. In my opinion, Scorsese has taken an interesting story and a very good cast and created a somewhat-better-than-mediocre picture. The photography is very good, the shots well done for the most part, but he has made some odd choices. The most puzzling is the Chinese/microchip issue. This could have and, in my opinion, should have been omitted. It doesn't move the plot, it doesn't add depth or breadth to the story and it doesn't help to develop any of the characters. Some of the acting was uneven as well. I love some of Matt Damon's work, but I never felt an emotional connection with this character. I had the sense that I was watching him act. Even his accent isn't consistent, changing from the Boston Southie he displayed in Good Will Hunting to Midwestern. Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson, and that's the problem with his portrayal. Unconvincing. There are other issues I have with this movie, but on the positive side, Mark Wahlberg and Alce Baldwin are both quite enjoyable to watch. And by far the best performance, without question, is given by Leonardo DiCaprio. This young man can act! He has a way of becoming the character and his performance here is worth the price of admission. So, my suggestion is to go and see this movie, but don't set your expectations at the level suggested by some of the almost hysterically glowing reviews. If you do, you will be disappointed.
9.0~He deserved best director, rafiqmustafi Sign in Permalink took me a long time to settle into this movie and i find that i do that with almost all of Marty's movies (Marty, ayah, like a know the little bugger) anyway... I think i am so thrown by all the tracking shots which i suppose has become his signature that it like a slap in the face i just want to scream stop masturbating with all your film equipment and tell the dang story, ya know? but there i was not enjoying it at all until mark walhberg came onto the screen and dang he was funny, what a great great performance every time he was on the screen i was like ayah man this is great timing - alec baldwin too was a joy to watch.
3.0~Hollywoods screws up another really good foreign film bluntwoods Sign in Permalink The original, Infernal affairs is so much better. Scorsese took a great movie and turned it into a cuss match and 2.5 hr long sex joke. If I hadn't seen Infernal Affairs, I'm sure I would have thought the movie was great given some of the character developments. But, since Scorsese started from Infernal Affairs, I have to measure his work from there, and it is pathetic. The scene where Leo and Gwen meet towards the end where he's sitting down outside and she holds him to her stomach is horribly shot. At the side angle it looks like his head is at her crotch level, at the behind Leo's head angle it looks like his head is at her breast level. The two bright spots of the movie for me were Matt Damon playing a prick (as it just came natural to boo his character) and Mark Wahlberg showing he can take on an asshole role and not some guy in touch with his feminine side as all his other characters seem to be that I've seen. If you're a someone who will never watch a subtitled movie and loves being spoon fed Hollywood crap as well as dick and fart jokes, I mean killing and sex jokes, this movie is great for you, seriously. But, if you like watching a fresh film rather than its not as great rehash and care more about the story and movie and less about the actors names, and don't mind subtitles, snag a copy of Infernal Affairs.
10.0~A Cat-And-Mouse Game Desertman84 Sign in Permalink The Departed is an American crime thriller film,a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, about two men from opposite sides of the law that are undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mob. The film is directed by Martin Scorsese.It has a star- studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin. The story begins when Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is introduced to organized crime through Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston at a young age. Costello trains him to become his mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on organized crime.While Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is asked by Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to become an Undercover Agent due to the fact that his family ties to organized crime that makes him a perfect infiltrator. Before he graduates,he drops out of the Academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.Eventually,both infiltrate their respective organizations and play a cat-and-mouse game until the end of the film. We are treated to a great action thriller in The Departed.But comparing Infernal Affairs and The Departed,the original is a lot superior as compared to the American remake. Infernal Affairs is more realistic and has more emotional depth as compared to The Departed.It clearly explores the complexities and moral ambiguity that both Inspector Lau and Yan are undergoing.Aside from that,the material is very original and it is truly brilliantly made.The acting of the film is also great especially that of Andy Lau and Tony Leung.There are more interesting characters like Inspector Wong and Sam,the triad boss.Finally,the movie's ending makes you feel for both Inspector Lau,who finally became the person that he wants to assume by becoming a real cop through a series of lies and murder; and Yan,whom we feel considering that he never got his true identity back of being a cop and will always be remembered as a criminal. The Departed is just a two-hour and a half mindless entertainment.It is NOT AN ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY since it is remake of Infernal Affairs. (Literally it is a remake since it copied scene by scene of the Infernal Affairs - LOL).Most of the great scenes of the movie was taken from IA as well.Also,there is too much swearing in the film.Why do the movie has to have the word f*ck said for 237 times?Do all cops and criminals swear every time they speak?Also,both Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are one-dimensional.One is good and the other is bad.There are too many characters and a lot of them are bland.Frank Costello looks more like a cartoon-like character rather than a mafia boss.There is less emotional depth and complexities as compared to the original.Then there is the pathetic character of Vera Farmiga named Madolyn.Does she really have to sleep with both Colin and Billy?We are treated to the acting histrionics of the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio,Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson.Matt Damon is simply bland in this film.Watch Damon in The Informant instead.Finally,the viewer has less empathy to the characters in the end since everybody just has to get shot in the end. In the end,I still prefer the original compared to this remake although this movie still deserves a 10/10 rating.
7.0~A testosterone-fuelled turn, The Depahted Flagrant-Baronessa Sign in Permalink Two newly-graduated police officers Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are hired by the Massachusetts State Police, one to simultaneously infiltrate the Irish mafia lead by the colourful Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and one to investigate leaks within the bureau. Their respective tasks parallel each other at all times, but they never meet. Cue intrigue en masse, coated with tense cat-and-mouse games and green-and-white Irish culture in Boston, making The DepAHted something of a Goodfellas lite. This is, essentially, all that is achieves. For a 'Best Picture' nominee, The Departed lacks heart and makes up for it by trafficking in violence, suspense and swearing. The aforementioned naturally gets it a long way with most people, and indeed even with me, but since Martin Scorsese is incapable of making a film shorter than two and a half hours, the substance stretches thin. I'm no math whiz but things simply do not add up to a complete film. Much like in Goodfellas, The Aviator and Gangs of New York, Scorsese gets so taken with the setting and atmosphere that he positively dawdles on scenes and the majority of these serve no other function in the story than to get us a feel for the way--and the venality--with which things are run. The acting, by contrast, is actually good. Jack Nicholson may simply be rehashing his psycho-Jack routine but it works as well as ever and he chews scenery whenever he is on screen. Leonardo Dicaprio inhabits something of a lead role in the film, but his acting regimen consists of shouting as loudly as he can. Billy Costigan is a difficult character to capture the nature of, for he is both contradictory and confused, jockeyed between the Irish mafia and his allegiance to the police department. Matt Damon's slick character Colin Sullivan is a joy to watch as he "rises faster than a twelve year old's dick" in his career, but much credit is also due to Mark Walhberg's streetsmart Dignam who is given some excellent and brilliantly funny dialogue in the script, such as the latter observation about Sullivan. The only problem is that he is at the mercy of a grossly underwritten character. The big problem that The Departed has is that its story rotates around genuinely unlikeable anti-heroes. I'm not even sure if they'd qualify as heroes, for these are characters with good qualities that are so distant that you need binoculars. It is difficult to slot them in protagonist/antagonist positions because while Sullivan is corrupt and selfish, he is funny, charming and we follow him from childhood. Costigan, by contrast, lacks all the enjoyable theatricality of his polar character and comes across as whiny, moody and desperate in his actions but certainly he is morally right in the film, and quite firmly on the side of good in spite being taken under the wings of Nicholson the mob boss himself. Without likable characters a wide array of problems follow, but the direction, pace and action of the film cleverly mask most of these. Who cares that all women are hookers (often literally)? Who cares that these is product placement by the bucketload? And who cares that the ending is one huge mess? The fact is that Martin Scorsese knows how to craft a compelling film, and much of this expertise has translated into an enjoyable crime cop drama with Boston accents and slang that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace. Ultimately, the actors sing tunes we have all heard before and the story may be intricately-sketched but we have been down this road before, so this is nothing revolutionary. And where, pray tell, is the tracking shot?! 7- out of 10
8.0~"It's a nation of f*****g rats" Magenta_Bob Sign in Permalink The thing I remember the most from seeing The Departed the first time is that I had rented it with my parents, and there was something wrong with the DVD so it kept freezing at the scene in which Jack Nicholson whips out a dildo at the adult movie theater, which I found both harrowing and amusing since I imagined that someone had played that scene over and over until the DVD got scratched or something. We must have watched that rubber penis ten times trying to get past that mark. I mention this because it says something both about my complicated relationship to my parents and sex, and about the slight forgettability of the rest of the film. Still, the fact that the film pales a bit alongside Scorsese's other great gangster films does not make it bad, in fact it is a solid piece of work. The Departed eschews some of the lavish style of movies like Goodfellas and Casino, possibly because the source demands a somewhat grittier presentation, by, aside from a couple of neon glowing scenes and a weirdly gratuitous cocaine orgy scene, keeping the visual excess to a minimum and playing the soundtrack rather safe with things like Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones – Gimme Shelter is played at least twice, but I gotta admit, it's the perfect song to make a badass entrance to. However, the plot, about a policeman infiltrating the mob while a mob guy is infiltrating the police, is brilliantly constructed, especially during the latter half where Scorsese turns the tension of who will be exposed first up to eleven. The fact that both camps are full of "good guys" and "bad guys" helps blur the line between the two, which is a recurring theme in the dialogue. There's an inherent growing sense of distrust and paranoia in the central conflict that the film could probably squeeze more out of, but DiCaprio conveys it quite well in his emotionally troubled undercover cop. The suspense reaches its height during two excellent scenes; first, an intense alley chase, and second, an equally intense phone call between the two infiltrators. The only thing that doesn't really work with them is the somewhat contrived subplot in which they both sleep with the same woman. It would be unfair to single out The Departed among the host of gangster films but it's like it didn't even show up for the Bechdel test. I have to revise my opinion about the violent two-part climax which I previously thought had an air of silliness to it, as it actually plays quite perfectly into the whole blurred distinction between good and evil. There's something ironic? fateful? nihilistic? about it and it reminded me of those old French heist movies like Rififi and Le doulos. The departed, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, are all equal now.
7.0~Scorsese is overrated yet again jnunes-1 Sign in Permalink This was a pretty good film, but it's mostly because it has a really great cast. Marty Gore-sese has yet another film with blood splattering all over the place and at some point in the film you know that everyone is going to be shot except for a lucky one or two.This creates a domino effect with the scenes for the final 40 minutes or so - one down, who's next? This device in screen writing is very mechanical and has been used many times (see Road to Perdition for a recent example) The music, while adding atmosphere and excitement, substitutes for dialog and is overused in my opinion. The female psychiatrist who is involved with Damon and Dicaprio is pretty lightweight for the role; she's too important to the story to be just average. -spoilers, don't read if you have not seen the film - Once you think the story is over and the bad guy has won, the character they conveniently removed from story comes back and kills him... all the central characters die. Is that the point, no one wins these wars between the cops and the criminals?
2.0~Abject failure of a remake of Infernal Affairs (SPOILERS) eugeneluah Sign in Permalink Caught The Departed last night and I have to say, its one abject failure of a remake. I was expecting it to be good, and truth be told, I wanted it to be good because it is based on Hongkong's Infernal Affairs, quite possibly one of the best gang flicks of all time. It is one of my personal favorites due to its brilliantly conceived plot of gang versus police, replete with paranoia and deceit. It is also quite possibly, one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen (second to Memento). Where do I even begin? There are just so many things to criticize about. Firstly, the utterly realistic characters in Infernal Affairs have been reduced to one dimensional vectors that merely carry the plot forward. Matt Damon's character was reduced to a bad ass villain and was almost gleefully ridding anyone who knew of his identity, with no hint of remorse even till the very end. In Infernal Affairs however, at the end of the film, Andy Lau truly wanted to be a good guy but obviously, circumstances did not allow him to, and therefore he was forced to kill the gang boss to protect his identity. He subsequently went crazy over the guilt of killing the police informant (Tony Leung, or Leornado in Departed). Infernal Affairs ended brilliantly because Andy Lau's character survived it all with no one knowing his true identity. He could therefore assume his role of a high-ranking police officer, but was ridden with guilt and constantly reminded of the people who died because of him. It was really tragic and you could almost sympathize with his character. And what's with the ending of The Departed?!! Do all Hollywood films have to have perfect fairy tale endings where the bad guy has to die? And even if he has to die, does it have to conclude with an abrupt scene that lasts 30secs, and not to mention, totally cheesy and lame. It seems like a quick way out to conclude the story. The climax at the lift in the abandoned building was also unintentionally funny as body counts skyrocketed as people just started dying ridiculously. The reaction that people had in that scene in Infernal Affairs was true shock'Oh my god!'. The reaction in Departed was quite the opposite  people started laughing. Also, the strange and awkward friendship between the police informant's boss and the gang boss was completely removed in the Departed. It was so enjoyable watching how the 2 former friends who are currently on opposite ends of the law, try to outplay each other in a full-fledged war of wits and power, but with grace as a result of their friendship in the past. This was COMPLETELY omitted in the Hollywood version. And also, there was a lack of tension between the police force and the gangs. Martin Sheen seems almost weak and hapless against Jack Nicholson and Nicholson himself appears barely sinister and intelligent. Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant. This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died. There was no friendship to speak of between these 2 characters in Departed!!! The movie also tries way too hard to entertain. The crazy antics of Jack Nicholson is reminiscent of his character in Anger Management. Yes, Anger management, that rubbish of a comedy. And I do not understand why there are so much sexual references in the movie. There is sex, women and porno everywhere in the movie and is completely unnecessary and downright insulting. Gritty realism is not achieved by dumping sex scenes in the movie. I can go on and on and criticizing about almost every single aspect in the movie (like how unnecessary the role of the psychiatrist in the Departed was, but completely pivotal in Infernal Affairs etc.), and might as well write a thesis on this movie. To conclude, there was not a single scene of tension nor was it ever moving or exciting. In fact, i found it more funny than anything else. The acting was not particularly great as well despite a rather stellar cast. Infernal Affairs was an intricate and convoluted plot of deceit, lies, friendship, paranoia and love, at the hands of skillful directors who carefully stage memorable scenes and powerful climaxes  almost everything that Departed was not, despite an almost identical script. The critics are REALLY WRONG on this one. It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot. The editing was also fragmented and confusing, and coupled with horrendous pacing, the film gets progressively frustrating. Martin Scorsese has effectively removed everything that was so good about the original. Trust me, save your money and time, and watch Infernal Affairs, even if you have watched it already.
9.0~King Martin conquers Boston Jonathon_Natsis Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese hits the mean streets again in his triumphant return to the crime genre that has justified his position as arguably the world's greatest living filmmaker. The Departed, a remake of the well-acclaimed Hong Kong grit-fest Infernal Affairs, follows the complicated lives of Billy Costigan (former criminal turned undercover cop), Colin Sullivan (current criminal who's weeded his way into the police force) and Frank Costello (the seemingly infallible Don who's array of memorable quotes have made The Departed the most naturally quotable film since Mean Girls). This film is always contained in the mind and hands of Scorsese; we never forget that this is his project, and his influence is constantly felt throughout the film. The cinematography employed reminds us of some of the director's earliest projects, and that he certainly hasn't lost his touch. The trademark quick cuts, flashbacks and general detail offered to every aspect of every scene are all on display. The integration of dated yet actual footage of the Boston race riots with the commanding, satisfied voice of Jack Nicholson's Costello creates one of the most engaging opening scenes in recent film history. Frank Costello reminisces about 'years agowhen we had the church' and that, even today, 'no-one gives it to you, you have to take it' all to the tune of Gimme Shelter, a song that has largely defined all Scorcesean works post-Goodfellas. But don't be fooled, this is not the stereotypical Don who can't believe business is no longer conducted the way it was in the old country. Flunking out of the Corleone School of Business, it appears that Frank controls every aspect of his universe with an iron fist and a silver tongue, until his own flaws come to the forefront in a denouement scene that could be seen as uncharacteristically cliché, if it weren't so masterfully acted out in front of us. For all intents, the acting, in its purest form, is the strongest suit of The Departed. Essentially an ensemble film, Dicaprio and Damon exceed expectations while Crazy Jack adopts his most blatantly villainous role since The Shining. Marky Mark is delightfully hateable and the rest of his Funky Bunch (Sheen, Baldwin and Farmiga) make themselves known as well. One of my film-osophies is that one can distinguish a good director from a great one on how they apply a comic-relief character within the plot of their film. Baldwin's portrayal of Ellerby is witty, used sparingly (a crucial quality) and has a genuine respect and passion for his work within the force, giving him a somewhat larger scope for character development than just being the laugh generator in what is otherwise a very serious film. While The Departed goes against the mould of earlier Scorsese dramas (which typically focused on the goings-on around a single crucial protagonist), it does retain the fact that each primary character has very obvious flaws that will be inevitably extracted and exploited as the film progresses. I find this to be not only a treat to watch unravel from a creative perspective, but also the central message of the film: humans, by their very condition, are morally flawed, and that the consequences of their actions upon society have greater reaches than the effect of those consequences on any one person. If there was to be any criticism imposed upon this film, it is that the intended plot controls the characters, rather than the character(s) dictating where the story is going. This might need to be made a little clearer. In films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, the story does not go anywhere unless Travis or Jake respectively choose to steer it in that direction. With The Departed, the characters merely serve as a vehicle for getting parts of the story from A to B, or to connect the plot in a plausible manner, and several scenes towards the conclusion seem somewhat too convenient for a film that has a lot to say about the implications humans have on the world around them. That said, this remains a highly enjoyable film, but one that benefits infinitely from multiple viewings. After eventually deciphering who dies, where they die, and why they died in your first sitting, it is advisable that you re-watch the film. This allows you to delve very deeply into the persona of each major character and gain a subsequent understanding and appreciation of one of the best examples of ensemble cast filmmaking in the history of dramatic cinema. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*
7.0~This won Best Picture? MrGKB Sign in Permalink I caught Scorsese's latest at a second-run house after the Academy Awards had been dealt out, and was left perplexed that this remake of the Hong Kong quickie, "Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs)," garnered Best Picture and secured Scorsese's long-overdue win as Best Director. Make no mistake, "The Departed" is an entertaining thriller, well acted for the most part, well-directed, shot and produced well, but Best Picture? I think not. Scorsese has done much better, more memorable, interesting films. "Gangs of New York" and "Goodfellas" spring instantly to mind. My opinion is that the Academy has simply finally given Scorsese his long-awaited props as a filmmaker, nothing more. It won't be too long before "The Departed" joins past Oscar winners like "The English Patient" in the ranks of attractive, but totally dispensable film entertainment. That said, I thought the film was overly long. The subplot involving the leads' mutual paramour, the lovely Vera "The Manchurian Candidate" Farmiga, was mostly unnecessary padding to the slim story. Matt Damon is fine as the flip side to Leonardo DiCaprio's heads-up coin, although original choice Brad Pitt would have served equally well, and DiCaprio shows that he's here to stay as a talented and bankable star. Jack Nicholson does what he does best (chew scenery), but strikes me as about as Irish as--oh, I don't know--Mr. Whipple. The rest of the cast is competent, but not overly distinguished; virtually all of their roles could have been assayed by other actors. Wahlberg's nomination for Best Supporting Actor is an equal mystery to me; he did nothing he hasn't done before, and better. I just don't see "The Departed" having much to offer beyond a few hours of idle entertainment. It's a good movie, but hardly a classic, and definitely not one of Scorsese's best.
10.0~Making Decisions with a Gun Instead of a Gavel dataconflossmoor Sign in Permalink I am not saying that I think this movie is in the category with other Scorcese greats such as "Raging Bull" and "Taxi Driver", actually "King of Comedy" is my favorite Scorcese film, however "The Departed" is a relatively remarkable film!! The acting in this movie is simply incredible!! The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you!! Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, and of course Matt Damon!! I thought Matt Damon's performance was the best acting performance in this movie!! The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was "The Irish are impervious to psycho-analysis".. I went to grade school at an Irish parish, and even though they were affluent, they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are!! Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate. The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States. Boston is where the movie "The Departed" takes place.. The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie, and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it!! "The Departed" won for best picture in '2006, as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade!! How were all the problems in this movie solved?...WITH A GUN!! The violence in "The Departed" was almost satirical, as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances!! Everyone's anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything!! Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing- This is a Scorcese film!! His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies!! I enjoyed this film, and I can definitely see how it won best picture in '2006. What is the best way of saying "The Departed" is an excellent movie, by saying this: "The Departed" is a really good (F word) picture!!
7.0~In the shadow of the trilogy... evilflic Sign in Permalink I'd give this seven stars out of ten. Why? Simply because the Infernal Affairs trilogy eclipses it. Why remake a film which is superb as it is? The plot of this film follows that of Infernal Affairs closely- however, the ending seems a little different. The film basically attempts to walk in its daddy's footsteps. I suppose, though, that if you don't understand Cantonese and dislike subtitles, you're better off watching this movie rather than the original. Pardon my use of a cliché: nothing beats the original. This film isn't very 'special' or 'original', in the sense that it's all been done before... This film, however, is well worth seeing. The acting was good, 'good' meaning nothing special, but nothing too mediocre either. Famous names add some star spangle to the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting lives up to (if not, surpasses) that of his Asian counterpart, Edison Chen, from IA; but then again, it cannot be denied that Chen's acting was far from admirable. At least both actors are fairly attractive- they both give the film a little 'zing'. Flimic techniques are geared for thrilling viewing. Those who are game for a fast-paced, action-packed movie with a clever plot will find themselves drooling over The Departed. Watch this movie for a bit of excitement. It's best viewed in a cinema- surround sound and all that. Don't watch Infernal Affairs until you've seen this movie. Otherwise, you'll find yourself sitting through The Departed, thinking to yourself the entire time; "What was the point of a remake...?!"
8.0~so cool!!!1 ian_atherton Sign in Permalink I couldn't believe it. The coolest scenes I have ever seen, I mean, did Leo Di CaPrio ever act as well as this? His acting blew my face off, and Matt Damon as well. His best performances since Team America World police- MATT DAMOooN! The scenes come fast and furious to the nail-biting extreme. Nevermind the original, this remake deserves all the Oscars Academy can throw. And Jack Nicholson. What a hero. He makes the screen light up with his brazen cheek. He's so rude, yet ultimate intimidating. terrifying!!! what a movie. 10 out of 10! A barrow roll, encore! Bring on the remake of the original sequel, can it get any better? I love it.
1.0~more gore than Texas Chainsaw Massacre sveb5 Sign in Permalink What a disappointment. Fun level of zero. Realisism near zero. Cops that do nothing but constantly scream the f-word and get in fistfights with one another at the office all day, every day. Apparently assaulting an officer is OK if you are an officer. A couple of Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies worth of pointless gore. Uselessly jarringly filmed like a bad CSI episode. And if I want to see that many people realistically killed I'll rent the entire Faces of Death series. This movie is junk. It should have been classified as horror so I could have avoided it. But of course none of that was in the previews because once again the people making the previews have more talent than the director and writers of the actual movie.
10.0~This movie isn't just another cop drama. The lives of the main characters will overlap creating an intriguing work of art. rehren75 Sign in Permalink A movie that cast Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Demon, with the direction of Martin Scorsese is a mixture for success. The intrigues triangle is well planned, and effectively keeps the audience in suspense until the end. The sound track and the shoot techniques point out significant developments through the movie. All in all, The Departed is the greatest movie of the year. In the opening scene a magnificent Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), introduces the evolution of the South Boston's Irish mafia, and sets the roots for the entire film. It takes about five minutes into the movie, to see Frank's face, and exactly when he says /we could become cops or criminals when you are facing a loaded gun what's the difference?/. The choice of the director to introduce Frank, one of his main characters, with a mysterious darkness around him, perfectly defines the nature of this man. Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Bill Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) are introduced, as adults, almost at the same time. This choice demonstrates duality between them; simultaneously their roles are inverted to create misunderstanding in the viewers. Collin appears to be the perfect man, rising fast and with enough attitudes to be promoted into the Special Investigation Unit. Bill on the other hand, is treated like a criminal, because of his affiliations with the organized crime. Scorsese's choice to initiate Bill as a non welcome addition to the State Police is brilliant. The prelude of the two characters overlaps defining the title of this movie. The title, The Departed, is obviously associated to Bill Costigan's change of identity, where the cop in him dies. The music is well chosen, and it helps associate the different situations. For example, the song I'm Shipping Up to Boston, by The Dropkick Murphys, defines two significant events of the story. The first time, it is used when Bill begins his new undercover life. The second time, the song is used to define the state of actions that will bring Bill back to his real identity. I'm Shipping Up to Boston, is the perfect song to classify the two moments especially because of the Irish Folk in it. The multitude of shot techniques makes the viewer understand, and concentrate on significant details in the movie. It also defines the personality of the main characters. Collin is prevalently filmed from a high angle, which indicates submission. Bill on the other hand, is mostly filmed from a low angle, which represents superiority in values. Frank is filmed up close and mostly by himself, which symbolizes power and domination. In conclusion, The Departed is a masterpiece. Scorsese was able to create something, which will become a cult for generation to come. His choice of actors and filming techniques are appropriate to the subject. Whoever, can understand the brilliancy of this movie will be satisfied with it.
2.0~Very weak effort. **SPOILERS** drickard-2 Sign in Permalink This film was so weak in so many areas it is difficult to even begin. Instead of wasting too much more of my time on this film I will only comment that there was no story arc to be identified at all in the film. None of the characters you meet in the first half hour are alive at the end of the film. Some of the characters you meet along the way have sub-plots that don't tie in and are not resolved in any way. This is all underscored by the low point in modern cinema featuring Jack Nicholson pretending to masturbate in a porn theater only to reveal that he is waving a dildo instead. The AMPAS should be ashamed, and all members should be replaced after this recent display.
10.0~One of the best movies i've ever seen, just be warned, very violent rbkeavney Sign in Permalink Its about 2:20 in the morning and i honestly have nothing better to do right now than to write a movie review. so, here goes. i saw the Departed about a week after its theatrical release. I knew it was going to at least be good. it wasn't good. it was possibly one of the best movies i've ever seen. that being said, if you can't stomach incredibly brutal violence, then don't watch it, because believe me, as much as i like a violent flick here and there, even i left the theater feeling like i had been hit with a baseball bat. The story is very riveting with good twists, yet one doesn't have to pay attention to every minor detail and look for symbolism left and right to find out whats going on. DiCaprio's performance i thought was absolutely fantastic, hes definitely one of the best actors out there today. Whalberg is hilarious in his few scenes and of course does the ultimate justice in the end of the movie (watch and you'll know what i mean). The soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, from Gimme Shelter, through I'm Shipping Up to Boston, Nobody But Me, Thief's Theme, all the songs fit every scene perfectly. Scorsese never fails to amaze me, and i've only seen four of his films. The movie to me is an 11 out of 10 (unfortunately, thats not possible). Definitely watch it, but if you don't like violence, steer clear.
9.0~Better than the HK version chowy-1 Sign in Permalink I've seen the HK version, Internal Affair, of this movie long before it became available in movie theater. I think the delivery is much better in The Departed than Internal Affair. I have seen countless of Hong Kong movie, believe me, I was born in Hong Kong. In the HK one, the dialogue were just not there. I think in general, dialogue in HK movie need a lot of works. Second, the role of each player wasn't very clear in the HK version. Remember at the beginning where both of the cadets started from the same Triad group, i.e. the temple sense at the very beginning. So it makes audience wonder who is really the bad guy. Third, in the end, the police guy (the real bad guy) trying the be good after the head detective was killed. I think that confused the heck of the audience there. The role switching near end of the movie is a big no-no and just don't make sense. If I was the mole in the police force, I would have done what Matt Damon did, killed everyone to protect my identity. The American version has a much more powerful delivery of the story. It is very good in showing how Leonardo DiCaprio nearly becoming insane for being a mole in the Mob. The 3-way relationships between Matt/Leonardo/Vera Farmiga is a good tying-everything-together development. The brain splatter scenes simply drive home the fact that its is not a nice job to work with the Mob. It is expected because it is an action movie, period. In all, I like the American version over the HK one is not because the story but its delivery and logical way of laying out the characters. It make you think twice on becoming a mole....
10.0~Brilliant mflynn-4 Sign in Permalink Having been a fan of the 2002 Internal affairs I entered the Cinema with a bit of trepidation. Could they possibly match the excellence of the Hong Kong masterpiece & it's 2 sequels? Too bloody right they have! This film seriously kicks arse. Scorsese is truly at the top of his game, the action is beautifully filmed. Some top performances from DiCaprio, 2 Whalbergs & Matt Damon. My only criticism is the that there seems to be less of an emotional connection between Sheen & DiCaprio that in the original, but it is more than made up by fast paced intelligent & often hilarious dialogue. If this film doesn't get Oscars there is no justice in the world.
10.0~Outstanding performance! omel_18 Sign in Permalink I'm not going to tell the story of this wonderful movie. What I just wanted to tell you how this movie became a masterpiece and absolutely compelling to watch. This story of the movie is not typical. For me, it is unique or one of a kind film. At very first, one can determine what they are trying to uncover but the main goal of this movie is how each sides will be able to unravel the secrets or who is the rat between two parties. In addition to that, the greatest stars of Hollywood were here. I believed this one of the reasons why the characters were depicted amazingly. As one watch the film, it can easily seen how lies, betrayal and sacrifice pictured. For this reason, I gave this a grade of 10/10. Moreover, I've never seen movie like this before. For those who haven't seen this film this is the best one to spend one's free time, whether to see it on a computer or on a TV.
10.0~The Departed-Ida Allen allen74-884-714138 Sign in Permalink Ida Allen HUMN246 F2WW Assignment 5-5 Film Review The Departed The Departed is an American film based on the 2002 film called Internal Affairs. The Departed takes place in Boston, Massachusetts. The film is centered on crime and deceit. One of the main characters Frank Costello played by the legendary Jack Nicholson is quite the crime leader. He trains and plants Matt Damon's character Colin as an informant at the Massachusetts State police Department. At the same time, the police get wind of some wrong doing and plant their own undercover assignee Leo DiCaprio's character Billy. The Departed is quite the layered film. It is deep and serious through out. It takes more than one viewing in my opinion to fully understand and appreciate the wonderful actors and the stories they tell. Legendary director Martin Scorsese has been mentioned as one of the most legendary directors of the decade. He really met his match on this film. It is so intricate and detailed that even he said on an entertainment show that he had more to tell than he could truly fit into a respectable time allowance. The theme of The Departed gets down to basics about cops and robbers. It shows the audience about the good guys and the bad guys and shows that sometimes they even pretend to be on the other side when they need to. The central concern in the film is based upon crime and catching the bad guy. The theme mainly focuses on plot and character. Thematic ideas are truly important when reviewing a film. The plot points of The Departed have so many thematic elements intertwined into it that one has to pull each string of information from it to understand the full picture. For example, the plot involves two trained cadets who are both trying to uncover crime in the same work place of the police department. Both Billy and Colin are working as double agents with the overall goal of catching Costello. The thematic element of character comes into play strongly in this portion of the plot. The characters in the film have very detailed roles and truly make the movie. The Departed is clever, cunning, and meticulous. There are many undercover scenes where Billy and Colin give incredible performances. The scenes are tense and nerve racking and place you at the edge of your seat. The viewer feels nervous about either Colin or Billy getting caught by Costello. Both sides worry about getting their cover blown, but yet suspect that they are being watched by someone else. In all reality, they are. Both Colin and Billy are watching the same criminal and one another. The plot thickens when Vera Farmiga's character psychiatrist Dr. Madolyn Madden is involved with both undercover agents. She is the stations psychiatrist and Colin begins seeing her and then Billy also begins a romance with her after meting with her for his probation. This woman could blow both men's cover at the drop of a hat. They refer to the other as a rat. Colin and Billy give stunning performances in this film and left me hoping for a sequel. They provide such a believing performance of their characters and really convince the audience that the good guy, bad guy story line is real. Techniques used during The Departed really added relevance to the film overall. For example, the lighting in the film was right on the money. A scene where Costello was discussing his crime activities with Colin was often captured in low lighting. This gave me the feel of hidden danger and secrecy. In addition, a scene where Billy was investigating Costello and Colin was often portrayed in natural or low light. This felt surreal and authentic. This provided me with the belief that these characters were real and the film was not just a film, but a real occurrence. Another example of a technique in the film is camera angle. In a scene where Mark Walhberg who plays Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam who is second in command of the undercover unit and is on a mission to figure out exactly what Colin and Billy is up to makes the audience feel as though they are on the street as well. The angle he is captured when yelling at Colin made me nervous and feels on edge for him. The angle was shot close up and was bona fide. The theme of The Departed is not a singled out one. There is one other film that comes to mind with the character and plot portrayal of crime and undercover moles in the police department which is Goodfellas. This film is also based upon crime and robbery. The film places direct reference on the theme of character and plot. The main characters Henry Hill and Jimmy Conway take part in a robbery that was in completion of two other gangsters who also have their bids on the crime. The film was quite complex and involved around the characters and the plot. In conclusion, The Departed has a theme related to character that many can relate to. Costello acted as a father figure to both undercover agents. The main point of theme is identity of the good guy and bad guy. The identity of both agents keep the audience intrigued and the thought of Costello realizing who they are are just captivating. Throughout the movie, Scorsese proved that remakes of earlier films can be as good as the first version and that suspense and thrill are his main ingredients to this film. References Scorsese, M.

10.0~Scorsese is the master mathmaniac Sign in Permalink I don't think I have to read every comment here to say what I have to say about this movie: it is the work of a master and that will make it always worth watching. The very first time I saw a Martin Scorsese film, it was 'Mean Streets' and it gave me an anxiety attack. I thought I wouldn't be able to cope with all the adrenaline making me sit on the edge of my seat throughout that movie. Little did I know that any movie of the crime-suspense genre by Scorsese would make me feel this way and I had better get used to it. Spielberg should bow and scrape every time he sees the master. And any actor with a brain would crawl through broken glass to get to work on a Scorsese picture. The fact that this was a remake of a great Chinese film invites comparisons between the two. I think I will wait a good long while before I see the Chinese film and I will probably love it as much but with distance and time between the two stories. Mark Wahlberg was blessed to get the role that he did in this film. He had to do little except act the part of tough native Bostonian. His somewhat important part in the story didn't really shock or amaze. He got recognition for his role simply by being involved in this wonderful production. Can Martin Scorsese tell a story better than anyone on the effin planet or what? Can he recognize a humdinger of a story when he sees one better then any effin director alive today or what? Can he dig the diamonds out of the effin coal while working in effin politically correct effin Hollywood or what? Sorry, just still feeling the effin spirit of the effin movie's effin language, that's all. There's a haze of dread that hangs over every scene like pollution. Does that come from the viewer's intuition or does the director, with the writers, the camera man or the lighting guy, put it there? In almost every scene, there's the new lethal weapon (call it Lethal weapon XXVI): the cell phone. Every time one rings in someone's pocket on screen, you want to stand up and scream, 'Don't answer it!' The cell phone is the new character, deserving separate billing, getting 'offed' (thrown in water) or marked with blood (literally). As in all crime plots, the black character is marked - you know he is going to get whacked, it's just a question of when. Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio give equally powerful performances but Leo is the lucky guy who has the audience rooting for him. They look a bit alike and this cannot be an accident. They look like they SHOULD be related. In real life, in the non-screen world, Whitey Bulger and Billy Bulger are brothers and have been living a drama based in Boston that also pits good against evil (brothers, Whitey is a mobster on the lam, Billy was the president of the University of Massachusetts, both Irish, both Bostonian). There's a fabulous irony that somewhere, Whitey Bulger probably owns this DVD and watches it in a setting not unlike some of the film sets. There has been talk that Costello, the Nicholson character, was loosely based on Whitey Bulger. That isn't important. The good/evil conflict is, and it is very Bulger family - like. Kudos to the screenwriter, William Monahan, who has more than a little knowledge of the Bulgers, having written a book about them, and knows how to write one quotable line after another. Bang, pow, wham! They just keep coming, making your wish you could carry those lines around in your pocket. 'I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy.' Alec Baldwin and Leo have best lines - the dialogue just comes from them, as if they went home at night and wrote the lines themselves -but Nicholson has his share, too. Nicholson is great but he plays, who else, the Irish American version of Jack Nicholson. Great nonetheless. The dark scenes with the soundtrack of the slammin bangin Dropkick Murphy's music: everything is harmonious in this movie as long as we are in bars, alleys and dark, hidden places. I have the tiniest criticsm of one plot point in the movie: who cares if your identity is erased from a computer? As everyone who ever has touched a computer knows by now, everything lost can be found again! I also want to thank the Academy for recognizing this picture - what's with all the other crap coming out of Hollywood these days, anyway?
10.0~See it and you won't be sorry Boyo-2 Sign in Permalink I just saw it this morning. 10:00am, Upper East Side. Not what I would call a crowded theater, so that was great. I'm not going to go into the plot or the details, because you've read all the reviews by now. After about an hour, I said to myself "well this is not so great, what's all the fuss about?" I started to think that everyone is so desperate for a good movie they've gone overboard in its praise. I know that the last two Marty/Leo movies had their fans but they had their detractors, too. Scorsese has been accused of trying too hard to appeal to the Academy, and Leo has as many fans as he has people who cannot stand the sight of him. At one point it all just came together. I guess you could say it snuck up on me, had an 'accumulative' effect. The last 45 minutes are just remarkable. Its so great to leave a movie with that rare 'I just saw a great movie' feeling. I'm still pretty buzzed from it. I didn't fell like Jack was just being Jack (playing to his audience, with whom he shares some sort of secret that just they know..WINK WINK), I felt like he created a larger-than-life character who's, of course, memorable as hell. Costello is perfectly suited to his legendary ability, and he delivers, and then some. The real substance is the contributions by Leo and Matt. Playing two sides of the same coin could not have been easy (how did they know what the other was doing? they rarely are on the screen at the same time) but it goes to Scorsese's skill as a director that they work so well together, even though, like I said, they are almost never together. Once review I read put it perfectly - Leo is fire, Matt is ice. You see all of Leo's turmoil just by looking at his eyes. They show you Billy's soul, his conscience. You do not see Matt's conscience, because he does not have one. Much as I love and respect "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator", let's be truthful here..Scorsese is at his very best with this type of thing, and "The Departed" makes that point again and again. Nothing wrong with that either. A movie like this makes it hard to consider seeing something else. Why would you bother? So don't! I might not be able to go on reading that lousy book I started the other day for a couple of days. The movie really does stay with you. 10/10.
1.0~Jackie Brown is much better than this Zephyranthes1 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS!!!!!!!! The Departed is lame overrated mess. Infernal Affairs is better both in title and script. A movie about moles here and moles there. 24 and Alias had better mole stories. It was longer and more complicated than it needed to be. The Hong Kong versions were three movies and this one tried to put them all in one. No one acts and speaks realistically. It seems like the movie was set in the 80s. Take the cell phones and computers away and it might as well. The ending was ridiculous. BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! with CG blood. People want to believe they are so smart and intelligent for thinking this movie is so great. Just because it has a lot of big names doesn't mean it's good. The Academy is full of crap as always for putting this movie on top. Jackie Brown is a better alternative. It is another long normal talking movie but it's more realistic and even has comedy which The Departed lacks.
10.0~amazing chadhas Sign in Permalink this is my second time commenting on a movie, the first was when i gave x-men 3 a 1 for being so terrible, and now I am giving The Departed a 10 for being so, so amazing. For all you movie buffs out there, remember how we always say they don't make real movies anymore, movies with plots, and characters, and development, and story lines, and subplots, and just amazing direction...well this is finally a movie we can say reminds us of the good old days. THIS IS A PERFECT MOVIE, AND IF NOT, IT IS VERY CLOSE TO IT. So no talk about what its about, no talk about what happens blah blah blah...just go and watch the Departed and enjoy a true gem for its time.
8.0~Solid return to the crime drama for Martin Scorsese BroadswordCallinDannyBoy Sign in Permalink An American remake of the Infernal Affairs trilogy from Hong Kong. Story is essentially the same: a powerful mobster wins the attention and soon the loyalty of a young boy who later joins the local police force and gives him critical information to help the gangster carry out his underworld operation. Meanwhile, the cops send in their own undercover man to find who sends them critical information from within the crime lord's empire. Soon, paths become dangerously close as both cop and criminal know that someone is out to expose their real identity. One of the world's finest directors once again works with a powerhouse cast to deliver a powerful film. Nearly epic in tone and riveting with its great performances for its admittedly lengthy runtime, but you'll hardly notice that. This is also one of the rare times where remake measures up to the original, mainly in that Scorsese pull no sucker punches or cheap shots. He controls the characters, sensationalism, and critically, the violence and steers them out of Hollywood cliché. The film has literally non-stop profanity/offensive remarks and brutal scenes of violence, but it is all convincing when shown next to the two-faced nature of undercover work. Nothing happens just to show off a slick location or gun-play, but all measures up to what crime drama fans have been waiting to see from Scorsese since he made "Casino" a decade earlier. The film does end slightly abruptly and the scenes seem to jump a bit towards the end. The lengthy duration of the seems to the have caused Scorsese to speed things up there in order to reach the conclusion, but overall this great stuff. Jack Nicholson has never looked so evil and a film has rarely been so dark in parts and funny in others, so depressing in certain scenes and uplifting in others. And the best thing is, most of these scenes ring true. Even if you have seen the original (and will be able to predict major story turns) this is still a film worth watching in how its core has been placed in America. However, the biggest strike against the film, and Scorsese at Oscar time, will probably be the poignancy of the film. Scorsese is more than likely to once again square off against Clint Eastwood who directed the great, and POIGNANT "Flags of our Fathers." This film lacks that punch in that it deals with issues that don't affect everyone, but war reaches an entire nation as you have, inevitably seen in recent years. Though this still ranks as one this year's best. 8/10 Rated R for strong violence and profanity
9.0~Another Great Film from a Great Director! Ndirsch11 Sign in Permalink Just as it was becoming painfully clear that 2006 was one of the worst years for movies in recent memory, along comes a masterpiece like 'The Departed' to freshen things up a bit. This should come as no surprise, however, when one takes a look at the credentials of the film's director: Martin Scorsese. Scorsese is arguably the greatest living filmmaker whose films tend to center on themes dealing with violence, masculinity, and urban alienation. Films like 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', and 'Goodfellas' are among his best work and have represented American cinema at its very best. After a series of period pieces, such as 'Gangs of New York' and 'The Aviator', Scorsese takes a change of pace with 'The Departed' and goes back to the urban alleys and streets that have been the setting for many of his films. Many fans will no doubt find this to be a welcome 'return to form' for Scorsese, although this is hardly a fair assessment of the director's body of work. Although the plot has a somewhat labyrinthine structure, the basic premise of 'The Departed' centers around two moles, or 'rats', both of whom are employed by the Boston State Police Department and the Irish mafia. Jack Nicholson, in one of the best performances of his career, plays the notorious mob boss, Frank Costello, who has many friends in high places protecting his every move. Frank is the kind of man who rules his Boston turf with an iron fist, but is capable of mercy and generosity when it suits him. He values loyalty above all else, and if "you'll scratch his back, then he'll scratch yours." Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a young thug who works his way into the Boston State Police Deparartment and gets a little more than he bargained for: he gets assigned to work undercover as a 'mole' in Frank Costello's gang. The other mole is played by Matt Damon, who also works for the Boston Police but is secretly helping Costello every step of the way. The brilliance of 'The Departed' lies in its wild energy and fast-paced storytelling. Tight editing and controlled camera-work move the story along at a quick pace while the twists and turns of the plot will leave you on the edge of your seat. Another charm of the film is its somewhat over-the-top sense of violence combined with eccentric dialog and crude humor. While watching 'The Departed', I was reminded of Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' in that both films contain random and brutal scenes of violence that are juxtaposed with long scenes of quirky dialog. 'The Departed' is a remake, or more accurately, a reworking, of the popular Hong Kong produced film, 'Infernal Affairs'. Other than a change of setting, 'The Departed' keeps the basic story intact while modifying everything else to appeal to Western audiences. With a great director at the helm, 'The Departed' winds up being one of the most wildly entertaining movies in recent years. It is sure to be a big contender come Oscar time and may even score Scorsese his long eluded best director trophy. Everybody is perfectly cast with strong performances from Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Alec Baldwin in particular. 'The Departed' works because it knows how to entertain. Whatever it may lack in thematic content it more than makes up for in entertainment value. Don't skip this film as it is one of the year's best films and deserves to be seen on the big screen. Rating: 9 out of 10.
10.0~My favourite film varun_120 Sign in Permalink 'I don't want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me.' The film starts with this dialogue. A question is also popped at the very beginning- "When you face a loaded gun what's the difference,if you're a cop or a criminal?"At the very outset the mood which is started, is kept till the end. Billy ( Leonardo) is from south Boston, has a family with criminal background, which makes him a suitable undercover in his criminal neighborhood. He is a mole in Costello's( Jack Nicholson)outfit. While, Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon)is a Sergeant in Massachusetts, is actually a mole working for Costello. Throughout the movie Billy & Collin try to figure out each others identity. As referred to as Rock star of the gangsters Costello by Alan Baldwin, truly in this movie Jack Nicholson outshines everyone. His character is so insensitive in this film. Everybody has done justice to their characters. Again , Leonardo proved why he is Martin scorsese's pick. Mark whalberg's character of insulting everyone was very unique, also with Mark's Massachusetts accent, adorned the character. Matt Damon was also very good. One more thing I want to say about this film is about its dialogues. I don't remember hearing so many crispy dialogue exchange, after Pulp Fiction. This movie is very intense throughout, with some twists and turns, that keeps you at the edge of the seat. This movie touches everything like, racial discrimination which was there once in Boston. And, bravely puts forth its opinions. I have seen this movie more than 50 times. But, whenever I see it, it never bores me. This movie teaches you a lot of harsh realities of life. Martin scorsese dished out so many good flicks. But, according to me this has to be his best film. He gave it all. Deservedly, it won an Oscar This is one of the best crime thrillers of all time. I would recommend everyone to watch this great flick. Hats off and all my clothes off to Martin scorsese for giving this incredible film. I'd like to finish this review off with a quote in this film- " No one gives it to you, you have to take it."
9.0~A Film for all movie lovers amymg1980 Sign in Permalink In the film The Departed directed by Martin Scorsese audience viewers will get to experience an action packed film, filled with internal character turmoil, played by some of the best "A" list actors Hollywood has ever seen. The three main characters, Billy Costigan played by Leonardo Decaprio, Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, and Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson are all facing a moral and ethical dilemma. Throughout the film the audience will see how each character contemplates doing what is morally right, or sticking to their alliances with other characters in the film. In the opening scene of the movie we are shown how Colin's allegiance to Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson, is developed. Colin is a young child sitting isolated in a deli. Frank comes in to collect "taxes" from the deli owner. After causing a commotion with the deli owner, Frank makes the owner give young Colin milk and bread, because Frank knows that Colin does not have a good family life. Fast Forward into time and Colin is now working his way through the Boston Police Department to work as a mole for Frank Costello. Simultaneously as Colin is going through the ranks we are introduced to Billy who is working through the ranks for good intentions, to change the perception of his family's name. The director, Martin Scorsese uses a variety of film techniques to portray the underlying mystery and suspense in the film. Scorsese uses a lot of low-key lighting to create an almost depressing atmosphere in most of the action scenes. The audience can almost predict when something bad is going to happen. Scorsese also uses high angle shots to diminish Billy's worth within the police department, while low angle shots are used to make Collin appear more respected. This style of directing can also be seen in Orson Wells film Citizen Kane. The Departed is a film that all movie viewers will love, whether you're looking for a love story, an action flick, or a suspense thriller. Viewers will be on the edge of their seat from the start of the movie all the way up through the end of the movie. As the characters develop, and the plot thickens, viewers can't help but to hope that good will overcome evil.
6.0~"The Departed" NOT the Best Scorcese Movie Ever! TrumpIsAHump Sign in Permalink Contrary to what some of the Scorcese devotees have posted here, this is not his best movie! "GoodFellas" was much better! And why is it that "epic" dramas always have to be so long? Have we become so programmed as a movie-watching society that we won't take your movie seriously unless it's two and a half hours long? In my opinion, there was way too much padding in this movie. It could easily have been cut down to less than two hours, and would have been vastly improved. I haven't seen "Infernal Affairs" so I won't comment on comparisons between the two, but I hope that the Academy doesn't think that remaking someone else's movie (even if it's well done) is worthy of an Oscar! I think that the "best of the best" should be original ideas (although I'm well aware of the fact that there are few "original" ideas left in Hollywood). That having been said, I thought "The Departed" was a good movie, but not great. I thought most of the performances were good, if not particularly memorable (although Alec Baldwin was hilarious!). I thought that for the most part, the principles pretty much play their parts about the same in most of their movies. And will Leonardo DiCaprio EVER look like he's older than sixteen!? On to the ending...from reading other postings, it sounds like it's a pretty straight redux of Infernal Affairs' ending, but I don't think a "gritty" crime drama should have the audience laughing with increasing volume as each character goes down with a shot to the head!
9.0~Best since Goodfellas... ajs-10 Sign in Permalink I have lost count of the number of times this film has been recommended to me. Consequently I bought the DVD some time ago but never got round to watching it until now. It is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film titled Infernal Affairs which was a big hit over there. It deals with crime and police corruption in Boston, and I must admit to those that recommended it to me, it's pretty damn good! More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters take big Joey for a ride while I write the next paragraph But don't let me catch you readin' it!!!). State Detective, Billy Costigan, is from the South side of town; he has no family to speak of and so is targeted by Cpt. Queenan and Staff Sgt. Dignam who run undercover operations. They persuade him to get in with crime boss, Frank Costello, who they suspect is selling technology to the Chinese, amongst many other crimes. Little do they know that Costello has an inside man on the police task force, Colin Sullivan. Now Sullivan is not able to get the name of the undercover operative in Costello's gang, but tips him off whenever the cops are getting near. After a while the cops become suspicious that Costello has an inside man amongst their ranks and start up an investigation to find out who the rat is. Cpt. Ellerby appoints Sullivan to lead the investigation. Add to this the fact that Costigan is slowly losing his mind the longer it goes on and has to see a police psychiatrist, Madolyn, who just happens to be Sullivan's girlfriend. With both sides slowly closing in on the insiders a tense and shocking climax is in the offing. I must say I really enjoyed this film up to a point. That point is the ending, I would have done it differently, but then who am I to argue with a man like Scorsese? A great script by William Monahan really brought out some great performances. First up I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon totally made me forget the Bourne films as Colin Sullivan and, of course, Jack Nicholson was great, as ever, as Frank Costello. Also on the role of honour are; Mark Wahlberg as Staff Sgt. Dignam and Martin Sheen as Cpt. Queenan. Honourable mentions go to; Ray Winstone as Mr. French (Costello's top henchman), Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, Anthony Anderson as Brown (a cop) and Alec Baldwin as Cpt. Ellerby. A really engrossing film with just enough twists and turns to keep the audience enthralled without confusing too much. A great script and some really great performances only add to the enjoyment factor. I've already said I have a slight problem with the ending, but it is still a tremendous film and one I don't hesitate to very highly recommend. My score: 9.3/10
1.0~Apparently, violence resolves all. ebender-4 Sign in Permalink What a disappointment! Just saw the DVD of this allegedly Best Movie of 2006 and am most disappointed. Virtually all conflicts and threads are resolved with bullets through the brain with concomitant spraying of blood. Nothing gets worked out intelligently. And there are just too many inconsistencies in terms of police procedures for any of this to be believable. And they have the audacity in one scene of the movie to have their cops dumping all over TV cops, who are generally far more believable IMHO. And is everyone so stupid that neither Damon or Di Caprio is recognized as a mole when there just aren't any other credible candidates? I contrast this 2006 film with the far-more-satisfying "Notes on a Scandal" in which the conflicts among the various characters are resolved through creative plot development; nary a pistol in site. I guess whoever said "violence is as American as cherry pie" wasn't very far off the mark at all.
9.0~"One of us had to die. With me, it tends to be the other guy. " G_a_l_i_n_a Sign in Permalink In "The Departed" (2006) directed by Martin Scorcese, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is young police officer who has been sent undercover to work for a vicious and powerful Boston mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was handpicked by Costello as a young boy and placed to the Police Academy with the intention to infiltrate later the Boston Police Department. One day, two young men will inevitably meet... "The Departed" is a very good film but sadly, it slows down in the final 20 or so minutes and leaves a viewer (yours truly) with several questions and slightly disappointed. Seems that Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello kept all parts of the movie together and after his departure, it became literally empty. As for directing, Martin Scorsese is in the top his form the movie is well paced, suspenseful, and has a great soundtrack (as usual in Scorsese movies). The cast is the closest to perfect it could be. As much as I like Jack Nicholson, it was nothing he has not done before (his Frank Costello is a combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep) but Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan played the best role of his career. About a year ago, I wrote about his acting in Scorcese's previous movie, "The Aviator", "Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction." I am very glad to admit that in "The Departed" he is even better - the hell Billy Costigan has lived in working undercover for the devilishly evil Frank Costello was absolutely real, suffocating and palpable. DiCaprio had many scenes with Nicholson and he never got lost next to his celebrated partner. Not as perfect as "Goodfellas" which comes to mind while watching "The Departed", the newest Scorcese's work is a lot of fun to watch - it is an inspiring film-making, and I believe that finally Scorsese will be recognized by the Academy for his directing.
7.0~The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film. TheMovieDiorama Sign in Permalink Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a "thriller" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims "harrrrrdest!". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative.
5.0~Would give an applause to it, if one never saw the Infernal Affairs before meibreezes Sign in Permalink OK, saw the movie actually 2 days ago, didn't get a chance to think about it. Now with a refreshed mind, here it goes: If one never saw the original "Infernal Affairs", you would fall in love with "The Departed" right away, after all it has an excellent plot. And with the legendary "Gangs" like Nicolson and Scorsese, we have every reason to have a high expectation. Unfortunately, this is not the case! The Bad: If I want to sum it up, I would say that was because of Scorsese's passion over brutal violence, it prevents him to reveal the true essence (as human beings) of the movie. 1. I really feel sorry for Martin Sheen, his character in the movie is so pale, he does not show the deep and close relationship (as in the Infernal Affairs between Tony Leung and Anthony Wong), nor there was any sign shows he was even a capable cop. So unfortunately, I found myself hardly could feel sorry for what happened to him. Having said that,Infernal Affair's Anthony Wong did a superb job to catch the essence of his character. 2. OK, how about Mark Wahlberg's role? The obviously increased lines for him did not charm him a bit. With his boss being killed, and him as the only one knows about DiCaprio's true identity, he actually took a paid leave?! What's up with that? Does it even make a logically reasonable sense?! All right, he took his action in the end, but 3. Does it have to be a two and half hours movie? There are so many unnecessary scenes to my opinion. Just name a simple one here: when Matt Damon went in talking to the bad guy pretending he is the lawyer. PLEASE! We audience are no fool, you don't need to show everything to us, all you need to do is send Damon to the room and start talking. We would figure out the guy's lawyer did not show up. Well, there are so many in the movie, what I am trying to say is if Scorsese wants us to keep thinking about what happens and what will happen next, you ought to do a consistent job! 4. The most of all, this movie pretty much follows what the Infernal Affairs had to offer, the biggest shock? The ENDING! I have to say I was confused right after I saw the movie, I thought maybe I was too dumb to figure out what it meant. BUT, the more I think about it, the more I got disappointed. The ending was so bad it can literally take all the credits it gets. Let's set Mr. Scorsese's beloved violence scenes aside, for me, I think the essence for the movie is: the "good" and the "bad" does not really have a clear line in between to judge from. Just like Nicolson said: "When I was your age, they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?" For that reason, I gave two thumbs up for Infernal Affairs' ending, sorry Scorsese, yours is just too lame! Also, I am not buying the cell phone communication throughout the movie, personally, I think the Morse code is a much better way! The Good: 1. Nicolson! To be honest, he is a perfect fit for this character. The only other possible candidate I can think of is Robert De Niro. Nicolson actually did a great job as Frank Costello. My only problem is I could hardly see Costello's foxy side. 2. The Shrink! OK, I have to say that is one shining point of the movie! Not like the original one assigned two female roles to the two leading actors, "The Departed" combines as one, which not only makes the character more standing out, but also adds another interesting twist to the story.
1.0~What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere! Faisal_Flamingo Sign in Permalink What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere! I'm not saying the movie is awful but it isn't great .. yeah, there's a big load of excitement but I think it is too big for the movie to handle it and most parts of the movie aren't even, it is an OK at its best .. Martin Scorsese did cast a bunch of Hollywood's class "A" Actors and he was relying on the good performances that they could give to empower the movie but unfortunately they all were So-So except for Mark Whalberg who gave an OK performance but his little role didn't give him a chance to do any better .. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was bad & disappointing .. so is Matt Damon. Nicholson's performance is OK but not at his best. What I miss in that movie is the depth .. I feel like if it is a cheap thriller movie with a great excitement but it makes no sense sometimes. I felt that the movie is disconnected and not very solid!!! When you read most of the reviews that praising the movie .. you feel that it is the movie of the millennium or of the year .. but actually The Departed goes nowhere .. it was going to be an OK thriller that you watch and forget about it the next day until the horrible ending blew up all the "OK" work . Martin Scorsese did a great job on cinematography but he didn't give a depth to his exciting story. I'm a big fan of Scorsese's .. Martin Scorsese has directed great movies that we loved such; After Hours, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas .. I wouldn't call "The Departed" one of his best .. probably his worst. I'm not comparing the moving with any movies .. I even haven't seen "Infernal Affairs". It is an exciting thriller .. you will enjoy it but by the ending you will feel that you are lost in the middle of nowhere because of the lacking of the necessary minimum depth and it was just a stupid ending. I highly doubt that the movie will receive any big nominations at the Oscars or any other big film awards. That's what Hollywood dose to a movie! .. it makes it only "pretty" pointless picture! Overall, it isn't a bad movie .. it is enjoyable most of the time .. watch it without high expectations and you will save the big disappointment.
7.0~Jack is great but the Original is MUCH BETTER kongwong Sign in Permalink Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original "Infernal Affairs" was compare to "The Departed." The Departed had wasted its cast power, failed to fully develop the characters, failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover, didn't make enough of a point in betrayal, and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess' trade mark violence and sex. I didn't feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn't help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy's inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was. I couldn't feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn't sign up because he chose to, he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof, Leonardo wasn't feeling the loss of his only life-line to the world, there was still Mark, he wasn't feeling the loss of a trusted friend, there was no friendship, he wasn't feeling the loss of a fatherly figure, and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder. Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted, too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but "Mr. French" to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack's character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in "The Departed" and his brilliance was wasted. (The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off.) Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers, nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead, we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg's existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original, logically he didn't have to do it alone. "The Departed" is a good movie if only it wasn't a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same, Infernal Affair was a much better movie. Watch the original if you haven't seen it, and see the difference in camera work and characters.
8.0~Great! Antagonisten Sign in Permalink Scorsese is one of my favorite directors, at least he has certainly made a few of my favorite movies. And seeing how he keeps the quality of his work so constantly high is astonishing. And not only that, i would rate this as his finest movie this decade. While i did enjoy "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator" (both are fine movies in my opinion) this is still a lot closer to the masterpieces of Scorseses previous career. I have always considered the American way of taking foreign movies and making a new version rather silly. I don't know whether they do it because they can't stand reading subtitles or if there are other reasons. Generally the new versions are also inferior which makes it an even less understandable practice. Here though we have the opposite. While i feel that "Infernal Affairs" is certainly an interesting movie, and a quality film to boot, i still feel that "The Departed" is a vast improvement. What i was perhaps most impressed by when i watched this movie was the way that Scorsese brought the best out of the entire ensemble. Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg are far from my favorite actors but they are all as good as i have seen them here. Damon usually has something stiff and almost detached about him that i don't like, but here he seems a lot more relaxed and really flows into his character. Jack Nicholson on the other hand is one of my favorites, and he is absolutely magnificent in "The Departed". He makes one of those appearances where he just dominates every scene that he's in, and unlike many other great actors who have been in the game for a long time, he never seems to relax and turn on the autopilot. Of course in a thriller the story has to be interesting too, a great ensemble is not enough. And i think that "The Departed" delivers there as well. While it is perhaps maybe 20 minutes longer than i would have liked, it never becomes painfully so. A few twists along the way are also bound to keep most people guessing. After watching "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator" i felt afraid that Scorsese might never reach the peaks of his earlier career, and therefore would never receive the Oscar that should have been his a long time ago. But "The Departed" gives me hope since this is yet another memorable and simply great movie. Very recommended! 8/10.
9.0~Brilliant Movie_Buff_Brad Sign in Permalink Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected. The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too. Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time. The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations. See this as soon as you can.
9.0~This is the Martin Scorsese I missed for such a long time. Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink Let's face it, Martin Scorsese has made some good movies the past few years but nothing too brilliant or remarkable, at least not compared to his more early work from the '70's, '80's and early '90's. The last real brilliant Scorsese was in my opinion the remake "Cape Fear", which dates back from 1991. But "The Departed" is really again a movie that deserves to be on the long list of brilliant Martin Scorsese movies. From the opening sequence on it's obvious; this is a typical Scorsese movie. For this movie he went back to the genre were he already was successful with in the past; the gangster-movies. It's a nice touch for a change that the movie is set in present time. After all, why should the best gangster-movies always take place in the past? "The Departed" is a greatly told and constructed modern crime movie about an infiltrator in the state police and an infiltrator in a crime syndicate who have to hunt each other down. It's a movie that provides the movie with some thrills, unexpected twists (especially toward the ending) and some great confrontations between different characters. The story on its self is already quite good (Just loose the love-story next times. It adds nothing to the characters or story.) and interesting but it's made all the more great by the way it is told. Not only kudos to Scorsese's directing for that but also most definitely for the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, with lots of good quick flash-forwards and other tricks. All I can say is that she really deserved her Oscar for this movie. It really helps to tell the story and give the movie a look and identity of its own. The movie its cast doesn't seem like the most likely won but it works out perfect in the movie. I think a lot of people were screaming for Robert De Niro but also Jack Nicholson is perfectly believable and just great as a gangster-boss. Mark Wahlberg was great as a bastard-cop and Alec Baldwin as a nice cop. The other way around would seem more logical but they work out surprisingly well in their roles. It was good to see Matt Damon in a more villainous and tougher role for a change, mostly because it shows how great as an actor he actually is. Leonardo DiCaprio also shows once more that he is more than just another pretty face. It's not a movie that relies on its action but more on its characters and story. The movie is exciting, tense and spectacular regardless of that it hasn't a lot of action in it. Of course this isn't Scorsese's best (which really says something about the extremely high qualities of this man), so is it fair that he finally won his Oscar for this movie? I mean after all, if this movie won, then should had movies such as "Heat", "Training Day" and so on. As a matter of fact it is of course true that if this movie was completely the same but had another director's name attached to it this movie would probably not had been nominated at all. It's just not the Oscar-type of movie but alas, I'm glad that Scorsese finally has an Oscar now, only just 3 decades too late. 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
6.0~The Ending. . . Mitch_Janzen Sign in Permalink Let me preface this post by saying that I LOVED the movie. Loved it until the last 15 minutes. Don't get me wrong, i'm not complaining that the hero died, or anything along those lines. I'm usually a big fan of the surprise shock ending, and I hate the way Hollywood films tend to follow an established norm... But to me the ending just felt rushed. Did they run out of time!? "Damn it! We have 10 minutes to go... lets just introduce a new character, have him shoot Dicaprio and blah blah blah kill everyone" It just didn't work for me... And the final shot with the rat? Pure cinematographic masturbation. Seriously! We get it, you want to be deep guys, don't be such cop outs! The story is left hanging and all we get are corpses. I felt bad... people literally giggled at the shallow attempt at metaphor. *sigh* ALSO! This movie had more false endings than the last LOTR. If i'd have left after the first ending, i'd have been much happier with the film as a whole. I'd have been much happier if the story wasn't resolved at ALL and the film ended after Dicaprio ran off. Oh well... can't win em all I suppose. The acting was brilliant, the directing was brilliant, the cinematography was brilliant... the ending was a huge let down.
10.0~Never Trust Anyone ScarletSwimmer Sign in Permalink I had been dying to see the Departed ever since I had first seen the trailer. After seeing what I high rating it got on here, I wanted to see it even more. And when I finally saw it, well let's just say I wasn't disappointed. Leonardo Dicaprio gave an absolute brilliant performance, and though I wasn't a big fan, I now have a new found respect for his acting skills. The entire movie keeps you waiting and wondering, nervously biting your fingernails. It's very nerve racking, wondering which one is going to be caught. A single slip is the end. Any character could betray another one at any moment. You have no clue who works for who until the very end. And let's just say it doesn't end pretty. 10/10, a must-see.
3.0~Just didn't get it crendine Sign in Permalink Quite frankly, it took me a few viewings to figure this one out. This movie seemed a bit too long and contained several unnecessary characters and events. Mark Wahlberg's character, in particular , just seemed way over the top and was just plain annoying. I still haven't figured out why this character is even included in this story. As for the other performances, Nicholson seems a bit out of place in this one and Martin Sheen is a little too low-key. I must agree with other reviewers that state that this movie contains way too much information, plot twists, and should have been a lot shorter. I have yet to see the original "Internal Affairs" but will now seek it out and compare the two. Again, I agree with other reviewers that I just didn't see what the big deal was about this movie. This was not one of Scorsese's best as far as I'm concerned.
4.0~F for the Departed harborrat28 Sign in Permalink The day long movie, The Departed (it was a mere 2-1/2 hours but seemed like a day), is one of a very few movies I've found valueless. It is difficult to comprehend what the critics and the Motion Picture Academy are thinking in their various homages to this. I guess Scorsese is the magic word. The last shot in the movie, a rat toodling along the balcony of the corrupt Colin Sullivan's (Matt Damon) luxury apartment in downtown Boston (the luxury apartment that no honest cop in the Special Investigations Unit realizes that Sullivan is living in on his $30,000 plus salary?) is emblematic of the ham-handed approach of the movie's makers. There are probably a dozen missteps by Sullivan that would have raised the curiosity of colleagues with an IQ higher than that of my cats but, hey, we know cops are dumb. The Departed was totally lacking in finesse or intelligence and pandered to a crowd that has no trouble believing that all cops are either stupid or corrupt (or both); that undercover cops wherever they are are permitted to engage is every sort of violent, brutal and destructive act short of intentional murder by their handlers and that Baghdad-like firefights on the streets of major American cities and blood gurgling (or spurting) out of people's mouths or spattered on the walls and floors are realistic. The approach of the movie was actually insulting to the audience (and, by the way, to black officers, making the nice black officer from the training cadre one of the principal mechanisms of the hero's undoing). Lest we fail to respect and empathize sufficiently with Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), the incorruptible head of SIU, Scorsese takes Billy Costigan/DiCaprio (and us) into his home and has Queenan talk about his wonderful wife and son at college. Any suspense about whether Queenan would be among those left standing at the end of the film was instantly dispelled. I immediately ordered a wreath for his grave. The movie was a waste of a great collection of actors. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but he was OK in the ridiculous role he was asked to play, although I don't consider lip-pursing acting. Mark Wahlberg, as Sgt. Dignam, a foul-mouthed but fiercely honest cop with good street instincts was about the best of the lot. And, in the end, the directors turn him into a cold-blooded murderer. Jack Nicholson was Jack Nicholson, which is OK. I suppose there are mobsters capable of clever one liners somewhere. The opera reverie scene in which he has a fantasy (?) of tossing cocaine into the air like fairy dust over two of his bimbos was, like the balcony rat at the end, insultingly gross. I wonder what this movie could have been if it had been written and directed by people with intelligence, finesse and reserve.
10.0~Masterpiece! nickfonehome Sign in Permalink I don't get it... How did Martin Scorsese manage to make this movie so great? Well, more or less, everything was at least close to perfect. Somehow, Scorsese figured out a way to combine violence and humor in a way that is anything but cheesy. And that's only one of the incredible accomplishments of The Departed. Above all else, the characters are so well developed and so likable that even if the plot was awful, I'd still watch this movie. You're looking at a diverse set of characters, who all have some little thing about them that makes it impossible not to find them interesting. I couldn't believe it! And then, you have the plot. Just what you might expect, there are a good many peaks and troughs of action in this movie. But the whole time you're wondering how it's going to end, which makes it possible to avoid the ever-so-cheesy extreme plot twist, while still keeping the audience guessing. And as complex this movie is, everything comes to its neat little conclusion at the end, and there isn't a single question that hasn't been left open beyond necessity. Well done, Scorsese!
4.0~Extreme Disappointment fbably Sign in Permalink I can only say one thing, with this all star line up including the director I expected to be overwhelmed. I wasn't. The movie is below average in every sense. This movie without, mainly, Nicholson and the rest of the line up would have been a terrible waste of time. The story is fully depreciated and the ending is just trying to put a spin on things. Of course the direction is outstanding but Scorsese is whipping a dying horse. This is definitely not the movie I expected. It is not even entertaining to say the least.
1.0~I want my $10 back amaro72 Sign in Permalink Perfectly horrible. Weak storyline, choppy, and powerless. This might be Scorsese's worst work. Shallow doesn't begin to describe this movie. Unfortunately, shooting people in the head and saying the F-word don't make up for storyline. The acting is actually decent for the most part - minus Leo Decap and the lead female - but they've got nothing to work with. The suspension of disbelief is lost about and hour in. By the way - for once can someone (besides Matt Damon, Mark Walberg - both from Boston) do a decent Boston accent??? I don't know WHAT accent Leo Decap was doing. Also, one of least inspiring leading ladies of any movie, EVER. If the lead actress can't act, can't she at LEAST be good looking? Short Version - Save your money!
10.0~I was amazed!!! HannahJane Sign in Permalink I think this movie is wonderful. It gives you info about a time you do not need to know, but is still real and important in an interesting way. I am Irish so I had a special passion for this film, but even if you are not you get sucked in. The acting is amazing. It is like a wonderful ice cream treat on a hot day and the cast is the cherry on top! This is a fascinating tale of two men who are doing the same thing just Leo Dicaprio is on the good side pretending to be bad and Matt Damond is a bad guy pretending to be good. This is Jack Nicholson's best work EVER!!! My favorite line is " When you grow up people tell you you can be cops or criminals, what I am saying to you now is when you are facing a loaded gun what is the difference?"
7.0~"Who let this IRA motherf!cker in my bar" rjones611 Sign in Permalink I applaude these excellent performances from DiCaprio and Nicholson. Intense realism and major unpredictability. I'm not going to say it exceeded my expectations but I will say it come right up to the margin. The characters were well developed, the dialogue was believable and well said. The overall story was mediocre however some of the parts for example the unexpected elevator shooting made me go "WTF" didn't see that coming. At that moment I knew this was a Scorsese film before even checking to see who directed it. I'm giving this film a seven although I will agree that it is very important and impressive but it didn't entertain as much as Scorsese's and DiCaprio's other great films.
4.0~What a mess matthew-male Sign in Permalink Oh dear, it's Scorsese does Tarantino with some Goodfellas thrown into the mix (even down to using the Human Beanz - Nobody But Me for a fight in a shop). The first third of the film is excellent, despite the constant sound of the Rolling Stones - Gimme Shelter every five minutes, but then it goes downhill fast. The basic premise of a cop infiltrating the Irish mob and a mobster infiltrating the cops is good, but soon so many other things are thrown into the plot it becomes a farce. Why make Costello am FBI informer? Pointless, other than maybe to give Matt Damon a reason to kill him, although it would have been a thousand times more interesting if Damon's reason was Nicholson's dismissive treatment of him since a teenager. Why did Matt Damon's character have so much power to do as he liked in the force after only joining a few months back, able even to call a surveillance of Sheen police chief? Stupid. How come Damon didn't figure out immediately that Dicaprio's character used his phone at the meet with the Chinese? He knew the whole of Nicholson's crew apart from Costigan, but Scorsese just needed to drag the film out for another hour. Why was Baldwin's character camping it up like a pantomime dame all over the screen? The acting from Baldwin was so bad it made me think he was play acting for Damon's character and actually new he was a mole, but he didn't, Baldwin just can't act. The mess of shootings at the ending wasn't a twist either it was very dull 'ho hum' and 'so what' and i had lost interest half an hour earlier when Nicholson exited the film. After the first hour this film is silly, contrived and with no clever plot twists at all but just pointless adding of layer on layer of meaningless guff. If someone tells you this is an intricate and well plotted film, don't believe them, point them in the direction of The Usual Suspects.
8.0~The Question, Part 1 jpschapira Sign in Permalink Remember when I said "Match Point" moved fast? Well, "The Departed" moves faster; so much faster that the name of the film appears after the movie has begun developing the plot and it would have been the same if it appeared at anytime. Characters speak without pauses, throwing intelligent lines from time to time; the music is too loud and it never seems to stop. Every time I paid attention the loud music was in the back; as if the montage of the first scene was still running. It's fine, but I was thinking about the beginning of "Goodfellas" and how much I loved the speech he gives; gentle and slowPaused. Here, Jack Nicholson gives a wonderful opening speech but it goes so fast that if you close your eyes you miss its essence. The same goes for some talks between Vera Farmiga and Leonardo DiCaprio and between Matt Damon and Alec Baldwin that lie between the best little scenes of the movie. I didn't watch the original piece in which William Monahan based his script, but Monahan still doesn't convince me. There's a lack of seriousness to his work and he'll get an Oscar for it. However, when his "Kingdom of Heaven" was short of words, this screenplay has words to spare. I probably miss the days of "Taxi Driver", when Bob drove through the streets and there was no need for words to express his feelings. Here we encounter the great Martin Scorsese in a rush, as his movie of course. The pictures of Scorsese I've watched made me understand he was a calm and observing director, with a lot of messages to give in each film and a lot of importance to give to the screenplay. "The Departed" doesn't instantly find messages, but the screenplay rushes; and Scorsese doesn't stay behind. With his ability, Marty followed his characters rapidly, moving constantly his camera; whether in a chase scene or in a chat inside of an office where the close ups are instantaneous and the frames show a character by the second. In addition, he still found the time of creating new and interesting filming shots that go along with the film's rhythm. That "The Departed" is far from being Scorsese's best picture is a fact; but it's probably the best he's done this decade. And that's enough to get him an Oscar before he starts desperately trying for one and goes back to make films without a burden or a personal pressure; because he won't give up the crusade for an award he simply deserves. As I said, a part of me wants the old Bob back, but as the years go by, Leo is kind of growing on me. I mean, he'll never be my favorite actor or anything similar; but his performance is the finest of "The Departed" cast. I look back at his retarded kid in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and I think to myself that when DiCaprio isn't on the main focus (because it's where he's always been), he can hand in some great portrayals. And what an ensemble! I mean, Scorsese can get big names that are among the biggest talents. Don't even mention Jack Nicholson, who's not in the run for the big awards because we are rewarded when we watch him on screen; it's his present to us. Mark Wahblberg, an actor I've always liked, could have gotten recognition for a couple of films where he outshined the leads some time ago; but is perfect here in a role that was definitely for an older person. If we say older persons we find the fabulous portrayal of Ray Winstone and two underrated performances of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin (what a year he had). What was even more underrated was Matt Damon's incredible turn as Collin Sullivan, the second in line after DiCpario's performance in the movie and easily his best labor since "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Is anyone sure if Vera Farmiga has nothing to do with the Arquette family? She looks a lot likeAnyway, she's a good actress. I refuse to talk about Anthony Anderson, but the question remains: "Is 'The Departed' the Best Picture Oscar of the year?".
2.0~A Farce at Best chicomello Sign in Permalink ****SPOILER*****To any and all that take this film seriously, you are not in on the joke. At its best, The Departed is top of the line farce. At its worst, the film is a train wreck wherein all actors of quality intentionally subvert the director and the film with farcical performances that, though a delight to watch, must have been inspired by the sheer boredom of working with a lead actor embarrassingly limited in ability, DiCaprio, and a director too far gone to realize that his film was only his at its worst moments. This is not to say that this film is dreadful to watch. The performances of Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin, were spectacular, but, then again, they almost always are. It is no trick of Scorsese that such professionals as listed made the most of savagely poor dialog. The fire they project is a necessary distraction from lines that simply don't hold up and pacing that makes little sense. Take for instance Sheen's character being thrown from the building. First, there is no reason within the logic of the film's world for his character to stay behind. He knows these people will kill him, and, obviously, if there is enough time for Leo to get away, why couldn't he follow. Second, he makes no attempt to hide in a room filled with clutter. Third, after he is killed, his character is thrown from a building in broad daylight. Let us not forget that he is a known police officer and that to be thrown from the building his murders must be inside it. So the question arises, why throw him from the building? Certainly not to speed the killers' escape, nor to ensure it. Certainly not to send a message, death in this film is the only message and how you get there is of little importance. The only logical reason is to confront Leo's character with the man's murder. This is the hand of the director and a clumsy hand it is. Such insultingly obvious moves make up the bulk of this film. If we take them as farcical, then there is a certain meta-humor to them. If they are not, and I believe this to be the case, then it is simply poor film making, and this, despite the best attempts of good actors, is a poor film. Don't believe me, take a look at the scenes between Leo and the artless Vera Farmiga, which are some of the most forced, unconvincing "love" scenes I have ever seen. True these are the two most amateurish actors in the cast, but then again with such actors we see the director at play, as he must craft every scene for them. In this case, his crafting equates to little more than depicting animal arousal, which, with Leo in the scene, is not convincing to say the least. Not convincing is, I believe the mantra of this movie, just as the cleverly placed allusion to Leo's two accents is not a convincing mask for the fact that he could not maintain a convincing southie accent for even the most highly edited of scenes. Equally unconvincing is Leo's placing of the girlhood picture of Farmiga on her wall as supposedly indicative of his utter understanding of her. It is again nothing more than the heavy handedness of a director whose loss of subtlety is equal to his rise in obsession for an actor who cannot act. That said, enjoy this film for the thoughtless, mindless fun of watching its many good actors have a good time. Do not enjoy it as a pinnacle of film making or for Leo and Farmiga. If it wins an Oscar, then you will know exactly what those awards are worth.
10.0~Better see it before you hear about it krazykidd666 Sign in Permalink Warning: Don't watch any interviews on TV or listen to them on the radio about this movie or from the cast. In fact, watch it now,on it's opening weekend to stay ahead of the buzz. The ending to this movie is so surprising, it's bound to be the talk of the town. It was an amazing movie, but if you hear the ending before you see it, the shock'll be significantly less, although no matter what, you can't ruin this movie. All those phrases you hear when you watch a movie trailer, "Gripping..." "Breath-taking...", totally apply to this movie. See it. Love it. Enjoy it. And don't go talking through the whole thing, this is a movie your gonna want to remember. I'm ready to see it again, honestly.
4.0~I beg your pardon? animalmother05 Sign in Permalink I am shocked at the number of reviews that exist that praise this film to no end, and that call it Scorsese's best film since "Goodfellas." "The Departed" is far from a bad film; it is, in fact, a decent one, but it is still very disappointing, and the only part of "Goodfellas" it resembles at all is that film's last segment, starting at 6:55 AM on May 11 of 1980, after which it loses track of everything that made it one of Scorsese's best film. The film consists primarily of extremely short takes sloppily edited together which are theoretically meant to jar the spectators, but in fact only prohibit the narrative from moving effectively. There is nothing theoretically wrong with short takes; Sergei Eisenstein made very powerful films with shorter Average Shot Lengths than "The Departed" ever dreamed of having, but his films were conceived as juxtapositions of shots, whereas in "The Departed," as in most modern films that use this technique, the shots only interrupt each other. Eisenstein's films were great, and revolutionary, because he used editing to create sequences of shots to develop his ideas; Scorsese's greatest films tend to have longer average shot lengths because he expresses his ideas in a single shot rather than a sequence of them. In "The Departed" he has not decided to express himself with sequences of shots rather than single shots, he has merely made the shots shorter and thus hindered the expression of his ideas in the film. Moreover, there are serious narrative flaws in the film. Jack Nicholson gives an outstanding performance as a once great (if a little eccentric) mob boss who has become paranoid near the end of his life and becomes self-destructive. He is hilarious for much of the film, but at times, particularly near the end, he truly becomes terrifying. This is all quite good, but the film is not about him; it is about Billy and Colin. It perhaps would have been better to have made a completely separate film about Frank Costello, since he is given either too much or too little attention in "The Departed." The same could be said about Alec Baldwin's and Marky Mark's characters; they need either to be given more major roles that relate more directly to the thematic elements of the film, or to be removed entirely. At times, it seems as if Scorsese were so intent on having an Outstanding Ensemble Cast and in the process forgot about his main characters. It would seem to me, from the film's mere plot, that a major idea with which "The Departed" could play is that Billy and Colin are mirror images of each other. The film should be an exploration with the nature of identity, and though it obviously would tie in most directly with these two characters, it should also apply more subtly to the other characters in the film. However, Colin (Matt Damon's character) does not come across as in interesting character suffering from inner conflict; he is simply a jerk. Before Marky Mark's character shoots him at the end, he says "okay." The line should be delivered with a sense of self- hatred that has developed after Colin's conscience begins to attack him for the damage that he has wreaked on all the people from both of his lives; instead, he sounds merely bored. Billy is significantly more interesting than Colin (though I give more credit to Leonardo DiCaprio than to the screenwriters for this), but could still use more work. Damon's performance does not stand out, DiCaprio's reminds us that he is perhaps the most talented actor of his generation in Hollywood, though the film, lamentably, does not make as much use of these talents as "The Aviator" did. The film particularly seems to fall apart after Frank Costello dies. It would make sense for Colin to become indecisive and confused after such an event, since his mafia loyalties were to Frank alone, but it instead seems as if the screenwriters were the confused and indecisive ones. Moreover, having all the major characters (except Baldwin and Marky Mark) die was not the proper ending for the film; it seems dull, predictable, and superficial to the extent that, when Colin says "Okay" before getting shot, I could empathize with his boredom.
8.0~cat and mouse ezioashwin Sign in Permalink There are lots of things I didn't like about this movie, namely the entire cat-and- mouse plot line. How could neither Billy Costigan nor Collin Sullivan nor anyone else not figure out that those two are the double agents? It seemed pretty common knowledge that Collin grew up under the wing of Frank Costello and that bad things keeps happening after Billy joins Costello's mob. Is Costello really that trustworthy and critical a thinker to believe correlation doesn't equal causation? The alliterative names are also confusing. I'm not a fan of early-aughts Marty or Leo, but Leo isn't bad in this role. Matt Damon's face and voice are too boring to play a villain, Martin Sheen's character is pretty thankless and dies easily, and Marky Mark's character is just a rod for the sake of being a rod - hardly enough meat to develop an Oscar- worthy performance. The only female character is just there to form a slapdash love triangle, and the script doesn't even write her as a realistic psychologist
9.0~What All-Star Casts are Made For Screen_O_Genic Sign in Permalink Two cops from opposite sides of the law unknowingly get into a duel matching wits and dealing with the twists and turns of fate in this standout movie of the grey area that thinly separates crime from the law. The stars aligned for this memorable take on the cop genre and what stars and how they deliver! Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin shine in this added gem to Martin Scorsese's directorial crown. Enhanced by a gritty and humorous script this is one flick you'll never forget. A blockbuster upon release and winner of multiple awards this fave of both critics and the public is one of the few instances where artistic and commercial success are both well deserved.
6.0~Somebody fell asleep at the helm mrjrd869 Sign in Permalink Let me first clarify: This movie was FANTASTIC...until the last 10 minutes or so. I scanned comments and failed to see anything negative about this movie except for the comparisons to another I never heard of, so reader beware...if you watched this movie and missed what I'm about to point out, well...read on for yourself. Everything was going great until the scene in which Sullivan (Damon) goes to delete Costigan's (DiCaprio) file. So OK...I may be more tech-knowledgeable than some...allow me to elaborate: It is not possible to just 'delete' a file from a database computer. (I am oversimplifying only for the sake of keeping this short) We can assume the movie is set in the present, given the technology displayed. In my opinion, this was a horrible mistake, besides even the fact that Sullivan is sloppily using a computer with his back to a glass wall. But is is only the beginning. When Sullivan goes to 'delete' the file, he is committing himself to getting rid of Costigan. Sullivan's character has, to date, been portrayed as intelligent, yet he fails to react and seek to eliminate Costigan. Even worse, he fails to see the threat that Dignam poses once Costigan's file is deleted. The film 'could' have taken a great turn here, but the writers and Scorcese fail to deliver. Instead, they now cast Sullivan as an idiot who then goes to a meeting with Costigan ALONE and unprepared. Next, he eliminates Costello's other inside man (ostensibly with the intent of protecting himself from exposure) and fails to recognize (again) the threat that Dignam poses. Not to be outdone, Scorcese goes on to allow Costigan to be 'outed' as a Trooper for his decorated burial, but fails to account for HOW anybody knew he was anything but a has-been (remember, his file was 'deleted'). There were other anomalies, such as with the envelope, the baby and the CD. I would object to this movie getting any awards...it was finished very sloppily with poor attention to important detail. Unless, of course, a movie could be nominated for only 90% of it... But didn't somebody once say 'the ending is everything'?
8.0~Divided Loyalties, Compromised Choices. Joseph_Gillis Sign in Permalink Plot Outline: A police plant tries to infiltrate a Boston gang-lord's crime empire, while the gang-lord's police mole tries to expose him. Talk about the proverbial 'film of two halves'!! Martin Scorsese's latest film "The Departed" is his loose re-working/ trans-location of the acclaimed Hong Kong thriller, "Infernal Affairs", which spawned two sequels, one of which was, effectively, a 'prequel'. When I saw the earlier film on the festival circuit some three years ago, I was bowled over, even more than I had been by John Woo's kinetic thriller, "Hard-Boiled" from some 10 years earlier. What made "Infernal Affairs" so special, besides the technical excellence of the production and the fast-paced, high-octane action, was its emphasis on characterisations: particularly in what I regarded as the key, indeed the only players of any necessary substance: Tony Leung as the police plant, and Andy Lau, as the crime-lord's mole. The problem with Martin Scorsese's 're-working', and, while I recognise that he is at liberty to expand the narrative to broaden the supporting characterisations, is the way he allows himself to be compromised by the star turns and the 'alternate agendas'. So, and in what I refer to as the first 'half' we get too much of: Jack Nicholson, (whose HK equivalent was, at best, a two-dimensional peripheral character), revelling in an excessive quota of 'Jack-isms': think 'The Shining'; "Batman", etc, etc. Alec Baldwin, in his latest incarnation of his 'Glengarry Glenn Ross'/'The Cooler' hard-man, seemingly revelling in his ever-expanding waistline; Leonardo Di Caprio, who had to be given plenty of opportunity to emote, his 'Aviator' Oscar play having fallen short. while Ray Winstone gets to drop the Cockney hard-man stunt in favour of its Bostonian equivalent. Then, just when I was about to doze off, having realised too late just why Martin Scorsese needed 140 minutes to tell his story, he cranked the gears up a few notches. Matt Damon's gang-lord's police mole realises he's got to move fast before Di Caprio's good guy undercover cop brings his (Damon's) employer's empire crashing down and, in a daring move, orders a police tail on the head of the police undercover unit, thus hoping to flush out Di Caprio: the resultant 10 minutes or so of breakneck, white-knuckle tension, even if it does rely too much on the original and 'The French Connection' for inspiration, is almost worth the price of admission alone,culminating as it does in a tragic death which ultimately precipitates a breakneck pace of cross and double-cross. This is where Scorsese really comes into his own, with the kind of frenetic, yet sure-paced action sequences not seen since the heyday of "Goodfellas". Pausing briefly to swiftly despatch Nicholson's crime-lord, (which couldn't have come too soon, in my opinion), he constantly keeps us guessing as to the next twist and turn of the tail, and which of the 'double agents' will eventually prevail, and at what cost. A 'film of two halves', indeed, and while the second 'half', of perhaps 50 minutes or so, probably contains more cinematic merit than most Hollywood productions of at least the past 5 years, ultimately this has to be seen as a missed opportunity for Scorsese. As with 'The Aviator', Scorsese seems these days to be compromised too much in his artistic 'vision', to such an extent that I don't believe that this is 100% the film he wanted to make. 'The Aviator' seemed to me partly an Oscar vehicle for Di Caprio's (admittedly fine) acting, and part Scorsese 'Citizen Kane' homage: granted it was, after all, a Di Caprio vehicle. Here, once again, it appears to me that far too much screen time is devoted to 'Jack-isms', and more (unconvincing) brooding Di Caprio 'emoting'. As if, 'the Aviator' pitch having failed, they'd make sure of it this time. The trouble is, while Di Caprio is certainly a fine actor, who, I believe has yet to achieve his peak, more often than not he's trying too hard in this film in what is an underwritten role, lumbered with often puerile dialogue. And, where acting is concerned, don't get me started on Alec Baldwin, (whose acting capabilities seem to decline in inverse proportion to his waistline), or to Mark Wahlberg's cardboard-cutout undercover sergeant 'character'. Matt Damon, who doesn't try too hard, almost reaches what for me was his peak of 'The Talented Mr Ripley' But it was good to see Ray Winstone doing a 'foreign' accent, for a change. Once again, Scorsese's choice of music was impeccable: And I so loved his apt placement of Roy Buchanan's sublime, bluesy guitar rendition of Patsy Cline's "Sweet Dreams". Would that all of Scorsese's moves had been as sure.
7.0~Good, but could have been great. . . chicknbuff Sign in Permalink This movie had almost all the elements of a really, really, great film. The acting was absolutely superb. The direction and cinematography were excellent. The music was well chosen and orchestrated. Most importantly, however, the story had a bit too many holes and questions. I found myself too many times during the movie -- and in processing it later -- not making any sense out of some parts and happenings. I don't want to give anything away, but for all of those who tout this as Scorcese's best work (not by a long shot - perhaps could have been, though), go back and think about the last 20-30 minutes and see if you think it all makes sense. For a two and a half hour movie they certainly wrapped it up all nice and neatly in a pretty short period of time. Oh, and the last minute and a half is possibly the worst part of all. BUT, all of that aside, it's a great ride and perfectly acted by Damon, Nicholson and especially DiCaprio. Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Personally, I think Marky-Mark is a bit annoying and over the top, but he's OK. See it. Be entertained by it. But stop there.
4.0~And the audience laughed ... wmjahn Sign in Permalink Well, I went to the cinema yesterday evening to give Marin SCORSESEs new so-called "masterpeiece " a viewing and there are indeed a couple of positive things one can say about this movie: 1.) It could have been a really nice little mean & dirty B-movie (the storyline is indeed great and would have made fantastic B-movie material), but it was not to be. 2.) DiCAPRIO does indeed give an outstanding performance, much better than I had expected. 3.) It's a nice time-killer and certainly watchable 4.) There's one really terrific scene very much at the beginning, when DiCAPRIO beats up two molesters in a small deli. This scene has a raw quality and utterly believable eruption of violence, which is unmatched in the later scenes of the movie. That said, there are unfortunately so many (needless!) implausibilities, logical impossibilities and story-holes, that the movie as a whole is unfortunately a far cry from the "masterpiece" it has been called by some critics. In fact Scorsese seems to be out of sync with his material fro a few years already and has not achieved any major artistic achievement since the days he has made such great movies as RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE. Personally I consider this a pity and can actually not imagine Scorsese has not himself realized the above mentioned and down below discussed shortcoming, which are: 1.) The major implausibility or even logical impossibility is Mark DAMON walking in some high-$$$ fancy apartment - as a young policeman - and either renting or buying this (I think more renting). He simply could not afford this with the average or below-average income he is supposed to have. Looked at critically by the guy, who would rent it to him, he utters some line that somebody would guarantee for his payments, but at that time of the movie, the only rich person he's connected with is the molester played (over.played, unfortunately) by Nicholson. As the story progresses and the police has realized that they have a traitor in their own lines, all people are checked in detail, but obviously nobody takes any notice of the question, how DAMON can afford this style of living (even now equipped with an average-wage-earner girlfriend). Come one, that's not a minor implausibility, given the fact that everybody's lives are checked so much in detail!! And it's completely useless! There's no need for the story to have DAMON live in such an expensive apartment. he could have easily rented a small affordable one and the following story would have developed the same. 2.) Now I am certainly no moralist, when it comes to foul language, but with foul language you have the same problem as with exceeding violence. With more and more of the same, it does not only get redundant, but it also wears thin, get's implausible and even ridiculous. Already at one of the very first scenes with DAMON he calls other footballs players some (here) unprintable words. He does not call them that once, but he calls them that some 4 or 5 times, speaking as fats as a machine-gun and already after that scene you ask yourself, if the guy is really in control of himself (which he'd certainly need to be, with that story to follow). The whole picture goes on like that, every 10th to 15th word is ****(in), ****(in), **** sucker and whatever else. Everybody (!) seems to talk that way, the low mobsters, the high mobsters, the low and the high policeman, only the few women are an exception. Now, is that believable that really EVERYBODY shouts obscene words in every fitting and unfitting scene? I very much doubt this and less would certainly have been more and more impressive. A needless waste of credibility again. (I do have an explanation for that nevertheless: SCORSESE wants to show us - the audience - how similar the good and the bad guys are ... well, an old story and not the right way to tell us that, I'd say). 3.) NICHOLOSON is usually good when playing a mobster. And that's how he starts. He does look sinister, does some SHINING-faces, does a lot of wise-cracking and the movie strolls on. As time progresses, Nicoloson seems to get out of sync with his role. He does some wisecracking, he makes faces, utters lines here, utters lines there and that how it goes on until a real low-point, when NICHOLSON does some wise-cracking and makes the face of a rat. For the first time people laughed in the audience, but it wasn't the laugh of apprehension, it was that of disbelieve and I'd say SCORSESE would not have cherished theses laughs. As the movie progresses NIOCHOLSON becomes more and more unbelievable in his role as a hard-boiled mobster. Wise-cracking once in a while is fine, but also in this case: (much) less would have been more ... In fact as the movie progresses one starts to wonder if the mobster NICHOLSON plays is really intelligent enough to get a top position in organized crime, to become "the king" as he himself seems it and to hold such an organization alive with wise-cracking and his mimic antics. I VERY MUCH doubt it. I also see the difficulty of even a seasoned director like SCORSESE to say a "no" to NICHOLSONs antics in shooting, but that doesn't change the impression of implausibility that rests with the viewer. A middle-"management" guy in organized crime, yeah, but the top leader in Boston ... no! Since I am only allowed 1000 words, this is continued at the discussion board!
2.0~Another disappointment from a past master. mburnsderry Sign in Permalink Scorsese used to walk amongst giants. Now he mixes with midgets. Everybody to their own but I found this film to be badly acted, confusingly scripted and cliché ridden. Ex cop joins mob - mob knows there is a rat in their midst - who could it possibly be? Mobster joins cops to be a spy and within minutes of graduating climbs into the back of the mob's car which is parked yards away in full sight of the entire Boston PD! Please!!!!!! Was the story stolen from a Bugs Bunny cartoon? Jack Nicholson's performance certainly was! It was that unbelievable! The whole thing is an insult to the intelligence. As is the belief that DiCaprio or Damon can act!
5.0~An Oscar failure of 2007 - This is not a bad film, but bad remake, and really did not deserve the Oscar. tintinau Sign in Permalink True, i must clarify my point of view: I don't see this as a bad bad film. It's in fact quite good, for who have never watched or heard about its original movie: the Asian famous THE INFERNAL AFFAIR. It is just a less-than-adequate remake to ask for an Academy, especially key awards like best picture, directing, film editing and shamefully, *Screenplay Adapted Writing*. As one already stated here: "If The Departed could win Oscar for best picture, then Infernal Affair should have been voted the best film of decade". LOL. But I agree. For movie's sake, I beg all of you who praised this and (certainly) have not seen The Infernal Affair, please go to your local video shop and ask for Hong Kong movie titled above. You would see that someone might have cheated the Oscar this year. For the following reasons: 1- This is a remake (for a *recent* well known movie), not original work of art. 2- Lack of directing role (half load of the scenes, especially good one, stole directly from IA). 3- Poor creativity 4- Even for any "creativity" added, they were really silly compared to the original plots. 5- Except Leo and Jack, remaining casts are just adequate. 6- Even for Leo and Jack could not beat the superior acting from Tony Leung and Anthony Wong in IA. Matt also can't compare to Andy Lau in the original (What could we blame it for? director? or screen writing?) 7- Unrealistic and cheap added/adjusted stories: the undecided psychologist's love for both 2 male characters (was totally different from original) with instant hot sex, the never-ending cursing from decent police force, and the *surprise* ending. (For that, I really shocked for the "Best Adapted Screen Writing" award). 8- Many good&intelligent scenes, instead, was removed. For example, the Morse Code. And all experts here have said more than enough about the 2 movies, but I just add my final 2 cents: "How could Scorsese gather that much courage to bring this *copycat* to the contest? and how could they let this win the important Academy shamelessly?" Really don't understand. America maybe should have not advertised any about this film, not mentioning giving Academy for it - if they really don't want the rest of earth to see and think Hollywood is declining... Poor old Scorsese.
10.0~great movie tiagoalves6926 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie yesterday, and think this movie is the best movie of the year in my opinion, Scorsese's will go to win the Oscar of better director and Leonardo DiCaprio will go win Best Actor in a Leading Role MAT makes one great Role and Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson too. this movie is better the Japanese movie. he acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles. Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year. the directed are great the casting was great. the writing are great . the sound track are great too. i wait this movie win many Oscars and golden globes! I love this movie!!
1.0~How could this even be nominated for best picture? john_meyer Sign in Permalink This is a haphazard movie, with violence substituting for acting, and profanity taking the place of real writing. The editing is slipshod, to the point of making parts of the movie incomprehensible. If you like over-the-top violent thug movies, don't waste your time on this poor excuse for movie making and instead rent "Snatch." You'll get your daily dose of violence and profanity there as well, but done with a much firmer hand on the controls. The corruption of the motion picture academy has been obvious for the past decade, with nominations and winners increasingly determined by factors outside the film's actual merits.
9.0~Winter Hill Gang blake-21 Sign in Permalink While watching this movie I got the Idea that it could be based on the real life story of Whitey Bolger as well as what someone else wrote (maybe that's where they got the original idea). If you know the story of the Winter Hill Gang in Boston and yes they were southies, then I highly recommend the Movie. In the late Seventies a gang calling itself the Winter Hill Gang were murdering at will and trying to take over the city of Boston's underworld. Led by Whitey Bolger they used every means at their disposal including the legal system to hide what they were doing. Whitey finally fell when he went into business with two out of state investors. On his orders they were killed separately in Okalhoma and Florida. Investigators from the FBI tied the two murders together and upon further investigation found a suspect mole in their organization in Boston. It touched off a scandal in the FBI and the Federal Witness Protection program because Whitey was using it to protect himself. Whitey then disappeared and has not been heard from since.
8.0~Scorsese returns to the house he built--- 8/10 Sfpsycho415 Sign in Permalink A few years back i was worrying about the state of the gangster movie. There were tries. Some people did an okay job, some made laughable attempts to emulate classics like the Goodfellas and Scarface. I started to think that with the Sopranos knocking all mafia-esquire stories out of the park, the classic gangster movie may be dead. Now, the man that helmed some of the greatest gangster movies of all time, Martin Scorsese, returns and adds a cop movie twist. The Departed is loosely based on the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, which was a decent thriller with great performances. The Departed however is a great thriller, with amazing performances, all directed by a master of the medium. The Departed follows two moles; one a cop in the Irish mob, and the other an Irish mobster with cops. Both answer to Frank Costello and Oliver Queenan, the mob boss and the head state trooper, respectively. As each find out about each other, they enter a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse as they race along the body littered streets to blow each others covers. Now, i know it sounded like the back cover of the latest Wesley Snipes movie, but The Departed is a gripping, exciting, and star-studded epic. The most instantly appealing part of the film is the amazing ensemble cast that includes Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nichcolson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. They all do an amazing job but never though i would say this; I officially forgive Dicaprio for his crimes against cinema. While Jack steals the show of course, Leo turns in an incredible performance, becoming the character you actually care about the most. His intentions are well, but the act of betrayal is wrong and has consequences no matter what, and thats what Leo brought to the table. Matt Damon handles his rare bad guy role really well, and Jack Nicholson rivals Joe Pesci in Goodfellas for being both hilarious and terrifying. Martin Scorsese knows how to use his cast to tell the story in the best way possible. This story, at it's core a straight-forward thriller plot, could have been handled by any director and made a good movie that you would forget in a few hours. Scorsese, however, puts the characters first, haunts you with their mentalities and their ultimate fates, and creates an unforgettable film. Welcome back, Marty. 8/10
10.0~Amazing cast, multiple endings FirasSaw Sign in Permalink A lot of excellent performances, good story, martin scorsese, and those kind of things!
3.0~The Departed - hard to like. danielstephenclarke Sign in Permalink It was with no little trepidation that I arrived to see this latest offering from Scorsese. There are few directors in his class in modern cinema and he is certainly one you would watch directing traffic, but I can only report that this film is massively disappointing. A strong ensemble cast promised much and almost to a man they delivered massively, and here I think lies the clue to this Curate's egg. It occurred to me that Jack Nicholson delivers a performance that was at best ill-conceived and at worst massively self-indulgent to the detriment of the film. As a result the Nicholson character is a shocking turn off, maybe only rivalled by Ray Winstone's leaden Mr French. The remainder of the cast deliver strong performances, actually exquisite in the case of Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, perhaps this is an attempt to distance themselves from a flaccid core? For me Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon are serviceable as the central characters (which for Di Caprio is as good as it gets but that is possibly a matter of personal taste) but this doesn't detract from what is ultimately an underwhelming film. Its worth mentioning that the level of disappointment I felt at this film was such that I had to go and watch it again to confirm that I hadn't grossly mis-read the film, sadly the second viewing simply confirmed my lack of satisfaction.
10.0~Fantastic sandeep-challa Sign in Permalink Was desperate to see "The Departed" because it was the first time I was catching up on a Scorsese movie in US on release date. (I am from India). Making a 2 1/2 hr gangster flick is a very tough task. But there are so many twists and turns that are there in this flick that 2 1/2 hrs just passed by without my knowledge. Initially i took some time to get into the movie. But once you are there, you will get so involved with the characters that you actually feel whats going on with them. Screeplay was very tight and gripping. To actually make a movie about two guys who don't meet until the end, is quite an achievement. And the last half an hour was amazing. I saw quite a few reviews which said that the climax as not up to the mark. I totally disagree with them. The scene when DiCaprio is shot, the whole theater was shocked and I could hear the sounds like "Oh!! My God"...Man it was amazing .... I was like "What the heck was that" .... One final word "Marty! You rock, You simple do!!" Planning to catch it one more time this weekend .....
3.0~humm, what the hell dejawolf Sign in Permalink don't know why this thing got such high score. its cut like a frickin movie trailer, watching this thing.. feels like watching a 2 hour long movie preview.. jeez. extremely annoying. the story is pretty good though, like the angle. but the cutting.. argh, its so annoying, it gets through everything, and all you can think of is how badly cut this movie is. then there's the characters. whole frickin bunch of wannabe tough guys. they're so pitiful and lacks so much charisma they need to wade through rivers of blood to get any sort of credibility. waste of time. friggin wannabe Tarantino directors.
9.0~A near perfect thriller vishal_wall Sign in Permalink Undercover cops and criminals. There are moments when you think you are watching Face Off, Catch Me If You Can, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, Reservoir Dogs or may be Casino but its all there in 'The departed'. Story is flawless except for a banal ending. Narration is very regular;three stories very obviously connected run parallel and meet after almost half the film is over. It opens in layers and is a sheer joy to watch the character finally crossing each other's territory. Dialogs are punched and speed is fast. Editing is a little shoddy in a few scenes but may be footage weren't too helping i guess. Its a definite Oscar winner. 'Gimme Shelter' works again for Scorcese. John Lennon reference was damn funny :> Everyone is extremely good but its just impossible to not mention Caprio. He is so gifted and he is so good. He plays a perfect undercover policeman. Popping down tablets of speed, short tempered, a nice guy playing a bad guy trying hard to get back to his real side. He plays it so beautifully. Scene where he get up slapping his face with both hands is a stealer. I hope Scorcese make 5000 more films and he cast Caprio in all of them.
8.0~Powerful, violent, profane kingbad Sign in Permalink Great character study of two young state cops, each leading a double life and trying so hard to keep their deceptions undetected. Leinardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon are probably going to be competitors for the best actor Oscar; both gave great performances, DiCaprio in a flashier role, but Damon's controlled intensity was amazing, too. Strong supporting roles, especially by Martin Sheen and, of course, Jack Nicholson, as the most evil guy in the world. I usually find Nicholson to be a distraction, since he's usually called upon to play basically a slightly different version of his crazy-guy role; this time he really submerges into an anything-but-crazy role as mob boss Frank Costello. Savagely bloody, sustained tension; vintage Scorsese, easily his best movie since Goodfellas, and the best American movie of the year.
7.0~Nice, but overrated Filmfan-NL Sign in Permalink The Departed's storyline is promising, the cast top notch and the names behind the film impressive. Yet the film does not quite meet the expectations I had of it. Somehow the characters never really grasped me, I felt no more sympathy for the good guys than the bad, and frankly, Nicholson sort of disappointed me. I just didn't believe him in this top criminal role, and the majority of his goons just were too flat and stereotype to lift this mobster flick above the average level, where films like the Godfather (the entire trilogy), Goodfellas et cetera seriously surpass that. Maybe it's a matter of a bit too much of everything, too little of one thing in particular. Good ingredients don't necessarily make a gourmet meal. The high rating in the top 250 surprises me, not often I feel so different about a flick's rating. Anyway, worth watching anyway, but don't expect too much.
10.0~Dazzling character study from a master filmmaker cpbadgeman Sign in Permalink Without a doubt this is the best film of 2006. The deceptively simple premise involves the Massachussets State Police planting an undercover operative (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the South Boston underworld in order to take down Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). However, Costello has a mole of his own.... What unfolds is an absolutely stunning examination of the nature of violence, loyalty, avarice, and betrayal. The ensemble cast are uniformly excellent though Martin Sheen and a caustic Mark Wahlberg absolutely steal the show in their supporting roles as DiCaprio's world-weary handlers. Big Bad Jack turns in a bone-chilling, high octane performance that simply lights up the screen. As a side-note, his character is based in part on the exploits of a real-life South Boston mobster, Whitey Bulger. The razor-sharp dialogue is enthralling and Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless. This film is a triumph.
6.0~Remember when Scorsese used to make GREAT movies? TooShortforThatGesture Sign in Permalink This is not a terrible movie, but it's hardly worth the investment of 2-1/2 hours of your time. Mostly it feels like a well-filmed (and over-long) TV cop show episode. All very tense. All very "who's really the bad guy and who has figured out who is good and who is bad" with Boston ethic gloss on it (lots of "Southie" accents. Lots of "F..k you" "No F..k YOU" dialog. Lots of bloodshed at unexpected times (it is Scorsese after all). But what it seems to lack is that ironic edge that makes the great Scorsese films great. It's just a little too much involved in the plot. The acting is...expensive. I was mostly impressed with Scorsese's ability to convince a studio to pay to have Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson ALL appear in one movie at the same time and then to also add in Mark Wahlbern, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen. But none of the performances were anything to write home about (though doubtless there will be a huge Oscar push for everybody -- but I'm thinking no winners because, if nothing else, they may all cancel each other out.) Damon and DiCaprio's important scenes felt a little "acting school." Martin Sheen was working hard not to be President Bartlett. Wahlberg was walking through a "Southie" caricature and Nicholson was once again trotting out the old crazy Jack routine. Visually, things were not helped by the fact that the film does a good job of looking like Boston, which I generally find to be one of the least interesting looking large American cities. Even the iconic (in the movie) shot of the State House is sort of dull and when two characters talk about moving to another city, I found myself thinking "Please do, I'm tired of looking at Boston." Some nitpicks -- 1. A slightly big deal is made of the fact that the shrink didn't go to Harvard. Then why is she wearing a Harvard shirt later in Damon's apartment? 2. This is yet another one of those movies that mostly makes sense, until it has a plot point involving technology. The, it behaves as if no one involved has ever really used anything invented after 1970. We get miraculously taped cell phone conversations that clearly weren't being taped when we saw them the first time. Or police personnel records that can be completely deleted by the press of one button by one person. Very Charlie's Angels. 3. In an already long movie, why do we have to see the whole "giving the envelope to the shrink" scene when the fact that she has the envelope does not have anything to do with how the last 15 minutes of the movie works out? ...and a couple of other similar silly things that kind of don't really add up when you think about them. They don't ruin the movie, but add to the sense that one is watching a film that is a bit more slipshod than it should be, given the high gloss of its cast and crew. So, all-in-all, a movie to pass away a slow night at home on the DVD but nothing worth rushing out to the cinema for.
1.0~terrible mltubio Sign in Permalink How can anyone think this is a good movie? We know the ending from the beginning, and this can't be good for a movie that actually pretends to mix "suspense" with "action" and a touch of "comedy". Here's the story: Jack Nicholson is some mafia guy who pays for Matt Damon's education. Matt Damon becomes a cop who helps Nicholson continue to be the bad guy. Then there is Leonardo Dicaprio, who is an informant who works for the police trying to help them catch Jack Nicholson by pretending to be one of Nicholson's men. Now Nicholson wants to know who might be betraying him. The policemen want to know who is the bad cop helping out Nicholson. What is the ending of the movie: suspense, suspense, surprise! They find out. In the meantime, everyone gets killed, Damon and Decaprio have sex with the same woman, and Nicholson and the cops swear a lot. Wow, how creative! How interesting! This movie is stupid, very stupid. This says a lot about those people who picked it as Best Movie at the Oscars.
1.0~I guess I will look for the original llndierckx Sign in Permalink Is it the actors ? Is it the appeal of the original movie ? Is the Scorsese-clan lobbying around to vote 10 ? Did people become suddenly brainless or is it plain compassion ? I really can't figure out why this movie is so overrated ! Do people have compassion for Scorsese because he still needs an Oscar ! Hey, I agree too, he surely deserved SOME Oscars in his career but,  hey  ho, not this time! You will find it difficult to believe but not long before I saw "Casino Royale" and euh liked it MORE ! The movie had a promising start but halfway I sat there with an uneasy feeling. I wanted to leave the theatre but out of respect for my friends I went all through and was washed away with all the rubbish you could ever imagine. The characters became hollow, the acting disappeared and worst of all the story went absolutely nowhere. All we got is a rat. Maybe rats should see this movie ? Normally I don't bother writing comments or even vote but this time I was profoundly hurt. I thought, hey lets see how other people think about this and then I got hurt by our human race itself. Hey true fans out there, be honest to yourself and pay Scorsese some respect by not rating this movie high because if you don't do this you loose all credibility. I hope Hollywood will see this too. Scorsese should have made this movie when he was 20 or so and make his masterpieces now. But I guess life doesn't work that way. See for yourself and enjoy the first 40 minutes. Ps: I will look for the original and see if the original is better like they say.
7.0~It could make a psychiatrist's head explode! MartinHafer Sign in Permalink I realize that "The Departed" won four Oscars (one for Best Picture and one for Best Director and one for writing). I know that it has a HUGE overall rating on IMDb. I know it's a very popular movie. BUT, the film simply didn't do its homework when it comes to some of the characters. And, because of this, I was not especially impressed by the film. Now before you slam my review with another NOT HELPFUL, hear me out.... Had the writers cared about consistency and believability, they would have cared about the only major female character in the film. However, she was a caricature--a lady with zero believability...NONE. While it's true that films often get psychologists, psychiatrists and counselors wrong, this is among the very worst cases. While she's described as a counselor, she prescribes medications (that's illegal by the way--only an MD can do that). And, personal boundaries mean absolutely nothing to her...nothing. Here we have yet another case where a supposed professional begins sleeping with one of her patients--and one of the most screwed up ones at that! There is no reason to believe this relationship--there is no chemistry and he clearly is a mess...so she sleeps with him!! Why can't a film show a mental health worker who isn't crazy? Does some Tom Cruise write all the roles for psychotherapists in movies?! How can anyone believe her character in any way?! How does this bad writing get rewarded with all these Oscars? To me, an Oscar implies perfection...or at least near perfection...and this is not it. By the way, since I am on a tirade, I am also irritated that the main baddie is called 'Frank Costello' (Jack Nicholson). Why pick this name since the real life Costello was a HUGE figure in the underworld and bore little semblance to the guy in the film (who is more like Whitey Bulger, by the way)? What not give him some totally fictional name? Why, if he's so much like Bulger, does his fate have nothing to do with Bulger's? I don't get it. Now I am NOT saying it's a terrible film or I hate it. It's just flawed. So, despite Leonardo DiCaprio's wonderful performance and a taut script, it is a film that didn't really seem good enough to have received all these accolades.
9.0~Best film of the year, bar none. akain8033 Sign in Permalink The Departed is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It is the only mob movie that I can say rivals The Godfather. After seeing the film all I could think of when I walked out of that theater was "wow". The acting was top notch. Every single person made me believe fully in their character's whole essence. Of course the directing by THE Martin Scorsese was superb. He throws more curves at you than Phil Niekro. And if you love fantastic endings then this one astonish and impassion you. This is without-a-doubt his best, most appealing movie ever, even with the considerations of Taxi Driver and GoodFellas. You have the freedom to agree or not agree with me on this but as long as you enjoy the movie like you will, I don't care. (Always remember, X marks the dead)
10.0~Home Run Scorsese hpioch2 Sign in Permalink This film not only met the high expectations I held for it, but SURPASSED THEM. The Departed was expertly written, crafting each character's development thoroughly, without useless background information that would drag the length of the film. Everything took place "in the now" and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. In fact, the movie flew by, but left me completely fulfilled and overly satisfied, well more like BURSTING AT THE SEEMS WITH EXCITEMENT! I was very impressed at how the plot took shape, and how every twist that was thrown into the mix never pushed the border of believability, but still wowed the audience entirely. The violence was exceedingly well done and strategically placed, adding the right amount of muscle behind the film, which only enhanced the color of each of the characters. The plot took into account the mindset of it viewers, and gave us an excellent scope into the undercover world of police officers. Whether or not there is complete validity to cut throat mentality surrounding this line of work didn't matter, it had me in complete belief of every character, and every piece of action. In addition to a brilliant script containing superb characters, the directing was also top notch by mister Scorsese. I enjoyed many of the artistic flares and interesting shots, but mostly the artful way he kept that dissonance of the two main characters in the forefront of the viewer's mind, making me as an audience member, really take interest into what was to come of each of them in the end. The finale of this film is bluntand perfect. I LOVE THIS CAST. Many times star studded movies can fall flat, as they rely on names, rather than writing an performance to draw money to the box office, but this was not the case. Leonardo DiCaprio was astonishing at every moment, and he plays this role PERFECTLY. I personally loved Mark Wahlberg's performance as well, and Alec Baldwin delivered an excellent supporting performance, truly allowing his character to shine, and adding high quality comic relief when needed. The soundtrack also surprised me slightly, and I loved the Irish flare the dropkick murphys added. It kept things interesting to say the least. Overall this is an EXCELLENT, WELL CRAFTED PIECE OF ART! It will keep you talking for hours after seeing it, and only make you want to see it again, I adore this movie, and without contemplation, it is now one of my new favorite movies of all time...well done, HOME RUN MARTIN!
10.0~Best movie I have seen in years Cyanide1 Sign in Permalink I was blown away by this movie. It will be tough to beat come awards season if you ask me. Best Scorsese movie since Goodfellas and just as good. I went thinking it was going to be good, but wasn't sure if Leo was going to be that great. I haven't thought he has been a 'great' actor, but he shot up the charts with this performance. Everyone in it is great, and Wahlberg has a great small role as well. It's running time may seem long, but it's not. It flies right by and the final scenes had me reeling in astonishment at what was going on. I hope everyone sees this movie. It deserves a lot of accolades come the end of the year.
4.0~Overrated, silly ending author-21 Sign in Permalink I've seen a lot of overrated movies in my life (can anyone say The Crying Game? Gladiator? Million Dollar Baby?) but never has an entire audience been so completely lost by the Director of an eventual Best Picture Winner. In my screening in Gainesville, Florida, the last forty minutes of the film -- you remember, the forty minutes in which nine of the eleven main characters get skull-shot by someone else? -- the audience was so pulled out of the thing that people were actually LAUGHING AT THE SCREEN. This is a truly mediocre movie. It's dreary, it's ham-acted, the dialogue is forced, it's half an hour too long, and its ending is one of the silliest I've ever seen in a film that expects itself to be taken seriously.
1.0~I hope to God I never see another movie like this again!!! wwv111354 Sign in Permalink I'm not sure if what I write will be considered a spoiler or not, so I opted to check that it does. Anyway, the level of graphic violence, the actual depictions of the physical ramifications of that violence, made this, for me, the worst movie I have ever been unfortunate enough to see. I certainly do not need to see someone's brains projecting through the air or splattered on a wall to appreciate that someone has been killed. I also do not want to see both bad and good guys die by the end of the movie. A movie without heroes is of no value socially. And, the questions - why were certain scenes included bringing up questions that weren't answered by the end? What was in the envelope given to the psychiatrist? Did she ever give to anyone? And, why did the suspended cop show up and kill Costello's mole? Was he aware of his role, did she give him the envelope so he'd know the truth or was he just angry that this guy had usurped his position of importance in the division? If he had the evidence, why didn't he be the hero and turn him in? What happened to the envelope, really? Why was the scene even included if the envelope wasn't going to be involved later? (Unlike the envelope full of Social Security numbers collected by Costello.) Sure, there were definitely surprises - unexpected scenes that took place, but they just made me sick and want to leave as soon as possible. I detested this movie. It only glorified violence and bloodshed. If it wins an Oscar....if it even gets nominated....I will forever hold that process and those awards in contempt because they will have no value whatsoever at that point. I love a good mystery with twists and turns and surprises. This was not good....period!!
10.0~Best Director...Martin Scorsese. djteich Sign in Permalink WOW! I had very high expectations going into this film, and Marty blew them away with overwhelming force. The plot is gripping from beginning to end, and the acting performances are stellar. The cast works together so well, just fueling the fire created by the searing action. On top of the reality created by the astonishing plot and acting, the picture is shot beautifully. No single shot is dull, it is always captivating to watch. This is the BEST film I have seen in a LONG time. I can't say anything else but SEE THIS PICTURE. Thank you Martin Scorsese, you are truly a master.
1.0~a poor rip off kimberley-helena Sign in Permalink I have to say that when i went to watch the American Version of Departed i was rather in two minds, firstly since this film is a remake of a very successful Hong Kong film starring the very talented Andy Lau, and Tony Leung Infernal Affairs. OK Departed has had huge publicity since it stars many top rated well known actors, so already this is used to deter the public from the original success of the Hong Kong version, if you were to not know that Departed is not original, then you would see this as a fantastic film, but having compared to HK Version, this lacks all you can think , it is taken word from word, act from act, and the worse thing about the US Version is the ending. If you see the HK version you shall see why. A very poor rip off, covered by well known actors!!and that is all!!!
1.0~It was very good, but the ending left me unfulfilled phenomynouss Sign in Permalink Coming in to "The Departed", I was lucky to already know what the plot was about (some trailers are so obscure as to not mention jack-crap about the plot, to hide the fact that it sucks) and it got four stars (highest rating) in my local newspaper's movie reviews, with lots of great mention on acting and drama and directing. The movie was very well-done. It was a bit confusing in the start as some of the actors mumbled and made it hard to understand them, but this didn't deter from the plot as though you missed something important. The directing style wasn't too special at first, but showed some definite high points and strengths later on (the scene where Martin Sheen's character, chief Queenan, is thrown from the roof of a building in slow motion, a bunch of people in the theater I was in gasped audibly, and even more so when he hit the ground) The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, not just in the movie, but in their roles as rats, were very convincing (some scenes with DiCaprio, and Frank Costello suspecting him as the rat, made me genuinely think he wasn't a rat, but rather pretending to be one.) The dialog is crisp and never seems to falter with uselessness or insanity or something off the wall completely. My only complaints were that Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan had some unexplained obsession with the golden dome roof of a church, in which he'd constantly stare at in his apartment. This was never explained or even delved into in the least. Another was the mild hint at Costello slowly going crazy over the course of the movie. I didn't see this at all. He did some eccentric things in the later course, but nothing to truly qualify as ascending derangement. The movie peaked when the two rats discovered each other out (after Costello's death) and DiCaprio's character William Costigan went out trying to expose him, even going so far as to lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group). It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go. He then killed one of the officers who was friends with DiCaprio's character, and then was killed by Sullivan. Then he went home, to discover Dignam there, who then killed him and wandered off. The final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something. For some reason, this ending left me unfulfilled, and a bit disappointing, almost anti-climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama.
8.0~Lacks suspense & action iamjoanni Sign in Permalink The Departed provided a well explained background of the characters that very well patched up the story gaps that Infernal Affairs had. It connected both the Rat & Mole in so many ways that they are not aware of. It could have been a perfect 10 if it surpassed or at least lived up to the action that Infernal Affairs had, it lacked suspense. In the first meet-up scene with the Chinese men, it lacked tension and on the scened where Martin Sheene was going to meet Leo at the to 344 Washington, it felt dead. The way Mr. Sheene feel from the roof top was uneventful, "how did he exactly fell of that way?". Another is when Matt Damon & Leo meet up on the roof top... where's the struggle in there???? It didn't even had any action! Though it answered a lot of questions to the story gaps Infernal Affairs had, it did not provide the tension & action it had. It was good, but could have been better.
4.0~A Scorsese Return To Form?! gareth_john_nolan Sign in Permalink The praise this film has received is undeniable, but it is for quite obvious reasons. How hard is it to make a poorly received film with a pseudo Ocean's 11 style cast? A veritable who's who of Hollywood in future establishment star's like Mark Walhberg, Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon with the establishment proper in Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen as the Daddy's of good and evil. Throw in the excellent plot of somebody else's film (Internal Affairs), and a director who has an untouchable reputation. In Hollywood terms, its a no-brainer, a sure fire success story, unimpeachable in form and content. For a director of Scorsese's reputation though, this film is an indictment. I have to hope there are others like myself who can see through this rouse. This film is vacuous, bloated and overblown. It's a rehash of somebody's else's film and even a rehash of Scorsese's own films. It's the best Internal Affairs since Internal Affairs, and his best Scorsese crime drama since every other Scorsese crime drama. This man has built a reputation on a handful of genuinely subversive, ground breaking, and thought provoking films - but when will it be recognised he has simply run out of ideas, as nothing could be more certain when looking at this film. Scorsese has lost his way, and he knows it (as evidenced by his move to make his own indie flick). People are reluctant to knock him down and hold him to account because they are in love with the sensation that his reputation invokes. He is probably the last man who brings credibility to mainstream Hollywood  but he is ultimately subverted by it. It would seem to me that a vote against him is a vote against a last strand of credibility in this type of feature making  If Scorsese can't help us then who can? It has to be clear that the best work that he has done in the last 10 years have been his own documentary output. His history of the blues, cinema and his Bob Dylan work, are exemplary. But his feature fictions are bloated, messy affairs. For The Departed, it's shown in a few clear ways, one being musical choice. How many times in one career can he use the iconic but ultimately invasive Gimme Shelter by the Rolling Stones? Moreover, how many times in one film? In one scene alone in The Departed, he plays the song twice, restarting it to use the intrigue of Keith Richards tone setting guitar play. It's as jarring as it is juvenile. The song itself features over three times in the film. Yet, this is only one example of his corrupted sense of film-making style. I can appreciate his attempt to incorporate new ideas into his films, but his attempt to use Wes Anderson's pace setting Spanish Guitar plucking falls on its face, setting a comedic tone in places where there shouldn't be one. Another reference to Anderson is used in his full screen photo flashback device, which is quickly followed in the same scene, by his own more traditional in-scene photo pick up. The result is messy. Scorsese's sense of style is subverted by his inability to go any one way. Sloppiness also features in that Scorsese staple of the continuity error. I can appreciate this lack of attention to detail were it some art house reflection on the nature of reality, but this is mainstream Hollywood and says more about his editorial and film-making laziness than any overarching thematic concern. See Leo without cigarette in hand in one instant, and blowing smoke circles the next. You need only go to the goof's pages on this site for more. For inability to follow his convictions, see a jarring POV shot of Matt Damon in a waiting room looking down at his shoes, held for 1 second. It is a brave attempt to capture a moment between moments in a character's life, but an idea that cannot be pursued in half measures. As for overblown performance and a suggestion of a director losing control, look only as far as Jack Nicholson's fly eating. An integral part of a director's reputation must always be what he brings to the table as a filmmaker. The reason this film has succeeded has nothing to do with his ability in that regard, in so far as it carried by somebody else's plot and the Hollywood powerhouse casting and acting. When looking at this film it must be asked what did Scorsese actually bring to this project? Is this a man resting on his laurels or an active master of his craft pushing the boundaries of his expression and creativity? His use of violence at this stage of his career is merely exploitative, rather than questioning. His supposed exploration of modern masculinity has never been more stale. For a man of Scorsese's undeniable ability and vision, this is nothing short of a shameful piece of work. Clearly, he is as jaded as the mainstream American cinema which nurtures him. I look forward to his next project because at the very least that can be judged as a real Scorsese picture, a greater measure of the man; and those who praised him for this will hopefully realise their folly as I am quite sure that even he himself would balk at the suggestion that this film was exemplary of his ability.
10.0~Scorcese finally gets his due! hnt_dnl Sign in Permalink THE DEPARTED is the first Best Picture winner that I've seen in years that I've actually at least LIKED! And I'll go a step further to say that I REALLY, REALLY LIKE it! It is an excellent story, played brilliantly by all involved, and told by one of the greatest directors in all of film history: Martin Scorcese. Scorcese FINALLY won Best Director and a film of his won Best Picture for this modern masterpiece. Of course it's not TAXI DRIVER or RAGING BULL, or even GOODFELLAS, but so what? It's better than 95% of the other stuff thrown at us the last few years! THE DEPARTED stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon as Bostonians Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan, respectively, both from opposite sides of the track. Costigan's father's side of the family has criminal ties, but he was actually raised apart from that w/ his mother's more uppercrust upstanding side of the family. Sullivan was a poor boy raised in the streets. That's how both characters came to be what they were as grown men: Billy was brought up away from crime and Colin was exposed directly to it. As a boy Colin unwittingly became involved with local crime boss Frank Costello (played by the great Jack Nicholson in typical scene-stealing fashion). Costigan and Sullivan both joined the police academy, with Costigan volunteering to go under deep cover to help take down Costello's organization, while Sullivan worked as Costello's inside man/mole to notify him when the cops were closing in on him. Costigan's only link to the cops is career cop Captain Queenan (Mr. Martin Sheen in terrific form) and his right hand man Lt. Dignam (Best Supporting Actor nominee Mark Wahlberg in a superb performance). Dignam and Queenan are the ONLY cops who know that Costigan is really one of the good guys as it was set up so that Billy would get thrown out of the police academy and thrown in jail for 18 months to help solidify his cover. Upon release from prison, Billy connects with his father's bad side of the family in order to ultimately get close to the PRIZE, Frank Costello himself. Meanwhile, the 'clean-cut' Sullivan ingratiates himself with the Boston PD's bigwigs, in particular, he is assigned to work with a task force led by Lt. Ellerby (played by the superb Alec Baldwin). Ellerby and Sullivan's job is to take Costello down. Very labyrinthine! The cop tasked to destroy Costello is really Costello's boy (Sullivan) and Costello's new boy in his organization is really a cop truly trying to take him down (Costigan)! The irony! Thankfully, this juicy main plot doesn't fail to deliver the goods. It is very tense, exciting, edge-of-your-seat stuff. You really hold your breath at times wondering what's going to happen. To complicate matters, obviously, neither Costigan nor Sullivan know each other, but both men know that the other EXISTS. Costigan knows that Costello has a police mole and Sullivan knows that the cops have a plant inside Costello's organization, so during the course of the film, they try to root each other out. To FURTHER complicate the proceedings, both men become involved with the SAME woman, a police psychiatrist Madolyn (played by the alluring Vera Farmiga). Sullivan meets her because they work in the same building and Costigan is one of her patients. Wow! What a cast! What a film! And very well told. I was never a big fan of DiCaprio's until I saw him in this film. He really delivers the goods as Billy, a tortured soul who begins to blur the line between right and wrong. And Damon is truly solid as Colin, a tragic, doomed individual who sadly got influenced by the wrong person in his formative years. Nicholson of course delivers with his flash, flair, and aplomb. And the rest of the cast is solid beyond words. Scorcese has fashioned a classic for the modern viewer, his best film since GOODFELLAS. This BEST PICTURE winner is a keeper! 'Bout damn time!
4.0~What a piece of crap... more than a disappointment, a JOKE! Dame311 Sign in Permalink Wow... How is it possible that I am seemingly the only person to HATE this piece of trash? I don't know if it was the expectations going into this movie or if it was the ridiculous bantering between several of the characters or if it was simply the worst plot twists since All my children. I mean are you serious?? I didn't just go to a Martin Scorsese film, did I? If you have a brain and any bit of creativity you will save your money and never see this movie. Good cast, terrible writing and an ending that is so awful that you will want to punch the usher in the face on your way out of the theater. "you weren't the only one working with Costello" LOL!!! They should have just lined up the entire cast at the end and shot everyone, that would have made more sense. PIECE OF GARBAGE ... and embarrassment! Enjoy.
10.0~great cast, script, and of course Scorsese's genius kornfreak666_1 Sign in Permalink Any fan of Scorcese's work will love this picture. I was a little worried that the cast would not hold up to Marty's genius, but the performances were great. I was most worried about Alec Baldwin and and Mark Wahlberg's performances, but after I saw the film I thought they gave some of the most memorable performance's in the film. The story starts off a bit slow and jumps from story to story a bit to often, but once the premise is established the movie is excellent. The plot can be confusing if you don't pay close attention, but if you're an avid Scorcese fan or just someone who appreciates great cinema, then this is a great movie to watch. This is the best movie I have seen in years. The writing was great, the director is a legend, the cast was incredible, and I think this may be my new favorite Scorcese picture.
8.0~Very gripping plot shreekara-1995 Sign in Permalink Cops chase thief and going one step further both plant their undercover in their team to get the updated regarding each other's move, these cop gangsters saga had rocked the silver screen since very long time and proved to be the hot favourite genre, and when it's Martin Scorsese behind the plot then the things get pretty much serious, this film maker always has his own way of executing the story on screen. One such kind is 2006 release ''The Departed'', this gangster drama has the best casting ever made, Jack Nicholson, Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Wahlberg this is the unite of the venerated icons. Jack Nicholson steals the show with his all time typical cool performance as the Mobster, Dicaprio and Matt Damon had provided justice to their respected roles, the plot is so smooth and gripped that shows the perfection of the entire team, this crime tom & jerry play! gradually gets curious as the plot get intense with unexpected though possible twists. The screenplay gets the rocking credit as it succeeds in maintaining the grip throughout the show, camera and the scissor work are so perfectly captured and trimmed that deserves the warm appreciation, this movie evokes the thought in us and pursue its viewers towards exploring the loop within the system.
5.0~Good plot, acting, cinematography+ horrible ending=OK movie tapples01 Sign in Permalink Good plot, acting, cinematography+ horrible ending=OK movie I don't understand how this movie has an 8.1 rating. I think people are forgetting that a good movie has to be a complete package. Plot got really complex and instead of even trying to attempt an ending, just kill everyone and roll credits. Went from a 10 movie to a 1 movie in the last fifteen minutes, so I am giving it a 5. Another problem is that with the all star cast...you are constantly reminded you are watching a movie, and this can make it tough to get into it. I don't know how Ocean's 11 did it, but I feel like they did a much better job handling so many talented actors.
4.0~User Rating: 8.5/10?? why? alexandrumail Sign in Permalink Just because it is a Scorsese movie? (Which I respect for great works he done before BTW) I don't say that this is a bad movie to watch, but is that kind of movie that on some point makes you want to team up with the "bad" guys, this is funny sometimes...OK, this movie contains many errors here are some: the other rats, they appeared out of the blue in the end!,some actors playing themselves and only themselves Nicholson for instance, stupid behavior from Matt Damon as a police officer, ask some cops they will laugh at the errors were made, I feel like Scorsese never bothered to ask what the state police will do in some cases, and the brutal error of "citizens letter" which I can say at least 10 motives why shouldn't have been there in the first place!. Those and many more made me feel that they put it that way only because they wanted to end the movie... how it ended :)
7.0~Better than Aviator or Gangs, worse than Goodfellas be_headed Sign in Permalink If The Departed had been directed by anyone else, especially someone without the pedigree of Scorsese, I would have been pleasantly surprised and left the theater more than satisfied. However, movies like Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver have infected me with an extremely high standard for anything with Scorsese's name on it, and while this movie is good, it is not in the same league as those classics. To begin, Scosese probably went a little over the top with casting. I realize that big names bring big bucks, but having dominating talents like Alec Baldwin (if you don't agree, see Glengarry Glen Ross or any one of his stints in SNL) or Martin Sheen in supporting roles is distracting. Such recognizable faces removed any sense of anonymity or realism from those roles -- they felt more like cameos than real characters. Not that Scorsese is the first to make this mistake; The Thin Red Line suffered from this same fatal flaw. There were also some underdeveloped relationships that I had trouble sinking my teeth into. In particular, the affair between Vera Farmiga's and DiCaprio's characters seemed contrived, particularly later in the movie when I wondered what exactly DiCaprio "wasn't there for." It's not that the actors failed to do there jobs adequately; it's more like there was some critical scene left on the cutting room floor that would have explained the characters' behavior towards the end of the film. On the plus side, for the first time in a Scosese movie, I was not annoyed by DiCaprio's presence. While he still looks young, this movie called for a younger actor. This is in stark contrast to The Aviator, where DiCaprio looked like a child with a mustache glued on his lip. Nicholson was fun to watch, of course, and Damon gave a particularly strong performance as a charming alpha male with a menacing streak lurking just beneath the surface. Mark Wahlberg is from Boston and therefore has the accent down pat, but I thought his dialog was a little over the top. This is not his fault really; the writers probably could have better developed the reasons behind why Wahlberg's character hated DiCaprio, and most the other characters for that matter, so much. I suppose I probably went into the movie having the wrong expectations. Not every movie can detail the rise and fall of a criminal family. Had this movie been too much like Goodfellas, I'd be complaining about Scorsese riding his own coattails. Looking over the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, apparently I'm alone in thinking this movie is not the next American Classic. I wish there were some way to see Scorsese's next movie without knowing he directed it.
4.0~Too long, too noisy, too boring - a pastiche LeandraZZZ Sign in Permalink What IS it with Scorsese and endless VIOLENCE ? actual violence, communication violence, interpersonal violence, and on and on. Another East coast violent gang movie ? in 2006?! I don't think so, thank you very much. If it had been made in 1990, then maybe .... But today we have enough real violence on the TV news each night about a real increasingly violent world. Nothing fictional can compare any more, and it is pointless to try. Where was all the subtle character analysis? and growth? and inner dilemmas ? and on and on. And Jack Nicholson hammed it up good and proper - what else could he do? - at various points the audience in my theatre (in the UK) were LAUGHING !!! And the movie was too, too, too L-O-N-G ! And as for the number of tedious F-words ! seemed like the scriptwriter was trying to vie with J D Salinger in -The Catcher in the Rye- for the number of G--D-----s. In today's world? Pathetic ! Come on, Marty baby, you CAN do better than this - before you get too old to try !
8.0~not really scorsese's best work PIST-OFF Sign in Permalink The Departed is a great movie that suffers towards the end from an excessive number of plot twists. Everything else is in it's right place and yet, and yet, and yet... it still does not have the feeling of greatness that casino or taxi driver had. Why? i'm not sure. I have the feeling though that this will eventually grow into a descent drinking movie thanks in most part to Jack Nicholson's one-off mafia boss. Plenty of laughs to be had there. The movie for me had the unfortunate luck of following a preview for 300 which i couldn't get out of my head for most of the movie. 8 out of 10
7.0~Scorsese Should Have Made His Own Movie Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment ***** SPOILERS ****** The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichéd and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't
5.0~A Disappointing Remake JiaQiLi Sign in Permalink Being Chinese, I have already seen the original Hong Kong version (a trilogy in fact). Honestly, I am very disappointed by Scorsese's remake. Matt Damon's character does not seem to struggle in his double identity. The ending of "The Departed" surprises me in a negative way. It is really lame and dull compared to the original. However, it is not fair to evaluate "The Departed" by constantly comparing with the original "Infernal Affairs" trilogy. I hereby turn my focus to "The Departed" as a movie of its own. This is my first time watching a Scorsese movie. He achieves a marvellous job in terms of directing the actions although they are excessive. DiCaprio and Damon are very good in acting but the best actor has to be Jack Nicholson. Playing Frank Costello, Nicholson's facial expression and acting demonstrate the charisma of a gangster leader. Scorsese does an excellent job on generating the tensions between characters too. I did not want to leave my seat for the most part of the movie. Damon used to be an altar boy at the church that Damon can see from his home's window. He has then become Nicholson's mole in the Special Investigative Unit of Boston police. It reminds me about Damon's past. But if Damon has some struggles, Scorsese ought to do a better job illustrating them. I experience Damon's character to be naturally evil in "The Departed." "The Departed" probably has a different focus from "Infernal Affairs." "The Departed" comes across to me as an emphasis on the ones that depart after doing good works for the society. "Infernal Affairs" emphasizes the tension between people's goodness and wickedness. If this is the case, the ending of "The Departed" makes very little sense. I give it a 5 out of 10 mainly because of the poor ending. In addition, the actions (well-choreographed) and foul languages are too much. They become too unnatural as the movie progresses. If you enjoy pure actions, "The Departed" is worth watching. But I recommend the original trilogy even more. "Infernal Affairs" is miles better than "The Departed."
10.0~Best Movie This year! revival_in_canada Sign in Permalink There were many reasons why i wanted to see this movie. The handful of talented actors, Martin Scorsese directed it and even the commercials were pulling me in. I couldn't help but go, which was a good thing i did. The movie had me leaning forward and gripping my arm rests the whole time. Martin made Boston seem like Brooklyn New York. A dangerous daring gangster movie. I was happy with every actors performance in this movie, Jack Nicholson was very different from his usual character, of course he's been evil before but he made his character menacingly evil. Other actors such as Mark Wahlberg,Matt Damon,Martin Sheen and Baldwin had stellar performances but what I think made this movie excellent was Leonardo Dicaprio. He was very involved with his character, made you involved with his character. You felt pain when he did. Made the movie almost seem real. If you watch this movie you won't get it out of your head until you see it again, which you will. I watched this movie get onto the best of all time list within two days, I'm not the only one who's impressed. I expect this movie to win awards, countless. Even in the Oscar department I wouldn't be surprised to see Leo win an award. Now could you say this was Scorsese's best movie, no, that's hard to say but this movie no doubt is one of his best.
9.0~Scorsese and his A-list cast make The Departed soar eddie_baggins Sign in Permalink When veteran director Martin Scorsese walked up to collect his Best Director Oscar in 2007 for his efforts with Hollywood remake The Departed, it felt like justice had finally been served. After many a miss (hello Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Aviator, Casino etc. etc.), cinema fans breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the long-standing master finally get his just rewards and while it's hard to argue against the fact that The Departed is unlikely to be Scorsese's best work, it's one of his most easily accessible and fun films that remains a joy to watch to this day. Utilizing a whip smart and darkly humorous script by scribe William Monahan, that adapted Asian mega-hit Infernal Affairs for English audiences and transported the action from Asia to the thick drawl of Boston, The Departed is one of the most successful reimagining's of all time thanks to the screenwriter, Scorsese's energetic and perfectly paced direction and a collection of stars who shine together in an all-round ensemble. Front and centre of the cat and mouse game that sees an undercover mob affiliate infiltrate the Boston police department while simultaneously a Boston police office infiltrates the local mob, is lead trio Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, who all deliver seriously fun and switched on turns with fantastic help from the likes of Vera Farmiga, Mark Wahlberg (in an Oscar nominated supporting turn), Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone. Scorsese struck it lucky with the casting of his 2006 film with both DiCaprio and Damon operating at the peak of their powers, while also snaring Nicholson before he fell into relative obscurity and it's a cinematic treat to see these performers eat up the rich and sassy dialogue and play off each other to great effect as the stories twisted and ever evolving plotline transforms. The Departed is one of those rarely found films that continually stays on the move, barely allowing you time to stop and take a moments respite as DiCaprio's undercover cop Billy Costigan, Damon's undercover mob mole Colin Sullivan and Nicholson's purple adorned crime boss Frank Costello go about their respective lives, with Scorsese's film becoming a thriller that genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat, culminating in one of the most unforgettable and at the times unexpected endings, that recalls many a wide jawed reaction for those that caught this classic in cinemas (myself included). Final Say - It's not Scorsese's best film but its absolutely one of his most enjoyable. The Departed may not offer anything deep and meaningful but this seriously addictive thriller is the type of cinematic ride we should all enjoy that rightfully ended up becoming one of the most memorable films of the mid 2000's. 4 ½ rat impressions out of 5
9.0~There Are The Few Exceptions Of A Remake Surpassing The Original Film, But This Is One Of Them. Just Too Good To Be True, A Scorsese Comeback Det_McNulty Sign in Permalink Most people are like myself and when they hear of Hollywood remaking another masterpiece from the other side of the globe they will shudder and feel that it can be disrespectful to the original source. Not in the case of Marin Scorsese's The Departed, where he's back on form with what will no doubt be the best film by the end of 2006. When you hear that a master like Scorsese is going to direct a film like The Departed you suddenly get overwhelmed with the knowledge that you know it will be something special. The Departed is based on an Asian cop Vs criminal film named Infernal Affairs that since 2002 has managed to spawn 2 sequels and now the remake The Departed. When a director like Scorsese gets on a project like The Departed you know that you're in for a treat and with its wonderful cast you're going to be hard done not be impressed. There is a certain responsibility The Departed has and that's the fact it has to be respectful to Infernal Affairs and no steal the film's original premise. It has to keep the original story, but remember to make it individual and unique. So The Departed pays respect to Infernal Affairs while adding the needed significant changes and that's where The Departed succeeds. Whether you hate remakes or not all goes out the window because the film becomes a unique piece of work that only Scorsese could have done. Many other directors would have felt inclined to stay close to the tight knitted story, but Scorsese adds many changes and development so that he can make the work his own. My favourite aspect of the film is the intense proportion of skill in the acting from the entire cast of greats. The acting is the most dominant part of the film and you become so absorbed by the characters that you'll forget about the film's two and a half hour running time. Every single actor and actress has a personality and a certain technique to their character which helps you come to understand them better. The enhanced range of styles and wonderful capabilities everyone shows just how much time and effort was put into the film. The cast includes the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio who's performance is in fact the best of his career and also the best the performance the film has to offer, he truly succeeds at holding the film together. You've also got other excellent performances from Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and the gritty performance from Ray Winstone. Mixing crime and drama perfectly the film sets out to be a modern masterpiece of the cop Vs criminal genre. The technique used to tell the story is brilliant and smoothly paced; it's a distinctive style that has a trademark stamped all over it. The original soundtrack is one that perfect suits the scenes it accompanies and the stark direction captures the crime perfectly. There are many powerful moments to accompany the film and it is at times quite heartfelt. From start to finish you become gripped to the intelligent and intense plot line. There's also a psychological element to the film and moral subtext to the characters, which is terrific. In the end The Departed does become a better film than Infernal Affairs and this owed to the original otherwise The Departed would have been a lost case. One of the best films of the last few years, a must see for anybody interested in film and for the sheer entertainment value this film has to offer.
8.0~pretty good adaptation etl33 Sign in Permalink quite good. a little more violent than the hk original though; Scorsese shock value which actually works. plus a bit more humor to spice it up. though i liked both movies, the original turned out to be more suspenseful while this one was the grittier drama. Mark Wahlberg steals the show whenever he's on screen. And his character wasn't even in the original movie. All the major actors did a splendid job. From Alec to Wahlberg, everybody turned in one of their most memorable performances. However, the role of the shrink is just pushing it. Just way too incredible that she's been sleeping with the two guys who are after each other. They could have done away with this subplot, just like in the original. can't say it's Scorsese's best work though. If we are talking crime drama, Goodfellas and Casino are the still the jewels.
3.0~And the Oscar for worst swearing in a movie goes to... floyd-52 Sign in Permalink this otherwise very mediocre movie. Look, I don't care if it is a remake or not -- not an issue. Both Thomas Crown movies were good, for example. But I am frankly sickened that this movie won best picture, and that Scorsese won his (body-of-work) Oscar for this piece of literal dung. It reminds me of Sean Penn winning for Mystic River when he should have won for I Am Sam. Wahlberg was off the scale unrealistic. Not at all impressive acting. I may have to move him to the always-avoid category I've affectionately dubbed the Revolta zone. Nicholson was great, as always. He can truly make any movie work and become successful. So where was his supporting nomination? Damon was OK, given his character's ridiculous behavior (I blame the director and script). Ditto for DiCaprio, who put amazing effort into this lost cause. This movie has hundreds and hundreds of swear words. Some are EXTREMELY ugly. Virtually all are gratuitous and do NOT help this movie. The lowest of these words make this movie unfit for repeated viewing -- and that is a crime. I blame the super ordinary scriptwriter who shall remain nameless and hopefully career-less. This movie is overly graphic in places. Add to that a sound track that is one of the worst I have ever heard -- boring, mostly, except when a gun is fired or a body hits the ground. By the way, the best scene involved the ringing phones (and nary an expletive). All in all, this movie is disgraceful, Mr. Scorsese. You have made some good movies, (and some excellent commentaries), but this one is unfit for human consumption. 2* out of 4* for those not put off by sickening amounts of swearing and gratuitous violence.
6.0~The Good & Bad Of 'The Departed' ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink THE GOOD - A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, ---- (the only female with many lines), Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone give superb support. My favorite was Winstone, a guy I'm familiar with from "Sexy Beast" and "The Proposition." Despite the length of this movie, it keeps your interest all the way. I never got more bored... BUT.... THE BAD - ....I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less about that, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it, such as too much action can numb you. It just wasn't necessary to have it said THAT many times, and by practically everybody in the film. That's my other main complaint: every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. He's pathetic. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life as you must be. OVERALL - Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess. If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot.
10.0~Excellent Movie, Big Names. wells-ethan1995 Sign in Permalink The Departed is yet another brilliant film directed by Martin Scorsese. With actors like Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, who would expect anything less than perfection. The Departed has a little bit of everything to keep everybody interested and entertained for the duration of the film. It has the gritty comedy from Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Jack Nicholson, the dramatics that Matt and Leo bring to the movie and the brilliant scripting and writing, by William Monahan, Alan Mak and Felix Chong, that keeps you on your toes, and unsure on who's side you're on. All in all The Departed is an amazing film, I suggest that if you haven't watched it, watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again.
9.0~An Instant Scorsese Classic, Nicholson Dominates... tharnax Sign in Permalink "The Departed" will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with "GoodFellas" in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay. This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film "Internal Affairs"(2002) of which "The Departed" is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg. The screenplay for "The Departed" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director. Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he "adopts" the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries. Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's "Gangs Of New York" and 2004's "Tha Aviator") as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in "Good Will Hunting" complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced. Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer. The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets. "The Departed" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala "The Sopranos". Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date.
2.0~senility contest between Nicholson and Scorcese fraisselaurent Sign in Permalink What a boring piece of ... This is the movie Scorcese shouldn't have made. He is just ranting around, doing what he has already done thousands of times before, but this time without and style or talent. You might like this one if you're not familiar with his previous work, or if you hadn't watched Infernal Affairs before... but if you did, i'm afraid you cannot find anything to save this unnecessary remake. The worst thing is that Scorcese completely misses the point of the original movie. It even looks like he didn't understand it. Important parts are strangely removed while unnecessary long, boring and ridiculous scenes are added. And the scenes you can find in the original are just soullessly duplicated here. None of the actors are on par with their HK counterparts, but it may not be only their fault. Where IA displays subtle characters, The Departed has only gross caricatures to offer... I think the only good thing in this movie is that people unaccustomed to HK cinema may want to know what the original looks like, and thus discover great actors, especially Leung Chiuwai and Wong Chausang, and a brisk, neat and efficient movie. One last thing : Nicholson is definitely a buffoon
10.0~The Lines Are Certainly Blurred wisemantonofski Sign in Permalink Wracked with an intense atmosphere of paranoia and unapologetically gritty realism, Scorsese's brilliantly adapted remake is a cunning game of cat and mouse while the mouse also plots to destroy the cat and the audience is left unsure of who to root for. This urbanly stylistic piece is a salute to the classic gangster movies of old, brutally entertaining as it is frustratingly perplexing, a true Scorsesean crime drama classic.
8.0~Tight, intense thriller mstomaso Sign in Permalink The best cast of the year 2007 makes this Americanized adaptation of an original Hong Kong film (Internal Affairs) shine. William Monahan's adapted screenplay has been nominated for an Academy Award, the film is nominated for best picture, Scorsese for best director, and there are a couple other nominations out - somewhat inexplicably including Mark Wahlburg for supporting actor for his roles in this film. Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm). But the Academy won't give him an Oscar for this, especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran (Arkin). While I do not think this is Scorsese's best film, nor the best film of the year, it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time. The film is set in Boston, and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film's believability. Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination, the film's slightly absurd pace (DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3-4months???) the film is not a character study, and, rather, relies on archetypes of good cop/bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards, opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game. DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime, Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss (Nicholson) infiltrating the police. Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both. Damon also gives a nice, edgy, though a little detached performance, and stalwarts Nicholson, Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years. The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration (and surprisingly - are only over-done by actors who have lived in Boston!). The acting is generally outstanding. The cinematography is above average - there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts, but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera. The direction is, as with most Scorsese work, tight, economical and clean. The script is excellent, and, in my opinion, is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar. Contrary to some opinions I have seen here, I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film. In fact, if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound. Excellent film, well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays.
10.0~A triumph daveysnoek Sign in Permalink Scorsese spend a lot of years lingering on different projects. Gangs of new York was okay, The aviator was quite good but every fan of Marty was secretly hoping for a new crime flick from the master. And this is the one! The Departed is brilliant. Absolutely stunning. Like Goodfellas, it's one of those rare movies where everything just..works. The acting is amazing. I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that. His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away. Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police. And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance. Jack radiates menace, madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello. A true legend at work. And he hasn't lost his touch. There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations. And for this he will undoubtedly get his thirteenth. In the supporting roles Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver the goods. Wahlberg is a scene stealer with some of the best lines and he has fabulous chemistry with both Sheen and Baldwin. Ray Winstone also shines as Costello's right hand man, Mr French. His part in this movie is overlooked in many reviews. But it is a golden one. The crew knocked this out of the park once again. The camera-work looks effortlessly smooth and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is impeccable. To top it off there is a very strong soundtrack with the indestructible Scorsese-favorite Gimme Shelter. The Departed is Scorsese rising back to the up. even though he was never really away.
3.0~Poor, in a rush and not a well acted US remake... fczenit Sign in Permalink Was Martin Scorsese even awake when the editing was done for this movie? All respect to the man (good director), but I haven't seen such poorly made remake since... well never. The original "Internal Affairs" (Hong Kong), was very good (not brilliant) but solid in every way; acting, script, special effect etc. This new US version (wtf is the Irish mafia???)... Is to say the least below par, but if being honest is absolutely terrible. Acting: 4/10 Script: identical to original (except evil Irish Mafia) Special Effects: 2/10 Even the combination of Dicaprio, Damon, Sheen, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Winstone, Baldwin and others (how the hell did they manage to get them all together, director's name I suppose.) could not have saved this movie from being a flop. Throughout the whole movie I felt like, the director was under pressure to finish the movie in the hurry (and even here it gone all wrong it took 2+ hours). The only positive was the music, and the fact that everyone died, apart from that don't waste your time with this version get the HK original.
7.0~how do you feel about the ending? MatijaR Sign in Permalink OK. i'm opening this topic cause i'm having mixed feelings about the ending of the movie. when i'm talking about the ending, i'm talking about the part from the moment Leonardo realizes that Damon is a rat in the force, and on. first of all - why does Leo run away? makes no sense for him to run and then later tries to "arrest" Damon. why doesn't he go straight to Baldwin?! 2. what's the thing with the yellow envelope?!? he gives it to psychiatrist and then...what? no sense, again. 3. everybody get's killed. after seeing Goodfellas (imdb auto corrected the name) and the casino i can understand that Scorsese likes to kill everybody on the end. but in this point, it makes no sense! what was i watching for 2 hours if on the end - no one wins? the mobs get wiped out, the good guy, the bad guy, innocent people (like the black cop). why? i mean, what's the point of executing everybody? who won? what have i learned in this movie? if you ask me, a great movie with perfect performance, almost unseen quality acting crew, interesting story during all of the movie... and it gets destroyed on the ending showing us that actually there is no winner. it just has NO ENDING. that frustrated me, a lot. 2 more questions. why in the name of god would Wahlberg kill Damon??? unless of course it was Wahlberg who "got killed" in front of an elevator by Damon. i'm not sure of that. first i thought it was him, but then my friend said it's not true, that it is another cop. 2nd question. if Damon "wasn't the only one" working for Nicholson in the force, what did the other guy do? what ever Nicholson did, what ever he needed help with, Damon was the one who would tip him off and save his ass. so what the f..k did the other mole do for Nicholson? my opinion after a long conversation with my friend: the end is not Scorsese's work. i think the producers said "ok, we want it to be this way" and it had to be like that. cause a disturbing and illogical ending like this is nothing like Scorsese. i just can't believe it's so. i gave this movie a "7" just for the ending. unfortunately i will always remember it as "could-of-been-a-master-piece" but didn't cause the ending was destroyed it. hope to see a directors cut. cheers all!
10.0~Modern Scorsese? Best Scorsese! jmateog Sign in Permalink A flawless movie. Spectacular performances from an esemble conformed by DiCaprio, Sheen, Farmiga, Whalberg, Baldwin, Damon and of course the great Jack Nicholson, who by the way deserved an Oscar nomination for this one, what was the Academy thinking? Anyway, the story is the tipical "Scorsese type" but in this case set in Boston. There is no place to boredom here, you can find plot twist, deaths, chases, monologues, great music and emotional moments that deserve your time. Every each scene has something unique, whether is the great acting, the marvelous music (Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd) or the exquisite dialogue. However, there is one factor that made this movie my favorite of all time, and that is the camera of MARTIN SCORSESE. If you want know why this man is considered among the best directors of all time you need to study this movie. DYNANISM is the word, Scorsese is not telling you again the usual mob story, in this movie he is guiding you through an experience of mystery, fun, excitement, violence, love and betrayel. Scorsese made all the scenes worth watchable in this movie, and if you feel I exaggerating too much, wait until to see the end.
9.0~Definitely worth the ticket price cjpat Sign in Permalink "The departed" was the best movie I've seen in months, and that means something coming from a guy who milks netflix for all it's worth. While some viewers may be put off by the violence that is prevalent throughout the movie the true film connoisseur sees that the vulgarity is artful and masterful. Matt Damon performs in what may be his finest role to date and there were stellar performances by Wahlberg, Nicholson, and even, though I'm loathe to say it, Leonardo Dicaprio. What really makes this movie work is the comedic dialogue juxtaposed against what is a truly gritty and harsh story. I can't reveal more than that without spoiling part of the story but trust me when I say that you'll be chuckling at some of the lines if you've got a funny bone in your body. In conclusion, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Scorcese, organized crime, drama, action, or Boston. Honestly if none of those things interest you I'd steer clear of this one, but in reality I doubt if your reading this that that caveat applies.
10.0~Stay until the credits roll, fans of the original michaelplewa Sign in Permalink Sometimes you see a movie in which everybody is so thrilled to be putting on this show, that their sheer joy in entertaining you explodes from the screen and burrows into the audience's collective imagination. You can tell that these actors, these filmmakers, everybody involved in this production, you can tell they were busting at the seams with excitement. Nobody was ashamed of their influences here; Jack Nicholson's character is a giddy rebirth of Johnny Friendly from ON THE WATERFRONT, oozing menace and self-entitlement. William Monahan takes Siu Fai Mak's excellent script and bumps up the humor, the tragedy...yeah, and a whole lot of Boston slang. There's a sheen of Hollywood artifice that some might decry but that I think contributes to the thrill of the show; after all, we know all these guys are playing make-believe anyway, right? Who cares if a soundstage in New York is subbing for a bachelor loft with a view of a Boston landmark? Point is, this movie has so much going for it, even what it doesn't have going for it works for it anyway. Fans of the Hong Kong original will immediately note the difference in endings, and I'm still deliberating this one. !!!! SPOILER !!!! Damon getting popped in the end is, supposedly, the "right" thing. However, it means that his lover betrayed him, or did she? See, what ambiguity it robs from the original's ending it adds in a new shade. Does this mark the return of Scorcese? It certainly is a very good sign, if it is a sign, of things to come. I for one hope this isn't the last kind of this film he does. He knows how to make these toughs work on screen...it's a rare gift.
1.0~Why The Divide In Loving Or Hating The Film - Its Like Marmite gurmcorp Sign in Permalink I have watched a number of Asian films over the past few years and have found them to be refreshing in the ideas they present to an audience as opposed to Hollywood where the majority of films seem to either be bogged down by having a special effects budget that needs filling or a complete act of mindless violence which can pass the time with some occasional thrill seeking. I can understand the need for the latter form of film, it can be entertaining to a degree but that is all it can provide, a simple short term solution. The basis and overall genius of "The Departed" lies in the fact that it cloned a pre-existing masterpiece that provides more than a short term fix of a film. The original Infernal Affairs (on which The Departed is almost completely based on, and not just inspired by as Scorsese has stated)is a brilliant film, it stays in your mind and makes you think, its not a quick fix or light form of entertainment but a gripping and involving story between two men and their struggle to deal with the blurred boundaries of right and wrong. I honestly read no reviews before watching the departed and had no idea it was based upon Infernal Affairs. I sat down expecting something good, I mean goodfellas was excellent so I assumed The Departed would be at least an on parr as Mr Scorseses previous works, but as the the film progressed I realised what the story was and that I had been greatly mistaken. It copied Infernal Affairs and at each scene my heart sank lower and lower as I felt the sheer mess the director had made of the originals work. Soo much about this film was wrong, it felt wrong, as if someone had stolen a beautiful piece of art and exchanged it for a toilet roll! I understand why people like the film, and the majority of those that do have probably not seen the original. If you have I think you will agree it is a superior movie in almost all aspects, I mean it was one of Hong Kongs most popular movies of all time. Had it not been for my partner being from Hong Kong and urging me to watch some of Asia's finest films I admit I probably would never have watched Infernal Affairs and would therefore have ignorantly liked the departed and voted it in the top 250 movies. It doesn't deserve it, I plead with you to watch the original and see for yourselves, you will not be disappointed, if anything you can watch the sequels and progress your love of the plot even further. I realise my rating of the Departed is low but that is mainly out of respect to the original, I couldn't believe that Scorsese didn't even properly accredit Infernal Affairs well at least a large proprtion of the population still have no idea its a remake, what was he thinking! Anyway enough ranting basically you love The Departed because its a great story with great scenes and ideas and the cast does manage to carry off their individual performances well, especially Mr Nicholson who I found to be the only redeeming feature of the film. I feel for a remake to be justified it needs to at least add somethng new to the original material and provide the audience with a novel and unique perspective into the film. The departed i felt actually detracted from the original and did in no way improove upon the original. This leads on to why people hate it because it cloned a great story and some great scenes and ideas from another great film and in the majority of the movie it actually removed the strength and impact of certain scenes through a poor level of re-interpretations and lazy mundane camera work. Its obvious what side of the marmite divide im on but i do feel the quality of Infernal Affairs far surpasses that of The Departed, Even though the latters budget was substantially higher.
7.0~The movie is 'over-designed'... mhetter Sign in Permalink The movie is unfortunately 'over-designed'. Its happening too much, with too many twists, but without being intelligent. Additionally, the role of Vera Farmiga is this movie is totally meaningless , it does not help the plot at all. Its simply stupid. She does not get suspicious, she is, in an unmotivated way, starting a relationship with her patient, she has no character (here, its not a fault of the actor). Furthermore, I got annoyed that everybody is shot in the head and that some of the policeman can only talk in a 'funny' cursing way. Besides that, Leonardo di Caprio plays his role unexpectedly well. One really believes his inner fight. Also, like almost always, Jack Nicholson is brilliant.
10.0~An Excellent,Unforgettable Epic Gangster Film/Crime Drama/Thriller Remake. Another Martin Scorsese Classic. jcbutthead86 Sign in Permalink The Departed is an excellent and unforgettable Epic Gangster Film and Crime Drama/Thriller remake that combines amazing direction,great performances from the cast,a terrific script and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make The Departed not only a great Gangster film and remake but another Martin Scorsese Classic. Set in the Soutn Boston neighborhood of Boston,Massachusetts,The Departed tells the story of police officer Billy Costigan(Leonardo Dicapro)who's been asked by his superiors to undercover and work for a vicious local Gangster and crime boss Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson)and his organization. While undercover,Billy is unaware that there is another cop working for Costello,Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon),a State police detective who is selling information to Costello from the police department. With Billy and Colin both working for Frank will one of them discover each other identities or will one of them become a member of The Departed? The Departed is a brilliant and thrilling Crime Drama Thriller that saw Martin Scorsese return to the genre Scorsese is best known for the Gangster film after two great period dramas Gangs Of New York(2002)and The Aviator(2004). The Departed won Oscars for Best Picture and most importantly Best Director for Martin Scorsese although many agree that Scorsese should've won for his earlier masterworks such as Raging Bull,GoodFellas and Taxi Driver but that doesn't stop The Departed from being the great film that it is. Right from the opening The Departed is an amazing film and an instant Scorsese classic that has you mesmerized and glued to the screen giving viewers a film that intense and powerful and will have viewers on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next and there is constant intrigue going on throughout the but done in a no holds barred style that Scorsese does so well. The Departed is a Gangster film that is rooted in the spirit of Film Noir where the attitudes of the main characters is tough and cynical and the tone and atmosphere is dark and where streets in this film is brutal and cops and criminals only follow the law of the gun. Where as Scorsese's other Gangster film took place in Scorsese's hometown New York City (GoodFellas,Mean Streets)or in Las Vegas(Casino),The Departed takes place on the mean streets of South Boston where the crime world in South Boston isn't as flashy as New York(in terms of clothes and how they live)or other big cities in terms of style but still has the same violent viciousness as it's other big city counterparts and where the Irish Mob and Frank Costello's crew is working class,gritty and people you don't want to mess with. The Crime world in South Boston has a style on it's own. The Departed not only succeeds as a great Gangster film but a great remake of the incredible Asian Crime Drama Infernal Affairs(2002)and while The Departed adapts the plot Infernal Affairs Scorsese's film works as it's own film. The two main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are great characters because with Costigan being undercover and Sullivan being an informant you see these two dealing with guilt,fear and a sense of dread of someone discovering who the two really are and working for Frank Costello adding to the suspense of the film because while you may not always like the them as people or the things that they do but you will be in their shoes. The violence in The Departed is classic Scorsese because the violence is vicious and brutal and when the film gets bloody the red plasma comes off the screen in dark fashion. If you've seen Scorsese's Goodfellas and Casino you know kind of violence is going to be in this film. The screenplay by William Monahan is terrific,with Monahan giving the film gritty and memorable dialog that feels realistic and reflects the style and tone of South Boston and has characters that are unforgettable. The ending of The Departed is fantastic and memorable because it's shocking and darkly humorous. A great ending to this wonderful film. The whole cast is amazing Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Billy Costigan,with DiCaprio bringing intensity,depth and energy to the role. Matt Damon is brilliant as Colin Sullivan,bringing power and believability to the role. Jack Nicholson is amazing and at his maniacal best as Frank Costello,with Nicholson being intimidating and funny at the same time. Mark Wahlberg is terrific as Sgt. Dignam,with Wahlberg saying great one liners and stealing scenes. Martin Sheen is great as Capt. Queenan,Costgan's boss. Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr. French,Francis' right hand man. Vera Farminga is wonderful as Madolyn,Colin's girlfriend and Billy's psychiatrist. Alec Baldwin is outstanding and funny as Capt. Ellerby,a hyperactive cop. Anthony Anderson(Trooper Brown),Kevin Corrigan(Cousin Sean),James Badge Dale(Trooper Barrigan),David Patrick O'Hara(Fitzy),Mark Rolston(Delhunt),Robert Wahlberg(Lazio-FBI)and Kristen Dalton(Gwen)give good performances as well. The direction by Martin Scorsese is excellent and stylish,with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style with terrific shots and camera angles. Great direction,Scorsese. The score by Howard Shore is fantastic and intense matching the mood and tone of the film. The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Let It Loose),Roger Waters,Van Morrison,The Band(Comfortably Numb),The Dropkick Murphys(I'm Shipping Off To Boston),Patsy Cline(Sweet Dreams(Of You),Roy Buchanan(Sweet Dreams),John Lennon(Well,Well,Well),Nas(Thief's Theme),The Beach Boys(Sail On,Sailor)The Allman Brothers Band(One Way Out),Badfinger(Baby Blue),The Human Beinz(Nobody But Me),Lavern Baker(Tweedle Dee)and Joe Cuba(Bang Bang). Wonderful soundtrack. In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Crime Thrillers or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Departed,an excellent,unforgettable epic Gangster Film Crime Drama/Thriller that is another Martin Scorsese classic and is a film you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.
3.0~The "DEPARTED" has left the building iamstevep Sign in Permalink If you're into blood sprayback, bigotry,racism, and misogyny, then this is the movie for you. Jack nicholson gives his standard routine of eye rolls. Wahlburg is a highlight in the acting venue. The star power cast is highly wasted in this blood fest. Matt damon is a wasted talent in this flick. Leonardo is believable but his talent is muted by the storyline. Alec baldwin and Martin sheen are a long way from being Hollywood icons if they continue to jump on a bandwagon created by the likes of Scorcesse. This flick was drawn out. It was also typical Hollywood plot line. Furthermore, it was a gasp at creating a teenage audience for the likes of producers.
9.0~The Departed FilmGuy34567 Sign in Permalink Scorsese returns to his old form in "Goodfellas" and Mean Streets" with this tense thriller, about two men who are both moles for the police and mafia, respectively and how their lives crisscross. There is a duality to these characters, they are at once opposite and the same, but working on different ends of the spectrum. This is what creates the tension of the film, not to mention the brutal depictions of mob violence and ethnic nationalism. Scorsese embodies a modern crime thriller here, but explores the same themes of his previous films, such as isolation, redemption, and betrayal. It's exciting and morally relevant, a power punch of a thriller boosted by fine performances from DiCaprio and Nicholson especially.
10.0~Best Movie I have Ever Seen mikebrownemail Sign in Permalink This film has a long runtime, but I have watched it a total of 11 times. I love it. It is literally the best movie that I have ever seen. The performances are flawless, every last one of them. As an actor, I felt so fueled and inspired by each and every character choice and performance by the actors. By the end of the movie I felt like I knew these characters, because of how much actual character work must have gone into them by the actors themselves. I will carry this film and the brilliantly crafted characters that the actors created with me for a lifetime. A huge acting and film making influence, and for me the best film ever created. See it, it is unforgettable, and I hope you feel the same way about it. The only way you could dislike it is to not have a brain.
6.0~Do u know the word plagiarism...well it is a very light accusation (voted with a 6 deserved -10) rallierf1 Sign in Permalink It is a 100% copy of the Internal Affairs movie so actually there is nothing original about it. I watched both movies back to back and compared them and not only i found that it was thoroughly copied but also this high paid cast wasn't a match for the Chinese actors which were really embodied in the roles. If u think u liked that movie i pity you because u actually lost the opportunity to really enjoy the real masterpiece (INTERNAL AFFAIRS). Damn it seems that Hollywood has run out of original ideas completely!!!! As soon as i watched the first few scenes i realized that it was a duplicate and knew exactly what would happen in the movie. IF I could RATE IT SUB-ZERO I WOULD!!! I ONLY REGISTERED JUST TO WRITE THIS ONE COMMENT BECAUSE I FIND IT DISGRACEFUL FROM Hollywood!!!!
10.0~Oh my god!! Do Not Miss!! loganalexa-1 Sign in Permalink Wow! I saw this movie the day it came out and it was all I expected and MORE!! Of course it had to be good with Scorsese directing, and starring Nicholson, DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, etc. But, man, this movie had all the nail biting suspense and awesome action as Goodfellas! I almost can't come up with the words. All I can say is this had better win some Oscars, especially for Scorsese and DiCaprio, they both deserve them. Everyone must go see The Departed!! Now, I do agree with the last comment, though, if you have a weak stomach or don't like violence then this is definitely not the movie for you. But if you can appreciate the way Scorsese does violence (he is the best at it, in my opinion) then DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!!!
10.0~To our fatefully departed reyes_a Sign in Permalink I just finish watching The Departed for the second time, and although I rarely ever write a review here at IMDb I felt compelled to put my thoughts into words and share them. I believe TD is an excellent film. Seeing Leonardo grow into himself an play an amazing believable character as an rat with a conscience is amazing, good on him. Nicholson is amazing like always, trowing coke at hoos !!!! jajajajaj great ! Even good ol Marky Mark plays a deep caracther ... you hate him at the beginning but at the end he delivers .... 10 point to MM. And last mr. Damon is alright, I don't really like him that much so the fact that he plays the real f... at goes very well, good on mr Martin for a tremendous job, or should I say in a common term in these section... a tour de force !
1.0~There were rats. Because this movie was foul. nicktokar Sign in Permalink Where do I begin with explaining how awful this movie is? First of all, I think the entire plot was written and constructed by a rat being let loose on a keyboard typing up random crap and auto- correct turn groups of letters into words, which ended up as a "plot." Let's start with the casting. They took as many big-budget actors that they could find who would be willing to join them and gave them a role. Let's take Damon and DiCaprio for example. They play two characters who are supposed to be each other's foil and yet, the two actors look so alike they are almost indistinguishable other than the fact that DiCaprio has a bit of facial hair. I normally love Jack Nicholson, but he was a bit weak and not right for his part. Onto the main part of the movie that really was the downfall, which would be the overall plot. I would be amazed if any person on the planet was able to fully grasp this overly complex plot the very first time they watch it. The first part that was utterly ridiculous was at early parts of the film, DiCaprio, who is supposed to be an undercover cop severely beats up people for no obvious reason. At the bar he gets one insult from a person and smashes a glass over his head. I don't think that is part of an undercover cop's duty. Later, He beats two random people from Providence, again for no obvious reason. Somehow Nicholson's character learns about this, so what does he do, He smashes DiCaprio's already broken hand with a shoe. But the really smart part is the fact that DiCaprio is more than willing to befriend the guy who just injured his broken hand. Is Nicholson really just going to let him into his crew that quickly? You would think not, but whatever. Later in the movie DiCaprio even tells the characters played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg that they have the evidence to convict Nicholson, but they don't think they have enough evidence even though they know him to run a large scale operation with includes selling drugs, micro-processors, and killing people. And its not like Nicholson is trying to hide or anything. Just arrest the guy for crying out loud! Later in the movie we see that Wahlberg's character is forced to step down from his position for reasons that the movie failed to explain. Then for some reason they decide to have Damon, who is one of the newest members of the team, lead the case on Nicholson. Here comes the second most confusing part of the film (Yes it will get more confusing). During some kind of cocaine exchange the cops show up where a big gunfight follows. Nicholson is injured in the fight then reveals to Damon that he has is an FBI informant. Wait... What?!? You're trying to tell me that for the past several decades, Nicholson has been working as an FBI informant? Many unanswered questions arise from this situation: 1) How and why is an FBI agent running one of the largest organized crime groups in the city. He's killed people, sold illegal contraband and this goes unpunished by his superiors at the FBI? 2) What kind of information is he trying to get if he's supposed to be an informant? What is he trying to accomplish? 3) At the very beginning, we see him recruit Damon at the age of 12. Why is he allowed to recruit people, especially kids, for his crime group? Moving on to the very end of the film, we now find the most confusing part. DiCaprio tells Damon to meet him on a roof so he can arrest him, which he does. But for some reason another cop shows up on the roof from the request of DiCaprio, but he sees DiCaprio as the bad guy. Damon and DiCaprio go down the elevator, DiCaprio is immediately killed by some random guy I don't recall ever seeing, then he kills the other officer who came down by stairs, then Damon kills the guy who killed DiCaprio and the other cop. At this point of the movie I am completely lost. All I know is that people are killing people for no logical reason. At the very end of the movie, we see Damon walking into his apartment and Wahlberg is waiting for him and shoots him. Then here comes the most brilliant piece of symbolism in cinematic history, a RAT is shown walking across the balcony of Damon's apartment. Yes, a rat. Because that has to be the most clever and least cliché metaphors I have ever seen (sarcasm fully implied) because they only said the word 'rat' about 100 times during the movie. Complaints continued: 1) This incredibly long 2 1/2 hour long movie is paced so poorly. They spend an incredibly long time on the parts that have no significance to the plot, and the parts that make no sense, they either barely touch on it or don't explain it at all (I don't need to have the plot spoon fed to me, but there is a certain point where there does need to be some explanation within the movie). 2) There is this sort of 'love triangle' going on with Damon, DiCaprio, and a psychiatrist, which adds nothing to the plot other than to make the movie longer. 3) By the end of the movie, there are 3 characters who had screen time that ended up surviving. Basically every important character ends up dead. 4) Scorsese's portrayal of violence is glorified and unrealistic. Overall, I would definitely consider this one of the worst movies I have ever seen and would not recommend this movie even if you were bored out of your mind.
3.0~less is more dranonyme Sign in Permalink I am an admirer of Mr. Scorsese's work as a filmmaker and cultural documentarian, so it was perhaps with heightened expectations destined to fall short of the mark that I went to see The Departed. Scorsese is an actor's director, and with a cast that includes the abundance of great players assembled for this project, it was hard to imagine how this film could be anything less than exceptional. In my view -- which is evidently a minority view -- it was quite a bit less, and I left the theater frustrated to have endured such a spectacular waste of talent and resources, signifying nothing -- or at least nothing we haven't previously seen from the director in Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Gangs of New York, echoing a Jenny Holzer truism from the '70's,"killing is unavoidable, but nothing to be proud of." Against the emerging vogue for "Indie" films, Scorsese has been one to embrace their antithesis, and he has the clout to summon the financial resources to do whatever he pleases, which has resulted in recent films that aspire to be large, almost as an end in itself. The Gangs of New York and The Aviatior epitomized this trend, exploiting successfully the wonderment that historical films can bring to the imagined past with figures larger than life. Viva Visconti. However, this inflated sensibility falls flat on the mean streets of South Boston in this interminable playing out of double-subterfuge, in which characters (more like caricatures) play out their appointed roles with a noticeable absence of subtlety or nuance. Nicholson is a parody of himself (though wonderful to watch even at his most absurd), Matt Damon seems unintentionally oblivious to the darkness of Colin Sullivan's soul--we have no idea of what makes him tick beyond the small favors offered in the opening scene, while Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen--wonderful actors all--play out their stereotypes with little psychological resonance. Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is one of the finest dramatic actors of his generation, but there is no catharsis in the inevitable outcome, which takes an impossibly long time to occur. The big surprise is Vera Farmiga, who displays exquisite emotional range and complexity, and should emerge as a formidable female lead worthy of serious dramatic roles, which are sure to come to her (with some help from the NY Times Magazine, which extolled her talents last month -- legitimately, it appears -- in a cover story.) The film also includes a great supporting cast of colorful thugs. But you sit through all the twists and turns of this interminably complex narrative feeling that you're looking at the work of a masterful technician whose infatuation with his cinematic virtuosity has become an end in itself, trumping his capacity, in spite of this film's pretentious title, to tell a meaningful or compelling story, which is easy enough to forget once you have exited the theater. I remember when I saw Taxi Driver for the first time, not having a clue what it was about in advance. I left the theater rattled, irate, and a bit unhinged, wondering how anybody make a move that was such an assault on my expectations and sensibilities. It was unnerving, politically disturbing, and ultimately a profound expression of the Nixon years--certainly one of the best films of its time. I was fairly unnerved also when I waked out of the Departed, feeling that it was much ado about nothing, a waste of fissionable talent, wishing that I could have departed sooner. Perhaps like Bunuel's Exterminating Angel, Scorsese wanted to see how much misery he could put the viewer through while keeping him squirming in his seat.
7.0~Great, but can't better the original. guanyu Sign in Permalink First things first. I watched The Departed before watching Infernal Affairs. So I had absolutely no idea of what to expect from TD. Colin Sullivan is a criminal undercover in the Massachusetts state police. Billy Costigan, conversely, is a police officer working undercover in the ranks of big shot Irish American gangster Frank Costello. The tension rises as Sullivan is assigned to discover both the mole inside the police and the mole in Costello's crew -- while Costigan tries desperately to discover Sullivan's identity. Dicaprio turns in a great performance as the tough-as-nails Billy Costigan. Damon is also great as the more laid-back Sullivan. But the best performances come from Mark Wahlberg as hot-headed staff sergeant Dignam and Jack Nicholson as the irredeemable Frank Costello. But great performances can't elevate the Departed to "Infernal Affairs" levels. The movie is full of pointless subplots (such as the love triangle between Madolyn, Billy and Colin) and re-imagined scenes which can't hold a candle to the originals. Queenan's death, for example, is nowhere near as gut-wrenching as the death of SP Wong in Infernal Affairs. The music ("goodbye, policeman") and suddenness made that scene a real tear-jerker in IA, while the decision to film Queenan's descent in slow-motion damaged unexpected nature of the character's death. It was also a bad idea on Monahan's part to combine the two female characters from IA into one. That Costigan and Sullivan would be seeing the same woman is far too improbable. The ending of TD isn't particularly well-written or directed. Adding another corpse to the elevator bloodbath was unnecessary and made the scene almost comical as the body count increased. The decision to kill off Sullivan at the end was another mistake, negating the entire point of the original story. My main problem, however, is the complete alteration of Yan and Lau's characters. Lau in IA is a decent, albeit misled man who wants nothing more than to leave organised crime behind. While Yan is an internally troubled individual desperate to regain his identity. In TD, Sullivan is almost a comic book villain, working for and against everybody. While Costigan is a wacko who kills people for no apparent reason. It's also worth mentioning the scene where Costello's gang meets with the "Chinese government" guys. Is the extremely negative portrayal of the Chinese (complete with various racial slurs) Hollywood's way of repaying the very people who gave birth to the script?
5.0~Very disappointing; poor writing, hamminess sink it dfranzen70 Sign in Permalink Matt Damon is a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police who's secretly working for Jack Nicholson's gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is a former bad boy deep undercover in Nicholson's gang. But whose side is each really on? And will this end in anything but total, major bloodshed? The answer to the first question is, "Who cares"; to the second, "duh." Like many people, I went into this movie with high expectations, but unlike most (judging from the early returns), I was pretty disappointed with the result. Let's take a look at some of the good and bad points. 1. Martin Scorcese directed it, so I was expecting not only a lot of gunplay and a lot of profanity, but a lucid screenplay. I mean, this is the guy who did Goodfellas, for crying out loud, which this movie should have closely resembled. In case you forgot, he also did Raging Bull and Mean Streets. Now, granted, Scorcese didn't write the script, but cmon. He's got the clout to make changes to it on the set. 2. Jack Nicholson is just all right. I like Jack. (Who doesn't? Seriously.) But nowadays, he plays the same basic character no matter the role, no matter if he's a Good Guy or a Bad Guy. He's Jack. Apparently, Robert DeNiro was approached to play the role of Frank Costello, but he was busy working on his own film, The Good Shepherd. So enter Smilin' Jack, and I dunno; I think DeNiro would have been much, much better. 3.Profanity. No, I like profanity. Love it! Even gratuitously, it's usually perfectly okay. See, for example, the aforementioned Goodfellas. But it seemed here that profanity was used merely to see how many times the f word and c word could be said in a movie. After a while (say an hour), it quickly got tiresome, sounding more like a high school locker room than anything else. 4. Comic relief. Who said there needed to be comic relief? Someone must have thought so, because we had not one but two comic roles: Alec Baldwin's Ellerby and Mark Wahlberg's Dignan. Okay, they weren't there solely for comic relief, but they were given funny lines that seemed wholly incongruous with the rest of the picture. Instead of being a subtle change in direction (you're expecting drama and they shift to comedy), the result is jarring. When the timing is right, it works, but more often than not I wondered what the actors were doing in the same movie as Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon. 5. Damon and DiCaprio. I've never been a huge fan of either one, although I've like Damon's Bourne movies to a degree. I think my primary complaint is that they both perpetually look about sixteen years old, not the kind of persona you want in a purportedly gritty crime drama. They both have more gravitas now than they did, say, ten years ago, but still nowhere near enough to carry the heavy workload, characterwise, that this particular type of movie demands. 6. Accents. The setting is Boston, and most of the leads are playing Irish Americans. Damon, who's from Massachusetts, and DiCaprio sounded fine, but Nicholson's Boston accent came and went - it was usually absent, come to think of it. Like I said, the screenplay didn't feel particularly tight; it's as if the writers (William Monahan and Siu Fai Mak) just borrowed from all of the cop films of the past without providing any nuance to hold interest. For example, there was a subplot involving the girlfriend/fiancée/wife of Damon's character. Why? I'm not saying we shouldn't know anything about her, but she didn't seem to be much of an influence on Damon's character anyway, so why bother with her? Oh, I see, so that we could include a second romantic angle with her and someone else. But why would we want that? Bring on the guns, bring on the cussin, and ditch the romance - it neither enhances the plot or titillates the audience. (Kristin Dalton, who played the love interest in question, didn't turn in much of a performance, but I don't think she exactly had a layer-rich character with which she could work.) Then there's the obligatory sex scene, which should have felt erotic but came off as awkward, as did the two (yes, two) first-date scenes. Bah. Here's a positive remark, though. Kudos to an on-target performance by Martin Sheen, as DiCaprio's boss. Might be his best work in movies in years, kind of an expanded version of his role in Catch Me If You Can, also starring DiCaprio. Another plus, perhaps, is the high body count. Lots of death in this one, and it's not just unknown extras who get whacked. And the deaths are particularly gruesome at times - bullets through the skull, plenty of 'em, leave huge splatters of blood on the back walls of elevators. That sort of thing. A loudmouth audience member to the left of me wailed that it was "just like a Shakespeare play!" True enough, because so many of the main characters of those tragedies were slain, usually quite unceremoniously. So maybe I'm just a grump. Maybe I've reached the point where no movie can satisfy me, particularly when I pay nearly ten bucks to watch it in a theater full of incredibly stupid and/or rude people. Maybe I'm too jaded to appreciate true genius. But I don't think so; I think a year or so from now, we won't even remember The Departed as anything more than a slight footnote to Scorcese's great career.
9.0~Brutal but splendid; a plot to be admired, savored inkblot11 Sign in Permalink In South Boston, one man reigns, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As he himself explains, he rose from poverty, little by little, to become the leader of the leading gang in SB. Naturally, he is a thorn in the side of the Boston Police and they live to bring this man down. A secret task force is formed and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a cleancut boy from South Boston who has graduated from the police academy, is given the special task of infiltrating Frank's mob, pretending to be a sworn follower. This is dangerous work indeed. However, Frank has the same brilliant idea. If the gang had a plant in the police department, above reproach, then he would know when the police are coming to mess up his plans. A disciple from his teens, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the perfect choice; he is bright, good-looking and seemingly genial. He fools most everyone, including the brass (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) and a psychologist (Verma Farmiga). In fact, Colin and the shrink begin a relationship while, at the same time, Cop Sullivan is relaying crucial information to Frank. As such, eventually, Billy and Colin cross paths and get suspicious of one another. Billy even goes after Colin's lady. So, whose "traitor" in the midst will be the most successful? How many lives will be sacrificed? This brutal but splendid film is not really for the most faint of heart. Nevertheless, is ultra-fascinating plot has to be seen to be appreciated. The story even eclipses the GREAT work of Nicholson, Di Caprio, Damon, Farmiga and the entire crew. What a breathtaking twist and turn tale of betrayal and goodness. As many critics have found, this may be the ultimate Scorsese film as his hands are behind every scene. Thrillers come and go but The Departed will stay around for the ages.
8.0~Very good - but not very Goodfellas Mr_PCM Sign in Permalink The Departed is a slow-burning simmering thriller, a tale steeped in deception, and gently, expertly brought to the boil - until a slightly overcooked finish leaving a slightly unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Martin Scorsese's latest is a very well told story by one of the greatest directors of all time, and while the Departed does show exactly why the great man is so highly thought of, it also hints that perhaps he is not quite at the peak of his powers anymore. The film is good, indeed it is very good, but the Oscars for best picture and director feel more like an apology from the Academy for overlooking Raging Bull, and particularly Goodfellas, rather than just recognition for this film. Yes, nobody does gangster films like Scorsese (unless Coppola wants to continue his Godfather saga), but while many directors would be proud to have 'The Departed' in their filmography, Goodfellas was far superior. The dialogue was sharper, the acting crisper, and the story more flowing. Yet the Departed remains an enjoyable film. Largely the feeling of two parallel intertwining stories feels very effective, with both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio providing a great deal of conflict in bringing their lead characters to life. Both are all contradictions - Damon is the cop who is a mole for the mob, and is smooth, charming, but yet somehow slightly bland, whilst DiCaprio as the man from the wrong side of the tracks handpicked for a special undercover assignment as a mole within the mob is a violent thug with a turbulent past but desperate to get his job done. With so much deception, you are never sure who knows what, and, rather appropriately, you feel like rats in a maze. And Scorsese does expertly time the reveals of information and keeps you guessing - but yet something about it feels ever so slightly underwhelming. However the action does heat up nicely towards the final third, with an interesting homage to the original by the use of a scene in Chinatown in Boston, creating some genuine edge-of-the-seat moments, until a rather unexpected conclusion that slightly jars against what has gone before. The acting however is uniformly excellent. One thing that can be said for Scorsese is that he sure can get the best out of DiCaprio, who here produces work to rival that of his portrayal of Amsterdam in Gangs of New York - another Scorsese picture. Damon however seems to be slightly lacking in charisma, although that does not provide a tremendous problem here. But it is the supporting actors who really steal the show. Jack Nicholson as the crime lord produces an atypically restrained performance - never overacting, and producing a quietly menacing performance, relying on his natural gravitas to still fill the screen whenever he is on it. Martin Sheen is as ever a class act, but the show-stealers are Mark Wahlberg as the intensely unlikeable but committed handler, and Alec Baldwin, who is given precious little screen time, but certainly makes the most of his scenes without scenery-chewing antics like those seen in Glengarry Glen Ross. Overall, while this is a worthy addition to the Scorsese canon, the unsatisfactory conclusion and some of the slightly unsatisfying reveals make this feel a somewhat inferior cousin to Goodfellas, rather than a true companion. Yet any other director would be proud of this work, and rightly so, as there is a great deal to take pleasure from. Maybe Scorsese just set his own standards too high for anyone, including himself, to live up to.
5.0~Better than Infernal Affairs, but still more of a mess than it is a masterwork. CuriosityKilledShawn Sign in Permalink Unfortunately there are millions of people out there who will watched this movie with a positive bias as most believe that Martin Scorsese is utterly infallible, but I am strictly in the middle with this director. I know I am going to be totally controversial (and perhaps SHOCKING) when I admit that I really hated Goodfellas. Now, before you immediately vote against my review, just please read on so I can explain myself. I find Goodfellas to be one of the most ridiculously over-rated movies in history (along with DePalma's phenomenally misinterpreted pile of crap Scarface) but I do LOVE Casino. They are almost two sides of the same coin, so you can see how I am split over Scorsese. I saw the original Infernal Affairs a few years ago and I hated it too. Yes, some good moments, but mainly an over-wrought bore. It's not because it is an Asian film, as I often enjoy them, but I just found it to be slightly inaccessible and alienating. Scorsese's remake is easier to identify with but is also a whole 50 minutes longer. The plot has undercover cop Leo Dicaprio infiltrate the Boston Irish Mafia in order to flush out a mole in the Police Department. Matt Damon is that mole and his job is to flush out the undercover cop in the Mafia. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicolson play the respective bosses, lawful and lawless. Within this set-up characters bounce back and forth off each other, swearing, shooting, swearing and swearing. Man, this film is effing hardcore! (Sarcasm!) Asking Jack Nicolson to play evil is like asking a Rottwieler to bark. It's what he does best. 'Ooh, but what about all the subtle nuances?' Come on, it's an easy, easy performance for someone like him and it's nothing you ain't seen him do before. The best performance actually comes from Matt Damon, closely followed by Mark Wahlberg (if you ever had trouble telling the difference between them then don't see this movie). The cinematography is ugly as sin. Scorsese has gone for the same dull as hell color pallet of brown, brown and dark brown he used in Goodfellas. Yes, I know this film is not supposed to be bright, happy colors and blue skies. But if the dank colors are supposed to reflect the gritty realism of the doomed plot threads then they totally contradict the perfectly set-up camera angles. I am not saying that this film could only have been shot in a Paul Greengrass style jitter but a little less and a little more of the former and latter could have set the balance straight. And the plot is completely all over the place. If you get into this movie you'll walk out of the cinema shocked and astonished, which will make you forget about some things that simply don't add up. Since I had already seen Infernal Affairs I didn't gasp at the ending when the rest of the audience sucked the air out of the cinema. I was too busy trying to make sense of it all, but you can't because there are too many holes in it. Remakes are becoming more and more common these days and they are increasingly scoffed at (even when they are really good, such as Dawn of the Dead 2004 or Poseidon) but as soon as apparently unimperfect Martin Scorsese does one most of you turn a blind eye to the fact that the film is near-enough a shot-for-shot remake itself. I don't think it took a great amount of talent to crank out a film like this. And where the hell the $90 million budget went to is the REAL mystery! But lads will love it. The screening I went to was sold out to many groups of 10 or 15 guys and metrosexuals with their blonde girlfriends. I am mentioning this because The Departed (like 2004's Crash) is a film that philistines go to see because it makes them feel clever. Sort of like penance for watching crud like When a Stranger Calls or The Fog. I just wish that people would find THEIR OWN good movies instead of always choosing what everyone else likes. Which is the only reason I can give for Goodfellas being so mysteriously well-regarded. Martin Scorsese is not the Mafia expert he thinks he is. Boston is not his turf. It's not a world I think he understands. And the result is a cartoonish, exaggerated shoot-em-up in which every character is lined up for the sole purpose of eventually being gunned down.
9.0~And the Oscar goes to... hall895 Sign in Permalink Well, Martin Scorsese finally got his Oscar. Long overdue. Some may quibble and say the film for which he was rewarded was not his best. Those who say that may have a point. But that's really not important. The questions which must be asked are whether this film is worthy of being an Oscar winner and worthy of being forever remembered as the film which broke the infamous Scorsese Oscar curse. The answers to those questions? Resoundingly yes. The Departed stands in its own right as a remarkable film, one of the best to come along in quite some time and clearly worthy of any and all awards it has received. Maybe not Scorsese's best but if not it's pretty darned close. Where to begin? So many different things come together to make The Departed the standout film that it is. There's a great story, a terrific cast full of big-name performers clearly on top of their games, wonderful visuals, a perfect soundtrack...all capped by that unique Scorsese touch. In this film Scorsese goes back to the familiar world of organized crime. This time the mobsters are Irish rather than Italian and the story unfolds in Boston rather than New York but it will all seem rather familiar to the Scorsese devotee. But this is not just another Scorsese mob movie. It's as intense and gritty and violent as you would expect but The Departed is quite unique, thanks mostly to the wonderfully involved and intricate story which unfolds in the film. For everything else the film has going for it in the end, as it usually does, it comes down to the story. The plot really revolves around two figures, Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan. The two both come from Boston's rather proud but rather rough Irish community. After very different experiences in their youth, both end up in the same place, becoming Massachusetts state troopers. But soon their paths will diverge again and the story really begins to pick up steam. Sullivan has become a cop for one reason, to provide inside information to Frank Costello, the gangster whose presence is always looming over Boston's Irish neighborhood. Sullivan's a mole. Soon Costigan will be too, assigned to go undercover and infiltrate Costello's gang. Quite a tangled web. Soon both the police and Costello are well aware they each have a rat inside their organization and Costigan and Sullivan will be racing to unmask each other before being discovered themselves. A very high-stakes drama this is as the potential consequences of being discovered are painfully obvious for our respective rats. While the story is thoroughly engrossing, great actors are required to bring that story to life. And one thing The Departed surely has no shortage of is great actors. DiCaprio and Damon are both terrific, each bringing just the right personality to their respective characters who are quite a bit alike but also so different in many important ways. Damon seems more calm and collected, DiCaprio more edgy and intense and those emotions work perfectly for the two characters. Playing Frank Costello is Jack Nicholson who is typically brilliant. Authoritative, menacing, diabolical and always dangerous...that's Frank Costello and who better for such a role than Nicholson? DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson have the three meatiest roles but there are plenty of opportunities for other actors to shine as well. Mark Wahlberg breathes great life into the character of Sgt. Dignam, one of Costigan's handlers within the police force. Dignam is a man of great conviction and passion and whenever Wahlberg is on the screen you get the sense there is always something fierce simmering just beneath the surface. Well played. There are other big names in the cast like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin who fall perfectly into their smaller roles. And there are countless less-familiar faces who also do fine work. It seems Martin Scorsese has brought the best out of each and every member of his cast. And in doing so he has been able to wring as much drama as possible out of the terrific story with which he had to work. A great story, performed wonderfully by a terrific cast, all touched by the hand of a master director. Add it all up and you have something truly special, a wonderful film worthy of all the accolades it has received.
9.0~Not Marty's Best.....But Better Than Most's Best!!!! sarusso-2 Sign in Permalink A really good old fashioned film, with an excellent story and an unbelievable cast. This film really keeps you interested all the way though as you want to know what will happen to the protagonists, and how they will or won't get caught. We have all seen All-Star cast films where they just did not gel, but Marty seems to have got a good performance out of everybody. You can tell that Jack Nicholson has been given huge leeway in how he wanted to take his character through the story, and as always seems larger than life, but do not mistake that for a recycled performance. Without giving nothing away, his meeting with Matt Damon in the cinema is certainly worth watching for novelty and imagination in introducing yourself to someone you know!!! This is the sort of film you come out of the theatre with a big smile on your face, and surrounded by good spirited chattering. There are twists but you do not lose track of events, and just lap up the quality that laces the film from beginning to end. Sure it is not Goodfellas, but then they say that genius only touches you once....but this is head and shoulders above the best that most other directors can make.
9.0~Scorsese in familiar territory: guerrilla warfare in the urban jungle. Terrific acting except for Nicholson's lazy turn roland-104 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese returns to the milieu he knows best: guerrilla warfare in the urban jungle, only this time the setting is south Boston ("Southy"), not New York City, and it's Irish ghetto dwellers, not Italians, that claim his attention. All of which is vaguely amusing in light of the fact that Departed is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong crime flick, "Infernal Affairs," adapted from the original script by William Monahan, a Boston Irishman himself. The plot line is as reminiscent of John LeCarre as of Mario Puzo. It's all about spying. The Boston city police suspect that Southy gang lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) has planted a mole inside their criminal division. At the same time, Costello's people have been tipped that the police covert crime unit might be running a spy, an undercover agent who has infiltrated their gang. In fact, both rumors are true, as we learn early on. But wait a minute. Things aren't THAT simple: there seems to be a spy behind every other lamppost in this shoot 'em up thriller. And Scorsese pays all due respect to the Hong Kong provenance of this story by liberally splashing blood and knuckle sandwiches around like holy water. Scorsese has also gathered a fabulous cast, and for the most part he orchestrates their turns to great effect. Matt Damon (playing Colin Sullivan) and Leo DiCaprio (as Billy Costigan) are the principal spies, and both sizzle: they're tough as shoe leather, quick as tigers. This is the best work I've seen from DiCaprio in ages: he's maturing, he's bulked up, he's convincingly tough yet just vulnerable enough to be intriguing, as well. Scorsese makes more than sufficient amends here for miscasting him as Howard Hughes in "The Aviator." Another wonderful surprise is Mark Wahlberg's strong work as the garbage mouth, in-your-face Sergeant Dignam, aide de camp to the chief of the undercover unit and Costigan's leader, Oliver Queenan, who is more than ably played by Martin Sheen. And that's not all. Alec Baldwin also shines as Ellerby, chief of the crime unit, Damon's boss. Then there is Brit bad guy extraordinaire, Ray Winstone, never more menacing than he is here as "Mr. French," Costello's right hand man. That leaves us with only a couple of less admirable turns to confront, one of which, I regret to report, is presented by Jack Nicholson, who sleepwalks through this film playing the role of, yes, himself, Jack Nicholson. We get the shambling gait that has attended his increasing corpulence in recent years. The rolling up of the eyes, the arching of the brows, the acid toss off comments, the devilish, naughty little smirks that can explode into either a violent attack or a hearty guffaw. But it's all old hat: Prêt-à-Porter, off-the-shelf, stock Nicholson. And for that reason I find his turn here distracting, like, how did this aging, frumpy, lovable Hollywood actor become enmeshed in a taut crime storyhe better watch out, he could get hurt. He doesn't need a hip fracture at his age. I defended Nicholson in "About Schmidt," when a number of critics said he was too big a star to play such a character role, i.e., too much Jack, not enough Schmidt. But I can't defend him here. Come on, Jack! You can do better. Start surprising us, for Heaven's sakes. Earn your money. Be a dog that is willing to learn new tricks. However canned his performance is, you can never accuse Nicholson of offering a weak turn, but you can sure indict Vera Farmiga on this charge. Her Madolyn is a psychiatrist who ends up having professional and unprofessional contacts with both young spies, Sullivan and Costigan. The screenplay demands that she face a hopeless fate: as a lover, she is ambiguous and lacks passion; and as a shrink, her sense of boundary issues approaches that of an amoeba. As the lone woman among this pack of seriously felonious cops and crooks, she all but disappears. If I were Ms. Farmiga, I would replace my current agent within the next 30 minutes, before he steers me into another suicidal casting blunder. This rough and tumble gangster stuff is done in the stylish, grand Scorsese manner; he's at his best directing entertainments like this one (think of "Mean Streets" and "Goodfellas"). And if the moral point seems to be that there isn't much difference between cops and criminals, why that's hardly news. For years psychological researchers have demonstrated such an affinity in the personality makeup of these two groups of adversaries. Like any good Hong Kong crime movie, this one may not teach us anything we don't know already, or transport us to any new destination, but it's sure a thrilling ride. My grades: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 11/02/06)
9.0~Outstanding thomasjay-52277 Sign in Permalink Twistful, masterly crafted and shocking in parts this is a brilliant film. With argument for it being Scorsese's best the all star cast deliver a truly special film that's rewarding to watch, I highly recommend
10.0~HeadShoot aleksandarthemight Sign in Permalink Well I m not big fan of Scorsese but this movie is great,I really love Leonardo DiCaprio(I m not homo)he s one of my best actors and I get really mad when he get killed but I was very happy when Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon)get what he deserve,he was like sneaky,freaky,cocky bastard ready to stab you in the back,Jack Nicholson(I don t like him to much)but he was hilarious especially with scene in cinema full of perverts.Vera Farmiga from Running scared to this well Scorsese should take her more and I should watch more movies with her.Daddy Sheen well no comment for him ,his the old school so I give respect for that.Anthony Anderson(I don t see point of his role Scorsese probably put him because of rumors about that Scorsese was racist)Mark Wahlberg,well what should I said I don t know he never be specific like actor,you can watch him in comedy,romance,actions but honestly I got no opinion about him,Plot is great,script was very strong and scenes are pretty tense.Anybody who said that movie is boring and stupid, he should need watch movie again.
10.0~The Departed is great!!! jb1211-1 Sign in Permalink The Departed is about the Massachusetts State police trying to take down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who is head of the Irish Mafia. In the movie police officer Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is under cover as a police officer for Costello so that he can tell Costello when the state police are close to finding him. Another state police officer named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is under cover as one of Costello's guys. Costigan is so deep undercover that he spends six months in jail and is made to look like he is kicked off then police force and the only people who know that he is still a police officer are Police officers Queenan and Dignam (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg). The movie is about Costello trying to find the rat on his team and the cops trying to catch Costello and find the rat on their team. I enjoyed The Departed very much. The movie had a very good story to it and a lot of good action. I bought the DVD without ever seeing the movie before and it was money well spent. This was one of the best movies I have ever sen and it deserves every Academy Award* is is nominated for. Though this movie is not for small children by any stretch of the imagination. In The Departed the "F" word is used almost every other sentence along with many other strong cuss words. This movie also has very strong graphic violence. Two more departed movies are in talks including a sequel and a prequel and Mark Wahlberg has already been approached for the sequel. I am very much anticipating the next two movies. in the Departed series. *The Departed is Nominated for five Academy Awards including: -BestPicture -Best supporting Actor: Mark Wahlberg -Best Director:MartinScorsese -Best Adapted Screenplay (The Departed is a remake of Internal Affairs which is a movie from Hong Kong that was released in 2002 and has two sequels): William Monahan -Best achievement in editing: Thelma Schoonmaker
8.0~"I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me." ryan_kuhn Sign in Permalink The first lines of this movie are said in a monologue by Jack Nicholson's mob-boss character Frank Costello. He starts with, "I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me." This line essentially sums up the movie even before it begins. The Departed is an Americanized version of a Hong Kong filmed called Infernal Affairs, and tells the story of two Boston state troopers--one goes undercover and works against the Costello gang from within (Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan) and one works for the Special Investigation Unit while still on Costello's payroll (Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan). Each one lives in a world of deception, each trying to keep their real motives a secret from their adoptive bosses, each trying to out maneuver the other. The Departed ends up being a 150 minute long cat and mouse game between two guys who are referred to as rats in the entire movie. At first, each takes to their responsibilities with vigor and enthusiasm, with Costigan having the more difficult assignment, trying to infiltrate a gang who all knew he was once a cop. As the movie goes a long, we feel the noose tightening around each, as both characters go through moments of dread and loss, until the bloody ending where all of the characters who deceived and schemed ended up getting a suitable punishment. Each character in the movie imposes their outlook on the world on their situations, as each one makes their own luck, so to say, as the first line uttered by Nicholson alluded to. None of the characters are the result of a predetermined destiny, as everyone made decisions on their own and had to live with their results. As Costello said, their environments were all products of their own actions. As far as Scorsese's direction goes, it is as usual top-notch, with quick cuts when quick cuts are needed, a neat opening that gives about as much background information as we viewers could possibly need in a fast-paced 15 minutes before the opening credits even finish, a fine selection of music (almost Tarantino -like in how the music matched each scene), and as much violence and obscenities as you could possibly get in two and a half hours. Boston makes for a fascinating location for a movie such as this--a rich subtext to each character, the possibility for interesting supporting players, and a gritty street life that makes it a poor man's version of New York City, without having thousands of movies made about it already. The one problem with the Boston setting is the accent thing--some of the characters lose the accent then it magically comes back. This is always a concern when it comes to Boston movies. Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are terrific as high-level police officers, and Mark Wahlberg goes all in with his portrayal of the salty Sergent Dignam. But the real stars are DiCaprio and Damon, each young actors who have really developed into well-rounded portrayers of emotion and gravitas. Yes, DiCaprio may never really leave the Titanic, but here he shows he can act in a subtle, yet strong roll in a Scorsese movie that is almost as good as Goodfellas.
3.0~Just An Ugly Film sullymazda Sign in Permalink OK. First off, I'm glad to see that "The Departed" has as many detractors as it has admirers. My objections to it, for the most part, have been filled in by other users. Therefore, I'll keep it brief. The movie's characters, just like its gushing audiences,seem to suffer from attention deficit disorder. As if they've never read a book in their lives. And it appears as if Scorcese had that in mind, knowing fully well in advance that the film would appeal to people who seemingly have no problem with the F word being uttered every twelve seconds--whether it's in the movies, or in their actual,everyday pedestrian conversations. Which, I've found to be a problem with those who, quite simply,did not stay in school long enough. And who would believe-- even for a second--that two members of the Boston P.D.(played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg) would engage in banter graphically describing how each of them had sex with the other guy's mother--at a meeting where the bulk of the attendees consists of top- level Federal Agents?. What are these guys--in the 8th Grade? If I held that position in real life ( FBI,CIA,etc. ),I--while walking out on the two of them-- would look both in the eye and let them know what slobs they are. Finally, to switch gears, I guess nobody thought the film went awry when Leo DiCaprio has apparently no trouble beating the hell out of two grown men from the Rhode Island branch of the Cosa Nostra (man, that's some muscle that got sent in from Providence, huh?). All of it punctuated by the unnecessary--not to mention perfunctory-- accompaniment of The Human Beinz "Nobody But Me". And later, when one of Nicholson's men is being interrogated, we are treated to about six and a half seconds of "Sail On Sailor". If you're anything like me, when you think grueling questioning, you think... Beach Boys. And don't get me started on the fact that this is an Oscar winning film, the last ten minutes of which consist of not one...not two... not three...but four-count 'em-- men getting a bullet through his brain. Lovely.Just like the conclusion of "Babe", where the talking pig wins the Sheepdog Contest. Guaranteed... when you're at some guy's house/apartment--and you don't see any bookcases--that if the subject of this film comes up, he'll tell you just how terrific it was. Childish, pernicious drivel.
1.0~It's not that bad, but balancing the score. yzcheung Sign in Permalink Based of the movie Infernal Affairs? Are you kidding, It's obvious a clone, with American TOPcast. This movie really confirms how great Infernal Affairs was. Don't get me wrong I'm not an hater, but it's getting really too much credits for a clone. I really like Matt, Jack and Leo, but it's something missing in the script. The time "feeling", you will miss the connection between Costello and Billy. The real connection, earning respect and trust. Colin getting promoted, gaining trust and honor at the state police, it's happening in a flash. It's the KEY for the viewer to get the "Infernal Affairs" feeling, it's not there. A must see anyways. I created an IMDb account after ~8years, just to inform you.
10.0~Scorsese does it again Dr-Conejo90210 Sign in Permalink 'The Departed' is an American crime-thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese ('Taxi Driver', 'Good Fellas'). The film gives us a poignant look at a fictional war on drugs fought by the Boston Police Department against an Irish-rooted mob led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), with his protégé, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) helping him from the inside of the police force while Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) helps the police department by infiltrating Costello's mob. The story takes place in Boston, following the lives of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop of the Boston Police Department, who is at a crossroads in his life, having just lost all close relatives and with no clear direction in his life, as he infiltrates Costello's mob, and Colin Sullivan, who from a very young age has been the protégé of Costello and who now works for the Boston Police Department, providing Frank with information. As the story unfolds, we see the consequences the characters have to deal with by leading a double life. We watch them as they blur the lines of what's right or wrong, and we get to see just how far they are willing to go to protect what they've built, and to get what they want. In typical Scorsese fashion, the director dwells into the moral aspect of their characters, exploring the kind side of the villain and the dark side of the heroes. The cast is on point through-out all the movie, with the performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being particularly fascinating. One of the strongest points of the film it's is pace, with the story developing in a fast-pace, leaving no dead-time on screen for the viewer to lose attention. One major critic of the film is that it doesn't follow the original, Infernal Affairs, too closely. While this may be true to some extent, it could very well be attributed to the fact that the original is a three-part saga; it's a given that some of the story it's bound to be lost in the process of condensing three movies into one. While it released more than twenty years into the career of director Scorsese, 'The Departed' is a solid film, with a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat, that's going to keep you guessing as of what's going to happen next. If you're in the mood for a film with a fast-paced, thrilling story, fleshed-out characters and superb acting, then 'The Departed' is a must-see.
8.0~a possible goof yandrey Sign in Permalink maybe a SPOILER I am not sure how it works in America, but usually they will have to shoot blanks at a funeral. I just do not see the guard of honor using live ammunition. At least that's what other countries practice. At the funeral in the movie, we see two consequent shots without reloading - which is hard to achieve with blanks, due to the lack of retraction of the loading mechanism. The gases fired are not enough to reload the weapon without a bullet of some sort. Correct me if I'm wrong. What is the usual practice in US in this case?
9.0~Yeah buddy..... Heiniken Sign in Permalink The answer is yes. This is a very good movie. Scorsese is back to his former form. Not that the Aviator and gangs of new york were bad movies, they're actually quit good movies, but not Scorsese good. The Departed is Scorsese good though. The story takes place in Boston which is a new field for Marty. It's actually quite refreshing. But when it all comes down the city doesn't really matter. In terms of acting there isn't much to say. Everybody does their job, and well. EVEN Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon. Dicaprio has really become a talented actor. But Matt is probably the actor that surprised me the most in this movie. I'm not a big fan of his, but he really does a good job here. I expected nothing less from the legend Jack Nicholsen which is one of my favorite actors. And Alec Baldwin probably shows his best performance so far. All in all a GREAT cast. A great movie, Probably better than infernal affairs, but it is Scorsese after all. 9/10
9.0~A far *departure* from the others! goodmanhunting2003 Sign in Permalink There are films, and there are films. "The Departed" is a cult film. A classic. When Matt Damon--hunting a rat with bad will--was plotting, prosecuting his diabolical agenda, I swear I saw vestiges of "The Talented Mr.Ripley" at work. Condemnations--excessive almost--by his character Sullivan about gays and queers did not only have an uncanny parallel with Mr.Ripley (who is queer), but about the Sullivan character who was this side of a bit bent...to the other side. More like the other side... of good! Sullivan certainly looked like a bad guy--exuding arrogance and criminal intelligence in an explosive mix--trained from his youth by crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to not just be a bad 'un, but be one who would be able to strategically fill him in on information from no less than the elite police unit that Sullivan had, ironically, worked hard to get into. And what of Costigan? Another bad 'un--or so we thought. He wanted his identity back; he got something else in return. Mark Wahlberg's wit would have been legendary if only it had been him--and not his character Dignam: a no-nonsense hardened cop with a penchant for the 'f-word'. Loyal. Trustworthy. Like his avuncular boss, Queenan (Martin Sheen), whose end was far from pretty. The cinematographic characterisation of Costello in the beginning was cute: he was shown with a half-darkened face; a gruff voice; erudite-sounding tongue. Truly a paradox. He liked to say: "no-one gives it to you; you gotta take it!". And he took alright! But you kept wondering--was he the Devil incarnate, or a glorified criminal? Truth is when you have a gun in your hand, "what's the difference?" The difference, like the devil, is in the film's details. The accents. The Irish pedigree; the seamless time; the increasingly sadistic and desperate nature of Costello. His slow-and-sure distrust of Sullivan. Costello's strength (Sullivan) in weakness (his impotence?). Nicholson's reminisces of "The Shining". But I digress. If I never used superlatives for this film, it's because I do not have to. Suffice-to-say, Damon excels; Nicholson outdoes himself'; Sheen and Baldwin are there; Wahlberg, too. But the real prize goes to the real (state) trooper, who was told he would never be a state trooper: Di Caprio as Costigan. The writers pulled an excellent piece here. Any writing class teacher will tell you to "begin with then end in mind". They certainly began with the end in mind. But if there's anything about this classic movie, it's a cautionary tale of minding one's "beginnings"...because you never know where it might take you. Go get this film now!
9.0~***Some spoiler content*** graham45-970-360422 Sign in Permalink The Departed is another classic Martin Scorsese film that can be put near the top of his organized crime genre set that includes Casino and Goodfellas. The plot of a young lad named Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) taken under the wing of a Boston Irish mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) grooms young Colin to infiltrate the Massachusetts State Police, becoming one of their own and providing the mob with an inside connection or mole. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young, soon to be academy graduate of the Massachusetts State Police, when approached to serve them by going undercover into the Irish mob. Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) convince Billy this is his best opportunity with his family ties to organized crime. This begins the chase of finding who the mole in each organization is, while Billy and Colin struggle with their own identities. The theme is that of identity and how one fits into their surroundings. When Colin was molded as a young boy by Frank, he had a newly discovered identity. Colin is first portrayed as an innocent well mannered boy. The same can be said about Billy, who believed that he was nothing like his father or uncle as he searched for his own identity, which was eventually stripped by Colin. Billy's search for his own identity is similar in what Kane pursues in Citizen Kane. The father-son relationship between Colin and Frank is a motif throughout the movie. The father like relationship between Frank and Billy is evident as the film progresses, not to the extent as Colin's relationship with Frank, but close. Colin calls Frank 'Dad' when speaking with him in cover while at work. Captain Queenan and Billy portray a father-son relationship as well, Billy trusts Queenan with protecting his identity. The lighting in the film was outstanding. The opening scenes with Frank use some high contrast with many different lighting angles for depth. Keeping the foreground of Frank's face very dark with a vibrant background was great. This keeps us guessing on what physical characteristics he may have, which ties into the theme of identity. The theme of identity has many different layers between the characters, as one identity is established another is questioned. The flow of action from scene to scene and the characters relationships tie well with theme. A movie well done!
1.0~Luckily I didn't have to pay to watch this tripe. davesteele-1 Sign in Permalink This movie was one of my local Blockbuster Video's "it's in stock or it's free" titles. I came to the store the day after this movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture and it was out of stock, so I thought "what the hell" and got a voucher for a free rental, which I redeemed a week later. I can't ask for my money back since I rented this movie for free, but I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. This was the most pretentious truckload of tripe I've sat through in a long time. I am a big fan of HBO's The Wire and other well made crime dramas. But I'm also a fan of movies that have a point. This movie had no point except to portray some laughably fake version of the "gritty reality" of Boston's crime scene and to pop off the main characters through one contrived "plot twist" after the next. A lot has been made about the acting in this movie. I think all the big name actors in this movie delivered highly-energetic, but completely boring performances. That is to say their idea of character development in this movie basically consisted of constant shouting. Nicholsen was cartoonish, acting less like his character and more like, well, Jack Nicholsen. I never believed him as a crime boss, and I never believed Damon, DiCaprio or Walberg in their roles either. A lot happens in this movie. A lot of people die graphic deaths and a lot of people swear a lot. A lot of people say "Boston" things like "Boston" people say them. A lot happens in this movie, but nothing interesting happens. I find it interesting that many of the most negative reviews of this movie come from real life cops and others who actually have some firsthand experience with the "gritty" urban life this movie purports to portray.
8.0~very intense, very good film kbozenhardt Sign in Permalink Overall I thought this film was very good. The casting was excellent. I thought that all of the actors did a great job with their roles and cannot think of any changes I would make. The writing was also very good and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested without being lost.The character development was good but there was a lot of violence. What seems to be a predictable ending is anything but. The quirkiness of some of the characters provided needed relief from the intensity and sometimes seemingly senseless violence. This film kept me interested from the very beginning and I was hesitant to go to the restroom (it is 2 1/2 hours) I do highly recommend it and would definitely see it again.
2.0~How did it win any of those awards? JaQaL Sign in Permalink When I saw this movie I was stunned at how bad it was and yet that it was rated so highly by IMDb voters. Here we had a highly talented cast and a great (based on fact) idea to work with yet it comes off as contrived, cheesy and unfulfilling. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the acting honours clearly but there's not much competition. Jack Nicholson is terrible. When he plays bad guys he at least has some charm. Not here. Maybe he wasn't meant to. If so then he was poorly cast. Martin Sheen was ordinary. Perhaps his lack of big screen time has affected his abilities. Vera Farmiga, as everyone's love interest, had no warmth, no depth, nothing. If you want to watch a Mafia movie then just put on a The Godfather. Watching it for the 20th time is better than watching this stinker once.
1.0~Disappointed rhargett3 Sign in Permalink Lets start with a very slow intro to an amazing story. Then lets compile a dream cast of characters to act out this amazing story. So amazing in fact that it very well could be the best movie of the year. Then once this character had given up everything and risked his life in nearly every scene, lets FINALLY give him the opportunity to hand over the dirty cop and set things straight. Well, we don't have time to finish the story with a great ending, so lets just kill him. Then at the end, lets kill the dirty cop so he can be decorated as a hero instead of turning over evidence so he can be convicted. This could have been the best movie of the year, and the story could have been told in well under 2 hours. They should have just opened and closed with a firing squad and I could have been in and out in 10 minutes with the same results.
10.0~Moles And Rats bkoganbing Sign in Permalink When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond. Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one. Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life. Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations. But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond. The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say. Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small.
9.0~The best crime drama of the decade!! lv_rk Sign in Permalink I had the chance to see this movie at PVR and was awestruck by its fantastic narration. Especially, the inter-cuts in the movie are so well done in the movie that u don't feel jarred or confused... superb! And even though DiCaprio and Matt Damon had pivotal roles, not to mention Jack, it was a treat to watch & listen to Mark Wahlberg whenever he appears on screen! And man, last 15 minutes really blew me off! I haven't seen much of Martin's movies, the last one I remember watching is The Aviator, which didn't impress me much, even though I liked it somewhat. But with this movie, I can I had become a fan of Martin and would like to watch his previous titles like... Good Fellas,Raging Bull, Caper Fear etc. I am eagerly awaiting for the release of DVD of The Departed which, unfortunately to this part of the world, will come a little late...
10.0~Scorsese's best masterpiece since Goodfellas! gavinooch21 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese's BEST film since "Goodfellas." Man is this an ABSOLUTE dynamite of a picture! With an all star cast ranging from DiCaprio to Matt Damon to Nicholson to Wahlberg to Martin Sheen to Ray Winstone to Alec Baldwin it really is in many way the ultimate all star cast list as EVERYONE delivers their A-game for the master filmmaker Martin Scorsese. Finally! Not only a great movie about the Irish mob in Boston, but on the modern day mob. Love every minute of this movie and the soundtrack as well! Scorsese can direct the hell out of anything! That's why he is my ALL time favorite director! He's the ultimate beacon of cinema! It's why I call him the master filmmaker! Because he is!
9.0~The man has done it again Monotreme02 Sign in Permalink The man has done it again. If there is any director who is the undisputed master of the crime genre, it is Martin Scorsese hands down. Not because his films are campy examples of the genre, and not because they take and break the rules. What makes Scorsese's crime movies, and The Departed as a particular standout example, is how incredibly matter-of-fact they are. Frank Costello isn't a caricature. Jack Nicholson plays him with much intensity, but he never, ever treads Vito Corleone or Marcellus Wallace territory. Costello is just a man who happens to be a foul-mouthed gangster  no more, no less. Costigan is just a young man who is extremely confused about loyalty. Sullivan is just a young man who stands by his loyalty but gets dragged down by his weaknesses. Dignam is a man who compensates for his lacking physical stature with fierce determination. Queenan is a wise father figure. The point of this breakdown is to emphasize that all of these are characters. They never become caricatures, exaggerations, and depictions. They all exist in all three dimensions, round as a billiard ball. As with his previous films, Scorsese never needs to emphasize the setting. Sure, since it is a contemporary film he doesn't need to indulge in period details. But the whole Boston setting is extremely well executed in that Scorsese never emphasizes it. It simply is. It is in this sense that Scorsese is so successful in his film-making. Because he doesn't indulge himself in excessive details. His focus is entirely on his storytelling. And this focus pays off greatly. The plot is thick as a brick. The initial concept of a police mole in the mob and a mob mole in the police department, both of which pretty much need to find themselves, is fascinating and brilliant. But there is so much more than the simple premise. The film is rich with paradoxical details and mind-bending deadlocks. The dynamics, parallels, and general unfolding of events are as rich as they are fascinating. And as the film reaches its unforeseeable climax, we see what all the anticipation was for. From a technical standpoint, Scorsese utilizes a style reminiscent of Taxi Driver. It isn't exactly minimalist, but it is certainly gritty and down to earth. There is no fancy lighting, no elaborate sets or costumes. Everything is extremely realistic and down to earth. Scorsese also expertly uses music in the film, both pop songs and Howard Shore's original score, NEVER to emphasize or warp the audience but simply as a setting. If there are two technical aspects that must be emphasized, it is the cinematography and the editing. Scorsese has always been known as a master of the camera, and what makes him such a master isn't being a show-off, but in his restraint. The camera angles and movements are brilliant and dazzling, without taking front stage. It all serves the story. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, longtime Scorsese collaborator, is definitely the most amazing technical aspect of the film. It blew my mind. I seriously can't think of any director that can better string together a series of shots in a more meaningful and expert way. The editing in this film should win awards. It's just incredible. But utilizing the film medium is just part of Scorsese's brilliance. He is also a notoriously good director of actors. And with an all-star cast most other directors would kill to get, Scorsese already has a great starting point from which his actors can take the dive and start bouncing. And bounce they do. Every performance builds on and off the other performances. Nobody ever overplays anyone else, it's an extremely expert use of an ensemble. This movie further supports the claim that that the Academy should desperately include a "best ensemble cast performance" category in the Oscars. Nicholson dominates the film; Sheen and Baldwin, the other veterans, expertly deliver fantastic supporting performances. But the real stunners are the younger cast members. DiCaprio was incredible and came across as extremely convincing and very intense as a gritty street character. Then again, Scorsese definitely knows how to direct the man - I still think his performance in The Aviator deserved the Oscar. Mark Wahlberg, a very hit-and-miss actor, is definitely in the hit territory - his aggressive police lieutenant character is expertly, expertly played. But the real standout is Matt Damon. I knew this guy could act - just see Good Will Hunting or The Talented Mr. Ripley for proof. But at THIS caliber? I had no idea he had it in him. The intensity, the drama, the accent - Damon nails it all. He deserves more recognition as a talent and less as a crowd-drawing name as he does today. I resent calling this a "return to form" for Scorsese, because I personally found his last film, The Aviator, to be just as brilliant as Scorsese's other masterpieces. But this is definitely another entry in one of the most masterful filmographies of any director working today. It's great to see that Scorsese, like fellow director Steven Spielberg and quite unlike fellow directors Brian DePalma and George Lucas, remains a strong and consistent directorial force, and hasn't at all lost his touch. He's still a master of his craft, and does his thing better than anyone else.
9.0~Another great from Scorcese pasha25 Sign in Permalink A great movie I thought that picked up pace more towards the end of the film. The acting particularly from Dicaprio was great, in particular the scene where he meets the shrink and the moments he tries convincing Costello that he is not a mole. Jack Nicholson played his character fairly convincingly. Despite not having the same menacing demeanour that Pauli's character portrayed in Goodfellas, Costello did look very much like the 'should be retired' rough and mean looking gangster in his own laid back way. I should have guessed Mark Wahlberg's character was still out there at large. He had a big mouth in the film and played the annoying and to some extent a crooked cop well. I totally did not see the ending coming, the twists in the end did not match my guesses but were a welcome shock in the end. Another great film from Scorcese, although Goodfellas still keeps this one in the shadows.
3.0~Bloated, overlong, overrated merklekranz Sign in Permalink Big names, big director, a rambling script equals not great. "Little Miss Sunshine" should have waxed this puppy Oscar night, as it was a far more enjoyable viewing experience. Somewhat confusing editing and too many characters with too little development sinks "The Departed". The movie could easily have been trimmed to under two hours. It seemed that it was not capable of ending until every last character had "departed" (pun intended). Alec Baldwin was totally wasted on a character who simply revolved around other characters. Martin Sheen added his name to the credits but remained well in the background. Neither Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio's character was remotely likable, and the common love interest seemed gratuitous at best. Only Jack Nicholson did not disappoint, but the movie is way overrated and forgettable. - MERK
9.0~I laughed, I cried. dorey-1 Sign in Permalink I was swept off my feet up to the last frame. Fabulous performances from a studly stable of studly men. DiCaprio's in particular. Intense, what? Wow and all grown up now, a muscular guy who you can see thinking, freaking, without a word of dialogue. Which was overall pretty good --witty-- lots of instant movie classic lines. Rich, subtle camera work + wonderful bit of vertigo inducing camera at intro of young Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). The weakest/campiest thing was Nicholson's over the top satanic performance. Perhaps doing the Joker Batman thing was too much, although admittedly kind of fun to watch. Further pickiness...what was Billy's job description, exactly in this band of murderers + thieves? Isn't there usually a hierarchy within these manly man groupsyou work your way up...in this case, from what to what? But these are details, in an otherwise superlative movie. Pure, intense entertainment. And the ending felt just right. Sudden, but right. Bravo!
10.0~Screams Oscar! intelearts Sign in Permalink Extraordinary performances from the absolute best cast of 2006. A character driven maelstrom. Amazingly fluid, visceral, gripping,powerful, real, honest Has it received too much praise? No. For my money, and without a doubt, the best character driven movie of 2006. Why? Because I simply go to the dark heart of the human condition, betrayal, trust, loyalty, honor, dishonor, and the nature of each and in that it leaves the herd behind. Wahlberg (awesome), Sheen, Baldwin, Damon, Di Caprio, and Nicholson (just forgivable grandiose) ARE real - even when the situations seem overblown. An immense feeling of absolute immersion that moves it from another film to something better. Impossible to imitate: though many will try. Topping this should be interesting Marty!
10.0~Quite Possibly the BEST Movie in 2 Years WillTheThrill228 Sign in Permalink Let's get one thing straight, Martin Scorsese is a genius. Goodfellas, move over. Gritty, dramatic, suspenseful, all-around awesome. Everything was well acted. Great cast, though, anything with Nicholson is unbelievable. I can't say enough great things about this movie. The twisted nature of the story is what binds it together and keeps you begging for more. From the superb shots of Boston to Alec Baldwin's witty and hilarious lines. My favorite being to Matt Damon... "You want a cigarette? What you don't smoke? What are you, a health nut? Alright, go f*ck yourself." All done monotonously and dry. Just a superb move through and through, and though, it clocks in at 2 1/2 hours, the time seems to fly by as the story just draws you in deeper and deeper. Definitely one of, if not the best, movie I have seen in a good 2 years.
5.0~Good Movie, not great lonestar788 Sign in Permalink The movie is the best film to date for 2006. However, that doesn't mean that The Departed is deserving of the Top 250 movies of all time. This is not Scorsese's best film, and should not be higher than than some of his other films, such as Raging Bull. This movie is on par with Mean Streets and Casino in terms of quality. While the plot was kept at a good pace, it seemed the dialogue took the place of the camera and its effect to speak. I highly recommend this film but I am saddened and dismayed to see a movie this recent, and this quality reach such a high status on the greatest 250 Movies of all time. I give this film such a low rating simply to lower it on the scale of the movies.
9.0~A Masterpiece Except for several Scorsesesque flaws. manwithavanpro Sign in Permalink Seriously Director Martin Scorsese finally delivers a mind blowing, crowd pleasing, genuine Hollywood heavyweight. And his long-time loyalists can't be more thankful. Credit begins with a brilliantly complex screenplay adapted from the 2002 Chinese film "Infernal Affairs." As Scorsese testifies, "It was the first picture I made with a plot." It seems like that is exactly what the people were waiting for, as the opening weekend gross of $26.8 million obliterated all other Scorsese releases. And regardless of its many shortcomings*, Marty certainly reassures us all that he is still the master of modern mortality with a riveting final half-hour of elegant and exciting violence that is right on par with the 'Baptism/Murder' crescendo in "The Godfather Part I"-- when Michael Corleone finishes all of the family's unfinished business. With "The Departed," it seems that Marty also finishes some business of his own. *First, realize a few things: that this film takes place in a fantasized contemporary world, that Jack Nicholson can't help but act extremely ridiculous, and of course, that Marty Scorsese is a highly stylized director the musical selections, the over-lighting, the frequent and casual violence, and the excessive story exposition and once all of this is understood, or more importantly, accepted (asking too much?), then you can really begin to have fun with this movie. Now, coping with Nicholson's absurd over-performance is probably an issue on to its own How much better might this movie have been had DeNiro played Frank Costello, rather than the attention starved Jumpin' Jack, who seemed like he was just horsing around until he got to the Lakers game later that night (i.e. playing with a dildo in a porno theater)? See Born Critic for more on that http://borncritic.blogspot.com/2006/10/departed.html On the other hand, the rest of the cast displays career acting performances, most notably Leo DiCaprio, who brings an amazing raw energy and intensity to his roles, balancing both the physical and psychological demands of his complex character, and was only beat out for a Best Actor nod by himself in "Blood Diamond." http://manwithavan.blogspot.com/
8.0~Better with age sonnylavelle Sign in Permalink I finally saw this again after first seeing it at the theatre in '06, and it's gotten even better. Everything about this movie is excellent. The acting is next level and the craftsmanship that Is applied to every shot is a dream. I shouldn't be surprised of course, but it's nice to still be surprised sometimes!
1.0~Martin screwed up befrank-1 Sign in Permalink The Departed, a movie by one of the best directors in the world, the one of great milestones of film history such as Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Cape Fear, Casino, etc. So must be something worth, you think. Sorry to tell you: not at all. The movie is interesting about movie language, meaning an editing very intense, which wants you not to elaborate what you see but tries to make you absorb it without thinking, which is definitely an important choice, something not easy to realize, something only a great director can do if he has the best professional people around him. As it often happens, when you try to build the pathos in such a way, you may loose the reality. That's what happens to the movie, to say the lesser problem of it. So we have here a team of policemen who, for doing their daily job of fighting the crime, keep on treating each other very badly (to use an euphemism), keep on insulting each other and on punching each other every time there's a decision to be taken. Imagine if you should work in such a way in your office, if you should punch your colleague every time he has a different opinion from yours... And this is just for the beginning... Later, in the most dramatic moments of the movie, you will hear the audience laughing. That's the best critic to a movie you can have. When you can't trust trailers and advertising (of course), when you can't trust interviews, reviews, box office result, Academy nominations and eventually awards, best signatures of the world... Than you have the only review everyone HAS to believe: the reaction of the audience. If they laugh, when they should be shaking on their armchair, that means something is wrong, something doesn't work. We saw something like that in The war of worlds, by another promising director named Steven Spielberg. An explanation for that may be that Hollywood has to make movies. If the script is good or not, if it's a serious operation or not, there's a budget to be spent soon and they have to make the movie. In such cases the hope is that, maybe, during the shooting, the right idea will come out to solve that problem of the script. Well, this time the right idea didn't come out. And you'll find it out with surprise. The movie has some qualities, as I said. We have some good acting performances, especially from Matt Damon, able even to show when he is lying, and in this I recognize the acting directions from Scorsese. Than we have Leonardo Di Caprio who, in order to get rid of his good-boy-face, has to tense all single muscles of his face in every scene... Mr Scorsese may be running for 10 Oscars, he may have sold for 200 millions, but, together with the audience, we can say Martin, this time, you screwed up.
10.0~A masterpiece right up Scorsese's alley Jay_Exiomo Sign in Permalink Director Martin Scorsese's "The Departed", a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller "Internal Affairs", goes without saying as perhaps his best work since "Goodfellas." Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity. Set in Boston, the Massachusetts State Police sends young cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate an Irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns the trust of leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello's informant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit. Soon, stakes are raised when both the police and the mob realize there's a traitor among them, and that both Billy and Collin are both in danger of losing their cover and even their lives. Nicholson, yet again playing another villain, owns every scene he's in with his portrayal of Costello, providing a paradoxical attraction to his menacing character. DiCaprio, increasingly maturing as an actor since becoming Scorsese's "muse", fits right in as the streetwise cop, while Damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor to the part. They are complemented by the ensemble performances of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga. Scriptwriter William Monahan ("Kingdom of Heaven") retains much of the structure of "Internal Affairs" but adds depth to its characters and an acerbic quality to its witty dialog. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is brooding and morbid, capturing the character of its Boston setting while Howard Shore's score is as good as a soundtrack can be. At its core, "The Departed" is a well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted film noir. In an age where style usually triumphs over the narrative quality, "The Departed" is one of the best films I have seen so far in recent memory.
3.0~i think the DIRECTOR IS MAD yuriboyka-11096 Sign in Permalink how could they made a movie like that i gave 3 stars because of leonardo ,this movie is a piece of crap.i prefer that you do not watch this movie there was no sense in the movie .if you read this then i recommend you to not see this movie really otherwise you would regret wasting your 151 minutes .what you would say is "i would much rather with star wars series than with this full of crap movie
10.0~Cops and Criminals, what's the difference? departed07 Sign in Permalink Taxi Driver was hailed at the movie of the seventies; Raging Bull was the film of the eighties; Good Fellas was the film of the nineties; now in this decade, Martin Scorsese returns to his mafia roots, not in New York or New Jersey, but brings his mafia to Boston where in this update of Infernal Affairs it's mean, violent, frightening with full of surprises, and Jack is Back making The Departed Martin Scorsese's definitive film of this decade. "When you're faced with a loaded gun...what's the difference?" In The Departed, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play different sides of the law that go in the opposite directions in their careers; Leo is Billy Costigan, a smart recruit who flunked the academy but is hired by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the foul-mouth Sgt. Dignam (Mark Whalberg) to go undercover inside mob boss Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) team and get any information; Matt is Colin Sullivan who is not only a smart prodigy to Frank, but once he is promoted to the Special Unit Investigations leaded by Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), it's up to Colin to make sure that he gives Frank the early step. In a game of cat and mouse, both sides of the law want to find out who the mole is in their operative sources while at the same time both William and Colin are taken in by the father-son figures of their work with Frank thinking of William as a son despite his henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone) breaking him down. Just like most movies, there is always the love interest. Vera Farmiga who is unknown to a lot of general film freaks like myself plays the police psychiatrist who falls in love with Colin's Suffolk education attitude while she sees Billy as her patient and falls for both characters despite not knowing that both are undercover operatives. Everyone gives top notch performances, but everybody knows that the one who steals the show is none other than Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Nicholson's performance as Costello brings back the devil's grin that made everybody loved villains in the first place; compared to the sadistic Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York, Jack's performance is one that people will be talking about and reenacting. On another note about the film, the editing of the film is top notch with Thelma Schoonmaker giving it all she's got bringing energetic life to the movie. The screenplay by William Monahan is excellent after reading the script from purchasing the two disc special edition on February 13, 2007 and this is Martin Scorsese's best film ever.
9.0~Scorcese's Long Overdue Oscar win is quite simply, a masterpiece Isaac5855 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese finally snagged a Best Director Oscar for THE DEPARTED and though there are some (myself included) who do not feel this was his best work, the film is more than worthy of the Director Oscar it finally nailed for Scorcese as well as the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year that it also received. This exquisitely mounted epic tale looks at the war between the police and the mob in South Boston, supposedly during the 70's and 80's, centering primarily on three characters. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio)is a young cop with a shady family legacy, who is sent deep undercover to get the goods on renowned Boston mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, a young man who grew up working for Costello,a la Ray Liotta's character in GOODFELLAS, but also becomes a police officer. A two-way cat and mouse game ensues as Costello tries to learn which member of his organization is a cop while the police try to figure out which one of their officers is a stooge to Costello. The race to learn which rat is where advances to the point where Sullivan is actually assigned to, in so many words, rat out himself. Scorcese offers one of the greatest examples I have seen in years of storytelling on screen with a meticulous and detailed screenplay that requires complete attention, not to mention multiple viewings to fully appreciated the multi-layered story presented here. Scorcese's direction is crisp and in-your-face, as always, and surprises are offered around every corner of the story told here. Every time you think you've figure it out, the story takes another detour and if you miss anything, you will be confused. DiCaprio offers the best performance of his career as the tortured Costigan and he might have won the Oscar if he had been nominated for this instead of BLOOD DIAMOND. Matt Damon's richly complex portrayal of Collin Sullivan hits the bullseye as does Nicholson's expectedly ruthless mafioso. Mark Wahlberg received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his razor sharp performance as DiCaprio and Damon's 2nd commanding officer who allows matters to get personal. Alec Baldwin, Martin, Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Anthony Anderson also register in strong supporting roles, but it is primarily the compelling story, masterful direction by Scorcese and the three electrifying lead performances that make this film an instant classic not to be missed.
10.0~Love It When a Plan Comes Together jnelso19 Sign in Permalink Yea that's right, I made an A-Team reference regarding The Departed. Despite the quality differences between these media stories, this film went exactly as planned. So when Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B decided to help remake a Chinese classic, they decided to go all out. Aside from getting the great Martin Scorsese on board to direct and William Monahan to write an excellent script, they felt like it wasn't enough. They hired Leo and an All-Star cast that could only be matched by a corny romantic comedy (Valentine's Day). Then as they say, the rest worked out itself. The acting was superb with Leo leading the way along with Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson not far behind. Not to mention the ten other actors who did their jobs well and when it was all said and done. Mr. Scorsese didn't get denied and he finally won his Oscar. Plus he found his new De Niro with Leo and with this and Shutter Island, the future looks bright as long as Scorsese is still kicking.
4.0~I don't know if we watched the same film peryteran2 Sign in Permalink This one went on way too long and had too much Jack Nicholson's shtick. The story had more holes than Whitey Bulger's victims did. I saw the original and was not impressed with the good guy/bad guy duality. I tried to give it a chance, but it sank like a body in the harbor. It was nice to see actors valiantly trying to grip the MA accent, but some, like Nicholson, gave up any pretense. It was also funny to hear thugs deliver their lines with well-formed thoughts and references to Joyce and Shakespeare, despite the fact that they are low-class thugs. Setting up a meeting in a porno theater might have worked twenty years ago, but where are there any in the world? At times, Scorsese's use of music was boring. And the ending, oooh there's a rat in your apartment! That was just funny.
10.0~Scorsese Does It Again wereuat06-1 Sign in Permalink Scorsese taking a good movie and turning it into a cinematic masterpiece that will always stay with us. Lots of people did not enjoy the movie because it felt as if it were dragging which i believe is completely wrong. The movie didn't drag, allot of people thought the movie should have ended after Frank Costello got shot. The point of the movie was that there was a rat in the mob helping the cops and a rat in the cops. So now we had to find out what was going to happen. the story is pretty much based on the inner man giving info to the enemy(rat). I think this was portrayed in beautiful fashion with an all star lineup including Mark Wahlberg,Jack Nicholson at his best, and Matt Damon maybe one of his greatest career moves. I thought this movie was excellent another great hit from a hall of fame director Martin Scorsese. 10 out of 10.
1.0~Overrated, overacted and over done bookiemike Sign in Permalink This film was a waste of some tremendous talent - (remember Mars Attacks?) - with what seems to be a great cast, yet such a poor storyline. As for being in the top 250!?! The bottom 250 would be more appropriate. I reckon the reason Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar is simply that he's never deserved one. As the master of overrated films he should be avoided, The Departed continues this trend. Gratuitous and often unexplained violence is liberally scattered around the hour too long the film lasts. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson,. Ray Winstone plays Ray Winstone,. Leonardo DiCaprio starts OK and then over acts his way into making me laugh almost as much as he appears to be ready to burst into tears. I cannot understand how this film has been rated so highly by so many, I can only assume that the recent reduction in numbers of bloody and vicious films has brought some sadists out of the woodwork. Films need a steady storyline, either flowing or twisting, with a little consistency, the Departed doesn't possess this, instead my feeling after seeing the film, added to one of great disappointment, was that the story was made up as the film was being made, and that much of it had been left on the cutting room floor.
1.0~another Asian remake michael-phipps Sign in Permalink With out Siu Fai Mak, this film would never have happened - even from Martin Scorsese. It is evident that Hollywood has completely run dry of new ideas and is seeking great films from Asian nations to make money - e.g. 'The Ring'. After years of great original gangster films from Scorsese, I am disappointed. A setting in Boston, is the only original item of this film. For those unfamiliar with Siu Fai Mak, I deeply encourage you to watch 'Mou Gaan Dou' ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/ ) aka 'Infernal Affairs' - the basis for this film. Infernal Affairs contains far more intense drama and (if not better) an equally high quality acting roster than this remake. Although this film was greatly entertaining, it would not have been made if not for the 2002 original from China.
8.0~A Belated Response - Moral Ambiguity ameh1 Sign in Permalink The Departed, is one of the better movies I have seen by Martin Scorcece, with Leonardo DiCaprio as a replacement for Robert De Niro, and with Jack Nicholson at his evil best, when you watch him on screen you realize that acting for him seems the most natural thing to do, nothing seems too difficult, everything comes easily, although it would interesting to see if he is able to play characters that are simple and straightforward, instead of people who seem to keep the company of the devil. The movie is slow and methodical, where characters talk to each other and the story is allowed to develop for audiences to absorb and understand. But judgment is still out on Leonardo, he seems to express emotion and has screen presence, however this role does not have much range, it is limited in its scope, so one cannot really get an idea of his abilities, I maybe wrong for I have not seen some of his earlier movies. But I do not think he is the heir apparent, yet, to a Robert De Niro or an Al Pacino. I did find the female lead Vera Farmiga, fascinating, her performance was very good, and the relationship that develops between Madolyn and Billy Costigan, has a lot of chemistry and charisma, it is unfortunate that the director decided to leave it unresolved or to explain what happened to Madolyn, it would have been interesting. I did find Matt Damon's performance interesting, although a little wooden, because he is unable to express conflict very well. As the movie reaches its final dramatic conclusions and resolutions, one is left with a feeling of incompleteness and irresolution and so one leaves the theater with a sense of Moral Ambiguity and a lot of unanswered questions. Although this is a pretty accurate depictions of the real world, with its sense of chaos, greed, corruption and violence, where the question is not one of good or bad or right or wrong, but one where an individual is measured in degrees of immorality. One always hopes however, that in the world of fiction, we get to see our Moral and Ethical Dilemmas resolved with a clear distinction made between good and evil, right and wrong. At least that is why many of us in the Audience flock the theaters, although in much less numbers than before. Hoping to catch a glimpse of our hero's fight the forces of evil, with all their might and the advances in technology, sometime single handily but often with trusted Sancho at their side, triumphing in the end, and sometimes winning the heart of the most beautiful woman of them all and some of us in the Audience. But Art or what's left of it, demands that we stay true to life and to the story as conceived of by its creators. Although our director does make significant and subtle attempts to take a moral stand, even our arch enemy, by the end begins to show hints of a conflict, a softening of the soul in his relationship with Billy, or in expressing compassion for the fate of the Frank Costello's lady friend. On the other hand, by the end, the director is unable to suppress his fascination with the Mechanical and Technical aspects of the enactment of the Violent Cinematic Death Scene, although Brutally Honest and Tragic, with a Visual Sense of Appeal, it seems empty and hollow if it somehow becomes disassociated with the story, as certain important or meaningful characters seem to disappear and one is left with a sense of loss at their sudden end or disappearance.
6.0~"Honesty is not synonymous with truth..." moonspinner55 Sign in Permalink Cocky Boston police detective with the Special Investigations Unit--who, as a young man, was mentored by a drug kingpin, an overgrown thug who is still making everyone shake in the old neighborhood--is still in-cahoots with this mob boss and attempts to ferret out the police cadet whose job it was to infiltrate the bad guys' circle and get hired on. In turn, the cadet--who is frustrated by his lack of identity--must find the spy on the police force who is playing both sides. Big Oscar winner from director Martin Scorsese is an Americanization of Hong Kong's "Mou gaan dou" from 2002. It is also very typical of this particular filmmaker: flashy, fast-moving, repugnant and yet reveling in its nastiness--to the point where one nearly feels the rampant ugliness and constant homophobia gets the director's seal of approval. As the undercover cop, Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his finest work yet; although he can't do much with the man-woman stuff involving a perplexing Public Service psychiatrist, DiCaprio is convincingly rough in a very difficult role to pull off. As the bad detective, Matt Damon is also first-rate, bravely playing a real pr*ck while giving the picture a smug swagger that suits the narrative well (I would have preferred more about this character's loss of morals however, which happens entirely off-camera). As the drug-lord, Jack Nicholson performs without vanity and slithers through the movie like a smiling cobra; his unpredictability as an actor is tailor-made for this role, and Scorsese is careful not to overload the screen with Jack (we get just enough of him, although one sequence in a porno theater goes over-the-top). "The Departed" isn't particularly shrewd, and it is not Scorsese's best work, but the linear structure of the complicated plot is nearly free of static and has many gripping scenes. **1/2 from ****
1.0~Who ever heard of Westerners copying Asians skyjoanna Sign in Permalink Shocking is the only word for the originality of this movie. The movie is an almost exact replica of a Chinese film made 4-5 years ago called "Infernal Affairs" which won every nomination at the Chinese version of the Academy Awards. Not only was Infernal Affairs better in every aspect, it was original. The director and writer of this movie should be sued on the same basis that Taiwanese counterfeit makers are arrested for making Pradda with two "Ds", Nikey with a "Y" and Soney with an "E". With all the money Hollywood makes, you'd think there would be some left for originality. And to top that off, instead of an improvement which most remakes are, this movie did not do the original justice. To those that are interested in watching this movie, may I suggest paying less to buy the DVD of Infernal Affairs, where popcorn would not be a requirement to enjoy the movie, but rather a distraction from concentrating on a well made original film.
6.0~More of the same - good, but the same sven-58 Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong, I am a big Marty Scorcese fan, but I want to point out a few things about his latest film that you may not have noticed because he has become so crafty over the years. These are some of the "tricks" or "Devices" which were cool in "Casino" when first used, but now that it is ten years later, they seem a bit tired and overused. 1. The use of Early Rolling Stones music under a scene. Can't you afford to hire a real composer? OK, we get it. Rolling Stones music is cool, but do you have to use it in every movie and have it play under scenes. 2. The steady cam shot into a place of business that the mob guy has dominion over: Although the steady cam shot in this film was relatively short, it still reeked of the same type of shot into the Copacabana club in "Good Fellas" 3. The Iris wipe. This, to me was never a good idea and in fact seems like a frustration of the "limitations" of film by Scorcese: Basically, the director can't find a way to focus our attention on a particular piece of business in the shot, so he narrows our field of view to exclude everything else except what he wants us to see. 4. Lots of graphic violence. Again, OK, we get it. Organized crime kills people and chops them up and puts their heads in vices and beats them with baseball bats: Hey, Scorcese has an excellent special effects team headed by Robert Legato that make those head splatter shots realistic, but really, there is more violence in a Scorcese picture than most Friday the 13th flicks. Can you tell the story with less on screen violence? It seems that Scorcese forgot that the audience has an imagination and that their imagination is more powerful than his special effects and stunt crew. 5. The "chop sound with picture" edit. Again, a cool and effective device for switching scenes, but again more of a crutch device. Can't you just find a clever way to edit from one scene to the next without chopping the music from the previous scene? 6. Stupid women. Aren't you ladies a little angry at how women are portrayed in Scorcese's films? Let's see, Jodie Foster is an under-age hooker in Taxi, Sharon Stone is a drugged-out gold-digger in Casino, and Vera Farmiga plays a Psychiatrist, but is basically pushed around and lied to the whole picture. I am guessing that this is reflecting Scorcese's Heritage's view of women as subservient, second-hand citizens. Imagine how much richer his films could be if he had the ability to portray a strong female character? In summary, I really enjoy Scorcese's directing and his visual style. I am just disappointed that the little Italian man gets stuck in his bag of cinematic tricks. Imagine Hitchcock using a shower scene in several movies or Kubrick using a steady cam shot behind a big wheel more than once and you get the idea I am trying to get at.
10.0~Scorsese back to form fejimanz Sign in Permalink The Departed (2006) Dir: Martin Scorsese Rating: If you like good things... go see this film. Scorsese's best film in years. What's Good About It: They say that people elevate the level of play if they believe in their coach, (Which is evident this year in the miracle that is the Detroit Tigers) and it is evident that every one of these actors (great in their own right) upped every ounce of their game for Scorsese. Scorsese is back to what he does best, (after more than a decade since Casino) and he shows that he hasn't lost any of his balls in the decade, despite the scientific likelihood that his ability to procreate has decreased with age. Anyways, despite a couple things I didn't like on his end, this film was gloriously directed, with the pace of a healthy bowel movement (slow and steady with spurts of speed and spatter). It also brings back a lot of the directorial instinct I liked from Taxi Driver, and haven't really seen him explore again. Some people say that being a child, and being elderly are very similar, and I hope that this is the beginning of Scorsese's second childhood, where he re-finds what made him a unique voice to begin with. OK, the acting in this film is some of the most top notch acting by a group of individuals I have seen in a long time. They don't act like an ensemble (ie United 93) which is what made the film a lot better, all were individuals who were after their own goals, and all even appeared to have their own mini film within in the film. It's something that doesn't work very often unless you get the right mix of actors, and this mix of actors is glorious, all of which I would love to work with. I would love to write a paragraph on all of them from Ray Winstone to Alec Baldwin to Kevin Corrigan but that would take FOREVER... so I will talk about the highlights. Finally... FINALLY!!! someone cast Leonardo DiCaprio in a role that he was suited for, I didn't like him as 'Howard Hughes' in the The Aviator, I thought there were dozens of actors better suited for that role that Leo (I am not saying that he was bad, he just didn't have the tools or the look). I am of the belief that Leo gets miscast more than any other actor, just because people really wanna have Leo in their films, and in only 1 out of 4 films is he ever cast correctly (Such as; Catch Me If You Can, Titanic being the reason people wanna cast him and do so incorrectly for everything he was casted in before this i have no qualms with) I think Leo really defined himself as an adult actor with this role, before he was playing roles that he was still coming of age, or still the young kid. This was an adult role that he took and hit out of the ballpark, out of the number of Oscar nominations I assume this film will get, his will be one that was actually deserved (not to take anything away from the rest of the film, its just a film that the academy will over praise... I am sure). I was happy to see Martin Sheen kickin it again on the big screen, and he was great. The team up with Mark Wahlberg's character made for some of the most memorable portions of the film. Both these actors are actors that I have enjoyed for a while, and I am happy to see them both doing something other than The Italian Job 12 (Wahlberg) and small screen fare (Sheen). That will be all that I go into detail about what is good, for there was so much that I can't really get into it all unless I write an epic... and I don't write epics unless its about 'poo' or 'holes in my shoes' so I shall move on to... What Was Bad: I am going to go out on a limb and say Jack Nicholson. He is so close to brilliance in this film, but I feel it crossed over into ridiculous cartoonish evil. Really I hate to say it, because there is so much to like about the performance, but I even feel that the film makers saw what I saw, and his part in the film feels edited down (also from the information I have read in interviews, and other literature on the film). Though I will give him praise for taking risks in his character (for there were many), because there isn't enough risk taking in Hollywood today, and it was great to see a well established actor (who is known for taking risks) take some. Also I will say this, and I won't write any spoiler, though it doesn't hold a bearing on the story... the last frames of the film, almost ruined it for me... They did something I despise, and that is toss in a simple ass visual metaphor and symbolism just so that the idiot average film goer can think he figured out a "subtle" insinuation from the film maker... when and if you see the film you will know what I mean... it's literally the last frames of the film before the creds. Epilogue: If you like any Scorsese, see this film. If you like any Quentin Tarantino (specifically Reservoir Dogs), see this film. BUT DON'T TAKE YOUR MOM'S OR YOUR KIDS!!! This film is rough... so show it to people judiciously.
9.0~Martin Scorcese's Badfellas dunmore_ego Sign in Permalink Cops who are robbers. Robbers who are cops. And a hip hop star synonymous with exposed underpants who steals the show. A welcome return to form for the premier gangster movie-maker, Martin Scorcese bats one outa the park with *The Departed*. Ferociously funny, doggedly compelling, a *tour de force* of gritty production, tightly-wound storyline, sneeringly salty language and flame-throwing acting chops. And there's Leo and Matt and Martin and Alec and Marky Mark. And Jack. All so deliciously at the top of their game that the word Oscar is bandied about this movie as profligately as it is around Sesame Street's resident Grouch. Deservedly so. Jack Nicholson is Irish mafia kingpin, Frank Costello, who opens the movie cultivating the trust of a young street kid, who grows to be Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a Massachusetts Police Officer whose loyalties lie not with law enforcement, but with his mentor, Costello. Concurrently, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a former street thug who passes his academy training with flying colors, and who also applies to the Massachusetts P.D., is rejected on the grounds that you can take the thug out of the street, but not vice versa, and is "invited" instead to go deep undercover within Costello's mafia. Confronting Police Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), being forced to relive his checkered past, though DiCaprio mines incredible emotive shadings, that scene is definitively stolen by Mark Wahlberg, as the Cynicism juggernaut, Detective Dignam. With this film, Wahlberg comes into his own as an Actor; though his scenes are short, they are as cuttingly sweet as limes and salt rubbed into paper-cut wounds. *The Departed* quickly establishes its triangle of the gangster (Costello), his mole in the police (Sullivan), and the police mole in his outfit (Costigan)  and then sits back and lets the plot twist, as each faction tries to untwist its knickers and weed out their respective moles. Right hand man to Costello is Mr. French (Ray Winstone, almost unrecognizable under heavy beard and faux-Boston accent  given away by his customary élan, i.e. as tender and subtle as a crucifix nail). Under Captain Queenan is Ellerby (Alec Baldwin, in another of this movie's smallish roles that is eaten alive by its actor  Baldwin gives Wahlberg a run for his money as comic relief scene-stealer). Amongst the battle-scarred veterans, Scorcese chose wisely to insert a "new" beautiful face as female lead - Vera Farmiga, as police psychoanalyst, Madolyn, who moves in with Sullivan and then begins an affair with Costigan (nice!), setting up a tangential triangle which might have obscured the larger criminal drama in a lesser director's hands, but otherwise only served to verify that old saw, "chicks dig bad guys." Sullivan is a policeman, sure, but as a mole for Costello he is inherently a Bad Guy  whether Madolyn knows this or not, she is drawn to his duplicity and callousness. Costigan, though also a cop, is so deep undercover that the street is rubbing off on him in ways that make Madolyn's pants-suit pants moist - once again, no medals for figuring why she prescribes him "private therapy." *The Departed* is unmistakably Scorcese, with all the classic Scorcese stamps; his characteristic camera moves, angles and smash-cutting; foreboding or calming source music juxtaposed over contrary visuals, and pulling a depth of performance from his actors that must take them places in their heads they never want to visit again without an attorney. Selling Leo as a hard case in Scorcese's *Gangs of New York* was mildly obtuse; here, in their third collaboration, DiCaprio is steaming with mental muscle, street smarts and a spring-wound temper that turbo-charges his screen presence like no other role he has ever attacked. Not only might it be one of *his* best performances on film, the same can be said of Nicholson, whose conniving and ruthless Costello seems always to be on the verge of either welcoming you as a brother or snapping your spine and appending a pun. Re-made from a recent Hong Kong movie *Mou gaan dou* (*Infernal Affairs*, 2002) (written by Felix Chong and Siu Fai Mak and directed by Mak and Wai Keung Lau), it is a slight annoyance that Scorcese would insult his audience by performing that patronizing surgical act of re-rendering foreign art for the Great American Unwashed; on the other hand, *The Departed* (screenplayed by William Monahan) stands extremely tall on its own merit, not exuding that alarmist *stanque* of "remake" (*Oliver Twist*) or worse, "bad remake" (*Fun with Dick and Jane*) or worse still, "pointless remake" (*Psycho*). Whereas Scorcese's *Goodfellas* showed us the world through the eyes of only bad fellas, *The Departed* slews its camera over the wrong AND the right side of the law, graying the line between honor and justice and law and order with its complex layers of hypocrisy. Among thieves, among cops alike, we see honor and duplicity and lawlessness and order. The worlds are exactly the same. But the chicks dig the bad guys. (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
8.0~Stunning remake: but why a remake, from Scorsese? Chris Knipp Sign in Permalink Writer William Monahan uses a borrowed premise, borrowed plot, for Martin Scorsese's exciting and violent new crime movie, The Departed. The Irish Catholic intonation of the title emphasizes the Boston setting. We're far from the HongKong of the original, Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's Infernal Affairs . A group of Chinese triad gangsters are mocked with racial epithets, as if to further distance the new version from the Asian original. But the HongKong source remains. It's an illustrious one: the original was a well-made, well-acted film and so hugely successful two sequels appeared before this remake could be finished. Internal Affairs' mirror-image plot structure is so clever and one might almost say so obvious that it's surprising it was never used before. It gets deeper than ever into the always potentially incestuous, sometimes interchangeable, relationship between cops and robbers. In this story, the two main characters do cross over. And their goal is to stay there. In the original there is perhaps more of a sense conveyed of how hard it is to sustain the deception over time. Everything is so fast and furious in The Departed we don't think of the time. The cunning premise is that once upon a time there were two young men, who both eventually became police cadets. One almost from the start (we see him as a mere kid, at a soda fountain) becomes the protégé of a gangland boss who, when the boy becomes a man, persuades him to infiltrate the police force and spy on its activities for the gang. Matt Damon is at his most unappealing and blank as this slick liar. The other is a smart kid from a seedy family with Irish mafia links but an honest if unsuccessful dad, now departed, who doesn't do so well as a police cadet but is eagerly recruited by the police undercover division as an ideal person to infiltrate the gang. Leonardo DiCaprio is overwrought but strong as the pill-popping pseudo crook, who of course is in more danger. He must live among sadists, bad guys. The cops have foul mouths: this is writer Monahan's delight. But they are not made to appear as psychopaths. The two men are like stage managers, observing and calling shots from inside to a force outside. But unlike the God (and the artist) of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist who looks down from above, "within or behind or beyond or above his work, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails," these two mirror-image undercover operatives are always hiding and in danger of being found out, vulnerable to the consequences of any action. In the original, you're struck by how alike they are. They run the same dangers and play the same game of betrayal of associates. Here in the American version somehow the contrast is made stronger. The film is nihilistic and cruel, but it is moral in this aspect. Damon is a despicable fat cat, given a posh apartment. DiCaprio is a nervous outsider, sensitive and suffering. But even Damon and DiCaprio have a certain square-jawed similarity. The Chinese original had the two major matinée idols of HongKong film, Jeff Lau in Damon's role and Tony Leung in DiCaprio's, so you can't say it too didn't have big names. It ran fifty minutes shorter though and the performances were more understated: there was a greater economy and subtlety. Using Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Charlie Sheen adds to the authentic sound of the Boston accents. The overlay is convincing. Another new touch is having a woman both moles are interested in; Vera Farmiga is a psychotherapist whom Damon dates and DiCaprio is treated by. There's also Ray Winstone, excellent, as always, as crime boss Costello's associate. And there's Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello himself. Since the running time and the baroque expansion of scenes gives the actors too much time to ham it up, Jack just winds up being Jack. Apart from that, he doesn't feel like a crime boss. He doesn't have the physical authority of James Gandolfini, the stillness of real menace (which Winstone has). He feels like an over-the-top actor who's descended into mannerisms and comedy. In the original film, the parallelism is cunning: it's all you really need; the situation itself is extremely suspenseful. You don't have to jazz it up. The new version is also more moralistic. DiCaprio is more of a martyr and Damon more of a scumbag. The Chinese version makes you feel more sympathy for each, more conscious of the danger they're both in and the parallelism of their roles. Monahan is praised for his dialogue, and it's certainly spicy, but it's overdone. All Wahlberg does as the undercover cops' handler is insult and swear at people. He's generally the most appealing character in a crime movie, but this time he's a little wasted. Nicholson's character is incapable of referring to a priest without mentioning pederasty or a wife without alluding to fellatio. All this aside, the two and a half hours go by quickly enough. Scorsese's editor Thelma Schoonmaker does a bang-up job; the actors are in fine (if in Nicholson's case overripe) form. This is Scorsese's first crime movie since Casino and his most entertaining in a long time. It's also arguably his most nihilistic. After everybody blows everybody else's head off and the bad guy gets a commendation (but not the girl), there's nothing left on the ground but blood and cynicism. Great entertainment, a damned good show. But still the question remains: why does a filmmaker of the caliber of Martin Scorsese want to do a remake, even of a story as archetypal as Lau and Mak's Infernal Affairs?
9.0~Brilliant, brilliant performances thechosen1 Sign in Permalink OK now... I've never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I have always believed that he is a brilliant actor. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", "Gangs of New York", "Catch Me If You Can", "The Aviator" and now "The Departed." All fantastic performances. This might be a bit premature for me to say, but after four Golden Globe nominations with one win, plus two Oscar nominations... come on Academy people, hand over an Oscar to this guy, he deserves it. (Martin Scorcese's is a whole other request... I've given up on that one). He really held his own against an acting powerhouse like Jack Nicholson (who was, of course, great as well). In fact there were times when he actually stole the scene from him. If ever there was a character you sympathised with from the very beginning, it was this guy. And DiCaprio's performance really helped build that feeling. Matt Damon has been steadily pacing himself as an actor of immense worth as well. His career speaks for itself. Solid performances every time. It was nice to see him play a character like this though. I agree with people here who say he should do this type of role more often. He was believable, it worked. Martin Sheen was, well, Martin Sheen. Great screen presence. Alec Baldwin was hilarious. I love the way he just disappears into his characters. He just 'blends in' with the atmosphere created by the scene. Swift, sharp dialogue execution. I love it. But Mark Wahlberg stole the show for me. He didn't have as much screen time as the others, but man oh man, he just killed it. Brilliant performance. There are times when you wonder whether he's going to be in the next scene just so you can see him again. He stood out in every scene he was in: in the beginning with Sheen and DiCaprio and then later with Nicholson, Baldwin and Damon. I think he's always had this in him, but he really needed a quality film like this (Scorcese being the director has gotta help) to show what he can really do. I was blown away by his performance. In fact there wasn't a hair out of line in all the performances. We've all been hearing it for weeks and I'll just say it again... this is a superbly-cast movie. Now with the acting out of the way, let's get to the rest of the movie. It was thrilling, it was suspenseful and it took me a few minutes to get used to the ending, but the longer I thought about it, the more I liked it. I haven't seen "Internal Affairs" so I have no idea how similar this is to that. But I don't like making too many comparisons anyway. This movie stands out quite prominently on its own. A bit of a slow start, but things really heat up after the first hour. Highly recommended. :-) ****/***** 9/10.
7.0~good 3/4 but bad ending billcr12 Sign in Permalink The Departed starts out great with Jack Nicholson narrating an overview of the crime scene in Boston beginning in the 1960s. Jack is Frank Costello, head of the Irish mob and at war with the older Italian Mafia. Frank befriends Colin Sullivan(Matt Damon) who joins the state police organized crime unit and becomes an informant to Jack, providing him with vital information. Billy Costigan(Leonardo Di Caprio) is chosen to go undercover and then commits a crime in order to establish credibility with the mobsters and infiltrates the criminal underworld. Departed then becomes a cat and mouse game with each side being aware of the others existence but knowing the actual identity. The cast is magnificent, with Jack, Leonardo, Matt, plus Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin, it is an allstar lineup. The problem is both the two and a half hour running time and closing fifteen minutes so bad that it's laughable. It's as if Moe, Larry and Curley from the three stooges took over from Scorcese to complete the project. Best Picture; no way, it should have been Pan's Labyrinth, a masterpiece from Guillermo Del Toro. The academy blew it, big time.
10.0~Brilliant. djporter2007 Sign in Permalink excellent,loved it, good fellas was great this was excellent, although casting Matt Damon wouldn't have been my first choice, or perhaps reverse the roles of Damon a Dicaprio, Douglass was good, and good old jack was fantastically creepy as Costello, the plot was very good although a few gaps in it. what was in the envelope that Dicaprio gave to the shrink?. overall it was a bit plenty but the film kept me engrossed through out and i couldn't wait to see what happened to everyone and couldn't help thinking how it would end, you couldn't guess, and mark Whalberg gives an excellent performance as the cop with attitude and humour as does jack Nicholson.
5.0~Disappointing missygoldstein Sign in Permalink I usually go to the movie theater when a movie is as hyped as this one. It won an academy award and I still didn't see it. After all the awards, praise....I had this sinking feeling that it couldn't possibly live up to all of this. I finally watched it on cable last night and I have to say it didn't. While this was not a bad film and it was an entertaining story in my opinion it just did not even come close to living up to all the high praise it received. I heard many times people compare this to Goodfellas. The only possible reason I could imagine they'd make that comparison is because of Scorcese, but clearly that is where the comparison ends. Goodfellas was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The Departed? Not so much. The story centers on two men both graduating from the police academy, one who has a family history of connection to the mob and ends up working for the police as an spy and informant so they could bring down this mob guy, and the other who was groomed from childhood by the same mob guy to get INTO the police department and get high up in the ranks so he could find things out and shield himself from being arrested through tips and information. So both boys are basically informants, one for the cops, the other for the mafia. It seems to me that the idea is to show "good vs bad". In the beginning of the movie Costello (nicholson, the "bad mafia guy") exclaims; "you can become a cop or work in organized crime. When you're looking down the barrel of a gun what's the difference"? This theme supposedly is to play out during the movie and it is up to us, the audience to figure out what the difference IS. The problem with this movie in my opinion is there WAS no noticble difference between these two characters. They were both young, driven, and dedicated seemingly believing in their cause and the work that they did. They both felt guilt over their secret status. They both were terrified of being found out. Honestly during the course of the movie I found myself getting confused over who's the "good guy" and who's the "bad guy". Everyone double crossed everyone. Everyone was dirty and corrupt, including the police. I'm assuming that we as the audience are to derive the message that good and evil exist in all of us? Not sure. I personally don't like when movies depict the "bad guy" in such an obvious comparison to the "good guy", but here I just was confused about the movies intent. I thought many of the scenes were completely far fetched and over the top, unbelievable and silly. The problem I have with this movie is that I did not have any feelings for either guy, good, or bad. I had no sympathy for Decaprio, and no disdain for Damon. Who WAS the good guy/bad guy? I thought Nicholoson, who I usually like was playing "the joker". In all this wasn't a bad movie. It just wasn't great.
9.0~Unique in this type of films haimbaram Sign in Permalink The film is very violent indeed, but its artistic merits are truly overwhelming. It is rare to see such a high standard of acting, and this unqualified praise is for the entire cast. It is too neutral politically but one can draw one's own conclusions. Directing and editing are excellent, too. The film makes a Compelling viewing and it is even thought-provoking. A word of polite criticism: the violence is sometimes excessive and I detected at least four or five people at the theatre who actually laughed as if they witnessed a slapstick-type comedy. I feel that some creative restraint would have been helpful. Fortunately, the assured handling of the plot by the director has proved to be the decisive factor in the film's outstanding overall impact. I am almost certain that viewers will Cherish it even in 40 years time.
10.0~A Masterpiece of the Millennium hghoraba Sign in Permalink Having to admit that I was skeptical that Martin Scorsese can pull up a new great movie like he did in the past 3 decades (Mean Streats, Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Casino to name a few) especially being ignored by the Oscar committee for over 40 years of great work!!!, I was skeptical in the beginning of the quality of this movie. Yet Having the Legendary director with full star cast including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg who could miss a movie like that?!!! I have to admit that I spent some of the finest 150+ Mins in my life watching this magnificent movie. I have to be honest that I would never have thought that it would be half as good as it was. Me being a person who watched thousands of movies in my life there is a little room for surprises to me but I was SHOCKED. This movie will be held in the movies hall of fame to be one of the wittiest , brilliantly acted and directed movies of all time. Not a single minute of boredom in over two and half hours of brilliance. This movie just cracked its way in my Top 10 List ever. There are no words that describe the script smoothness and slickness throughout the whole movie. Leornard Di Caprio have entered in a new dimension in his acting skills and now he is not the boy with pretty face , no this Guy can on par to the greatest actors alive now. Nothing short of brilliant. No need to mention Jack Nicholson because he is the master who never really misses , Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg probably have done the roles of their lives. I haven't mentioned Vera Farmiga as she is pushing her way into stardom with the act she did in this movie. Throughout the movie you will feel no one is really acting and it's the real thing you are watching. Excellent camera control and flashbacks that really don't interrupt the movie flow but just gives you a glimpse of the background of every character. If you don't like Scorsese or DiCaprio or any of the great film cast or you being offended by violence or profane language, I Still advise you to push yourself to watch this movie because it's like an experience which you will never forget. For the younger audience who haven't watched the Great movies like Godfather , Goodfellas , Pulp Fiction, etc.. you will probably believe that this is the Best Movie you have seen in your life. Go watch it, enjoy it, buy it on DVD, Tell your kids about it and pass it on to your grand children . It'S UNMISSABLE!! And Yes Folks this is better than Goodfellas , Raging Bull and Mean Streets combined. No offense To De Niro cause he is still my favorite actor ever. Long live Scorsese!!!
10.0~The Godfather for this generation samd51 Sign in Permalink This movie was hazy to me at first. I had questions like which side was Matt Damon on? Was Jack Nicholson going to find the rat? Was Mark Whalberg going to do anything important in this movie? But all those questions were answered. This film leaves nothing out. And just to see Jack Nicholson doing what he does best, it reminded me of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. This was definitely Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas. I truly think that it was the right choice for Best Picture. This movie made me have a whole lot more respect for Leonardo Di Caprio and Alec Baldwin, who I think did the best in this movie. It was a truly spectacular film, with a great cast to go along with it.
8.0~By no means an "Instant Classic" but still worth your time cheezsjm Sign in Permalink Well, I must admit this was the first movie I was dying to see in theaters for a long time while it didn't quite live up to the expectations I set, it was still worth seeing. The Departed sets the mood pretty quick which is good bad thing, as with most movies that follow that format, it quickly reaches a point where it begins to drag some when it came time to wrap up the film, things seemed a little rushed. Here's the basic premise Matt Damon's character is and up and coming Massachusetts police detective who has deep ties to a high profile mafia member in Boston (played by Jack Nicholson) he uses that connection to help further his own career while also keeping Nicholson's character from being arrested. The other main character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio Leo is sent undercover to keep tabs on Nicholson. So the plot of the movie becomes, who can catch who first? Damon is trying to help Nicholson find the "rat" in his group, while DiCaprio is trying to find the "leak" back at the police department who keeps tipping Nicholson off. It's a pretty cool premise that leads to some great dialogue and tense scenes. DiCaprio does a good job of portraying the "tormented soul" part who's in constant fear of blowing his cover Damon does alright playing the dual role of "poster boy" cop and smug, crooked cop Nicholson's plays his bad-guy character a bit over the top, but adds a nice comedic element to it in the process there are several "laugh out loud" moments in the film which don't disrupt its intensity. But what helps make The Departed an even stronger film is its supporting cast. Both Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin serve as scene stealers who will have you chuckling to yourself. Martin Sheen turns in a nice performance as the head of the task force looking to take Nicholson down. Relative newcomer (at least in a movie of this scale) Vera Farmiga plays the love interest of Damon and holds her own. Anthony Anderson makes an appearance as well, but really seems out of place in a non-comedic role. Overall, The Departed was a very well written and entertaining movie my only quarrel came towards the end when there was an element introduced that produced one of those dreaded "aw, come on" moments from me. I'm not sure if this movie will have quite the replay value as some of Martin Scorsese's other works have had but it is definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre or of movies in general.
6.0~I am from Hong Kong yeung_o_o Sign in Permalink I am a person from Hong Kong. I have seen a lot of comments. The Departed is not a bad movie. If i need to choose, i think Infernal affairs is better. Because Infernal affairs can handle the frame better. IA can evoke your emotions.Some scene is much more better.Some dialogs are very classical in Infernal affairs too.The movie is very significant and profundity. Finally,i want to clarify some facts. Oscars said that Infernal affairs is a Japanese movie. It is a very serious mistake!! Infernal affairs is a Hong Kong movie. Not Japanese or Korean, Or even not a Chinese movie. Although Hong Kog is a place in China,but the language or the laws is different. I hope you not to misunderstand. :D
10.0~I Am Soooooo Sick Of You People Nosloc Sign in Permalink I read all your stupid comments on this film, grow up, so what you don't like this movie, oh i like the original better, oh the acting was bad, oh Scorsese didn't do it, BULLSH*T, the academy Obviously felt different about this, giving it Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing, And Best Editing????????????????????????? Why Is It Rated Number 35/250, When Infernal Affairs Is Number 228/250??? And so what it had Violence guess what people the world is a Violent Place, so grow up and don't try picking apart a movie. If your going to pick apart a movie, pick one from the bottom 250, like Epic Movie or something. I scan threw these comments and 90% of them are the same, like you copied and pasted it. It's been done, leave the Best Picture Academy Award Winning Film Alone
9.0~The Departed arrives. doublejay30 Sign in Permalink I'm not sure about you, but there is something I find comforting upon hearing the words a Martin Scorsese picture. Like a good home cooked meal, you are in for a treat with all the trimmings. With a Scorsese picture you can bet your 'Color of money' that you will be edutained with his amazing cinema technique, references to classical Hollywood and international filmmakers, and a soundtrack that has you anxiously trying to free up space on your MP3 player. Not including the bloated but interesting 'Gangs of New York', The Departed sees Mr Scorsese return to the gangster genre since his 1995 masterpiece 'Casino.' More than just a remake of the well received Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs' The Departed sees Leonardo Dicaprio as Billy Costigan, a middle class Boston Irish police cadet officer, brought in to become a mole and work undercover in an effort to bring down a local mob and their boss Frank Costello played by the devil incarnate (Jack Nicholson) The engaging plot has a complexity added to it in the form of Colin Sullivan, played by an in form Matt Damon. Looked after as a child by the Costello character and with a life almost the exact flip side to Dicapro's Costigan, Sullivan has also become a cop, only he has been recruited by Nicholson to be his eyes and ears in the department enabling him to see around the longest corners. A web made from the finest lies, wiretaps, frantic mobile phone whispers, sex, violence and deceit is spun, as both Costigan and Sullivan are caught up in it, trying to snuff one another out. The Departed is filled with wonderful moments that highlight the mastery of director Scorsese. A scene in which Costigan tails a paranoid Sullivan through a seedy China town is fantastic, cut with switchblade precision from regular collaborator and genius editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Another is a shootout in a standard gangster genre warehouse, Scorsese stages the action with an assured eye and the sound is brilliant as you hear shots and screams echo out like an orchestra of death. Signature pans, swishes, wipes and zooms are all here, with broody and sombre photography from Michael Ballhaus. Learn to direct watching Scorsese and his amazing crew, even when people are talking the camera moves with purpose and style keeping it interesting and within the needs of the story. William Monahan must take a lot of credit for this film. His script has taken the structure of the original but flavours it all on his own with quotable for years to come and an underlying pathos and humour amongst the swearing and shouting. The film is so full of menace and testosterone the woman next to me in the cinema sprouted hair on her tongue. With wonderful support from Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga and Martin Sheen The Departed is the best Hollywood film of the year. See you at the Oscars.
5.0~This movie's ma should have taken Plan B jp-aventurier Sign in Permalink Early on, Mark Wahlberg mocks Leonardo DiCaprio, "Don't you know any Shakespeare?" Scorsese definitely knows Shakespeare, and tries to make a twist out of the classic tragic ending "everybody dies". The final shot is a rat scampering in front of the Massachusetts State House. This blatant symbolism is nothing less than the punchline to a bad joke. "The Departed" is a classic double-agent flick, but one without any class. All the characters are double-crossers, even the ones who aren't, and they glide through their conflicts with dumb, irish luck. Unlike other such films, there's no sense of glory or betrayal - nothing for an audience to cling to. The "villain" is losing his taste for crime; the undercover cop carries out his mission not for justice, but to get his civilian liberty back; and the undercover mole doesn't care about anything but getting his dick wet and keeping his head above water. Despite their lukewarm characters, Leonardo DiCaprio (who I normally hate) and Jack Nicholson give outstanding performances - and watching them is what makes this movie worth watching at all. DiCaprio downplays his anxiety at being a fake criminal with expert grace and subtlety. Jack is ever cool and commanding - a prince among thugs. Watch for his trademark speak-singing.
1.0~Awful... Really awful. Bigprisc Sign in Permalink Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough, I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film. IA, with a much smaller budget, looks more expensive than The Departed (TD). Character development -IA, is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police, Ming, is torn between his identity as a mole, and his conscience, and the mole in the mafia/gangland, Yan, is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad, nor is Yan good. TD, like all other Hollywood cop movies, is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so one-dimensional, it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey. Timeframe - The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months, Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man, given that everyone (so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan) knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA, it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face. Acting - How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny, if he isn't whining to Queenan, he is whining to the shrink, or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase, so weak and wimpy, he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character, sarcastic as hell, for what? It's a wonder that he is even there, he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan, and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson, so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscast-ed. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers, with the American accents, I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong. Screenplay - This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever. a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a big-time crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss. b. the time-line. c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn, gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died, and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene. d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic. e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese, the FBI informer subplot, the letter that was never heard of again, the love triangle between moles & shrink, the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story. f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did? g. Did I mention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original? Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original. I read that the writer claims that he didn't see the original. Is he trying to claim the great parts of the movies as his own? Isn't that plagiarism? Which brings me to Production value - Scorsese bombed, big time. He has ran out of tricks, the movie started out good, but the ending seemed so rushed, like he has ran out of time, or interest. I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious. But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas. There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot, making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material. Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it.
5.0~Familiar And Overlong But Exciting Undercover Cop Thriller With Fantastic Ensemble ShootingShark Sign in Permalink Desperate to bring down local kingpin Frank Costello, the Boston Police Department convinces a newly graduated officer with a chequered past to go undercover and join Frank's mob. However, Frank has his own agents working for the good guys ... This fast-moving crime melodrama is pretty good fun but for me it's overly familiar Scorsese territory, with its wiseguys, stoolies, religious backdrop, failed romance and general male identity crises. It was a big hit for him, both financially and perhaps more importantly in that he finally won an Oscar after five nominations. But take it from me - most of those previous nominations were for better movies, and some of his best work wasn't even nominated (Taxi Driver, The King Of Comedy). Don't get me wrong though, there's a lot to enjoy in this flick and in some ways it is quite different - there's much more of a focus on plotting and intrigue, there's Crazy Jack doing his inimitable thing and the big ensemble of heavyweights are all clearly enjoying themselves (Wahlberg wins the Joe Pesci gratuitous swearing award). I liked Damon best as the increasingly confused Judas with a lucky streak a mile wide, and the plot has lots of interesting little quirks, such as the inference that Costigan (and not Sullivan) is the father of Madolyn's child. It goes for the standard Hamlet ending, but in an unexpected way and the final shot of the rat is an amusing metaphor. I've never been particularly enamoured of Scorsese's constant fascination with the link between machismo and male identity - I guess it's an Italian-American thing - but when the picture gets into more universal territory, like the scene in the restaurant where Frank is starting to crack under the pressure of knowing there's a traitor in his midst, it starts to come alive. The movie has an unusual history - it's based on the excellent 2002 Cantonese flick Mou Gaan Dou, aka Internal Affairs (and not to be confused with the 1990 Mike Figgis film of the same name). Aren't the Academy Awards strange ? When Scorsese makes a courageous and deeply personal piece like The Last Temptation Of Christ he loses (to Barry Levinson), but when he does a (slightly inferior) remake of a pulp fiction Hong Kong action flick he wins. Hey, maybe there's a rat in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
9.0~Back story based on the FBI's Number 2 still most wanted richmacdonald Sign in Permalink This Movie uses Irish Gangster Whitey Bulger who is still at large as the back drop for this story. Whitey Bulger is still at large and is wanted by the FBI (check their website). Great film, editing seemed rushed and had a few flubs. I wouldn't be surprised if you see more movies based on Bulger in the future. So why haven't a lot of people heard of him? Maybe cause he is still wanted. As far as the plot line goes, could it be a remake of a Japanese film? Who cares? It was probably a Shakespeare story to begin with. As far as the acting goes everyone did a good job. Hey check out the history behind this gangster. like I said before I wouldn't be surprised if you see more movies based on him.
5.0~Average Crime Epic robb6788 Sign in Permalink I really wanted to like this movie. It had so much hype, nominations for several academy awards and a great cast. Not to mention a great director. But I found this film to be very average. Dicaprio is not very believable as a mole and his character development seems rushed and routine. Wahlberg was good but I don't think his performance warrants an academy nomination. I actually thought Damon gave the best performance here. And Nicholson is chewing the scenery a little. I compare this to goodfellas and goodfellas had a very authentic feel to it. The characters were more fleshed out, real and believable. Dicaprio is just kinda like hey Im undercover, Im posing as a hoodlum, this is my whole life. I wanted to know more. We didn't see him really bond with the crew or really earn their trust at any point other than getting hit with a shoe on his bad hand. Here the characters are a more two dimensional. And at the end everything seems wrapped up too quickly. The elevator shootout scene was almost laughable the way people kept walking in and getting shot. And where the hell was Dingham. He was told to show up at the rooftop. No real explanation why he didn't. And why would he quit his job to protect Costigan but not find some way to get him out? If he cared that much he would have got him out or let him know he is in trouble and his cover is about to be lifted. Especially after his partner got thrown off a rooftop. And why the hell didn't costigan just meet with dingham and turn over his evidence to him and go from there. The reason to meet on the rooftop was to get his life back? That was a little idiotic. Overall I sadly give this a 5. Knowing in my mind this could have been a perfect 10
8.0~Excellent Movie, Spectacular Performances By an All-Star Cast ares58 Sign in Permalink The Departed is an an excellent film that is a remake of a Hong Kong blockbuster titled Infernal Affairs. I had previously seen Infernal Affairs and it was a pleasant surprise to see how closely The Departed tracked the original script. My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I definitely recognized several conversations that were lifted directly from the Hong Kong original. WARNING: PLOT SPOILER BEINGS HERE Despite the clearly demonstrated desire to stay true to the highly successful original, there were certain plot modifications made with an American audience in mind. Among them is the fate of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon's character) at the end of the movie. Other than adding a little additional color, and brief moments of humor, the desire for some "positive" closure appears to be the sole reason for the inclusion of Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg's character), a character who was not in the original movie. What really struck me towards the end of the film was the necessity of Billy Costigan's (Leonardo DiCaprio) death. I'm not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I was quite surprised and impressed with how convincingly he played his character. There was a certain point where I realized that in the absence of some cheap trick by the scriptwriter, there was no way for Costigan to live happily ever after. The closest they could have come to a Hollywood ending would have been to have Dignam come in and somehow vouch for Costigan; fortunately it was not with this in mind that he was included in the script. The one thing this remake was unable to capture was the strong father-son relationship between Costigan and Capt. Queenan. That relationship added a lot to Infernal Affairs and made the latter's death all the more affecting.
7.0~A successful operation, but the patient died on the way to the ER! almajo Sign in Permalink "The Departed" - like most other Scorsese movies - focuses on hormone-troubled males who hardly ever learn to grow up, entangled in an unforgiving society, playing their little games until they hit earth. The mob movie master has delivered another solid piece, with all necessary ingredients, but the result's rather half-baked. The whole Irish/Catholic setting introduction in the first few minutes, with a roaming, literally shadowy Jack Nicholson appears to be some kind of an odd mechanism, as it changes the focus and shifts the weight of the story towards him, a move he doesn't really deserve. It seems like today's moviegoer is inept at guessing the bigger picture of a story: Whereas it was intriguing to figure out who's who in "Infernal Affairs" as the movie progressed, here it's all laid out from the start: What an insult to an intelligent audience. Therefore, the initial 10 minutes could've been left out entirely, but my guess is there were some contract ties interfering with the artistic concept, resulting in a beginning that serves but as one big show-off for key-player Nicholson. Speaking of cutting, the crude editing style took me by surprise: At various points throughout the movie, cuts are made in the middle of an action, especially the case with inserts, resulting in a sort of staccato-like viewing experience. In addition, the jump cut approach doesn't quite succeed: The various, random back-and-forth jumps within the storyline left me questioning their real purpose. When it comes to the plot, Scorsese adapted most crucial elements 1:1 (even going as far as stealing shots), but the remake boasts way too many extended scenes, including an Italian mafia subplot and trying to disguise the fact that Scorsese simply worked from a foreign template, thus culminating in a total running time of a close-to-unbearable 150 minutes. Unfortunately, many important puzzle pieces and details are dropped: The police academy background is nearly left out and also the fact that the original mafia boss once served as an instructor in the police squad. Other critics have already pointed out that the subplot involving the police chief (Martin Sheen's character) and his mole (DiCaprio's role) is entirely missing, and to make "The Departed" even less convincing, DiCaprio's infiltration duty is reduced from an impressive 9 years (for Tony Leung in "Infernal Affairs") to a meager single year. Furthermore, I didn't particularly like the whole "swearing competition": For Scorsese, grown-up men are always ruled by their inherent animalistic nature, including excessive verbal and physical violence, but the amount of repetition in this picture distracts from what makes the actual script so fascinating - how and when the two snitches finally find out about one another. The dialogue is very poor for most part and the few instances where Nicholson is allowed to throw in some classic philosophy are rare. "The Departed" also changes the conversation by the two mob members outside the café by a complete 180 degrees. Instead of unmasking undercover agents as people who "look at you", it's now the ones that "look away". As for acting performances, I give an entertaining Mark Wahlberg the Number One spot (although his character doesn't exist in the original), closely followed by DiCaprio, who delivers a fine portrait of a troubled youth from South Boston that can't really cut his ties to his past. Nicholson does a memorable job at being displeased about life in general, as a fatalistic, old Irish mafia boss, although his decreasing physical agility and somnambulistic appearance makes me question his dedication for the movie. Sadly enough, Matt Damon does what he always does best in a movie he appears in: playing an unconvincing role. Not really being a character actor, equipped with an neverchanging haircut, stone-cold facial expressions, it feels to me as if he's never really emotionally present. His lacklustre involvement is a real letdown, and a definite loss for the picture. Compared to "Infernal Affairs", there's only one "big" female character, and even though Vera Farmiga manages to play a psychiatrist torn between the two sides of the same coin, the role demands way too much from her. I feel sorry that "The Departed" omits a second girlfriend from the original (Andy Lau's annoying female sidekick), which makes it incredibly difficult to portray two women in one. Scorsese adds more responsibility to Farmiga's role, but in the end, she suffers the same destiny like her Hong Kong counterparts: she's too weak, too unimportant in the big scheme of things. What the pregnancy's supposed to add to the storyline, I don't know. Something quite distracting that I noticed were the constant background songs. Rarely does the film give you some quiet time, silence is a foreign word for Scorsese. As if the combination of hard-boiled, simplified dialogue and smashing action wasn't enough to please a younger audience, "The Departed" serves you song after song, randomly piling up a plethora of music tracks that don't really serve any purpose. On the contrary, they are a real issue. They're neither location background music, nor a true soundtrack. To come to an end, I ask myself why the remake is almost an entire hour longer than the original. This movie is so artificially stretched and chewed out, hosts unnecessary lengthy scenes that don't really enhance the storyline or the movie overall. The original suspense is lost and makes way for a exhibition of overpaid actors. Two and a half hours for a tale that can be told in a much more concise and straightforward manner, as the four-year old Asian installment deservedly demonstrated. I doubt that the change of East Coast scenery will Scorsese do any good for next year's Oscar race. I fear that an aging man of such lasting creativity and intelligence has lost the plot yet again, after an abysmal "Aviator", and that he'll end up just like Robert Altman did, with the possession of a statuette he won't really be able to cherish.
10.0~Masterpiece Rubes17 Sign in Permalink Just got back from a second viewing of Scorsese's latest, and this time was even better than the last. The script is excellent -- this is a well crafted movie that deals with the themes of greed, trust, and deceit. "Man is a political animal" said Aristotle. This film plays with that idea - it's survival of the fittest out there and man's pride can get the best of him if he's not careful. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is clearly blinded by his own greed in this film -- he basically drools when he looks on the great gold dome of the capital building here in Boston. The dome is a motif that sums up the movie well - it is always looming in the background, it's glimmering gold a clear metaphor for the material benefits that men like Sullivan and Costello (Nicholson) desire. All deceive in this movie, even the "good guys". There is miscommunication galore - everyone withholds information from everyone else, even within the departments of the police. The acting is absolutely perfect in this movie. Hands down the best role I have ever seen DiCaprio perform. He is stellar - he encapsulates the fear, frustration, and grit of his Billy Costigan. We completely identify with him, and when he meets his end we feel as if we have met our end. It would be naive of me to say that he will definitely win best actor because one never knows the intricacies (or idiocies) of the academy, but I do believe he deserves it for such a sensational job. Not far behind him is the supporting cast, most notably Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. Wahlberg plays the "bad cop" of the good cop bad cop duo and is an honorable officer who does his job well. He says to an incompetent character, "I'm the guy who does his job, you must be the other guy!" Although he's in a small amount of scenes, he steals them all. The born and raised Boston accent adds to his durable character that doesn't ever flex. He would rather resign than compromise his principles and his devotion to his superior (Martin Sheen, also played well). Lastly, Alec Baldwin seems to have perfected the wise- cracking, vulgar yet efficient boss role as the police chief. The dialogue in the movie is excellent, and he seems to have some of the best lines - every time he speaks he gets a laugh (unquotable for this paper). It is clear that Costigan (DiCaprio) and Sullivan are foils of each other, "two sides of the same coin". They have the same task - to relay the actions of the other side. They have the same contacts, but with dual purposes. They even sleep with the same girl. It is no coincidence that Scorsese picks two virtually identical actors to play the parts. He is commenting on the dual nature of man, the antagonistic light and dark. On one side, greed, deceit, and vanity and on the other decency, integrity, and "merit". Scorsese shows their contrasting characters through their relationship with Gwen (Vera Farmiga) -- Sullivan at one point refuses to even look at a picture of her in adolescence before stowing it away with the sorry, vain excuse that "We may have company" and that "You don't see where I come from". Costigan, on the other hand, warmly embraces the picture and hangs it on her wall when he sees it. Later on, when Billy gives Gwen an envelope and instructs her not to open it, she does as he asks and leaves it sealed. Yet she can't resist opening the package sent to Sullivan. Costigan and Gwen have a relationship of sincerity and trust, whereas Sullivan cannot be trusted - he obscures his past, his true identity, and strives off his lies for his own personal ascension with blind eyes on the gold dome. The Departed is about men who have gone off their predetermined path. The departures are both negative and positive, whether the characters have departed from a life of faith and honesty (Sullivan) or departed from a family history of crime towards the honorable, good path (Costigan). It is about men who have departed from their true identities to play theatrical roles. They then must re-search for themselves - "I have to find myself" says Sullivan. "All I want is my identity back" says Costigan. Scorsese comments on how most of us in the everyday world lead a double life, often playing more than one part for societal and political expediency - "It's a nation of rats" says French, Costello's right-hand man. The Departed is a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat through two viewings. Not to mention one scene that is an excellent homage to one of my favorite movies, The Third Man (the funeral). Marty, I hope this is the one, you've certainly deserved it.
6.0~For The Love of God, please watch 'Infernal Affairs'!! tinny_tiny Sign in Permalink As an avid fan of what it had based on, Infernal Affairs. I was excited to see how Martin Scorsese would interpreted it. The cast looked promising from the trailers, I thought Scorsese could do no wrong. Jack Nicolson as Costello, the calculated brutal crime boss with good sense of humour! I was really surprised by his sense of humour, Jack have really made this character his own and I respect that! Leonardo DiCaprio as Costigan,the police's mole. He had played this tortured soul brilliantly. Matt Damon as Sullivan, Costello's mole with a heart of stone. The Departed had filled in the missing piece of puzzle of IA (violence) but it had compromised with the film's climax to make this Oscar worthy. The first two thirds of the film was fantastic! It had went further into the characters'past than IA (IA explores the characters in 2nd and 3rd instalment) It had a style that stood on it own. It was very promising, but the ending has undone most of the work @ the beginning. The film tries to branch out into different plots & sub-plots which doesn't materialise- it could've make this film stand out rather just a re-make, as it did with Batman Begins. E.g. the film doesn't explain why would Costello double-crossed the corrupted Chinese government officials by selling fake hi-tech military microchips. Did Costello have another bigger agenda in mind? Why would he keep the real microchips for? (NOTE. the mainland Chinese spoke Cantonese with the worst accent I have ever heard! It was not in Cantonese or Manderin accent &why don't they speak Manderin - their official language?! Even the extras spoke in perfect Cantonese during the scene where Sullivan kills an innocent Chinese!) Scorsese followed the same plot path as IA, but minus the moral dilemma both Sullivan & Costigan face, and this does not justify the actions which both characters carried out at the end of the film. For Sullivan - he had no reason to kill Costello or his new found 'co-mole'. The 'Sullivan' character in IA did this because despite that he work for the bad guys, he really enjoys his respectable visage (perfect home, life, girlfriend)&felt wrong for the choices he made &wishes for another chance to make it right, therefore he trapped 'Costello', killed him & (later) new found co-mole, so 'Sullivan' could break free of his cycle of crime. But Sullivan does not express any signs of moral, simply a psychopath. I could no feel sorry for him &I felt Sullivan's action is unnecessary. He killed Costello only by chance! Scorsese develop Sullivan's character's unfortunate childhood &his Catholic faith is that strong, Sullivan would have an apartment with a view of a Catholic Church - what is the point having all this to support his character?! Why would Sullivan recommended Costigan for Honor at the end of the film when he didn't admire Costigan's courage as IA have explore? I don't understand Costigan's desperation - nothing to live for, he didn't sacrifice very much. Costigan would achieve his present existence if he had not joined the police (as most of his family has done). Sure he want his identity back but why would Costigan enlisted Brown's help (aka dim-sum of Romeo Must Die)over Dignam, who is still alive?? He could've send evidence to Dignam to arrest Sullivan, as Costigan claimed that he doesn't want to be a cop anymore but still confront Sullivan alone? The Departed's climax scene was lack of class. The characters become two dimension &all they could do is to scream at each other with swear words &shoot each other and Scorsese had stripped off all suspension (the most powerful scene of IA - it still haunts me to this day). IA created a high-tension with suspension in the climax scene without violence or raise their voices. I am surprise by the final official ending of The Departed is almost parallel to the Mainland Chinese edition of IA. I thought Scorsese would be more brave to use the original 'unconventional' ending. Scorsese did really well on retelling the story in his unique style, changed the dialogue in his own way. But towards the end of the film, you could see the dialogues are practically carbon copy from IA. Did he just gave up? The film started of serious then it fell apart as if it is a parody of the original! I thought all the actors did really well especially Jack, Leo, Ray (Mr. French) and Matt. Some people though Matt's act was bit wooden, but it is not his fault - the script did not develop further into his character - bias more to Leo's character. Madolyn - she seems to fall head over heels to cheeky bad boys. She is just attention seeking. I can't believe she's a shrink! Mr. French's character is what should most of the actors should work towards - subtle but effective. He have created a dark aura & fear in a handful on screen time. He is more fearful than Costello! I don't understand why many people think this film is Oscar worthy? The story is directly from IA. Why should Scorsese take credit for it? The ending of the film just make all the characters to appear shallow!! Some say that it is based on true event - well this basically based on any city in the world with organised criminal gangs - which make this story believable! Scorsese - why leave your work half done?? Did you run out of time? Did you run out of budget? Or did you simply Lost in Translation? You had all the right ingredients to make this film a masterpiece. Yet, you have left me to go home and watch the superb work of the original Infernal Affairs. This is a perfect example that money can't buy you style.
9.0~4 Oscars, 47 additional wins and another 50 nominations buzznzipp1995 Sign in Permalink Whether he knows it or not, Scorcese, has a God-given talent for bringing out stories, with an 'intellectual' twist (Not Last Temptation however). THE DEPARTED, showed the hard-boiled side of Boston that is in need of repair. The whole 'Grit' of the officers and the jobs intermixed, from the criminal element right over to the 'Staties'. There seems to be quite a bit of sludge, in the Law there, as many places, (just about everywhere else in the world) unfortunately. But these investigators, with a real 'leak' Handy-capped department, were everything I would have thought this would be, and I am happy to report even more so. First off the Captin Queenan's office, the interview with one, oh-so-nice conversation with Statie 'Collin Sullivan', to the interview/interrogation of DiCaprio's character, showed the uneven operator's working on the inside. All the while, just doing their job of course. Breaking in the newbie's, getting into their heads, to see what they are made of, especially under pressure. Right off-the-bat, you got the higher up's in your face, when you pass the class and that's just to get things started. It starts to get more interesting, just after that. The good man got beat down from the beginning, then that man took action and in that course of, he started to make real waves. Almost invisibly. Enter (first) Jack Nicholson's 'Frank Costello' who Billy Costigan has nicely "Siddled" up on, and fills a needed position in Frank's business operations his 'Irish' Mafia. This put's Frank's son, who is feeding a criminal from a federal building into a place a crook should never be...'informed'. I was drawn deep into the storyline, from the first few scenes on screen. I was in shock, first when the Captain (Martin Sheen) was standing in for Leo's character and was unable to make it out alive, thus was cast head-long off the meeting place (building) to his,(bloody) end. But as it went on, the story and the shifting of information, back and forth from criminal (Nicholson) to cop (Matt Damon) it became, with the help of Costigan, a lot more complicated, even as it was sifting downward ultimately time would run out and someone from one of the sides would find out, just who the hidden identity was in fact. You know, that Frank's losing his cool and ability to think as he smashes a fly on the table then proceeds to eat it in a bout of anger! Costigan, went on to drop the hammer on Collin, (Matt Damon) he was almost there. The biggest shock was the elevator, after opening and losing the star player. This was a great film, in that some of the players like, Damon and Wahlberg, would use a differing formatted character, than what they usually play. I truly enjoy, Matt Damon's work and yet I perfectly could not stand his character, in this. Superbly done. And as in the end, as the elevator door opens and Collin walks out to head to his door with groceries in arms, as he opens his own front door, he receives the very shock, of his life!! I was blown away at this point, because he (Damon)utters, 'Okay.' Dignam (Mark Walhberg) would be the dispenser of 'ultimate justice' here in this equation. Yet, Sullivan still requested the metal of honor for William Costigan, that was a perfect treat for the ending shot, in this story. This for me was beside 'TITANIC' the most memorable Leo, deep, hungry, passionate, fierce. He was raw and yet refined in his 'mode of operation' investigating, i.e.,cousin Sean, smartly deceptive on the job. Calculated. I enjoyed Stephen Balwin's older Bro in this as well. (****) I recommend, but bring some ear plugs we got some scurrilous verbiage in this one!
1.0~This movies is worse than awful feonamaried Sign in Permalink I love movies, all kinds of movies, but I have to say this would have to be the very worst movie I have seen for quite some time. Apart from the abusive language the amount people being shot with supposed brains being sprayed on the walls was totally unwarranted. No wonder we have violence in the streets of cities and suburbs. Martin Scorcese should be ashamed to be making films such as these and the stars in this movie should hold themselves accountable. I am telling everyone I know not to see this movie and my friend I went with is doing the same. I work in the advertising industry and have friends who also work in the media industry and I am spreading the word not to patronize this movie. I hope for everyones sake it doesn't make money so to encourage directors not to continue to make these types of films!!!
1.0~Departed should have been DOA! rlnutt Sign in Permalink Geez, I'm a Martin Scorsese fan and I've enjoyed just about every one of his movies but "The Departed" was just a terrible piece of film work! Granted the acting was superb but that is about where it ends for me! This has got to be one of the meanest and dark movies ever made by Scorsese... just over the top with characters that anyone would walk on the other side of the street to avoid! When the movie goes out of its way to make our protagonist a victim and not allow him to get his life back, that's when it completely lost me! How much frigging realism do we need? He could have gotten the point across and not had Mark Whalberg's character be the only 'good' one left... all others were killed off! And, with Whalberg, you never liked him because of his attitude throughout the movie! Damon was good and Nicholson was his usual scene stealer self and Leo was in a league all his own, but the movie went 30 minutes too long and the ending was too awful to enjoy! No escapism for me here, just a reminder that we have really bad people in the world and some of them have taken a pledge to 'Protect and Serve'! This terrible piece of trash will get Scorsese his first Oscar because the Academy will award him more for his body of work than for this movie; I'm just afraid that once he wins, other filmmakers will feel the need to copy this movie's style and we'll see 100 clones of corrupt cops killing everyone that might remotely cross them! BLECH!
4.0~Ridiculously Over-hyped tmojoman Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese's "The Departed" won the Oscar for Best Picture last night (2/25/07). Simply by that large achievement my review will be posted here, just to get off my chest a few personal opinions of this film. This film by large was applauded by virtually every critic that has a area to express a view for movies. While that alone will not be enough to get me excited about a movie (especially nowadays), I am a big fan of Scorcese's work, particularly "Raging Bull", which I believe to be the best film to have come out in the last 25 years. So to say that I was looking forward to "The Departed", with it's dream male cast of Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon (criminally overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor Nomination), Alec Baldwin, and Leonardo DiCaprio, would be a bit of an understatement. To save some unnecessary details about the film (which, incidentally, if you look at any other reviews, you would have seen already), I will simply say that this film suffered from (largly): Scatterbrained, attention-deficit disorder editing/screen writing, where the average scene seemed to be all of 14 seconds long, especially in the first 45 minutes... Deriviative, plagiarized writing that Scorcese has done (much better) before. Gangster picture with violent, non-sensical action meaning nothing, and rapid-fire scenes with music loud and in your face (gee, haven't I heard that Rolling Stones song before?) Undeveloped, unlikeable lead character in DiCaprio. There is no substance to his character and doesn't receive on bit of concern from the audience-goer. Also, while he is a very capable actor, he is just still far too young looking to head a clearly very adult-natured film. The only thing that saves this movie is the mildly-surprising ending and Matt Damon's unheralded work. He is truly a gifted actor and deserves more acclaim for his work. 4/10 rating.
10.0~Scorcese SCORES again! brilliant, amazing, revolutionary kmr_jy Sign in Permalink you can add this movie to your list of favorite movies for your children/grandchildren and future generations, ie: godfather/carlito's way/and others. One of the Best directors of current times.. This movie, start to finish is action gripping sequence along with well trimmed dialogues and brilliant acting, especially LEO. Amazing picturization, screenplay. I went to theatres thinking this movie is over-hyped but I was proved wrong. I would love it see it again and again. You can learn a lot from each scene. There is a scene where Matt Damon's character looks through his balcony from his new condo<<< watch for symbolism in that scene, becomes very important in the end. I would recommend everyone to watch each scene very carefully.
9.0~A modern day Shakespearian tragedy MovieRat-2 Sign in Permalink If you didn't know any better, you would have thought that this story was written by Shakespeare. I mean it has everything: complex characters, heavy accents (Bostonian) that are near incomprehensible, plenty of language (oh yes, Shakespeare was quite vulgar for his time), sex, witty comedy relief, and an extremely high body count (along with gallons of blood). What starts as a simple undercover job turns into a deadly cat and mouse chase between the two rats (DiCaprio and Damon) to discover the identity of each other without getting killed in the process. Jack Nicholson is, as always, superb and delightfully evil as the vicious mob boss who, like everyone else in the film, has something big to hide other than the fact that he is a mobster. Minor roles of Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen almost steal the show with their off beat humor and sheer presence (respectively). Fair warning, this film has some very rough cursing and very graphic mob violence and is definitely not for anyone below 17. No nudity, surprising for a Scorsese film, but he makes it up with plenty of graphic sex talk (mostly from Nicholson). An excellent film.
10.0~The Departed is the best movie in recent memory greg-1120 Sign in Permalink I was somewhat taken aback by the power of this movie. While Godfather II is perhaps the best gangster movie of all time, this flick is a VERY close second. Moreover, it may very well be one of the best movies ever, and it ranks with Scorsese's best, including "Raging Bull." The cast was, simply, superb, and as I left the movie, I recounted who will win what Oscars....Scorsese is a lock for best director; the film will win best picture; but the acting awards will be more difficult to determine. Surely Jack Nicholson will win his umpteenth best actor award, and I would vote for DiCaprio for best supporting actor. DiCaprio might get a best actor nomination himself. I thought Mark Wahlberg was perfectly cast in his role as the liaison for the undercover cop. I will see this movie again to ensure that I haven't missed any nuances!
1.0~Strictly for Fans of Exploding Heads and Naughty Words; Otherwise, a Complete Bore Danusha_Goska Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is garbage. I don't care how many awards it got. I don't care if Martin Scorcese is such a capital J Genius that his feet don't stink. I don't care if critics reached for their thesauruses in competition for synonyms for "Brilliant!" "The Departed"'s appeal is strictly to those who like watching heads explode on camera and think that if a movie uses every naughty word in the book -- in every line -- that makes it deep and profound. Anyone who swallowed "The Departed" needs to have his stomach pumped. Good grief. Shakespeare, the Greek tragedies, classics like "The Third Man" would be lost on these people. As would a truly fine movie from 2006, "The Lives of Others", beside which "The Departed" looks, at best, amateurish and adolescent. I want my money back. And I saw this movie for free. I was so bored I started rearranging the groceries in my bag about ten minutes in. I looked at my watch at least half a dozen times. I thought up drinking games you could play every time Jack Nicholson utters the word *&^%. Several characters are shot -- or dropped -- to death on camera. A man's eyes are poked out. One character is reduced to a drug dependent, quivering wreck. I didn't care. I was amazed at how much I didn't care. I thought about why. I examined the desert emptiness of the script, other than for its resplendently brandished naughty words; reflected that the plot was so bankrupt it could be in chapter 11; I noted how absent characterization was, except to mete out how often each character said %$#^, or his posture when exploding a head. I pondered gossip column narratives involving Alec Baldwin and remembered how cute Mark Wahlberg was in that Calvin Klein ad; I wondered if Leo were still dating the model. An hour into the marathon that was this Guantanamo torture, I realized that I had been so pounded into boredom and apathy that the only thing that would have aroused me was if the entire oh-so-manly cast were, suddenly, to don black net hose and stilettos, and sing the rest of their lines in Gilbert and Sullivan musical style. I hoped against hope that Leslie Nielsen would appear and reveal the entire thing to be a very obscure farce whose humor would gel once Nielsen put it all into "Airplane"-esque perspective. Was Martin Scorcese trying to prove his own manhood by creating a dystopic Disneyland in which every ride is manned by a cop or a mafioso exploding heads and blurting out swear words? Scorcese insults manhood worse than Andrea Dworkin. As for art? I guess Scorcese never heard the phrase, "less is more." As it happens, I had just seen 1947's "The Third Man" the night before. "The Third Man" is black and white; its budget, compared to "The Departed"'s, was tiny. The cast, excepting Orson Welles, consisted of character actors or unknowns. In "The Departed," Jack Nicholson, playing a Very Bad Man, toys with a severed human hand. What hits you is not the shock and awe the scene demands, but the pathos that the movie is so desperately needy for its audience to respond, and so without skill at provoking that response, that it resorts to the kind of gory tricks a Halloween prankster would pull. In "The Third Man," Orson Welles delivers "the cuckoo clock speech." All he does is talk -- and what he says chilled me and frightened me so thoroughly I'll never forget it. Now *that's* a classic film. "The Departed"? Garbage.
6.0~Americans love movies made by American swordsi Sign in Permalink It makes no sense to argue which one is better, the departed or inferno affairs. Obviously most amercians would say the departed is way much better and rated it high score, but this is not the opinion by most of the Asian friends I know. So far as I know, all my friends from asia felt "disappointed" after seen this one... And also it doesn't mean IA better than TD. You even think the music in TD is much better than IA, because you guys listen to this kind of music ever before you could walk. But the songs in IA seems to be more moving and consistent with the plot from an asians' point of view. BTW: is the music in TD by pink floyd? can anyone confirm? The most disappointing change in TD, I think, is that the police undercover just wanted money at the very end. In IA, as a contrast, the police undercover wanted nothing but "to be a cop", and he got what he wanted after he died, which was the beauty of this film. Anyway, no offense. Just different tastes based on different cultures. Your story happened in church, and our story happened in temple. Stop arguing church is so much better than temple, or otherwise.
6.0~Pales next to the Hong Kong original a-tong Sign in Permalink THE DEPARTED is Scorsese's eagerly anticipated remake of the smash Hong Kong thriller, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, which captivated much of Asia and spawned two sequels across the Pacific. The casting of Nicholson, De Caprio et al looked promising. While there are some entertaining moments in DEPARTED and the film is enjoyable, it falls far short of INFERNAL AFFAIRS. Ironcally, IA feels more like a Scorsese film than DEPARTED: fast-cutting, a rock soundtrack, sharp camera moves and action jacked-up to 11. DEPARTED is inconsistent. At two-and-a-half hours, it moves, slows down, rocks, stops, goes forward, pauses. There's also a little too much posturing among all these cops and villains and not enough suspense which accelerated INFERNAL AFFAIRS like a rocket ship hurling into space. The central cat-and-mouse premise between the two moles is strangely muted in DEPARTED and that's what hurts the film the most. Performances are fine, starting with a salty Nicholson. I love Scorsese, but his hallmarks of slick camera moves, swift editing and the perfect soundtrack don't hit the mark. Not bad, but certainly not vintage Marty.
6.0~It's okay king_eru Sign in Permalink I found this movie to be rather boring. I love Martin Scorcese's other films, and when I saw this one win so many Oscars, I expected something as good as Goodfellas, which is a true masterpiece. The acting was great, and the cinematography was pretty good, but the story barely held my attention. About an hour and a half into it I wanted to turn it off, but was compelled to finish it, hoping for some really cool plot twist. I figured that must be the reason that everyone liked it so much. Perhaps there was too much hype, but I was extremely disappointed. I just don't see what all the fuss is regarding this movie. Most of the movies that are coming out of the studios nowadays are complete garbage. So now Scorcese makes a pretty good movie, and people think it belongs in the top 50 of all time. We're becoming complacent and settling for less. This movie is good, but not that good.
10.0~The best cop thriller since "Goodfellas" hchais Sign in Permalink This movie is excellent. It is definitely the greatest movie of 2006 is one of the 5 best movies of the decade. Everything about it is good. The story is one of the best ever. The story is just amazing. The acting is also incredible by almost everybody that was in it. The script is also great. This is definitely The best cop movie since Goodfellas, or you can say the second best cop movie ever made. This is Scorcese's best job directing ever. He deserved to win for Goodfellas. This movie was definitely worthy of the Oscars that it won. It deserved to take home best picture, director, and screenplay. I am surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't even nominated for this. This was a great movie. Scorcese's second best. 10/10.
10.0~The Best Scorsese Film I Have Ever Seen!!!!!!!!!!!! FilmGirl222 Sign in Permalink Minor, if any, spoilers. I first saw The Departed the first weekend that it opened because well...I'm a huge Martin Scorsese, Leo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon fan. So this was definitely the movie for me to see this year. I have to tell you all, I loved it! I loved it so much that I have seen it three times already. I mean, it is just such an incredible film. I would even have to say that it not only is my favorite film of the year so far (which there really haven't been many great ones, so that is not hard for me to say), but it would have to be my favorite Martin Scorsese film also. If you have seen and appreciate a lot of Scorsese's films, then you know that what I have just said is a huge thing. The Departed is such a great piece of work. It makes you think and is very well shot. The story itself is unbelievable. Just as a quick review to those of you who might not remember what it's about, The Departed follows two men, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). Sullivan is a cop with a clean background who has made his way through his career with the help of his "boss" Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), a terrifyingly huge mob boss who does what ever he wants, like killing whoever and putting Sullivan through police school so he has one of his men in the police force. Costigan on the other hand has a history with being on the wrong side of the law, both personally and with family, yet he tries to become a full on cop and is only able to become an undercover cop for Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Costigan is assigned to go undercover and become one of Costello's men, which he is successful in doing. So the movie goes on with Sullivan becoming a Detective who still works for Costello and Costigan an undercover cop who is able to become one of Costello's right hand men. The Departed is incredibly smart and very well put together. With some of Scorsese's recent films, such as Gangs of New York and The Aviator, which I both really liked, yet with both of those films I felt there was something missing, like it could have been tightened a bit more or something. The Departed was perfect. There were no points where there were lulls or where things should have been tightened. It was literally perfect. The way it was shot, the way it was put together, the story, the actingeverything was perfect. Now the acting, oh my god, was incredible! Everyone and I mean EVERYONE was fantastic. It seemed like everyone wanted to be on their top game for this one. One performance that I thought was really entertaining and good was Mark Wahlberg. I'm not that big of a Wahlberg fan, yet I was delightfully surprised with him in this film. He was cocky and a real smart ass. I loved him, and if you see the end of the film, you'll know why. I thought Matt Damon did a wonderful job. It was so nice to see him playing the bad guy for a change. I mean, it's not like he never has (School Ties, The Talented Mr. Ripley, etc.), but I'm so used to seeing him play the good looking good guy that it was nice to see him be the hateful bad guy. Jack Nicholson was good. He was completely crazy in the part of the mob boss Costello. Yet personally, I didn't see anything magical about his performance. It seemed to me like Jack was playing Jack, if you get my meaning. I have no doubt that Jack will be nominated for his part in this movie, but his performance in this movie wasn't the one that blew me away. Now, here is the point that I have come to that was/is my favorite part of the movie The Departed, and that was Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. I can not possibly explain how wonderful he was in this movie. It's the kind of thing you need to see with your own two eyes. There were so many layers to his character and he pulled them off beautifully. There were moments of total sorrow and anxiety that his character goes through that Leo did incredibly. Leo is so wonderful to watch and so sexy (a fact that I didn't mind at all). There are many sad moments that Leo has in this film, but there is one moment at the end where I lost it. When you all see this film, you will know the point that I am talking about. The part is very surprising and shocking, and it made me heart broken. It touched me in such a level that after the film ended, I went out to my car and cried like I have never cried before. Leo moved me in such a way that I just needed to let all me feelings out. He NEEDS an Oscar for this part! Leo was that good. This is his year for an Oscar. I could literally go on and on about this movie for hours. It was so good. I'm telling you, it will take a VERY good film to beat The Departed come Oscar time. It is finally the time for Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio to get an Oscar for their great work! If any one wants to talk to me about this movie, don't hesitate to contact me. I would love to discuss this movie with others.
7.0~Not as good as people say charliegeeza Sign in Permalink I must say, I went into the cinema with high expectations (always a bad idea) and this film did not live up to them. It was ploddingly slow at times. Scorceze is one of those directors whom people loathe to criticise but I think he is also one of those directors who is beginning to believe his own hype. This movie takes time to overemphasise things which add nothing to the plot, such as the religious attachment of Matt Damon's corrupt character. Too much of the movie is reliant upon the charisma of the core actors, especially Nicholson. It almost feels lazy in it's direction. There are some very good performances. Leonardo Di Caprio is excellent, Jack Nicholson is charismatic. Matt Damon is OK. Other than being glaringly slow, there were not many problems with the movie. Some careful scene culling and it would probably have engaged me a lot more. Do not believe the hype nor all the "this is the best ever" comments from people here. Don't get me wrong, It is good. But it's nothing special. I prefer the Chinese original over this remake - even though I have to read the subtitles! The Departed lacks the flair of Gangs of New York, and lacks the cohesion of the original Internal Affairs.
1.0~Juvenile Movie. bfc-4 Sign in Permalink This movie has three things seriously wrong with it. 1. The dialog is juvenile, evidently intended for kids in the 12 to 16 age group. It seems like every sentence included at least 3 curse words. Apparently the writers were handicapped when it came to vocabulary. 2. The movie does not make use of Jack Nicholson's talents. He is upstaged throughout the movie by inferior actors. 3. The movie has a very poor ending. Most of the characters get shot within the last few minutes, and then the screen says "The End." Nothing was decided.
1.0~Really bad. Really, really bad. $90 milllion of bad. Watch 'Infernal Affairs'. justincward Sign in Permalink 'Awful' doesn't begin to describe this insulting, puerile, stupid waste of everybody's time. Do you hear, William Monahan? You wrote a script that is lamer than the massed teams of the 2012 Paralympics. Not one character in it is believable, engaging or sympathetic, not one word of dialog in it bears any relation to actual human speech patterns, and any semblance of plot is absolutely smothered in unnecessary, bloated, self-indulgent pretentiousness, disguised with profanity as the 'honest' language of the good old Oirish Boston Police Department. Martin Scorsese, you directed a tiresome, overlong, overcomplicated mess. The only actor that comes out of 'The Departed' with any credit is Alec Baldwin because it's so obvious he doesn't take it seriously - he does a prototype of his '30 Rock' psycho-boss. For the rest of the cast, they frown harder and harder as this extremely tedious film lurches to its anticlimactic conclusion, as if that would make a viewer any more interested in it. If Jack Nicholson, the scruffiest and most inept gang boss in cinema history, had been looking for the 'rat' in his gang, he could have chosen a worse candidate than Ray Winstone, whose American accent falls off somewhere west of Shepherds Bush. As it is, he fails to suspect anyone at all. OK, so it was purely a money-making enterprise, and succeeded in that, but please; why could they not have fleeced their customers with a little good humour? Avoid this film like the plague - it's on cheap channel reruns at the moment (Aug 2012), and it is disgracefully badly written, poorly acted, and sloppily directed. On the other hand, if you want to hear Dvorak's 'New World' (you know, the 'Hovis' ad) played on the bagpipes, which I am asked to believe is what the Boston Police play at all their funerals, fast forward to the end. Everybody but Mark Wahlberg gets shot. Monahan and Scorsese should have been.
1.0~Made me so angry thebestoption Sign in Permalink this is yet another remake of a classy stylish Chinese film called Innfernal Affairs - Hollywood has managed to completely ruin this remake and instead of the gangsters being stylish they have become like poor white trash - why would anyone think this is a good film - granted if you haven't seen the original then the concept is good (even if the film is not) - i would ask all those people who voted this as a good film to watch Innfernal Affairs(the original) then watch the departed (the crappy remake) and really think about whether you should give this film anything but an awful review - thanks for taking the time to read this.
3.0~Not really a waste of time, but nothing special Oliver_Rizmanoski Sign in Permalink For a start, I have to say that I had already watched the original movie "Infernal Affairs" before I saw this one. As the story is pretty much the same, the characters almost identical and even the takes are sometimes shot from the same angle, I am forced to compare both movies, which might not be quite fair. It is not fair because I was not looking just for a good story, but for a better one. Of course this is much more difficult to accomplish since the original was pretty good. It would be overstated to say that I was disappointed. Not really, that would be to harsh. I definitely even enjoyed watching the movie. But...and it's a big, big "but". But, I wouldn't miss something if I haven't watched the movie. Still, there are some positive things. Marc Wahlberg performed pretty well. In my opinion he outshone Di Caprio and Matt Damon. Jack Nicholson did his best to play a role which was at times implausible. There were a few changes compared to the original. One of them, namely that the good and the bad guy were sleeping with the same woman was unnecessary and over the top. It was like a void twist that didn't add anything to the movie. I even think that Scorsese got the Oscar because of his previous works. This one can't match his best.
10.0~It doesn't get any better than this Nightman11 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese has been a renowned film maker for quite some time but he has just now reached his peak. I was in sheer amazement after seeing his newest The Departed, remake of the Japanese version Infernal Affairs. Scorsese mixes his classic style of films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver with a new age swing that makes for the ideal film. The film is about an undercover cop(Dicaprio), a high ranking police official(Damon), and an underground city crime runner(Nicholson). Also starring is Mark Whalberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. The movie is action packed from start to finish as a plot continually unfolds about a mole within the police station during the pursuit of Nicholsons arrest. All of these premier actors live up to their name as DiCaprio and Nicholson lead the way. Don't be surprised if Leo's name comes up during Oscar season. He really put on a performance not to be forgot. Nicholson also succeeded admirably. He creates a sense of intimidation up to DeNiro status. This film is by far the best picture I've seen this year and I don't see it being topped. I simply cannot think of a more entertaining, riveting, and well acted film I've seen in many years. I can't recommend it any higher. 10/10. Bravo Scorsese!
10.0~Shows Guy Ritchie to be the amateur that he is - 93% Benjamin_Cox Sign in Permalink Wow. Not since Michael's Mann "Heat" has a movie surprised me with its brutal, visceral and completely enthralling vision of the eternal battle between good and evil and how it affects all of us, whether we want it to or not. I confess, this was my first Martin Scorsese film but I completely understand why this was the one that famously got him that long-awaited Best Director gong from Oscar. Suffice to say, this ain't gonna be my last Scorsese film either... Things are going pretty good for Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). His gang of Irish hoodlums pretty much own the streets, his empire is secure and neither the police or the FBI can seemingly touch him. The reason for this is he has a mole working within the Boston police department, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). So senior detectives Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) decide to plant a mole inside Costello's gang, local officer Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). But when both sides discover that they are being infiltrated, the race is on to not only bring Costello down but also just to survive. Normally, there are some things I can criticise about a movie. Even "Pulp Fiction" (my personal favourite) has its flaws but the only one I can think of is the development of Vera Farmiga's character Madolyn, which felt a touch too contrite to be believable. Everything else is fantastic. The performances from the jaw-dropping cast, surely one that only Scorsese could assemble, are faultless. Nicholson looks to be having a ball as the vile Costello and quite frankly, it's great to see him back. The script never lets you go from the first scene through to the explosive finale and this sprawling, epic tale is told over an unexpectedly brilliantly soundtrack - just needed a few more Rolling Stones tracks for my tastes! And because this is Scorsese and you know through reputation that this is his yard, the whole thing feels horrifyingly authentic - not just the violence (which is brutal enough to satisfy any action film fan) but the feel of the thing. If it wasn't so entertaining and didn't have big name stars all over the place, you'd think you were watching a documentary and not a remake of Hong Kong classic "Infernal Affairs". This is probably the best gangster film to emerge since Scorsese's heyday in the Eighties and early Nineties and yet, nobody seems to be raving about "The Departed" in the same way they were about "Goodfellas". I can only assume that this is for two reasons. The first is that they haven't bothered to see this because he hasn't made a good movie since "Goodfellas" (apparently) and reasoned that this wouldn't be any good either. Fuggitabutit, this is the real deal - a welcome homecoming for a director who stuck to what he knew and came up trumps. The other reason why this film isn't getting the praise it should is due to age but given time, this will become a classic if it isn't one already. It is a movie of real, grade-A class and any doubts or questions you may have about it will be dispelled pretty quickly. Be a wise guy and go and see it.
10.0~Not a bad performance in the bunch. ghlist7876 Sign in Permalink Can we give Scorsese the Oscar NOW PLEASE? The best scene has to be the one where Nicholson grills DiCaprio in the bar after starting off with "I smell a rat". It's the greatest butt puckering movie moment since Pesci's "funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?" Oh yeah, that was Scorcese's, too. After disliking Matt Damon's performances in every movie since "Good Will Hunting", I have to say that he did a great job here, particularly on the long pauses before dialogue. It was those shots where you can watch people calculating things in their minds that makes this movie truly powerful. Mark Wahlberg stole the show every time the camera was one him. Even the old war horses Sheen and Baldwin were believable as too tough cops. Kristen Dalton was perfect as the gangster gal, how come we haven't seen more of this beauty in other 'A' films? I have to get the DVD.
10.0~Johnny Sal Approved! Amazing Film salvaggio_john Sign in Permalink The Departed is an Amazing Film. I found the film contained good dialog, shot composition, and lighting as well as fantastic editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Not as long as Gangs of New York (2002) but it still contains the action and clever plot twists and general excitement found in most Scorsese pictures. The Departed is authentic, captivating and heart felt. I predict Globe and Oscar nominations for Mark, Matt, and Lenonardo. Martin Scorsese's brilliant mind as a director shows up in this work of art and he better get the Best Director Oscar. He has worked for too long and too hard his entire career and has yet to receive one. Possibly best supporting actor for Alec Baldwin, or Martin Sheen. I rate this film 10 out of 10, a superb masterpiece of "Crime Art" as i call it. Better than Casino (1995). The film kept the entire audience intrigued and amazed at the hard depiction of corrupt Boston police, and an eye opener to modern Irish gangs. A grand remake of a Hong Kong film called "Wu Jian Dao". The Departed is fantastic.
3.0~It's New England, it's the Mafia, of course it's Scorsese how 'bout them apples, right Matt. jeff-chilcott Sign in Permalink To say that Scorsese, Nicholson, Damon, or any of the other Hollywood elites, in 'The Departed,' have outdone themselves would be a vast overstatement. It was simply too bad and too long to sit through for 7 American dollars. Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I was able to make it to the end of a Scorsese flick without snoring myself awake during its end credits. Nicholson's accent is shaky at best and his role as mob boss about as convincing as the film's denouement when every character that you should care about takes one to the face. It's as if Monahan got tired and handed the script of to his 12 year old to finish. Neither a masterpiece or anywhere near Scorsese's best. Perhaps, throwing in the towel is not an option when you command so much respect. But, it's never too late.
10.0~A Must See For Everyone. leftbehind4123 Sign in Permalink I have seen many movies in my time, though only 23, my parents use to own a video store when i was younger and i must say that this is hands down the best written movie in over a decade. The acting is phenomenal and you never know whats going to happen next. If you want action, drama, adventure this movie has it all. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I must say that the casting for this movie was incredible with a lot of high profile actors doing this film justice. The brilliant part about this movie like many other great movies is that you don't get hit with with the quality until your walking out of the theater realizing that you have witnessed the best movies of all time. It will be by far the best movie of they year and could be remembered as the movie of the decade.
3.0~Typical Scorsese - Over-rated!!! thegreenman5 Sign in Permalink Not a bad film from a character study point of view, but pretty dumb from a story point of view. Jack plays Jack, Leo still comes across as a teenager continually auditioning for a part as a "serious" adult actor, the rest of 'em were adequate in an enter-twining who's good, who's evil sort of way. But the ending! The stupidest ending in a film in a long time!!! All the main characters have their brains blown out? What the hell were Monahan & Martin trying to say? Stupid. Very stupid. We invest all our time in this story and it ends in an inane bloodbath, without any sense of what the hell the message or point was supposed to be. If there even was one. Guys like Scorsese and the people who do the Sopranos etc. spend so much time glorifying these violent, insane, psycho mofo killers I guess they gotta kill 'em all off at the end to assuage their guilty consciences. Over-rated. Rent some John Woo Hong Kong gangster movies: you'll get the requisite blood and guts, but at least the endings will make sense and be satisfying, unlike The Departed. D .
7.0~Well acted and directed but NOT Scorsese's best tonyjackie Sign in Permalink When this movie started I thought that it was going to be great.The way the lives of the two rookie cops were intertwined was very well done initially and I was definitely hooked.Gradually though,as the film wore on,I realised that I was clock watching a little and had lost a bit of interest.Why?Tough to explain but I'll try. The acting is pretty much first rate with Matt Damon(Colin Sullivan)particularly impressive.I thought that Vera Famiga(Madolyn)gave a very nice performance also.Every one else was fine,there were no duff performances.I started to have a problem with the movie when Madolyn two timed her boyfriend with Billy.This seemed very contrived and it didn't convince me at all.I also felt the movie was a little too long and the music was a bit overpowering at times.It is a good film,but certainly not a great one.No one can begrudge Martin Scorsese his Oscar,he certainly deserved to win one at some stage.But I would most definitely put 'Goodfellas','The Aviator','Taxi Driver' and the one he should certainly have won for 'Raging Bull'above this.It is a clichéd sort of a film and I thought that it got a bit crazy at the end when almost everybody was getting shot in the head! When I came to mark this movie I couldn't decide to give it a 7 or an 8.I then wondered if I would want to watch it again and I can't honestly say that I would.So,by no means a bad movie but definitely not Mr. Scorsese at the very peak of his powers.
9.0~The Departed one_way1983 Sign in Permalink Great film! The film is very funny and you can hear the laughter in the theater with the numerous raunchy jokes made by Nicholson, Baldwin, Walberg and even Dicaprio. This was an all star cast and the film was beautifully acted. Martin Scorse shows why he is a great director because he kept me surprised throughout the film. What you expect to happen does not happen. This is a film that kept me entertained throughout and I don't regret going. the best gangster movie I've seen in years. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves some type of nominations for best actor for this film because the emotions he brought to this role was better than great. Seeing the transformation in his character due to the circumstances that he is forced to partake in makes him a hell of an actor that is deserving of a golden globe or Oscar nomination.
8.0~Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best zetes Sign in Permalink Scorsese's long-awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs was a good film, but it always seemed to me like a gimmick, and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film. Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn't seem as much like just a good concept. The actors add a lot to it, too (though the Hong Kong actors, including Andy Lau and Tony Leung, were very good, as well). I don't think it stands anywhere near Scorsese's best work myself. It doesn't carry near the weight of Goodfellas, for instance. It starts to get a little silly near the end, and the director makes a few really bad choices  especially including that awful image in the final shot. That's just plain embarrassing film-making. And that's not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs - the original is definitely stronger in that respect. Of the actors, my favorite was Mark Wahlberg. Matt Damon comes in second, and DiCaprio third. Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster. The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton's first Batman movie. Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment, where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act. Well worth seeing, but definitely not best-of-the-year material. I would rank it quite below Scorsese's previous two films from this decade, The Aviator and Gangs of New York.
1.0~Too slow and boring odie_ven Sign in Permalink Seriously, what's the big fuss about this movie? Too long, too pointless, too slow. After an hour and a half I just couldn't keep watching it. I like suspense movies. This isn't one. Is it supposed to be about the characters? The info about them was so eschew that I didn't know them very well after 90 minutes. What was supposed to be great about it? I absolutely despised that this won best movie in 2007. Seriously. Far better ones in the category. It's outrageous that this is ranked better than movies like Aliens, 2001 Space Oddysey and Forest Gump. Skip it, or just rent it and see for yourself.
9.0~tough guys shouting profanities with an intriguing plot hderksen Sign in Permalink Do you want to see a movie with cops and bad guys (and there is certainly some overlap between the two)? Then watch this movie. The best part of this movie is the intriguing story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In summary, the cops have planted "a rat" (DiCaprio) in the criminal organization led by Nicholson. But Nicholson has his own "rat" inside the police force (Damon). To make things more interesting there are also "rats" for the FBI, and both Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same woman. This then all plays out like a bloody game of chess where at the end both "kings" die. This is a star-studded movie where most of the actors do very well, especially DiCaprio and Damon. I found Sheen's Boston accent convincing and Nicholson of course does his thing. Some times I got the impression that there was a bit of competition going on between the actors. Like, who can play the toughest guy. The weakest point of the movie was the psychologist who is torn between DiCaprio and Damon. The speed at which she falls for the convict (as far as she knows) DiCaprio seems unprofessional and unrealistic. There is never a real confrontation between DiCaprio and Damon over her as one might expect, but the documents that DiCaprio gives to her (not to be opened until something happens to him) end up being Damon's downfall.
7.0~Just another gangster movie fridayinlove Sign in Permalink Dicaprio did a good job in acting; Nicholson, despite all the good reviews, remained his natural psych tradition by duplicate it in every scene by every possible means, and therefore nothing new was seen. I guess that's the deal he got more parts and got to "improvise", in exchange for him being in the cast. Anyway, not impressive at all. Since this is a remake of the HK movie Infernal Affairs (according to the New Yorker Oct 27), I watched the original work just to get an idea. A brief comparison: all the tastes meant to touch and move the audience in the HK movie were removed and replaced with the authentic American money/slur/old days/gang elements. Therefore The Departed is a decent piece in its own way, although the whole plot and even some scenes are directly copied. To summarize it, my personal rating for The Departed is 7/10.
1.0~'The Departed' - LOL...is this movie for real?? mj2003 Sign in Permalink Last night i went to watch 'The Departed'. I left this movie feeling utterly sick to my stomach due largely to the poor quality of the movie. Friends commented on the bad mood in which i was in walking back to my car....my only comment was that i apologise, however the movie 'The Departed' was so poor in quality....so poor it truly is ridiculous...it simply put me in a bad mood. This was a world first...i have seen other bad movies in my life...however this one actually made me feel emotions of anger / disappointment / disillusionment all at once. I fully understand that readers would be asking 'why..o why' have u condemned such a, and a quote 'Film of the Year' (LOL). Well, readers here are the following reasons exactly why 'The Departed' is possibly the worlds worst movie.. 1. OVERALL STORYLINE... 15 minutes into the movie it was clear what was going to happen... Matt Damon was a snitch....Leo DiCaprio was a snitch....the ONLY thing we the viewer now needed to see was exactly how all involved parties (Nicholson, FBI, Cops, other miss. randoms) were going to find out and consequently act about it..You may wish to argue against me...however look into your hearts...you know what i say is true...and hence you must realize the stupidity of such a movie... 2. ELEVATOR SCENE LOL - Quite possibly the worst scene of any movie, of any form, of any generation. NOT and over dramatization. OK, i do understand that it was necessary in the overall storyline for those people to die...but really...4 people getting shot in the head.....LOL..people were laughing in the cinema...in this what Scorcese wanted?? The only thing achieved by that God forsaken scene was a 'novelty' effect created by 4 exactly similar gun shot...blood splatter..etc...at the conclusion of the scene i began to day dream that possibly it might be better if i was number 5...ready and willing to get shot in the head, ultimately putting myself out of the misery which was 'The Departed'. 3. Mark Walhberg His stint in this movie is laughable..i really am laughing at this very moment...He plays a tough talking cop....lol...arguably promoting as a main character in the film...HOWEVER has NO (0) relevance in the film whatsoever...EXCEPT for KILLING damon at the very end??? 4. Look, readers of this website...their really are to many things i hate about this movie to continue...Di Caprio / storyline / people in the cinema laughing about ridiculous Nicholson antics (such as patting a dog??? (is that funny or are people just stupid??)??. Anyway, i appreciated your time...hopefully you all understand my reasons and if you don't i truly do feel sorry for you...moreover i already feel sorry for us all for going to watch this move. Marko J OUT
10.0~Brilliant crex0408 Sign in Permalink This was easily the best movie I have seen this year, maybe even this decade. This is the "Goodfellas" or "Pulp Fiction" of this decade. The story is put together by Scorsese so well that when it hits you it never lets up. The performances are top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio steals the movie from power man Jack. His character is so perplexed and caught up in this mess, you begin to feel his pity. Damon is excellent as someone who truly only looks out for himself and has no heart. The surrounding cast is also excellent surrounded by the power. Kudos to Mark Walberg and Vera Farminga. The Departed is so well paced that when the climax his it leaves you stunned.Unfourtanly when the climax begins it obvious the fate of all. Scorese gets this genre better than anyone. This is a movie about crime, but so much more. See it ASAP!
9.0~Scorsese's Best kenjha Sign in Permalink This absorbing crime drama set in Boston focuses on the dynamics of a situation where a mob informant joins the police force and an undercover cop infiltrates the mob. Perhaps the best film of Scorsese's distinguished career, it ratchets up the tension from the beginning and doesn't let up for a moment despite its long running time. Although violent, Scorsese does not dwell on the violence as he does in some of his earlier films. The all-star cast is in top form. DiCaprio is gritty as the earnest undercover cop, Damon is appropriately slimy as the informant, and Nicholson is in his element as the mob boss. Sheen, Wahlberg, and Baldwin provide good support.
4.0~Drawn out mob movie with a few twists sdguero Sign in Permalink The Departed is loaded with talented actors and I went into it with high expectations. That said, during the last 30 minutes of the movie I just wanted it to end. It has strong acting, but that's a given considering all the on screen talent. It is too long, the pacing is too slow, and just felt like it was missing something. A lot about the movie felt contrived to me and I left the theater feeling deflated. The love story was predictable, a little weird, and definitely inappropriate considering the characters positions. The film didn't really have a climax, instead there were a series of climactic moments that kept sort of just puttering out and letting me down. The cinematography was boring as well, most of the shots seemed pretty simple and uninteresting. Similarly, the score felt contrived and pedantic. Like some bean counters calculated the songs most likely to impress a 2006 American audience and threw all of them into this film. Overall, I just can't recommend this film to people and I think it is possibly the most overrated film of the decade.
7.0~watch original ;) chtong Sign in Permalink It's a good remake of a better film to my eyes Scorsese shot the same movies with exact scenes, adding lot of others which don't serve his movies... Infernal affairs from Wai-keung Lau & Alan Mak is better & shorter to me. Lots of scenes and details looks to me really strange, now i've seen the original movie and i just understand that Scorsese just shot a copy, this way, these strange details and strange scenes have a sense to me now... cause they are part of the original and still don't have no sense in Scorsese version. This movie looks good but now i have seen the brilliant original it has no taste anymore http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/
9.0~DiCaprio Performance was GREAT donna0309 Sign in Permalink Wow Wow Wow. I just saw this movie and was blown away. I was on the edge of my seat for the 2 ½ long movie just waiting to see what would happen next. You can not tell the good guys from the bad or what will happen next. But what you can tell is everyone brought their A game to this movie. Everyone's performance were wonderful, from Alec Baldwin and Mark Walhbergs great line delivery, that let you laugh out loud when thing on the screen where getting to intense. To Martin Sheen and Jack Nicholson both letting you know who's in control. The of course Matt Damon who continues to surprise me about how good of an actor he is. But the person that really stands out for me was Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan. You feel his pain in every scene, you feel how alone he is, how frighten, and how freaked out his world is. You can almost feel his rapid heart beat. If you are not a Leo fan you will be after this. I highly recommend this movie for the great acting you get to see.
9.0~Loved It! travelstovegas Sign in Permalink This movie was great! If you liked The Usual Suspects, you'll like this. It kept you guessing, awesome acting, and a fantastic cast. Even the 'accents' were well done. Yes, it does have a lot of violence, and some of it surprised me, but that's to be expected with a 'cop' movie. The plot here was great, and I'll have to check out the original since I liked this version so much. The ending was a jaw-dropper! Really great job, and although the whole cast was brilliant, Mark Wahlberg & Leonardo DiCaprio stood out to me. They really made their characters real and their reactions were right on. Fantastic! Not to mention, ladies - the mostly all male cast is certainly nice to look at while you enjoy the movie! Ha ha ha!
10.0~Scorcese scores with 'The Departed' adit-gupt Sign in Permalink Okay ... if this one doesn't win at the Oscars 2007,screw the AMPAS ! The movie is a real tour dé force; without a shadow of doubt Scorsese's best after 'The Last Temptation of Christ'.Perfect in every which way ,be it the ensemble cast of Hollywood's best (Nicholson,Damon) or the sheer pace of the movie (believe me this movie is actually edge of the seat stuff ,no exaggerations whatsoever) or the plot (though its a remake of the Hong Kong cult flick 'Internal Affairs' ) or the timing (including the intermission!) or the deliciously sexy Vera Farmiga (including her steamy interlude with Leo) ,the movie is prodigiously handled by 'Marty' Scorsese (arguably one of the best Directors after Kubrick).And the biggest surprise was Leo... yep this actor has come of age with this role.You can see shades of potential fulfilled after he wowed audiences with his '93 performance in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape' as an autistic savant kid.It's probably the effect of Scorsese having continued faith in this actor after he cast him in 'Gangs of New York' and 'Aviator'. And the soundtrack is gripping to say the least complementing the action on screen brilliantly (most Pink Floyd aficionados shall agree) .Surely ,Martin Scorsese is the best Director to not have won the Oscar..let's see if that changes next year! Enough said! Watch this flick ... your satisfaction is guaranteed!
10.0~Killer Looks, Naked Ambition stevegannell Sign in Permalink Big Marty Scorsese is back baby and he's better than ever. After seeing this gem, there wasn't enough voltage in the world to electroshock me back into coherence. The story is riveting mainly thanks to the ingenuity of the premise of having two characters deep undercover and trying to track each other down. You know the edge of your seat? If not, you will by the end of this pulsating thriller. The ensemble cast is A-MA-ZING! Nicholson can start writing his Oscar acceptance speech now because he's in career best form as local mafia kingpin Frank Costello. Equally impressive are twin hotstuffs Leo Di Caprio and Marky Wahlberg who simply smolder in any scene they share. What more is there to say? Bring on the sequel, The Arrived!!! (cue the cringe)
10.0~By Far the best of the new millennium wwefreakjon Sign in Permalink I love this movie, and think it's not only one of the best gangster film's of all time but probably the best movie since LOTR 1. For me movie's have been getting boring in the past few years. Very plain plot line's and bad acting. But every once in a while a movie comes out and just blows me away. in 2000 i was blown away by Gladiator and Erin Brokovich, in 01 there was a beautiful mind and LOTR in 03 Lost in translation. But the past four years have been fairly good and then the failures started up; Date Movie, Epic Movie, Basic Instinct 2, The Wickerman, and many others. by that time I'd given up spending my money on going to see movies at the theater so when this came out on DVD I was blown away and my faith in movies was restored. The acting is spectacular,and to paraphrase SOMS The Departed is like the Godfather, intensified. I'm definitely not saying its better than the Godfather but it's still great. Jack Nicholson does fabulously has Costello the crime boss. There's no way anyone could tell that he was an informer and he does a great job being the puppeteer of the whole operation. Matt Damon and Leo Dicaprio were great has the rats and you could feel how hard it was for Leo to deal with the pressure. My Personal favorite character and many people agree with me on this was Staff Sargent Dignam played by Mark Walberg. He is amazing and is great in the interview's at the beginning and right at the very end when he kills Colin. He deserved his Oscar Nod for it although he didn't deserve the win(Alan Arkin was just to damn good). Overall My favorite movie of the decade are: 5,Erin Brokovich 4,Ray, 3, Little Miss Sunshine, 2, No Country for Old Men and 1, The Departed.
10.0~Martin Scorsese meets Guy Ritchie and Boondock Saints ... spectacular! zsept Sign in Permalink Wow ... first off ... wow. I just got home from seeing this film not an hour ago and still I'm struggling to describe this movie with words more descriptive than ... wow. I'd first like to point out that I'm not a Scorsese fanatic who will instantly love anything he puts on the screen (as I am with some directors) I've seen only two of his films the Aviator which I liked and Gangs of New York which I did not. I'm also not a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio however I don't mind him when hes working under a good director. My first thoughts after seeing this film were "its the great film-making of Martin Scorsese with a complicated twist laden plot line of Guy Ritchie (Snatch and Lock stock and two Smoking Barrels) set in the backdrop of Boondock Saints and Goodwill Hunting (Boston)". This movie although very unapologetically violent is, funny (something I was not at all expecting) the dialog as well as the situations are so funny that many times in the theatre I was hysteric with laughter, very loudly and in the theatre I might add and I was not the only one its not very often that an audience in a theatre is so captured by a film that you can hear its collective uninhibited reactions to every funny line or plot twist but that was the case with this film. The story itself is brilliant very very interesting. The Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mob both have moles deep in the other organization and let the mole hunts begin! The two sides are a negative and positive for one another and the mirroring and reflection that goes on between them is phenomenal. The acting was superb everyone was excellent the great cast of this film performed to its full potential. My favorites Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Martin Sheen were all at their best Matt Damon in particular was outstanding. Even Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin who I'm usually relatively indifferent to gave wonderful performances and yes even Leonardo DiCaprio was extremely good. The music (something I notice very much in films) was exceptional there was music playing nearly the entire film and created the perfect atmosphere for every moment of the film. The piece that was most notable for me was "I'm shipping up to Boston" by the Dropkick Murphies. Ever since I've listened to them I've thought I would love to see them used in a film and with the exception of Boondock Saints this is the perfect film for them. A warning to some as I mentioned before this film is unapologetically very violent and certainly requires one to have a stomach for that sort of thing. All in all this is an extraordinary film I haven't been this excited about a film since I saw Munich several weeks ago. Enjoy!
3.0~don't believe the hype omniscience1984 Sign in Permalink just saw this movie. absolutely pointless. everyone can fluff Scorsese, Nicholson, etc, but this movie is not that good. everyone may think its good because all movies now are garbage. however, a better smelling bag of garbage beside a worse smelling bag of garbage is still a bag of garbage. DiCaprio does a good job and Damon is surprisingly good, but the story is just so blah and predictable that it is easy to fall asleep while watching the movie. in my opinion,the movie does not focus enough on one character to facilitate viewer involvement. also,the music is not prominent enough and some of it is recycled from other Scorcese films which makes a veteran movie goer such as myself think Scorcese should ride off into the sunset.
1.0~worst movie faroud Sign in Permalink This is the most hideous movie I have ever sat through. I almost left but because it had such a high rating on this page I stayed thinking that the blood and unnecessary gore would settle down and a good story would emerge. No such luck. Movies such as the Godfather 1 and 2,Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels while having considerable violence managed to produce an enthralling story and in the case of Lock Stock a humorous plot as well. This movie's only focus seemed to be how else can we include another gruesome death or act of violence. The actors all played their parts well but I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this and advise others to not do the same.
1.0~In-Credible! verysimplebox Sign in Permalink The fact that IMDb gave this movie as high rating as Academy did sure does shake IMDb'S OWN CREDIBILITY. Some negative reviews i read above indicate to an awfully bad directing, to which after watching the DVD i fully agree. Mr Scorsese must be ashamed for accepting this Oscar. He was robbed for his Oscar with "Taxi Driver", now he lets Academy do the same s**t in turn to some other deserving director. How shallow! Puts shadow on his earlier works. It is my impression that ever since 9/11 Oscars were mostly fake, political, interest/profit driven. Is this an indication of THE downfall? The younger actors did well, too bad they will be remembered in association with THIS. Because when the balloon over "marty's great masterpiece" pops, the critics - Eberts' etc. will go down on this movie like flesh hungry condors. However, i don't think watching it was a waste of time. It made me once again appreciate the great "Gimme Shelter" by Rolling stones. The next movie on my watching list IS titled "Gimme Shelter" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065780/)
10.0~My faith in Oscar-nominated-anything will die if DiCaprio is not nominated... normlgirl-1 Sign in Permalink Wow. Let me say that I've seen this movie 3 times in the theater already, and that is something I've never done before. The acting in this movie blows me away! Even Jack Nicholson is great (playing Jack)... and I never had any respect for Leonardo DiCaprio until I saw this movie (probably because I hated Titanic). If this isn't nominated for best picture, best actor, director, etc, I will never put any stock into what is an Oscar-winning *anything* again. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat... you kinda know what's going to happen, but not how, or when; and the ending was excellent as well! ********* S P O I L E R below ********* >> I'm kinda thinking the baby was Billy Costigan's and not Collin Sullivan's. I like a few loose ends; things to chew on and think about after you're done watching a movie only makes the experience that much more enjoyable! <<
10.0~The master of crime movies is back!! cammybawz Sign in Permalink When I heard that Martin Scorsese was making a new movie I didn't know what to think. He had made some superb movies such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Casino but recently he had made the Aviator which i thought was OK but nothing special. Also the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio was starring in it made me think that it wouldn't be all that great either as i had only seen 2 movies in which i thought he was good (Gangs of New York and the Beach). But then i heard the rest of the cast (Jack Nicholson..come on!!) and the plot (an urban crime saga) and i thought that Martin may very well make another classic. When the trailer came out i was blown away and couldn't wait to see. When i finally did get that chance i thought it was cinematic genius. a not too complicated storyline, great acting, well known actors and edge of your seat suspense. I'm not sure if this is as good as Goodfellas but Jesus Christ its as close as we'll ever get to ANY film topping Goodfellas....The master of crime movies is back!!
5.0~Good movie but a Rip-off azmodan_gr Sign in Permalink Good movie but a rip-off by all means! I can't say that wasn't a good movie, I would be lying!!! Never the less though, it was a rip-off of the best police movie that was ever conceived and filmed, "Infernal Affairs"!!!! I mean the original had much lower budget and still it was visually stunning while "The Departed" felt like a movie that was made in a hurry... The plot where in the original "Infernal Affairs" was just the most gripping film ever, here felt somehow shallow, if you had seen the original before. Honestly even the huge stars, which are really good actors with talent and real acting abilities, that played in "The Departed" weren't as half as good as the Chinese counterparts in the specific rolls. What really gets me mad though, is that Scorsese and his crew will take the credits and the recognition that don't belong to them!!! All the Oscars should go to the original by far!!! If you think that I got it wrong I really urge you to watch the original and you will understand the difference simply by the impact that the characters will have on you and by the fact that visually is so much more detailed and in a much higher level. My opinion... Give the credits to those who deserve it!!!!!!!!!!! 2002's Wai Keung Lau's "Infernal Affairs"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0~Mediocre at best. Don't get your hopes up... G_Squared Sign in Permalink OK....I'm preparing for my death on these message boards but here goes... Am I really the only one that thought this film was incredibly overrated and definitely not one of Scorsese's best? I'm sorry, but I've seen it 3 times, each time praying I will somehow see the "amazing Oscar-winning-film" that everyone rants and raves about but no: I see a somewhat waste of an amazing cast, a crappy script, and Scorsese after having a little too much sex with Hollywood. NOW before you murder me, please read some of my reasons below: The Script: was ridiculous at times. Some of the dialogue was almost unbearably fake to me, and at times laughable (especially with DiCaprio). Cinematography: was amazing at points, but by the 100th "zoom-in-really-quick-on-a- character-when-they're-talking" I was bored of it. DiCaprio: was unoriginal....point blank. It doesn't take much to be an aggravated, obnoxious, and mean little goatee-ed man who is hooting and hollering all of the time, a role that seems to be DiCaprio's favorite type. As much as I respect Leo shedding his pretty boy skin and doing ACTUAL roles, I'm getting pretty sick of the same character he plays in every film. The Story: was incredibly unbalanced. There were a few choice scenes that would fall in the "Brilliant" category for me, but a good 60% of the film was nothing more than mediocre. The Ending/last shot: was stupid. How much skill and creativity does it take to kill everyone in your cast? NONE. It was an easy cop-out. And let me be the one to say that the last shot was comedic. "GABEGOMEZ4, YOU DON'T GET THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RAT AND THAT SHOT!!! YOU'RE SUCH AN AMATEUR WHO IS BLIND TO EVERYTHING GENIUS ABOUT THE ENDING!!!!" is what I'm sure all of you are thinking/typing as we speak but please...it doesn't take a *beep* rocket-scientist to get the symbolism of a god damned rat. Scorsese's talent: was missing in this film. His true talent and love for the film was simply un-evident in The Departed. I miss the Meanstreets' Scorsese, and the Goodfellas' Marty. Personally I feel that it was slightly disrespectful to Scorsese to give him the statue for this film. The academy was basically saying "Hey, sorry about the past and overlooking your works-of-genius, but since you made a bloody Irish-mob film with some of the most talented actors in the business never mind how mediocre it was, we'll give this one to you!" Please....Scorsese, please go back to your roots. Look don't get me wrong, I don't think this film is terrible. It has fantastic parts, and you can't really go wrong with Matt Damon. In reality, I'd give it a solid 7. But given the circumstances, I feel the need to call it out on it's faults. Thanks for reading and remember, it's just an opinion.
1.0~Dreadful footzie Sign in Permalink Here we go again. Another chapter in Scorsese's love affair with slimeballs. Whether it be Italian or Irish he has an unreasonable fascination for the genre. The central baddie is played by Jack Nicholson who does nothing but play Jack Nicholson. He chews every piece of scenery with a reprise of the malevolence he exhibited in "The Shining". You would think that a director with the skills of Scorsese could control him. But, perhaps he didn't want to do so. In any event, his performance is operatic and intolerable. Damon and De Caprio do well, as do Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg, but not well enough to make sense or meaning of an atrocious script. Scorsese showed us that he can be skilled in material other than sewer trash, with "The Age Of Innocence". Please Martin, give this garbage a rest.
3.0~Homophobic swaudby Sign in Permalink The movie was pretty good, except for the excessive use of fag and faggot. I am sure the Irish in Boston say it all the time, but really Martin do you think it was a little overkill? I guess what was more disturbing was when the audience laughed, not once, but every time. The accents were very inconsistent, more of a distraction than anything else. Jack Nicholson did an amazing job, as always is expected, but the only truly convincing accent came from Martin Sheen. Beware that there is some rather realistic gun violence. The blood spattering is very graphic and sometimes jolting. Mr. Scorsese sorry, but this definitely wasn't one of your better films. Maybe you have already done your best work. Too bad because I used to be a big fan. Hopefully you next film will work up to something memorable.
1.0~Too Violent jcdeclerk Sign in Permalink Don't ever go see The Departed. We went yesterday because there were good reviews and good actors. BIG MISTAKE. It had raunchy, nasty language all the way through it that was unnecessary. Then the violence was so graphic. It showed lots of people being shot in the head up close. I don't like watching violence. I don't understand why people like to watch other people get killed or hurt. Would they want to see it happen in front of them in real life and stand there and say "cool" or would they run and hide and be scared? It gives sick people ideas. I almost had a panic attack in the theater. I was shaking and wanted to run out. Then when we got in the car, I started crying real hard. It really upset me. The world has cried over all the school shootings, but then Hollywood makes a movie that shows that kind of violence up close. Would it make a good movie if those Amish girls were video-taped being shot in the head and it was re-played for everyone to see? Would everyone cry or would they think it was great and want to watch more real people get shot?
9.0~My opinion of the movie jiller89 Sign in Permalink My first impression of this movie from trailers was that it should be good mostly due to the impressive resume of the cast...and after watching it i think this was pretty spot on. A really good movie with in my opinion a superb cast, and i have to say i thought Mark Whalberg really made the film that much better and he really made me laugh (in a good way) Though without spoiling any of the story line i would have to say that anyone who doesn't like violence and some "bloody" bits may not be too keen, though its not overly gory or anything just quite violent, as you would expect from this type of "ganster style film". I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good storyline and good performances from some of the best in Hollywood.
10.0~One of Scorsese's Best Movies davidcahilldesign Sign in Permalink i think this movie is a brilliant rival for good fellas and definnutly deserves to win a best picture Oscar. it wasn't until i watched it a second time that i really saw what a great movie it really was. i thought it was a great for Scorsese to go into irish gangs in America (being irish myself lol), because i think the Italian mob has really been done in his movies and lots of others. The whole cast was absolutely great in this movie. but i think Dicaprio was the best performance and i think he really should have got an Oscar nom for this and jack Nicholson because he is just great in almost everything thing he appears in. don't listen to any of the negative reviews, deffinutly watch this movie
7.0~Entertaining... and not much more Timeee Sign in Permalink First I saw 'The Departed'. It was cool. Then I saw 'Infernal affairs'. It was awesome. Then, after some time, I saw 'The Departed' again. And I realized I've been conned. I wish there was a way to talk about 'The Departed' without constant references to IA, but there isn't. This is not a re-imagining, it is not a remake or a tribute- it's a pure and simple rip-off, most of the time scene by scene, shot by shot. Everything that is good, interesting or storytelling in 'The Departed' originates in IA. All they did was change the setting and the language and dumb down the story here and there with some melodramatic/vulgar effects. Speaking of vulgar; I don't give a s**t about 'ugly words', some of the best movies are full of cursing, and hell, that's how people really talk after all. But... i just couldn't get past of how scenes that are subtle and cool in IA are almost systematically replaced with mindless cursing-orgies here. It's not that they curse it's that they ONLY do that, as if a tirade Wahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. It seems like throwing in a dick-joke, adding some punches, yelling, being all f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. Even in minor scenes; in IA the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the psychologist; here he blows up, yells and runs away. After the cinema scene, when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in IA you have a tense psychological scene; in The Departed Matt Damon MUST stab somebody, apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough without that. Or the classic rooftop end scene- in IA the two opponents act calmly, with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and punching instead of a shared moment of drama. In one word- it's cheap, something you wouldn't expect from Scorsese and this cast.
8.0~A gem from a master of the craft ericscartier Sign in Permalink Scorcese has crafted another excellent gangster film. "The Departed" succeeds on all levels, including its script, its images, its performances and its themes. The intricacies of the complex screenplay are a delight to absorb and unravel. Several suspenseful scenes are masterfully strung together in such a way that the viewer has only a few moments to regain her breath, process the clues and prepare to hold her breath again. No other director has so successfully captured acts of violence in the filmic medium, and the violence Scorcese depicts in "The Departed" is ugly, sudden and brutal. The dialogue is riddled with profanity and tension-relieving jokes (Wahlberg's hip-rocking character's quips and insults alone are worth the price of admission), and the cast delivers its lines in convincingly authentic Boston accents. A number of actors turn in stellar performances, notably Nicholson (as a demonic crime boss), DiCaprio (as an undercover cop) and Baldwin (as a fast-talking, affable detective). Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who collaborated with Fassbinder on his finest films, frames the ratty world of "The Departed" with a sharp eye. One scene, a foot chase through Chinatown, is remarkably beautiful, composed of quick cuts, vivid colors and steam. There is a recurring theme, virile masculinity, which remained with me long after viewing the film, and I will continue to reflect on the ways in which Scorcese (dis)associates it with violence, success and happiness. Though the film runs 149 minutes, it does not run long. This is taut, top-notch film-making, and Martin Scorcese reaffirms his status as one of the few living masters of the craft.
8.0~Great remake of Hong Kong's Internal Affairs giuseppe92 Sign in Permalink I was in love with the original Internal Affairs (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/). I watched this movie without knowing that it was a remake. Though it started coming back to me, as I went on in the film. So it gave me a different taste from the original Chinese one. If you like this one, do not forget to watch the original, it is a very good one too. One thing I disliked about this movie was it seemed to be a bit lengthy and it could have been cut short by eliminating few scenes without spoiling the movie. The strength of this movie lies on the superb acting of Leonardo, although I think Tony Leung in the original was also very good. Matt also played an excellent opposite role in this film, which reminded me of him of Mr. Ripley's (The Talented Mr. Ripley - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134119/). It looked like Mr. Ripley's had made it to Boston eventually.
9.0~Scorcese's best since 'Goodfellas' turloughmcaleenan Sign in Permalink I went to see 'The Departed' last night and was simply blown away by the acting, directorial technique and story. Other things that really sprang to my attention was the noir lighting employed - check out how Nicholson is portrayed in the film's opening scenes or the Chinatown night scenes. The performances were superb. Mark Wahlberg gave one of the best performances I've seen him do as the committed, odious Boston detective. Di Caprio was excellent as the informer caught between his police handlers Wahlberg and Martin Sheen's fatherly cop and Jack Nicolson's flamboyant crime boss. Matt Damon was great too but I thought one of the actors who really shone was Vera Farmiga as his psychiatrist girlfriend. Her acting is so natural and realistic that she should get a Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. Ray Winstone gave a really good performance too as Nicholson's right hand man though unfortunately he struggled many times with the Boston accent as he dipped into a London drawl. He falls into the same league as the likes of Michael Caine and Jude Law, as being an English actor who cannot really pull off an American accent. You wonder where the voice coaches are. This is distracting and to me a little unprofessional - if you are in a movie this big and getting paid that much get the accent right! The storyline of two informers in the Boston mob and police force really brings out the best in all the actors concerned, though I will say that at times somethings are not properly explained. (Possible spoiler!) The plot is really complex to say the least and in a scene where DiCaprio follows Damon's character into Chinatown whilst being communicated with by cell phone we are not clearly told who is actually contacting him. (Possible spoiler!) There is also the distraction of a love triangle between DiCaprio's character, Farmiga's & Matt Damon's which I thought was not really necessary and distracted you from the overall story of cops versus crime lord. Also in true Scorcese style this has one of the bloodiest endings I have ever seen in a film. Lastly Jack Nicholson I thought was excellent though I thought he was just playing 'Jack' all over again. Where is the fear when this character enters a scene? I felt he was reprising a pseudo version of his 'Joker character from Batman. His turn was mostly blackly comedic and his character did not really prove to be a deranged psychopath - more another turn of Nicholson at his charismatic comedic best. This is why I thought he was miscast, although I can't think of many other actors who could have stepped into his shoes - maybe De Niro at a push. But overall this is one of the best films Scorcese has ever made and the best film you will probably see all year.
8.0~GIVE ME ANXIETY!! andrewchristianjr Sign in Permalink This movie will give u anxiety. Very nerve-racking and thrilling ride. The acting was great thanks to the A list actors: diCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg and Nicholson. Wow. I give 8.5 !!
5.0~Confusing as Matt & Leonardo together are too similar peterdorey108 Sign in Permalink It's not only me who thinks this, but with also with this plot it seemed to even accentuated as these two great actors who look too similar; a work colleague said the same. These two need to be separated in films really IMHO - LOL! Just check the web for More Confusing Celebrity Pairs lie these two. So the film was quite good, but a bit too unnecessarily violent for my taste. This could have been implied rather than showing, but suppose that gave a grizzly murderous 'reality' to the story. The plot had enough to keep you interested all the way to the grizzly endings. Jack Nicholson was very good in his role and made you believe he was a gangster. I didn't watch the bonus DVD as felt I's seen enough of the story line.
3.0~Dreay, Dreaful, Deathy, Ratty za-andres Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese is back with his new film, "The Departed, which brings cinematic dysfunction on to the big screen. "The Departed" was one of my most anticipated films of the year. Well, I highly regret that now. This film begins with the a self-reflexive narrative provided by a Wonderful actor, (who essentially saves the film from complete darkness) Jack Nicholson. He explains, "When you Have a gun pointed in your face, it does not matter if your a cop, or a mobster." Later the film incorporates Matt Damon, who plays the usual role with that smirky face of his. He plays an investigator who secretly works for Frank, but at the same time is a mole in the special police unit force, or something like that. On the other side, is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the opposite. He is an undercover cop who works for Frank. Such a wonderful role he plays. Honestly, in previous films, DiCaprio has managed only to distinguish himself as one bad actor. In "The Departed", part of the 4 good points it got was DiCaprio. He has finally found himself a role. Very good DiCaprio! The other points go to Mr. Nicholson. He is flawless. Completely flawless. DiCaprio and him tandem, to make "The Departed". If "The Departed" Were to prove anything, it would be that Nicholson has not lost his touch. And that is magic. So what's so bad about "The Departed"? let's say it is only a failed attempt to bring Goodfellas back tom the big screen. The viewers can probably imagine seeing Mr. Scorsese sitting there, thinking of a way to bring back the Goodfellas "Pop" into our junky Modern Cinema. Mr. Scorcese has failed his old but magical touch in bringing back Gangster classics (this is one is even copied! from Internal Affairs). Oh boy, I can't until next year.
10.0~what!!!! jrmcelmurry Sign in Permalink this movie only got the best director ??? it should have been the picture of the year and best actor. i can not figure out this body of voters...they must have been blind...after watching blood diamond and the departed i have to say that Leonardo DI Cappro must be the new jack Nicholson as far as i am concerned. once again the golden globes have rejected 2 great ,count em, 2 great male performances............how can 2 acting performances that show this young actor coming of age be ignore? maybe because both films were violent and had topics too close to the chewable vitamin morphine of marketing...i am disappointed in the nights vote.and the IMDb rated the departed as the highest of all the nominated pix.
3.0~The Disappointed j-lacerra Sign in Permalink Despite all the hype, the Oscars, and the good reviews on this site, I found the Departed a great disappointment. The story never for one moment captured my interest. There was not one character that I cared what happened to. And, as it seemed that most the actors were doing their jobs quite well, I assumed it was either story or direction that was the problem with the movie, or maybe both. I found that the Departed suffers from Tough Talkitis. That is when all the characters speak to each other with such tough, rude, arrogant attitudes, it becomes unreal (like a cop show on Fox). Why? Because no people anywhere interact with each other that way in real life. It's a synthetic movie-acting manner that actors take on to project toughness into their roles. It is too fake. DiCaprio and Damon do reasonably well in their over-tough parts, DiCaprio especially. Sheen is restrained. Wahlberg is particularly annoying as the police sergeant who never is for one moment human. He is smug and coarse. No doubt the director shaped that characterization. Worse than all is the outrageous hamming of Nicholson, a lifelong favorite of mine. I never believed him for a second in this role as some sort of serious Joker gangster. Alec Baldwin is very good in one of his small roles, which he seems to specialize in these days. The story is humdrum and boring. I began looking at my watch about 15 minutes into this epic. There is no humor, even less character development, annoying side shows (the shrink girlfriend), and no real tension in the tale. After one hour and forty-five minutes of this, I realized that I did not care about what happened to any of these characters, nor did I care how the 'story' turned out. So I shut it off. Three stars for a good try (stretching it!).
9.0~Better than expected apglorieux Sign in Permalink I went into this movie with a lot of people already telling me it was a must-see. Never a good start. I had the expectation that it would be another gangster movie with lots of violence but essentially the same story. I was wrong. This is a break out on the gangster theme and set in Boston, instead of the typical New York scene. I figured the cast would dilute the story, but again I was wrong. The cast made the movie. Kudos to the casting director. Best scene in the movie is the cell phone scene b/n Damon and DiCaprio. Similar to the scene in Heat, where Pacino and DeNiro meet for the first time. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would see it again. A couple of holes near the end, but the studio hacks probably cut it down b/c of the lengthy timing already. Its OK, it justifies buying the director's cut on DVD in a year.
10.0~Hands down the best movie I've seen all year guitarzank5 Sign in Permalink I expected The Departed to be an excellent film, but the final product blew me away. The story, the cast, and the direction were amazing. DiCaprio has improved with each performance he's given, and he is at the top of his game in this one. Damon plays a perfect foil, a smooth and sneaky character that was so easy to hate and yet remained empathetic. Nicholson was memorable as mob boss Costello, a twisted character that was made for him. The supporting cast, especially Baldwin and Wahlberg, were just as great. The story was engrossing from start to finish, and Scorcese presents it with style and visual flair. He uses music and camera angles to great effect. No one can deny he is a master of the trade. Monahan's adaptation is tight and balances story with character perfectly. Look out for The Departed come Oscar season. I have seen a lot of movies this year, but The Departed blows them all out of the water. Easily the best Scorcese film since Goodfellas, The Departed deserves your hard earned money more than anything in the theaters this year.
9.0~Finally! DickNay Sign in Permalink Finally, Martin Scorsese returns to the gritty underworld of crime in the United States. After "Casino", he left it - for whatever reason - and made a few bombs, followed by "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator." One could say that after so many years away from the crime underworld (over 10) Scorsese could have lost his touch. This is just not so. The camera flies around just like in "Goodfellas" and keeps us on the edge of our seat for the two-and-a-half-hour run time. The violence, Scorsese's trademark for so many years, is kept in check by the director up until the bloody end - and that's not a British-ism; it's quite gruesome at the end. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as the rat of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the rat of the Boston PD inside Costello's crew, respectively. The plot is simple, but through his mastery of the camera, Scorsese keeps us interested and engaged. William Monahan's script is simple, but relatively well-done (this is only his second produced screenplay; his first was "Kingdom of Heaven.") The supporting cast is excellent; Martin Sheen plays a high-ranking official in the Boston PD, Mark Whalberg plays his slight subordinate (Whalberg's Dingam is a real prick, but ultimately, a hero - kind of), Alec Baldwin plays the head of the Special Investigations Unit, who's tracking Costello (Costello's mole is within the Unit.) Scorsese has brought us back to the American crime underworld, and it is a journey that makes us realize: films like these are why we go to the movies in the first place.
4.0~Disappointment cappocanieri Sign in Permalink When I heard Scorsese made this movie, i was very excited. Because one thing that i know, Departed will be an adaptation of my favorite Hongkong movie "Infernal Affairs" or "Wu Jian Dao". And when I read a magazine, the director denied and said it's only inspired by. So my expectation flew away. But all my dream has gone when I saw "Departed". It's all the same. Sorry, spoiler, how the boss gang died, how the captain died, how the undercover died, all the same. In short, all the important scene, are all the same. Maybe, they have different ending but if you have seen "Wu Jian Dao", "The Departed" just only follower. No need a big name like Scorsese just to remake an Asian movie. One thing, "The Departed" has lost the thrill that "Wu Jian Dao" have.
4.0~over-hyped rtypos Sign in Permalink I confess from the start that I did not want to see The Departed. Gangster movies with their gratuitous violence, profanity laced dialogue and sordid characters have little appeal for me. I find them, almost always, tedious and unsettling, the exception being movies like the Godfather series which were able to transcend the genre. However I told my son I would see the movie if it won the Oscar for best picture which, to my regret, it did. A promise is a promise so I sat through the entire movie even though I wanted to leave many times. Setting aside my ingrained distaste for movies of this sort and trying to look at the film objectively, I would argue that it fails on many critical levels. The acting performances range from adequate to indifferent. Jack Nicholson plays his usual Jack Nicholson role which is good or bad depending on whether or not you like Jack Nicholson. Matt Damon's character is bland and motiveless. Mark Walhberg's character is just bizarre. Leonard DiCaprio's performance is probably the best but that's not saying much. The script never calls for any real character development so the actors basically have one mood and that's it for the rest of the show. All we have throughout the movie is people swearing at each other, menacing other people or being menaced. The whole set up and execution of the plot, the obligatory love affair, the violence and the twist at the end is so just so improbable as to be ludicrous. At the other end of the spectrum in the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees was Little Miss Sunshine and though this movie had its flaws it had, at least, an original idea which, of course, never appeals to Academy voters. It was intelligent and infinitely more entertaining than The Departed which does not even rise to the top when compared to great gangster movies like The Goodfellas, Get Shorty, Snatch, Scarface etc. If you like gangster movies you will probably enjoy The Departed, even though I doubt you will find the hype justified. If you don't like gangster shows there is certainly nothing here to make you change your mind.
1.0~Its Not Oscar Stuff. naveedjami Sign in Permalink I do not see any aspect of the movie to qualify for an Oscar. It has a great cast no doubt, but it is an action packed violent movie, it was not pleasant in any way, the viewer does not develop enough association with any character, this is meant to happen in a movie with a grand cast. There is rarely a moment when a scene touches your heart, though it does leave a bad taste of memory on your mind, something that you do not want to think about again. I only watched the movie because of the cast and the probability that it might be an Academy Awards Movie. There are violent / and action packed movies Natural Born Killers, God Father but this one just an agony to the mind.
7.0~Pretty Good, But From Scorsese We Expect More matt-stabile Sign in Permalink Read This and Other Reviews at TheExpeditioner.com I know that this next statement is irrelevant regarding my review but I feel obligated to state it anyway for the sole reason of justifying a perhaps more critical review than I otherwise would have written: Scorsese is easily one of my favorite directors. Not on only for the films that he has made, but also for his passionate involvement in elevating film as art outside of the realm of his own film-making. From his documentary work to his stature as this country's Movie Laureate, Scorsese is ever-present discussing film, throwing his two cents into a wide variety of cinema documentaries and retrospectives -- which I wonder if he agrees to do when he hears that his absence would cause the documentarian to interview Brett Ratner regarding Rossellini's influence on neo-realism. But with great power comes great responsibility, and for Scorsese this means film-making that lives up to his name, which unfortunately "The Departed" does not. Which is not to say that it is a bad movie, it's just not what one comes to expect from a true genius in the field. In "The Departed," the swift dialogue and intricate plot is weighed down by its notable plot holes and manic roster of male leads which looks like Ben Affleck's Friday night poker game spilled out onto a Hollywood sound stage after one too many double espressos. The two exceptions to this is not surprisingly Damon, who once again puts in a rare performance of a lead star adopting a character rather than vice-versa, and to my surprise DiCaprio, who when he steps back from playing hyper-Leo, effectively exudes the vulnerability and nervousness of a character fighting the inner tension of a person torn between professional loyalty and personal survival. On the opposite side of the fence is Wahlberg, whose singular direction seemed to have been, "Be really loud and mad," Baldwin and Sheen, two roles that would have been better served by character actors given their minor role in the film, and Nicholson, who seems to think that he needs to prove he can still play a bad guy by burning random objects and fondling dismembered body parts. But with his unkept hair and woefully chosen wardrobe, Nicholson's supposedly evil gangster character seems like he would be more comfortable lining up at the shuffleboard deck than capping bullets in enemies heads, which by the time the movie winds it way to the end, happens frequently enough to the various characters that the impact is minor at best, leading me to wonder whether killing off main characters in a movie is exceeding profound or simply an easy escape for a story searching for a finale. And with any discussion of a film by a legendary director, Scorcese's performance itself needs to be judged as a sixth man in an otherwise crowded court. Here it seems that his characteristic style of un-static camera work and innovative plot progression is all but absent here. The Departed looks prosaic and darts along frantically from one scene to another with what seems like little thought of what the impact of each scene would be on the audience. Though in another Scorsese motif, the thundering rock soundtrack was well chosen -- including a great version of "Comfortably Numb" with Van Morrison on vocals -- and worked well to create both an edgy feel for the gritty locales as well as providing dramatic influence in certain key scenes. But as the pasts of the main characters come back to haunt each of them with dire consequences, Scorcese's own cinematic past does the same, building up expectations that are not quite met in otherwise good film that should have been great. Luckily for Scorsese, in the world of film-making this amounts to little more than a bad review rather than a bullet in the head. If only "The Departed" could have been so lucky.
7.0~Good for thrills, but short on soul lbb2 Sign in Permalink As we all know from countless movies, cops and robbers are the heads and tails of a coin that always seems good for another flip, if the spin is sufficiently vigorous. But while this film has an interesting (if preposterous) premise of mirror-image moles in the Boston police and an Irish "mafia", and is well directed, acted, and photographed, I found it curiously unmoving. It is certainly far from the top of my list of favorites in the thriller/mystery genre. Puzzling over my unemotional state as I left the theater, I thought of The Departed in comparison to The Third Man, another movie with a mirrored pair of protagonists, and the thriller/mystery that is still at the top of my life list. DiCaprio and Damon as the cop-and-robber twins, and Vera Farmiga as the woman caught between them, could be compared favorably, as actors, to Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli, but the male characters in The Departed, unlike Holly Martins and Harry Lime in The Third Man, seem to learn very little from their conflicted loyalties as they ricochet from one violent event to another. Also, nothing happens, or can happen, between them, because they do not know one another, and even their final violent meeting is oddly devoid of drama. Only Farmiga's character learns anything, and it is a bleak lesson indeed. Nicholson's over-the-top mob boss is an entertaining Beelzebub, but actually a distraction from the main story. We certainly learn nothing new about evil from him.
10.0~Best Mafia movie since Goodfellas kairingler Sign in Permalink Wow this movie really takes you're breath away. What an all-star cast, you have Jack Nickolson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Anderson, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio. i think i like Leo's character the best though,, there are a lot of plot twists in this one,, i think this is also probably Jack Nickolson's best work in a very long time, this kind of role seems to suit him, Mark Wahlberg's character was very intriguing too, Matt Damon did a fairly decent job here, this is much better than the Good Shepard,, which Leonardo passed on wisely.. This gangster movie has it all,, people getting thrown off of roofs,, blood splattering everywhere,, hey i almost forgot Martin Sheen is also in this,, and he did a superb job as well, i think this is the best since Goodfellas, this movie has a lot of twists like i said,, i won't ruin the ending,, but you will be in suspense right up until the end, no matter who you choose to root for,, all in all i have to give this movie a very big thumbs up.
1.0~enjoyable yet terrible nareliruiz Sign in Permalink This film is overrated. I enjoyed watching it and expect it will sell well, but being quickly included in the top 250 is more a factor of American ignorance than film genius. This film is mainstream. I don't remember any long shots or groundbreaking lines. Instead, the Departed feeds the lack of attention and mainstream spit talk of a cookie cutter sellout. This film is unoriginal. Do you seriously feel that this film develops characters properly? Do you think that the twists were unexpected because you were raised on Disney entertainment. Did you forget the unbuilt grey area regarding the CIA informer?
10.0~Scorsese's best... one of my favorites turdferguson1000 Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is right up there. I can't think of any other movie besides "Pulp Fiction" that had me glued to the screen like "The Departed". It has a great plot with fantastic acting. If you can get over Leonardo Dicaprio playing his type of role then you will at least like the movie a little bit. I know its hard to imagine him doing this type of role, but he really has evolved as an actor over the years. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I'm not one of those guys that is going to get all technical. But this movie is real with real conflicts(especially Dicaprio). Marky Mark, Nicholson, Damon, Sheen, even Alec Baldwin played their parts well. Simply one of the best.
10.0~best mob movie since scarface rkcrawf-2 Sign in Permalink and I love mob movies. I loved this movie. When I think of mob movies, I think of the Godfather(s), Scarface, and Goodfellas, in that order. It's not the Godfather, but it is definitely a classic. The story is better than Goodfellas (yes, I know that was based on a real story, but this one seems more realistic). The violence and dialog are so much more satisfying than Scarface. You feel like the violence makes sense, and isn't there just to decorate the movie. And the characters are nearly as compelling as the Godfather. The acting (and writing) is so good, that I will be disappointed if there are not multiple Oscar wins for the cast and story. I could easily see ones for Nicholson and DiCaprio (and I normally don't like Leo). I'm not sure what the running time was, but if anything I felt the film was too short. It was paced well, and tidied things up nicely, but I felt like I wanted to spend yet more time with the characters to understand them. Imagine if you only got one movie to know who Vito Corleone was... And of course, the directing was A++. Scorcese is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. W/o giving things away, some of the duality, and contrasts are brilliant. One guy has one phone which he switches the sim cards. Another has two phones, which he carries around openly. I can't wait to see this movie again!
7.0~Nothing new for those who loved the original axis38 Sign in Permalink I went into this with very high expectations. #50 on the IMDb top 250, 92% fresh on rottentomatoes. I was disappointed, but I set myself up for it. It's a good movie, but after seeing this I'm starting to believe that a lot of the '10s' from IDMb voters, did in fact, come from those that hadn't seen Infernal Affairs. I'm not going to come out and say Infernal Affairs is a better movie. When you add up all the elements of both films, The Departed is the superior piece of film-making. What disappointed me though, was that Scorcese really didn't take it to the dizzying heights I would've expected after such a positive reaction from almost everyone that had seen it. Probably every aspect is improved upon in terms of the production process, with the exception of editing. I thought some of the earlier scenes about their childhoods were unnecessary and failed to add anything really substantial to the structure of the original... and that's perhaps my complaint for the whole movie. By the end I felt like I'd just watched Infernal Affairs all over again. What was good, didn't really change. What was bad was changed, but not in such a way that it made any dramatic impact. The romance subplot for instance, was equally as dull as it had been in the original. There wasn't much chemistry between the psychiatrist and the two leads.. it was done well enough to make a point about the two of them, but not well enough to really move me. The acting was fine, believable, occasionally there'd be something that'd make me draw breath from Jack Nicholas and Leonardo DiCaprio. But most of the time, nothing more. I guess what I'm trying to say is this: had I never seen Infernal Affairs, The Departed would have been nothing short of spectacular. But I had. And what I got was a very competent remake from the master that didn't take the story or characters to any dramatic new depths. What ultimately kept my attention wasn't anything different that Scorcese did, but the same, tense game of cat and mouse that was lifted straight of the original. Honestly I wanted to sing this movie praises, but all I can really do is clap and say: 'well done'.
10.0~Scorsese's Masterpiece of Boston Gangsters and Crooked Cops boatdoc Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese should easily finally take home his first Academy Award for Best Director for "The Departed". With consummate skill he has assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography - with the result being a film that grabs your attention in the first few moments and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film clocks in at a minute less than 2 1/2 hours. With about 10 minutes left the Mrs. and I shared that we both needed a bathroom break after our half-gallon sodas... but neither of us dared leave. The screenplay, I learn, was adapted by William Monahan from a Hong Kong script by Siu Fai Mak which was translated into English as "Internal Affairs". I also read that Mr. Scorsese didn't see the Chinese film but, rather, worked from an English translation of the "Internal Affairs" script. The story is a compelling narrative and Mr. Monahan has adapted the story to a Boston setting of Irish cops and gangsters. The dialog is full of sharp, witty one-liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth. The language reflects the setting of South Boston, not Sesame Street, so if your ears burn with the constant use of profanity - you may want to wait for an "edited for TV" version. The cast is brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston "Southie" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT - not usual police recruit material) he is recruited by a secret undercover unit to infiltrate the local mafia. We see him put through a grueling interview by his to-be superiors, Martin Sheen, full of paternal wisdom, and Mark Wahlberg, full of suspicions and vulgarities (but with many of the movie's best moments in a role that is no higher than maybe 5th or 6th billing.) At the same time DiCaprio is being recruited to infiltrate the mob, Matt Damon has been sent by the same mob to join the police force where, with his intelligence, etc, he is soon in a parallel secret unit investigating both his boss, Irish Mobster Frank Costello (in yet another defining performance by Jack Nicholson) and the "mole" who it is apparent has infiltrated the police force. (Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find - himself.) Jack's performance is a Nicholson special. Frank Costello is a nearly untouchable sociopath. (The reason Costello is "ungettable" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub-plots.) Costello is vulgar and menacing and everyone in Boston quakes in his presence, from local priests to the scariest hit men. The Mrs. and I differ in our opinion of whether the film revolves around Costello (her view), since all the other characters revolve around him and, after all, he's played by the great Jack Nicholson, or whether DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the main character (my opinion), since he has the most screen time and, if this story has a protagonist, Costigan is it. It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling. "The Departed" has so many well-drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films! Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower-paying position because she wants to serve her community while she also helps her patients. In one of the trickiest roles of the film she becomes romantically attracted to both "moles", not knowing the "true identity" of either until the climax of the film. Her steely determination after she discovers that Matt Damon is the police department "rat" reminds me of Alida Valli's famous performance in "The Third Man" and her final scene in this movie (walking away from a funeral in a cemetery towards the camera in a single shot, completely ignoring the man who thinks he has romantic possibilities with her) is an obvious homage by Scorsese to Carol Reed's film classic. Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man, "Frenchie") and Alec Baldwin (as the over-matched police detective who is trying to bring together the various machinations of the Boston detectives and undercover mob infiltrators) lead the next tier of supporting performances. It's just another sign of the overall quality of Mr. Scorsese's picture that actors who would "star" in other films take on roles that in other films would be fleshed out by unknowns. The films ends, I think, as it must, and it's fair to say it's a Noir ending and not a "Hollywood" ending. Over the weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards this film will be praised more than the last 25 films nominated for "Best Picture" combined. All the praise and hoopla will make "The Departed" and it's various investors a lot of money. This makes me wonder - if great films like this are profitable, why bother with the other 99% of brainless dreck that shows up at my local cineplex every week? Just wondering.
2.0~Very poor quality vargasje Sign in Permalink Sorry to disagree with those who liked the movie, but I have to say that I found it totally unmemorable. This work is definitely not of Oscar quality. I have seen many other Scorsese movies, and frankly, his later work (Gangs of New York, The Aviator) is just terrible. In the Departed the story line is not well presented, there are severe problems with continuity, many dialogs are poorly executed, and I could go on and on. In my opinion, these defects reflect a severe deterioration of Scorsese's craft. I hope he can recover his touch and go back to the excellent craft that he exhibited in his early days. This year there were several movies by far better than the Departed. One has to wonder why the academy gave an Oscar for a work of such a low quality.
10.0~Brilliance DrPlatypus1 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese finally received his Oscar for Best Director with this film, among three additional Oscars, including Best Picture. For Scorsese, his Oscar was overdue, but it could not have been awarded for a better film. The Departed is a powerhouse; the casting, directing and acting in this film are untouchable. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon work together to create a truly brilliant contrast between protagonists that escalates into an unprecedented and unexpected climax that will leave the viewer stunned and speechless. Jack Nicholson proves why he is the consummate actor of his generation with his chilling portrayal of a ruthless and truly evil Irish crime boss of whom the film's story circulates. From his first scene to his last, Nicholson's performance is spectacular. His authenticity is positively chilling. To complement the stellar performances from DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg offer performances that fit this film seamlessly and perfectly. From the honest character of Queenan (Sheen) to the brutish but intelligent Dignam (Wahlberg), the supporting cast blends effortlessly into the leading roles to provide a remarkable finished product that is The Departed. Alongside the brilliant casting and the outstanding acting, the pacing of this film is perfect. Comfortably over two hours, the steady and constant increase of action and intensity culminates in a truly unique and heart-stopping climax that the viewer will absolutely not expect. If you are a fan of Martin Scorsese, this film is for you. If you are a fan of DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, etc, this film is for you. If you appreciate the art of filmmaking, this film is for you. To summarize, this film is absolutely brilliant. 10/10.
9.0~Amazing, but not Martins best film m1xer Sign in Permalink He finally wins best director but that was because he deserved it for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and most definitely Goodfellas. One of the Academys biggest brain farts was robbing Marty of Goodfellas so they give it to him for one of his best films in a decade the Departed. An all star cast of Whalberg, Sheen, Baldwin, Damon, Nicholson and DiCaprio lead the way through this movie of good and evil. A mole, or rat in both the police force and mafia, (Damon and DiCaprio) Leo is the good guy who is paranoid and has to resort to pain killers like Oxy to level his head out and Valium to settle down his anxiety. Damon is a smart kid but grows up in Costello (Nicholsons) mob and becomes a cop, a leader actually who tried to track down the RAT in his unit, who is in fact him so that helps him protect his identity until later in the movie and it backfires. I could of done without a lot of the ending scenes and the murders and all that but the dialogue, story and acting were all compelling. Good shipping up to boston theme, good story, and I was entertained throughout. Well deserving of Best Picture. 9 out of 10. Probably my 4th favourite Scorcese Movie.
9.0~Whatever I say does not do this film justice Balidorf Sign in Permalink The Departed The screenplay: Top Notch The performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performances The music: perfect The Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something. Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, "Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre." This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene. Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed. That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
9.0~Textbook for adapting rather than lousy remaking Jithindurden Sign in Permalink Mainly the remake of Infernal Affairs but actually taking every great thing in the Infernal Affairs trilogy The Departed surpasses the greatness of the original. The only thing that shines dimmer would be Dicaprio's performance compared to Tony Leung's in my opinion, Dicaprio was amazing but Leung just edged out. The original Infernal Affairs had the strength of a powerful script and stunning performances, but when the director is Martin Scorsese every single aspect is near perfect.
3.0~Disappointed petoom4 Sign in Permalink Jack Nicholson is a wonderful actor and is wasted in this over violent and bloody movie. It was too long and sometimes boring. The cast is uniformly good but the plot was mundane. Why do I have to write ten lines to tell you that I briefly fell asleep a couple of times. I came out of the theater thinking I will avoid Scorsese movies from now on. What more can one say than an excellent cast cannot make a dull movie exciting and interesting. It was a waste of $24.00 (for the two of us). I am tired of seeing blood spattered all over floors, walls and people. This gore is no substitute for a skillfully written and filmed scenario. Surely Scorsese can do better.
8.0~return of the Scorsese movie is not great. but its good. lleeric Sign in Permalink Here it is. The Scorsese's movie i've been waiting for. THe Departed. I love Scorsese and his brilliant work and his movies and i was so excited to see this movie. I was so confident that i was going to love this movie. And I actually loved it, but it wasn't what i expected it to be. But this was Leonardo Dicaprio's best role. Jack Nicholson was good and so was Matt Damon. But Mark Whalberg was a cussing machine. Well, that was the problem with this movie: The cussing. There is like 2 or 1 F bombs in every 2 sentences and it got really annoying. Why so many F Bombs??? Although the story was fantastic. But it's just not what i pictured it would be like. Some scenes really bored me too and i didn't really need to know about it. The Actions were OK. But people who like action packed movies such as The Matrix or The Bourne Series are gonna get bored and hate this movie. This is my movie rating. Story: 9/10 Picture/Scenes: 8/10 Character: 9/10 Overall: 8.5/10 BUt i decided to rate it a 8 or a 9 because There is not .5's in IMDb. Thank you and this was just my Opinion.
5.0~they all laughed, but it isn't funny. enryberen Sign in Permalink People says this movie is great, wonderful, perfect... but what about the final? When I went to the cinema last week, the departed was just coming out and the seats were quite full. And when at last Di Caprio (I liked his performance very much) comes down from the flat... )who has already seen the departed know what scene I mean) well, all the people around me started laughing. Furthermore the first 2 hour are full with violence, vulgar language, raunchy scenes, and I can accepted them, but only if they have a sense! "You're makin' nonsense at all, mate" Jack Sparrow'd say. I'm Italian but I don't understand the Italian Scorsese: why everything is so sad? Is that his personal meaning of justice? why all that violence? nothing and nobody explains it. Here in my country people use to be kind and gentle and the violence is never free.I would have enjoyed much more an happily-ever-after ending.
8.0~The Departed Has Left 314 Wash Street vesperma-2 Sign in Permalink lots of bodies, should be this films title. Scorsese is at his best doing movies where the villain is more fun than the main characters. Nicholson shines in this film. His glowing hallow around Nicholson makes moderate performances by the other actors playing mob guys look excellent. Tony Sirrico and Gandolfini (Sopranos) act as if they are mobsters, the guys in this film "not so much". In fact in a couple of scenes they looked bored in the background. Scorsese doesn't spend much time worrying about his background players and it shows. Many scenes where an extra actor could add something to the scene. They Bump On A Log. I believe it is an east coast acting theme that believes heroes, major characters, should only be the ones on camera. I did not like Snakes On A Plane however, the director had a moving grooving set, with lots to look at both foreground and background. I found Martin Sheen, Baldwin, and Wahlberg's performances trumped Damon's performance by a long shot. Di Caprio stole this movie. He was unrelenting, viciously psychopathic and yet tender at times. The best scene is in the porno theater when he is listening. He did not take the easy way out by just sitting there, no Di Caprio outdid both Nicholson and Damon in a scene where he's just sitting there. Wahlberg, plays his character, as a vicious jerk, which seems overplayed. However, Scorsese, plays the viewer for the fool when he, the unemployed cop, kills a rat in the end. Excellent film because Di Caprio, Sheen and Wahlberg tugged out Oscar Winning Performances from what can be played as a mobster movie. Nicholson was a perverted mobster which I felt did not do the character justice and Damon adequately weaselly did an OK job.
8.0~Very good but not Scorseses' best preppy-3 Sign in Permalink Film takes place in Boston. It deals with two men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon) who are both working to bring down a crime lord (Jack Nicholson). Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other. Things quickly go out of control. OK--this is not Martin Scorsese's best film. That goes to "Raging Bull" and "Good Fellas". However it is one of his best. The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming. There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston (not easy to do). Also--since this is a Scorsese film--the word "f***" is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody. This isn't for weak stomaches. My only complaints here are that the movie is too long--it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it. DiCaprio is excellent in his role. I was very impressed--I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion. Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast. But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles. His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him. Mark Wahlberg is bad too. How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know. He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures. I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon. He wasn't playing a character--he was doing a caricature. Those two bad performances lessen this. Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well (Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it). It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both. So--it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot. I give it an 8.
4.0~Same old story: weak storyline held up by great acting tanstaafl28 Sign in Permalink Scorsese fans probably won't be disappointed by this Boston Irish gangster movie, alas, the storyline really isn't up to par. The principle actors make this movie far better than it has a right to be, (that's what one expects good actors to do for just about any film). The plot line seems muddled. There seems to be a lack of motivation for anyone to do anything except beat the crap out of each other, swear, and shoot people for the hell of it. Several principle actors manage to live through moments they should have been killed only to wind up dying later on. Whomever wrote the screenplay seems to have a serious fetish for depicting people's heads getting blown off. The movie leaves me wondering if I'm supposed to see it as just another rip-off of every modern mobster movie since Goodfellas, or if I'm supposed to just embrace that emptiness of not knowing what the point of the movie really was.
9.0~goofs mrmakersmark Sign in Permalink Overall it was a very well made film, but for being done by an anal-retentive director, I would have thought the editing would be better. It is not that I didn't enjoy it, it is that with the story line so 'tight', you try to pick up on everything. Maybe it is because I also act that I notice these things. Two big scenes that stand out in my mind were the picture of Madolyn on a bike as a child and then Colin's gun being left in the elevator. In one scene, Madolyn pulls th picture out of the box at Colin's apartment and he takes the box away to put it in the bedroom with the picture back in it. Nice big close up of the pic in the scene. About 15 minutes later, Billy comes to her apartment and she is still packing, OK not totally moved out, but there is the same picture and Billy actually hangs it on the wall! Wow, it was so obviously done wrong. I thought maybe she brought the box back, but earlier she told Billy that she only had 3 weeks left on the lease. Nobody would float the box back and forth between apartments if you are definitely moving into one. The other scene was at the end when Billy had Colin on the roof, took his gun, and shoved it down the back of his pants (like all good cops do). After the elevator door opened on the first floor and Billy 'got it', Colin shoots two other guys and walks out. The next scene is him being interviewed on what happened. I kept waiting for the cops to say, "and how did your gun get into his pants?" Might be a minor detail, but could have been done better. Either take the gun before leaving the scene or explain why the gun was there. Like I said, overall good flick but Madolyn's character had no real drive in her for either guy. Dialogue wasn't believable.
1.0~left me numb... bwlass Sign in Permalink I came away from this film feeling very confused and numb.I thought the acting was quite good, Dicaprio, Walhberg, Damon, and Nicholson (although a bit over the top)but what is the point of a movie that is all smart ass talk (appears no one respects anyone else)and blood and guts. The female actress was added I'm sure just to give us a break from all the testosterone flowing from foul mouth males and she was rather weak and pointless. One scene that really sickened me was Jack in the restaurant scene with his hands and shirt covered in blood...what was he doing? Breaking in a new crew or butchering a pig ? My husband thought the movie too long and and I sometimes felt that the director was just off camera saying..."lights, camera ,action", especially the scene on the roof top near the end of the picture with Dicaprio and Damon.It looked too staged as if Dicaprio was looking for direction. The blood bath on the elevator was horrible mainly because some of the audience (20 in total) started to laugh and because a second mole was introduced and quickly dispensed. What??? But the last frame(with the you know what)was laughable So did we like it? Well the hype was there so we caved in and spent $17.40 (CND)but it wasn't what we expected.My husband wondered if it was a waste of 2 long hours and I'm still so numb I'll have to get back to him with an answer.
6.0~One of the most overrated films of all time, but hey... when you got star power like this film had, who would dare say a bad thing about you? DemiRonin Sign in Permalink *Note: This film has too many big named actors for me to list them according to their roles. There is a such a plethora of characters in this film that they start to blur so I'm only going to refer to character names for ease sake. Actors you may recognize: DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin Synopsis: In the beginning of the film we are introduced through montage and monologue to Frank Costello, the ruthless crime lord of South Boston. He preaches about power, grabbing life by the reigns, and about his general philosophy of the similarities between cops and criminals. Next we are then thrown into another montage of Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan, young cadets going through the police academy. After they graduate we see that Colin is a straight- A, climb the ranks kind of officer but also a double agent working for Frank. Billy on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve. However as a man whose family history is littered with low life criminals he is stuck feeling a bit out of place. Noticeably the black- sheep of his family Billy is given a super secret top mission to fail out the "Staties" and instead work undercover infiltrating Frank's gang. Billy thinks long and hard about his decision but in the end is persuaded by the father-like figure Captain Queenan. After a 20 minute long intro, the movie begins as the two undercover operatives work on separate sides, doing their best to conceal their dual identities. In doing so there lives begin to morph and derange to the point they don't know if they're more cop or criminal. The story is less to do with a singular event and more to do with when the two will be found out and gutted. There is a thing about some military microchips being sold to the Chinese but that story abruptly ends mid-movie. The driving force of the movie is more about how Colin and Billy must maneuver, bluff, and lie their way out of trouble. Both sides suspect a double agent among their ranks which increases the tension. Madolyn is the on sight psychologist and while getting into a serious relationship with Colin she starts develop an attachment to Billy as their mandatory therapy sessions bring them closer. Review: First of all this movie is almost 3 hours long! No movie should ever be that long unless it contains elements of fantasy or sci-fi. This film has so many stars and characters that instead of choosing who to focus on, Scorsese gives screen time to EVERYONE. It excessively gives moments of emotional development to Frank and Madolyn. Yes, Jack Nicholson plays a cool bad guy but he acts almost like a narrator spitting diatribe after another about cops, foreigners , and every other social intuition on the planet. Why in a movie that has to deal with identity and suspense is there so much "other stuff" added? There are themes about church, race relations, and about settling in your romantic life. All things that are great and interesting but simply should have been set aside for another movie. The cinematography is nothing special and in fact can be distracting at times, best example is when Billy is being grilled by Wahlberg for his intent on making the force. The camera gets a little movement happy constantly closing in on heads while they talk. Although this film won for best editing I have to forcefully disagree with that recognition. The film is adequately edited but in no way is the editing outstanding. A well edited film has great pace, which this film struggles with in its entirety. It's a stop and go viewing experience with scenes ranging from a couple of seconds to five minutes. Maybe it was purposely done that way to keep the audiences awake, but you shouldn't have to sacrifice flow for attention. Otherwise you're simply shaking the viewer to pay attention instead of enrapturing them. The acting is pretty good but none of the performances other than Wahlberg's is something new. DiCaprio mannerisms continues to be the same in almost everyone movie and only different thing about Matt Damon's performance is his accent. The Departed is an American remake of the Hong Kong trilogy Infernal Affairs, which is probably why I am being harder on this film than usual. Also the premise of dual undercover characters has been done before the action film Face-Off so I don't understand all the buzz this film has gotten. Scorsese was a frontier shattering director and I loved his work in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. However The Departed is far from ground breaking cinema and the clearest example I know of success by name. Who this film is not for: -People who don't like gangster/cop films -People with short attention spans
6.0~if the comparison with original is necessary utp0130 Sign in Permalink Alrite, I finally drag myself to watch this. My reluctance, of course, is because i think the original is a very good movie that has decent plot and good deal of emotion heavy moments, plus I am never a big fan of Scorsese's works and i really did not think it could top the original. It turns out i was right, but I had to applaud for this movie. Afterall, it is Scorsese, one is not going to get those beautiful songs play at the background when someone die. It's bleak and cold, and it is a movie of its own. The only problems i have with this film is Sullivan and the ending. I think the screen writer must be out his mind to make such a complicated character in the original degrade into a stereotypical villain. In IA, Andy Lau is deep, evil, but in the same time, in constant struggle to find his self image. Sullivan is really just lame. I also think the ending lacks the tragic feeling in the original, but hey!, it is exactly Scorsese's style and i respect that. One other disappointment is leaving out the subtle kind of understanding between the two main characters make the film's depth a bit shallower. After all, the best scene in the original is the one at the audio store where Tony Cheung and Andy Lau first met. Departed just made the line between black and white too clear. Nevertheless, it is still a great film. DiCaprio deserve nomination for his performance, and even though i am in doubt Scorsese will actually receive one academy award next year, I think this is a better shot compare to GoNY and Aviator. Wellz, i guess i will just make a suggestion for people who watch this film but not the original, grab it. It's the same plot essentially but very different style, and both highly enjoyable
7.0~Great Acting, Bad Writing, Bledsoe-2 Sign in Permalink Great acting. Jack N. is good just reading a phone book and Caprio did his best work. Writing seemed sloppy and contrived. Editing had some bad cuts. At times it seemed they were racing against a schedule to complete the film. I think Scorcese has seen too many Tarantino movies. All the shooting, blood, dead bodies and gore was a bit over the top. Departed is not one of his best works. But what the heck, I liked it, but it didn't live up to the hype. The movie is based on the career of Whitey Bulger, a Boston mobster, who got away with scores of crime because he was an FBI informant, recruited by a boyhood friend who was in the FBI. Why they gave Nicholson an Italian name is a mystery. Martin Sheen should sue the writers for his role. He did the best he could with some dialog that seemed almost ad lib. One of the glaring omissions was the very obvious omission of the role of the media. In the real world the media would have been a major player in the movie. As usual, the photography was outstanding. Cinemaphotography has become so good that it can make up for poor writing, mediocre directing and bad casting. Sometimes its great to just sit back and marvel at the incredible camera work.
10.0~I'll Keep it short for now - excellent! adam4432 Sign in Permalink I will start by saying what a massive fan I am of foreign cinema - I love the original trilogy - Infernal Affairs. When I first head that a remake was being made I instantly took a harsh stand against it - thinking how could they destroy such a masterpiece of a film (hence what will happen with the Oldboy remake). I watched this last night - had high hopes - excellent cast, excellent director. The film ultimately was amazing for me - yes the script is very much based on the Infernal Affairs (hence it being a remake). But I can't help but feel that Scorscese really has made this shine. Another huge surprise for me was Leonardo Di Caprio - thoughts about his role before watching the film I felt I was going to be very disappointed. But I really do feel he deserves an Oscar for this. Watch it you will not be disappointed - especially if you are a fan of the original trilogy. Glad it kept it's "18 / NC-17" certificate Utterly Adult humour, violence and story in every sense of the word!! Definite 10/10 for me.
10.0~The Best Film of 2006 MichaelMargetis Sign in Permalink "You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice... I quit. You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a f*cking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. Okay?" - Billy Costigan Walking into 'The Departed' the latest Scorsese picture I didn't know what to expect. The way it used to be, back in the 70s and 80s, was when Scorsese released a film you knew it was going to be spectacular and a contender for 'Best Picture'. Now, unfortunately, you cannot say the same thing. Besides blessing us with some of the Best American Films Ever Made (Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas), in his recent years some of his other films have been more than a little disappointing (Kundun, Bringing out the Dead, Age of Innocence, The Aviator). I wanted to think positive, and think maybe this could be on par with Scorsese's early efforts. Despite the talent of Jack Nicholson of the bad guy, I was pretty sure it was going to be good, but the same old disappointing stuff we got from him in recent years. But, when those ending credits started to roll, I realized, I could NOT have been more wrong. Believe most of the critics and myself when we say 'The Departed' is not just excellent, but a masterpiece, and one of the best films Scorsese has EVER made. 'The Departed' is based on the superb 2003 Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Remakes usually are inferior to their originals, but in this case, 'The Departed' is 10 times better than 'Infernal Affairs', featuring acting and direction that is literally 20 times better. Instead of Hong Kong, the story of the remake is set in Beantown, or Boston. An up and coming rookie cop with a criminal family history, Costigan (DiCaprio), is commissioned by his superior officers Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to go on a secret undercover mission and infiltrate the crew of the charismatic yet incredibly violent crime boss, Frank Costello (Nicholson). At the same time, a street hood practically raised by Costello, Sullivan (Damon), is commissioned by Costello to go undercover and infiltrate in the Boston Police Department. The film quickly becomes a thrilling cat and mouse game of wits between Costigan and Sullivan, to see which of the two will come out victorious. Scorsese's riveting Boston crime drama also stars The War Zone's Ray Winstone as Costello's equally twisted #1 man, Mr. French, The Manchurian Candidate's Vera Farminga as a psychiatrist working for the Boston P.D., who forms a relationship with Colin, and Alec Baldwin as the sarcastic, easily-irritated, but constantly fun to watch police Lieutenant who tells Colin one of the benefits of getting married is that the other cops won't think you're a 'homo'. Analyzing the different aspects of this film, there is really nothing to complain about, but so much to praise. First off, the acting is perhaps the best out of any motion picture released this year. Jack Nicholson is absolutely outstanding not to mention bone-chilling in his supporting role as Frank Costello, creating what is his best 'bad-guy' yet. It will be virtually impossible for Nicholson to be denied an Oscar nomination for his work in this, seeing as though whenever he's on-screen he steals the film, even if he doesn't have lines. Matt Damon is magnificent in his role as the calculating gangster posing as Bostod P.D., but the real breakthrough and the finest performance of 'The Departed' is Leonardo DiCaprio. In a tour-de-force performance that gave me goose bumps, DiCaprio completely makes up for some of his lack-luster performances in the past and then some. I predict DiCaprio might receive another Best Lead Actor Oscar Nomination for his work in this, God knows he deserves it 100%. In smaller roles, Mark Wahlberg is hysterical and scene-stealing as the demeaning police Sergeant who always has some smart-ass nasty comment to say to someone. Martin Sheen is solid to say the least as the Police Captain, Alec Baldwin is quite humorous in a tiny role as the Lieutenant, and Vera Farminga is fantastic in her role as the precinct shrink. Rounding out the cast, Ray Winstone is perfect as one man no one wants to screw with, Mr. French, and The Shield's Anthony Andersen is merit-able in an almost unnoticeable role as another cop who works with Sullivan. William Moynihan provides a masterful screenplay which redeems him for the scattered and stilted screenplay he provided for 'Kingdom of Heaven'. The dialog in 'The Departed' never seems stiff, and most of the time it is laced with side-split-tingly funny yet gritty one-liners from both the criminals and the cops. The cinematography and film editing are astounding, but the real secret to the success of 'The Departed' is Martin Scorsese's breathtaking directing abilities. Scorsese outdoes himself with 'The Departed' which is as stylish as 'Raging Bull' and as entertaining and engrossing as 'GoodFellas'. Scorsese has been nominated seven Academy Awards for 'Best Director' and has never actually won, but mark my words, 'The Departed' is probably going to be the film he finally gets the trophy for. Not just because he's overdue, but because his surprisingly exceptional work in 'The Departed' is more than deserving. Out of all these nearly perfect aspects of the film, the only down-side is that the first fifteen minutes of the film aren't very gripping. No worries, though, the rest of the two hours and fifteen minutes fly by and will have you pinned to your seat. It's one of those films you don't want to end because you are having such a fun time in the movie theater. 'The Departed' is the best film of the year, thus far, and is a reminder of why we as a people go to the movies. Grade: A (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, AZ, 10/07/06)
9.0~The Departed is on its way to the Awards Season - BIG time! mike-2077 Sign in Permalink Scorsese at his best. The 150 minutes seems like 90. Stella cast. Jack Nicholson - got to be an Oscar Nominated performance. Leonardo DiCaprio as you have never seen him before. Brilliantly written. Magnificently Directed. Fabulous Photography. And Matt Damon - no more Mr Nice Guy..... A must see movie - A+. Let no one tell you about the film, see it and enjoy it. The film is well paced - it does not have the usually present it most films of 150 minutes plus duration that sagging spot - no way could you cut a frame of this film. Well placed for the awards season and I think this is going to pull a bunch of them, and deservedly so. At last an intelligent movie to grace the cinema screens this year.
8.0~Another voice comparing the two cliff-19 Sign in Permalink I managed to see both "Infernal Affairs" (hereafter "Mou gaan dou") and "The Departed" in one sitting and would like to compare them. To start, I would give them the same rating (8) and praise them equally. But the strengths are uneven. What follows is TOTAL SPOILER and meant only for others who have seen both. * Religion In Mou gaan dou, the mob boss Sam is religious. He indirectly attributes his success to his faith and ties in the disciples through a ritual of loyalty. He rules by this ingrained sense of loyalty and is never portrayed as fearful. In Departed, mob boss Frank rules entirely through fear, violence and intimidation. He caps this off with utter contempt for the Church. Who would stay loyal to a guy like that? * Class The Departed's greatest strength is in the in-depth analysis of the class conflict in New England's Irish community. References to "lace-curtains" and "shanties" is an allusion to long-standing symbolism of this conflict. This was a compelling introduction to the characters that Mou gaan dou left out, and went very far to explaining their motivations. * Language The language in Mou gaan dou is richly oblique ("At least I am not afraid to let the sun shine on me" says Yan toward the end.) and only occasionally rough. The language in Departed is relentlessly coarse and filled with coarse metaphors, puns and references. The language in each fits with the consistent tone of the acting. The two main spooks are cool in Mou gaan dou, and nearly hysterical in Departed. * Overall The Departed's beginning was utterly brilliant, far outclassing Mou Gaan Dou. But the high level of violence in Departed wore thin on me. By the time of the big bust, I felt that Mou gaan dou leaped ahead in crafting a complex drama that was not just another shoot-em-up. The cat-and-mouse chase between the spooks was FAR more compelling in Mou gaan dou, and the last scene in Departed proved that not even Scorcese can avoid the demands to give 'em a happy ending.
1.0~weakest cop film i have ever seen shishirsharma Sign in Permalink i watched the whole movie just to understand what was in this movie that entertained the people and made martin Scorsese win an academy award , and i would say there was nothing that i found .this movie was awful in each and every aspect ,the story was weak it was simple and there was no twist or thrills .people who liked this movie were talking about how corrupt those cops were, come on this happens in each and every country ,there was nothing to be surprised.I still don't understand how did martin Scorsese win an academy award for best director ,infact i found this movie to be poorly directed i give it 1/10 this movie is not for those people who are expecting thrill or plot twists.
9.0~Infernally good lee_a_scott Sign in Permalink First things first  if you've not seen it, see Infernal Affairs (just the first one  no real need for the sequels). It doesn't matter if you see it before or after The Departed, but you should see it all the same. It is not quite the same film (with, for me, the biggest difference being in the interpretation of Damon's character) and is excellent. So, that out of the way, The Departed: what a great film! A top, top, top flight cast, with a top director and a top idea  as a cynic, for me it was set up to be a turkey, but luckily they got it right. Scorsese's pacing and control are spot on, Nicholson seethes and explodes as only Jack can, Damon is cold and controlled, Alec Baldwin (world's greatest actor, according to Kim Jong Il) is superbly fat and sweaty, Wahlberg is intense and dislikeable (in a good way) and Di Caprio gives, maybe, his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape? managing to convey the desperation and isolation that Costigan was feeling without resorting to melodrama. It is a long film but never drags and, despite having already seen Infernal Affairs first, still felt fresh and gripped me to the end. This is quality cinema, of a style that you don't get much of these days (that's right kids  no wire work or chicks doing kung-fu) and deserves to be seen and applauded.
3.0~"Beware of the Hype." PWNYCNY Sign in Permalink "Beware of the hype, for it shall mislead." "There is a direct relationship between the level of hype and a movie's mediocrity." These are axioms that are as immutable as Isaac Newton's Law of Gravity or the speed of light and the truth of which are again evident in this dismal movie. Judging by the hype that preceded this movie, I am neither surprised nor disappointed by this movie's utter lack of quality. This movie is so bad that the scenes of graphic and gratuitous violence provoked unintended laughter. (By the way, isn't there enough violence already in the world that Hollywood has to dramatize it? Can't Hollywood ease off on the violence? Why show people being gunned down? How does that make the world a better place? How does that add to the artistic quality of a movie?) Also, the story itself and characters involved are so utterly insipid and so lacking in anything that even remotely resembles originality that they cannot be taken seriously. A police officer on the take? A criminal who is also an informant? The main characters in this movie are gangsters and corrupt police officers. It's understood that they are violent. So why show the violence? Remember the hype and judge accordingly.
3.0~Alright as a standalone film. Bad remake. hibbz02 Sign in Permalink Now, I'm sure a lot of people are going to disagree with me here, because I know a lot of people are DIE HARD Martin Scorsese fans, and some of you guys will blame this review on me having Infernal Affairs as my #1 film in my Top 10, but here goes. The Departed's first sign of greatness would be the original. It amazed people worldwide for putting a fresh face on an old genre, spanning endless amounts of Cop v Triad Hong Kong movies, which are still coming out today in endless amounts. The Departed's second sign of greatness would be the cast. A huge amount of famous actors. And this is where I'll begin criticising it. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and so on. All these names are great, but the acting was mediocre, Mark Wahlberg seeming to get nominated for an Oscar by his characters dialogue alone. Even veteran actors like Ray Winstone provided little flair. William Monahan, who wrote the screenplay went far too in-depth on the parts of the story that didn't matter. It took half an hour or so just to cover the opening five minutes of the original, focusing on Jack Nicholson and trying to stick as much swearing and wit into the script as possible. The film did progress towards the end, after a dire first half it looked as if it could catch up with the original. The cinematography was decent in places, but typical Scorsese. The scenes that mattered, Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) falling off the top of the building was seriously marred, and a disappointment from the original, and the rooftop and elevator scene at the end, was dire. With Scorsese and Monahan ripping the original story to shreds. Hideously overrated on IMDb with an 8.4 score and 77th in the top 250, The Departed is similar to The Ring. Both alright films on their own, but compared to the originals, they are terrible. Sorry for the poorly written review.
8.0~25 years in the making...and worth the wait dmbroome Sign in Permalink In 1981, Martin Scorsese was nominated in the Best Director category for Raging Bull. That he didn't win then was criminal, that it took 25 years for him to get his hands on an Academy award is simply felonious. And so it is perhaps apt that it was The Departed that won it, being arguably his best crime picture to date. I have just re-watched the epic on DVD, after being blown away in the cinema, and I was struck again by the level of humour it boasts. The film is a masterpiece, as good in my opinion as Goodfellas, Casino or Taxi Driver - if not directly comparable - and a welcome return to form after the trudging blockbusters that were Gangs of New York and The Aviator. 'The Departed', as a title, works on many levels. It refers literally to the numerous deaths in the film, but also reminds us how far 'departed' the main characters of Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan have become from their original selves. Costigan (Leonardo di Caprio) and Sullivan (Matt Damon) are, respectively, a cop from the wrong side of the tracks and a choirboy turned crook, acting undercover in each other's organisations. Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the mob boss, and Martin Sheen plays Captain Queenan, ably aided by the excellent Mark Wahlberg as Sergeant Dignam. I could eulogise at length about how much I enjoyed this picture, or explore some of the many themes, from the many religious connections (Nicholson as Costello is the devil incarnate for sure) to the clear juxtaposition of the lives of Costigan and Sullivan (e.g. when the latter is buying a flat or having a date, the former is in jail or in a fight), but instead I would like to focus on the humour. Productions of this ilk, (and by ilk I include the likes of Donnie Brasco, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas or The Sopranos), generally succeed where others fail because of the human side to the story. It's all very well having a killer plot, plenty of violence and lots of gangster patter, but if people can't relate to the characters it is unlikely to engage them. Think of the most memorable scenes from the afore-mentioned films and in your list is likely to be Joe Pesci asking "What do you mean I'm funny?" in Goodfellas, Johnny Depp explaining what "Forget about it" means in Donnie Brasco, "Royale with Cheese" from Pulp Fiction or any number of one-liners in The Sopranos. These jokes, while they would never bring the house down, remind you that these are real people rather than just killers, gangsters or crooks. And the Departed delivers as well as any of these, whether it's Dignam's insults: "My theory on Feds is that they're like mushrooms, feed 'em sh*t and keep 'em in the dark" and "I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other guy"; Captain Ellerby's quick-patter: "I'm gonna go have a smoke right now. You want a smoke? You don't smoke, do ya, right? What are ya, one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go f*ck yourself"; or Costello's big-talk: "One of us had to die. With me, it tends to be the other guy." This aspect of the film kept me engaged, and meant that I was alert enough to the action to spot other subtleties, such as the references to "Psycho" and "The Third Man" in the shower scene and at Billy's funeral. One reference though, also I feel the film's weakest point, was more rammed down my throat than slipped into my subconscious. This came right at the end of the film, where the "rat" runs across Sullivan's window. A little too literal I thought. I probably wouldn't have remembered that had it not been the last scene of the film, and that aside, this is easily the best film I have seen in the cinema in the last decade. It certainly deserves to become in time a classic to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese's finest and is fitting to be the one that finally earned him an Oscar, after 26 years of being a bridesmaid.
9.0~Fresh & Exhilarating Crime Thriller Diego_Flores Sign in Permalink With "The Departed" Martin Scorsese remakes a Hong Kong film called internal affairs. Taking Place in Boston, young Undercover Cop Billy Costigan is assigned the job of infiltrating the Irish mob ran by a violent crime boss named Costello. Simultaneously, Costello has a criminal mole of his own working in the Police Department. Eventually both the mob and Police realize there is a mole in their operations causing the ensuing action and excitement, when they try and smoke each other out. Scorsese knows how to do crime movies with such greats as Casino, Goodfellas and Taxi Driver under his belt. He matches and maybe even surpasses those films with the Departed. I'm neither a Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio fan. In Fact I always saw them as pretty boy actors who are mainly used to attract a female audience. In Departed both attempt to step up to the plate and try erase those past impressions. DiCaprio does a decent job even though his accent was questionable, and Damon is fully believable in his role. They were backed by a great cast including Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlburg, Vera Fermiga & Anthony Anderson. The one actor who I think did poorly was Jack Nicholson. He overacted and really hammed it up by acting plain retarded at some points. Some of his gestures and and facial expressions were ridiculous and silly. Writer William Monahan rewrote the script without viewing the original, allowing him more freedom. He does a great job translating this oft told story into something fresh that unfolds in an exhilarating way. Scorsese's directing was also quite impressive. He obviously didn't feel the need to rush things and allows the film to move along at an even pace without getting boring. Many directors would have made the mistake of shortening the script, thinking they would get a tighter movie. As I said the plot itself is pretty straightforward, but the ensuing results are anything but expected. This isn't a conventional crime thriller so things happen that you would never expect. The story and characters are exciting, and this movie packs a lot in what seems like a short amount of time. Nothing is excessive and everything is intense, leaving you with a true crime masterpiece. I give it a nine & not a ten only because of Nicholson. His hamming it up was ridiculous at points . Besides that this was a great movie, probably the best I've seen in years.
7.0~Why a meaningless and unbelievable subplot? peterportez-1 Sign in Permalink I must have read a dozen reviews of "The Departed" by professional critics. No one, however, has pointed out the utter meaninglessness of the 20-minute subplot--quickly discarded--involving the selling of mysterious microprocessors to agents of the government of China. It's beyond belief to ask an audience to believe that a local mobster into loan sharking, drug dealing, and the usual local mobster fare would delve into far murkier international intrigue. I guess Scorcese must have had second thoughts, too, since this whole sequence was dropped like a hot potato, not to be mentioned again. Further, and oddly, too, the agents of the Chinese government are seen speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin. Was the subplot a big mistake or was it an expensive tip-of-the-the-cap to the movie's Cantonese origins? In any case, it merely further bloated an already too-long film.
6.0~It ain't no good remake and it ain't no Goodfellas. ralphs-3 Sign in Permalink Compared to the original, Infernal Affairs, the Departed is a much weaker film: it lacks a whole lot of style and grace. This not only goes for the directing, but also for the main actors, Leonardo DiCaprio (well, he is at least 'okay' for the very first time) and Matt Damon (who is, as always, eh, Matt Damon). In Infernal Affairs the relationship between the two characters is much more layered en also much more equal: the viewer can feel for both of them. In the case of the Departed there is one hero in a very black and white setting. The greatest disappointment of the movie is perhaps the way Jack Nicholson is allowed to be completely over the top in every scene he's in and do all the tricks we've seen him do over and over again. Why didn't Scorsese tell him to tone it down? All Nicholson has to do to be impressive is walk into a room, he doesn't need all that other stuff (which is proved in About Schmidt). And the thing he does in the porn theater: come on! Since when are wrap-party- jokes put in movies? No, the Departed ain't no Goodfellas.
10.0~nothing except truth majidshafieejood Sign in Permalink hi.i have seen many of Scorcece's movies.maybe from Raging bull to Departed.the best undoubtedly was taxi driver accompanied by Robert De Nero great performance.OK after all i don't want to talk about just this movie.this movie was to some extant like the other movies of Scorcece , but I wanna talk more about the director himself and ... . except a few of his movies ordinary people can not watch the others, because they contain some harsh and aggressive actions like what was in Taxi Driver or Gnag'sYork or they are too long with no particular reason like Rging bull but i or better say we have to confess that he really deserved to get the Oscar prize at least for Taxi Driver,Aviator and now he really deserves to get it because of the nice cliff "Departed".excuse me that I have writrten too much but I wanna talk briefly about another subject;He has maken his films in some how with especial actor(es) during a period of time,that's what happened for Robert De Nero in Taxi Driver and Raging bull and for Leo Di Capperio in Gang'sYork,Aviator,Departed and ... . Thanks for reading my worthless writing.Hope to enjoy it.bye
9.0~Double dealing with a vengeance RJBurke1942 Sign in Permalink The debates will probably rage on for years: Has Scorsese done his best work here? Like many in this forum, I've seen all of his movies. From the aspect of thrills-a-minute, edge of your seat action, I think I'd say this is his best movie. However, as gangster movies go, I still prefer Gangs of New York (2002). For suspense, Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear (1991) beats them all, I think. And, for characterization, Raging Bull (1980)  the movie that should have got him an Oscar  is still without equal, for me. Having said all that, however, The Departed is still the overall winner, mainly because the story is so well constructed and delivers the best double twist  or is it triple?  I've seen for many a year. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to think of a better one... So, I won't be saying too much about the actual plot (the sequence of events), but the story is basically this: two young graduates of the police both act as undercover agents, one as a mole inside the Boston Irish mafia, the other as a mole for the same Irish mafia inside the Boston police force. The story centers around the two moles trying to unmask the other and it's a race to see who gets in first, so to speak. Aaaah, such irony... With a stellar cast of just super actors, this film just had to turn out right: too many careers were on the line, I think. And, it did turn out right. There's not a false note by any of them, with one exception: I wasn't convinced that Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) as the police psychiatrist could be so stupid to become the lover of both moles. I can suspend my disbelief about a lot of things to carry on with a narrative, but that just doesn't ring true. However, it serves a purpose, as you will find out; and that suggests to me that such artificiality was injected for that very reason. But, I could be wrong... Generally, it's fast paced, as I implied, but there are a few slow spots for me, mostly to do with Madolyn with the moles. To keep pace with the action, the editing is quite the best I've seen; the sequence when a body lands, from a great distance, on a city street in front of one of the moles in unbelievably precise, timed to the millisecond, but believably gruesome. Jack Nicholson is just superb as the gangster boss, affable yet entirely menacing; Ray Winston  always my favorite gangster  is an excellent sidekick and trusted friend for the boss; Alec Baldwin again shows his implacable nature as one of the police heads, Ellerby  just as affable as the gangster boss, and almost as menacing when needs be; Martin Sheen, as Queenan, the head of the undercover section, brings perhaps the only honest face into the story; and Mark Wahlberg, an actor I've ignored for a long time, gives a very good impression of a terrier that just won't let go  he's actually terrific in the role of Dignam. As to Di Caprio and Damon, the two young cops: both very accomplished actors and both acquit themselves with very believable portrayals  apart from sharing Madolyn. The only sour note for me was the closing scene, and I mean the very last shot, as the camera pans across the balcony of an empty apartment to show... Well, I'll let you find out. Tsk, tsk  how banal... and how unnecessary.
10.0~Act Accordingly fushnicken69 Sign in Permalink "When I was your age, they would say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying is this: When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?" If there is one bit of dialog that encapsulates what this movie is all about, it's this snippet that appears very early in the film. This movie is beyond great. It is the work of a master storyteller in complete control of his craft. While the excesses of the violence may turn off some (I heard more than a few gasps during the final 20 minutes alone), it shouldn't sway you from soaking in the film. Because if you just focus on that, you're cheating yourselves out of one of the most rewarding film experiences I've had in at least 10 years. I challenge anyone to walk out of this movie and not have it swirling around in your head for hours afterwards.
1.0~The DeFarted deaddogstwo Sign in Permalink I've lived in and around Boston my entire life. I have always been interested to see what the rest of the world (or at least Hollywood) thinks about we proud Bostonians, from the Fenway Park scene in "Field of Dreams" to Daniel Stern's watching the Celtics and Red Sox in "Little Monsters". So it was with much anticipation that I rented "The Departed". You see, I had been plied with much gushing praise from all quarters: my mom, the hipster guy I worked with at Newbury Comics who wore jeans that were made for women, the Press, and on and on. Let's just say that I was a tad let down. Now I've read plenty of reviews about the myriad plot holes, the wooden acting, the absurd amount of F-bombs, and how it pales in comparison to the Chinese film it was based on. So I will assume all of that is given, and try my best to elucidate the rage I feel towards this complete waste of celluloid. First, as I have said, I live in Boston, have for all of my 32 years. And I can tell you that the "Baaahstun" accent you hear from EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in this movie is really not as prevalent as Hollywood would like you to believe. I don't have one, most of my friends don't have one, and the majority of my family (also mostly life-long Bostonians) have only a slight trace. Outside of Gloucester (significantly north of Boston; see the completely different yet equally putrid Mark Wahlberg vehicle "The Perfect Storm") and Quincy (pronounced Kwin-Zee, dood), this manner of speaking is usually reserved for those amongst us who assault people walking around with Yankees caps. That said, the cast's grasp on this accent is tenuous at best, recalling at times Kevin Costner's butchery of the King's English in "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves". Even purported Bostonians Damon and Wahlberg struggle to maintain their comically over the top disregard for the letter "r" (i.e "Pahk the Cah in Hahvahd Yahd", which, if you didn't know, is impossible). Secondly, what is the deal with the gratuitous use of the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter"? With literally billions of songs to choose from, why use the same one over and over again? I have the same gripe with "I'm Shipping Up To Boston" by the DREADFUL Dropkick Murphys. But further than its multiple uses in this movie, it was, and still remains five years later, inescapable: from clownish man-child Sox pitcher Jon "Pap" Papelbon dancing to it at the end of every game in the '07 World Series run to, well, every other public event/radio broadcast/suburban backyard barbecue. But instead of affecting a comically inept Boston twang like the cast, they opt for a faux-Irish brogue. Turns out they're about as Irish as Killian's Red (made with pride in Golden, Colorado!) The fact that this won Scorsese an Oscar for Best Director and Best Film(!) is absolutely baffling. This piece of garbage, better than Goodfellas? Taxi Driver? Raging Bull? Absurd. Absolutely absurd. I watched it with my girlfriend and best buddy, and both of them fell asleep about a third of the way through, leaving me to yell at the TV screen and point out all the obvious flaws to the rare New England air. Living proof that Mr. Scorsese has lost any and all magic that he once commanded. Pathetic.
10.0~Great movie ytoshiya Sign in Permalink Thi is the movie about mafia. They have a fellow in the cops, while the cops have a rat in the mafia at the same time. Each rat knows that there is other rat on each sides so they use brains for treating each other. This movie was incredible, i gave it ten score!
4.0~Nowhere Near Expectations monkeys_are_too_blue Sign in Permalink Before seeing this, I had great expectations. Afterwards, I realized it was one of those movies that makes you think "This could have been REALLY good." How Mark Wahlberg deserves a nomination for those is beyond me. While much of the sexuality and profanity are over-the-top, Damon's and DiCaprio's performances are second-rate, Nicholson plays just another nut, and, as much as it pains me to say this, Alec Baldwin is the film's only redeeming quality in quite possibly the best role he has ever played. Several scenes were tasteless echoes of the infinitely superior "The Godfather" - Madolyn's revelations of pregnancy, the first funeral, etc. In short, quite possibly the biggest film disappointment of the year.
8.0~Boston PD Culture in an Unforgettable Crime Mystery juliana-944-722809 Sign in Permalink Although I'm several years late watching The Departed, I was impressed by how real the film holds up, despite time travel. Brutal language, violence, Boston accents, and culture, and the evil conflicts between the Boston and Providence RI mob gangs, creates an unforgettable Scorsese film. Particularly interesting is the birds eye view of the Massachusetts Police Academy, with anecdotes of how people inside law enforcement live seemingly ordinary lives while dealing with the worst evil crime syndicates in the US. DiCaprio is absolutely at his best playing the conflicted undercover PD agent Billy Costigan, who tries to win the confidence of his mob boss (Jack Nicholson) while keeping his undercover identity secret. At cross purposes is Matt Damon, who is doing the complete opposite, as PD officer Colin Sullivan, who tries to keep the confidence of his precinct boss Captain Queenan played by Martin Sheehan. In fact, Sullivan is double crossing his public trust by keeping the mob led by Jack Nicholson's character Frank Costello, in the business of murder and extortion. The Departed is an adult film, period. Nonetheless, performances by the main cast are extraordinary - note Alec Baldwin who holds the viewers attention as a PD facilitator and instructor for the plot to uncover the undercover agents. There isn't another actor I know of who could execute this minor but bridge building role other than Baldwin. Nicholson's evil intentions carry this film's graphic plot, because his performance as a crime boss is totally convincing. Otherwise, Vera Farmiga is a somewhat ambiguous character who is not exactly likable, but she brings the cruel pieces together in the end, so to speak. I would give The Departed a rating of 10, except I did not like the counseling scenes with DiCaprio and Farmiga - they were not realistic. Yet, I believe, The Departed will stand the test of time as one of Scorsese's best films and a great cultural description of America's syndicated crime culture.
5.0~The most overrated film of all time perhaps? dcw-12 Sign in Permalink This film is so overrated it bugs me badly. I simply do not get how this can be considered a good film. I will detail the problems with this film. 1. Jack Nicholson is totally and utterly unbelievable as the 'hard' mobster. He carries no weight with him, his presence commands no respect. He appears as he is a decadent and overblown 60 year old in a sweater. Yes he does some horrid things to make you go 'oooh he's nasty'. But it all feels hollow, and manipulative. He never brings any menace to the screen at all. 2. I love Leonardo DiCaprio, but Leonardo as a mobster. Come on. Not believable. He also horribly overacts the scenes where Nicholsons character is sniffing around him to find him out if hes a rat or not. In fact he overacts through the whole thing. Was endearing when he was a kid, but now its OTT. 3. Characterization is sorely lacking. Marky Marks character is terribly 1 dimensional and all he ever does is attack everyone in front of him and scream 4 letter words. Sheens character seems promising but is another empty shell who is never explored. The only full and believable character in the film is Matt Damons character. Everyone else seems like a cardboard cutout. Baldwins character seems like a guy out of a bill brasky skit. Bad script, mixed acting, totally unimmersive and unbelievable from start to finish. With no real redeeming observations or commentary on all the violence and destruction we're seeing. Crummy movie and the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Unbelievable I feel like i'm in some Citizen Kane reality where you can throw a bunch of big names in a movie directed by a big name and people will pretend garbage is actually a good movie.
8.0~Scorcese is Back at It brendastern Sign in Permalink The Departed marks Martin Scorcese's return to more-familiar territory after forays into period pictures. This film does not rank with his very best work but easily is among the best films of 2006. Leo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin turn in fine performances; Matt Damon does a good job essentially playing a variation of the same character he played in Syriana, only bigger and broader here. Scorcese almost but not quite reins in Jack Nicholson; perhaps if DeNiro had played Frank Costello as originally planned, the film would have gained at least another star from me. My main objections to the movie are its sloppiness (see the Continuity page for many, many examples) and lack of authenticity. Despite the location settings, it was really shot primarily in New York and that takes away from its efforts to depict the Boston cops and crime scene. Mystic River did a much more accurate job of that. And still, it's nice to have Scorcese back making a picture where his talents can really shine through -- humor, gore, profanity. and moments of real emotion.
7.0~The Departed and Infernal Affairs (Chinese version) comparison reachie85 Sign in Permalink Like a lot of other American films that's of the same genre, this one is filled with shooting, fighting, and killing. To some of us, this film is fairly original; just how the film is in detail, there are plenty of reviews already. However, to anyone that understands Chinese, or anyone who's interested in the original version of this film, I strongly advise you to watch Infernal Affairs (yes infernal, not internal) 1 (2002), 2 (2003), and 3 (2003) (Wu Jian Dao / Mou Gaan Dou). While I would say both the American and Chinese versions of the film are great. The Chinese version offers a greater detail of character development, there is a lot more layers complex that requires viewers to really pay attention to the movie to enjoy it fully. On the other hand, the American version follows the more American trend of such genre, story is completely flattened and simpler in comparison, with less attention to character details, and a lot more action. Since the American version of this film is considered an action film, I would say the Chinese version is a film of art. Depending on personal taste, some would prefer one over the other. If you want to enjoy a good o' American action film with plenty of "blowing things up" to keep you on the edge of your seats, The Departed is for you. If you enjoy the finer details and story of films that hooks you into the movie, then Infernal Affairs are the better choices. Either way, I suggest you watch both versions, and personally, the Chinese version is more my flavor. Oh, by the way, to avoid too much confusion: Infernal Affairs 1 is The Departed, 2 and 3 are prequel and sequel that goes into more details to complete the whole story (forgot which one's prequel, which one's sequel)
9.0~Scorcese does it again nuhc Sign in Permalink What can I say? This is the best gangster flick I've seen since Goodfellas. This movie had me engrossed the entire time and I definitely was not expecting the ending at all. I love movies like that. An all-star cast doesn't hurt either. The acting was excellent, though I think Mark Wahlberg's character was a bit over the top. His character was unlikeable, though at the end of this movie it works out, because the ending wouldn't have worked if he wasn't such a high-strung A-hole. The plot was simple yet intricate. A special unit of the police is out to round up a bunch of gangsters by placing a rat in the gang, only there's a slight problem. The gangsters have a mole working in the police department. I will say that I'm going to have to rent this one again to catch a lot of stuff I missed the first time through. I'm sure I'll enjoy it as much as I did the first time. Go out & rent this one along with Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Casino and have a great night of gangster action.
2.0~Unnecessary foul language and a real disappointment khagenbach Sign in Permalink I had heard good things about this movie so I went to see it. The 4 letter words were non-stop. In most cases this profanity added nothing to the plot. I seemed to be witnessing men with junior high school mentalities trying to out-do each other at how vulgar they could act. I am from Boston so it was kind of fun for me to see the scenes of B town, but the actors' attempts at Boston accents were very fake. The director gave these lower middle class Boston accents to all the actors, when in reality educated people from upper middle class backgrounds, like the woman shrink in the movie, would not sound like that! I am glad that I saw this movie at a discount theater, as I would have hated to waste more then $1 to listen to such incredibly offensive language! Am I am not a prude...I see R rated movies often! Definitely do not bring children, your mother or grandmother to see this movie! I will be disappointed if this movie wins any Oscars...I see no reason why it was nominated for any at all as I thought it was an insult to anyone with any iota of culture!
5.0~Very overrated charlieperry Sign in Permalink Well I was really disappointed that this won best movie. I thought both Little Miss Sunshine and Babel were better. Actually The Departed was the most disappointing film I've seen this year. Having said that I wouldn't begrudge Scorcese the Oscar. He definitely deserves a mantelpiece full of gongs but just not for this film. Poor stories and gratuitous violence never go well together and this was no exception. I'm surprised as well at how good everyone thought the acting was. Anyway if you're thinking of going to see this on the basis that it won best movie I'd steer clear and wait til it comes on TV then record it and watch it when you've literally got nothing else to do.
5.0~A very clichéd movie. The acting is what is so truly great about it. ninjagaiden007 Sign in Permalink This film had got great ratings, great reviews everywhere I went. All my friends where saying it was a masterpiece so I decided to check it out. My theater was full. I guess everyone else heard the same thing from their friends and the internet. The moment this film started I thought to myself "awww jeez, big mistake." The acting was always good through out the movie. So don't get me wrong there. The plot was poorly written. The direction could've been a lot better. This movie was just a big cliché. An undercover cop? Let me name some films right now with that idea: Reservoir Dogs, Sin City, Airheads, The Punisher, Go, Donnie Brasco, Miami Vice, The Whole Nina Yard and much more. There was not one character I liked either. All of them acted childish and just cursed each other or bashing each other up. Believe it or not, but my theater was laughing all the way through it. Everything about it was laughable. All in all, not terribly bad. But, boy was it very Hollywood. Will never make sense to me why people love this Hollywood movie. 5/10
2.0~Don't Waste Your Money grega25721 Sign in Permalink I thought the story line was very hard to follow, and the characters had no depth to them. I kept wondering how they became involved in the story. The movie ended suddenly, and I felt very unsatisfied at the ending, and would have liked to have more questions answered at the end. The movie had an all star cast, but I felt the studio could have saved their money by using lessor known actors, and they would have received the same results. I had trouble making a connection between the Title of the movie and the story. I kept waiting for a surprise that never came. The movie was poorly made, and I was very disappointed,and I would not recommend it.
6.0~Very well put together, but ultimately pointless? khan-busby Sign in Permalink This is undoubtedly a very well made film. It has a gritty realism in style, dialogue and acting. The main protagonists are clearly great actors doing a great job. There is also plenty of action - some of it pretty messy (this isn't a film for people who can't stand the sight of blood!). So why the low score? For me the film fails as there is no real character development. As a result, you never really build any empathy with any of the characters. Ultimately, you don't really care who "wins" or "loses" - pretty much all the characters come across as amoral. So you can sit back and admire the technical competence of all involved, though you won't feel involved yourself...
10.0~Best movie I have seen in a long time mekramer Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed the complex story line and the excellent acting. I saw it yesterday afternoon with a buddy and I am pestering my boyfriend to take me to it tonight, just so I can talk to him about the amazing conclusion. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are perfect foils for each other. They are both equally powerful actors and they are equally good and bad in this movie. The end is a shocker, so if you have heart problems stay away. The audience actually applauded the movie at the end and it was a matinée show. The plot line is really good for people who pick up the ending at the beginning of the movie. I will be surprised if it or the actors do not get nominated for Academy Awards. Leonardo Dicaprio, who I have been a fan of since he was on growing pains, should stop being overlooked by the academy. After so many overlooks, I hope this one is the sticker! Wow, it was a great movie!!!
2.0~Lean Streets amosduncan_2000 Sign in Permalink It's no great disgrace that Scorsesse takes this studio project for the dough; but why does every critic in the country have to pretend this warmed over T.V. cop show stuff is any good. It's not. It's a completely ridiculous and unbelievable story that throws around a few Shakespearian names in a lame attempt to give itself class. If your idea of great cinema is "Face/Off" you might like it, otherwise your headed for disappointment. Nicholson does a credible job with this nonsense; nobody is bad really; though the female shrink is pretty sexist eye candy in this "tough guy" swamp. What else can I say? It would be nice if Scoresse could find something to really apply his gifts too; some of his underrated films (Casino, The Last Temptation Of Christ) deserve a second look rather than wasting time with this one.
6.0~Entertaining but Nothing Spectacular mwendel Sign in Permalink For a movie over two hours long I felt like there was a lot missing. A lot of the story felt rushed while at other times it felt like it was dragging. The movie just seemed to fall flat despite all the talent assembled on the screen. I don't know if it was the dialog or all the plot holes (there are a lot of loose ends in my opinion). I just always felt like I had a lot of interesting characters but I kept asking myself as I watched this film - what the heck is going on? How much got lost on the cutting room floor? Maybe this film needed to be four hours. I would like to see an unedited unrated director's cut or read the original screenplay for this movie. It covers such a large span of time and seems to jump all over the place without neatly putting things together. And the end seems like a desperate attempt to close off as many open plot lines as possible. Entertaining, yet frustrating. I expected a lot more out of this film and I don't really feel like it delivered. I recommend waiting for DVD.
1.0~A disappointment ivanfn Sign in Permalink An absolute disappointment of the remake of the Hong Kong version. It totally lost the spirit of the original version and poor acting from both Damon and Dicaprio. No surprise from Nicholson either. It was a real surprise that this movie could have won so many Oscars, especially Best Director for Martin Scorsess. It just shows how pathetic the Oscar Committee is. I would strongly recommend anyone who really like this move to watch the Trilogy Version from Hong Kong. Much better acting from Andy Lau and Tony Leung with tension throughout the whole movie and full of surprises. Perhaps Martin Scorsess should never have adapted this movie from Hong Kong... a huge cultural difference.
5.0~Even an All-star cast cant save this piece.... hendrikd Sign in Permalink I just saw this movie earlier tonight and all I can say is: what a disappointment! I was expecting a Scorsese masterpiece, instead I get this crap! This movie is long, disjointed, and fails to capture the viewers attention. What does everybody see in this crap? It has the feel of a movie that was written by multiple people, edited to death by numerous individuals. Somehow they cant come up with a comprehensible story. Its a shame because this movie could have been real tight. Poor martin sheen is more like a confused grandfather figure than any sort of important police official. There are tons of things that happen throughout the movie that are never explained and make no sense. This is no Godfather... hell, it ain't even up the standard of carlitos way. Shame on you Scorsese!
5.0~Departed - viewed & comment - Angel-X Sign in Permalink "Departed" I must give this movie a strong rating of 5! The acting was most impressive by everyone. Damon did an exceptionally wonderful job with his character in this movie. Nicholson was his same rare self and played it well. As could only be expected by a man with senior experience and talent. However, anything beyond the talented acting in this movie is not at all impressive. The storyline was a bit on the weak side. The added humor placed within this movie did add to its finished result, but these were on the most part quite slim and far few to say the least. The movie seemed to go on way too long for the story at hand. It reached a point where I was saying when will this end? I must give this movie a rating of a strong 5 only with the consideration the acting was indeed well expressed. ~Angel~
5.0~Dearly Departed alangolgoski Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is a total disappointment. The director and premise gave this film potential but the lack of chemistry with the cast and Martin Scorcese's obsession with casting Leonardo, which transferred from casting DeNiro, has depleted Scorcese's criminal dominance. For anyone to compare this with the likes of "Goodfellas" should be blacklisted. Casting Leo as a "tuff guy" (gangs of new york, the departed) has become the downfall of Scorcese's gangster films. The suspense, wit, drama, soundtrack and overall natural blend was absent in comparison to Scorcese's classics. The film's only element of survival was violence, which there was plenty of (standard in a Scorcese film). Was this filmed in a 2 week span?
8.0~Years ago we had the church. sharky_55 Sign in Permalink "I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me." So growls Frank Costello, king mobster of Boston. He has more words of wisdom for those looking to make it in the big city, "If you want something, you have to take it." The veins of masculinity, morality and identity run strongly through The Departed, as in many a Scorsese movie. But the latter line is actually pilfered from the Buddhist-steeped crime flick from Hong Kong, Infernal Affairs, uttered by Andrew Lau as he shoots the original Costello and ties up all loose ends. He has emerged with his ideal life, taken it with his bare hands, years and years of luxury and rising through the police ranks making this decision for him. When Damon offs his own Costello, it's channeled through impotent rage and betrayal. The gilded State House dome that his apartment overlooks (a rather obvious motif) suddenly isn't so glittery after all. It speaks to the inconsistency of his motivations; how honourable can he be to the state when he was the rat all along? Or has he been lying to himself this whole time? He wants to have his cake and eat it too. You understand the appeal of a father figure like Costello to a 12 year old boy (wow, magazines!), who can have anything in the palm of his hand in an instant, although the character quickly sheds this mysticism in place for for an almost parody of the unpredictable, unstable gangster. The approach made sense in Burton's gothic web of shadows in Batman, where he rose to the challenge of the iconic comic book villain with a deranged mania, never quite telegraphing his actions to the audience. You couldn't guess whether his gun would sprout flowers or fire bullets. But it sticks out like a sore thumb in the gritty Irish Catholic world of Scorsese's Boston, every gesture a flourish, every threat underlined with a creepy grin. Hokey props reinforce it; a severed hand in a ziplock bag, and one of Nicholson's ideas (you wouldn't say no to a screen legend, would you?), a plastic dildo in a grimy porno theatre. Yes, these men sublimate violence for sex and vice versa, use one or the other as an outlet for their desires in the incestuous criminal underworld, but then along comes Nicholson to deflate the whole thing. The same can be said for Wahlberg's Dignam, himself accounting for half of the film's allotted profanity count, and in the end existing for little more than the plot's fail-safe (the deleted of Billy's file and identity lacks the original's gut punch for this very reason). Madolyn gets a better rap. Combining two paper-thin love interests into one, she further presses the issue of masculinity and impotence, serving as a foil to the mirrored leads in a tangled triangle. Notice that every facet of her and Sullivan's relationship revolves around humour and surface intimacy, how they'll be one step away from a serious conversation but hastily backtrack (usually into bed). Schoonmaker edits with a knotty, choppy precision, throwing in flashes of canted action and inverted angles, pilling on smash cut upon smash cut to stimulate urgency, bringing the camera rushing towards its subject before abruptly veering away. Its rhythm and intensity are palpable, drawing attention to the menace that underlines each encounter in the mobster world. See how she cuts the first phone call between the two leads. Not a single word is uttered - the tension is crafted from how she stages the pauses, the silence, the agony of hesitation. Will he answer, and will it mean his downfall? Scorsese's style makes the original Infernal Affairs look like a soap opera in comparison, and sometimes it's precisely that; slow motion, black and white flashbacks, mournful music. The claustrophobia of the Hong Kong setting could have used some of the remake's grit and paranoia. Costigan and Sullivan mirror each other, are two sides of the same coin. That much is obvious. The original script explored this further, and had none of the satisfaction or lasting finality of Scorsese's ending. Lau is doomed to perpetual hell, forever tortured by the path he took and the sins committed that led him to this point. Suppose you live and breath as a cop for 10 years, speaking and acting as if you were the good guy (and telling yourself that everyday). Would you eventually believe the same? Scorsese eliminates this option, makes Sullivan a product of his own unique environment, and then rips it all away from him in one go. He doesn't need to be shot. In the end, his entire world has been built by lies. You'd almost prefer to go the way of Costigan.
10.0~Critical Discourse saintcharlesw9 Sign in Permalink Can't wait to watch the film again to digest it better.Would lose if watched on DVD, without any doubt a film to be enjoyed on the big screen.Well done Scorcese and nice to see that Leonardo has been given credit to play a grown up role.Above all the script rises to the occasion- the words fitted perfectly- complemented by great acting.The script itself makes ideal material for DA (critical discourse analysis).Hollywood would be wise to follow this cinema genre.As much as I consider myself a cinema buff, have been very disappointed these last few years with what's on offer.But in this context, The Departed diverts from the norm
8.0~The Dee-PAH-tid, as we say here. paulcreeden Sign in Permalink Well, where to start? Martin Sheen gets Most-exaggerated-Boston-accent Award. Jack Nicholson gets Most-like-"here's johnny!" Award (again). Alec Baldwin gets the He-really-looked-and-acted-like-a-local-Irish-American-bully-cop Award. No awards for Marky W... he was just playing himself back in Southie. Great retelling of a notorious Boston story. Can't wait to see the one about the Big Dig, Mr. Monahan. I hope Whitey and his brother Billy Bulger got a chance to see this one. I think Scorcese went a little Little Italy on the violence. Too many bullet wounds and not enough baseball bats and beer bottles, the more traditional weapons of Boston hoodlums. A gripping suspense thriller most of the time. A short 152 minutes. It's a shame that Monahan's villains met a moralistic end. Life here in Boston just hasn't worked out that way.
10.0~Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again! Alwood Sign in Permalink Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films. I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions. All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.
5.0~undeveloped jurch2 Sign in Permalink I was really expecting this movie and had high hopes for it. I've never been fan of Scorsese, he always seemed like a guy who trying too hard. If only he would relax and not make movies just because of the golden statue. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with The Departed. It had bad pacing, worse editing, was way too short for such detailed story - constant jumping from one event to completely another, too many characters undeveloped (especially Sullivan). What kind of relationship do Sullivan and Frank actually have? Can you just shoot somebody after a lifetime of companionship? It reminds me of movies about superheroes. Those most likely fail when taking themselves too serious. The Departed is just trying too hard to be cool gangster movie with tough guys with f***ed-up personalities. Altogether, the idea is good but unfortunately Scorsese fails to deliver the whole package. Also, I didn't find DiCaprio to be Oscar material... he frighteningly screams in all his movies anyway.
10.0~The best johnaskew Sign in Permalink Simply the best movie I have seen in the last 5 years If Mr Scorsese does not get an Oscar for this, then there must definitely be a conspiracy going on in Tinseltown, also Leo DiCaprio should get one for best Actor and Jack for best supporting actor. I think the special effects were stunning too, the sound of the Pistol going off next to the lift at the end sounded real. This is about the best I have seen Leo perform in a Movie, I didn't know he had that much talent, However one downfall for me was the interplay and banter between Alec Baldwin and Marky Mark at the beginning, I thought it was over the top. This does not in any way detract from the overall quality of the movie its the quickest 2 and a half hours I have ever spent watching a movie.

9.0~Scorsese returns to a gritty crime-drama with near perfect results. WorkingAuthor Sign in Permalink "Martin Scorsese (the legendary filmmaker) zero Oscars - Three 6 Mafia, one!" The implication of Jon Stewart's words during the 2006 Oscars stamped a red hot exclamation point onto the thoughts of many moviegoers. Hopefully, with this recent offering returning to a gritty crime-drama, the Academy will finally recognize Scorsese's talent. The Departed is a witty, highly original story about a State Trooper named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who goes into deep cover to infiltrate Boston organized crime led by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), an aging, Teflon crime lord. Billy has a dark past and many connections with unsavory types, so he's a shoo-in to get close to Frank. As a fresh plot element, one of Frank's henchmen, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), goes into deep cover as a State Trooper. Here Damon treats us once again to his Boston accent that sounded so natural in Good Will Hunting. Once Billy and Colin discover the existence of one another, it's up to them to smoke each other out. It is in these moments where the movie truly shines. The most tense scene is probably the film's most subtle, with Billy and Colin on opposite ends of a silent phone call, waiting for the other to speak and betray their identity to the other. The main plot is helped along the way by a wonderful supporting cast. After a few years doing comedies and misfired dramas, Jack Nicholson reprises his role as the Joker (not literally, but close), which comes almost as naturally as playing himself. His highly nuanced performance has Oscar contender written all over it. Martin Sheen plays a fatherly Police Captain that could have come off flat and cliché with less camera time, but thankfully, the film gave him enough room in which to work. Vera Farmiga, who played the wife in this year's Running Scared, acts as the romantic interest and the third point in a love-triangle between herself, Damon and DiCaprio. My only complaint with her role is that it exists in a vacuum, having very little to no effect on the main plot as a whole. Lastly, Alec Baldwin, whose making a nice comeback through supporting work after his star appeal dwindled to nothing, and Mark Wahlberg play two foul-mouthed, zealous cops and they are a treat to watch on screen, exchanging a litany of swear-riddled barbs fluidly and with perfect timing. Their characters aren't the most textured, but the actors wisely resist the urge to overplay them. Penned by William Monahan, who also wrote Kingdom of Heaven, The Departed is evocative, witty, and violent. Scorsese takes all three aspects and runs with it, especially the violence. One scene has a character falling from a building and nearly crushing another character while another scene has brain matter from several character painting the walls. A lesser director might "tastefully" keep the gore out of frame or go the other direction and indulge in it. Scorsese simply sets the camera in place and lets the scene play out in one long take. The body count of Shakespearian proportions at the end of the movie will be shocking. I've never been a big fan of DiCaprio's, but it seems like Scorsese is hell bent for leather to strike gold with him. When I think of DiCaprio, I think of angst and caps slung low over a brooding expression. Maybe it's the way he looks. Like Matthew Broderick, he has one of those weird, perpetual baby faces that'll keep him looking like a teenager for the rest of his life. I think, for the first time, DiCaprio has found a role that suits him in The Departed and the gold Scorsese may strike might be in the form of a little statuette that is reportedly heavier than it looks.
10.0~Matt Damon is outstanding Cedric_Catsuits Sign in Permalink This is a classy bit of film making with some cracking performances. Matt Dillon's portrayal of slimy faux-cop Colin is brilliant, probably the best I've seen from him. He alone makes this film worth watching, and I've watched it 4-5 times and intend to do so again. Dillon's adversary is faux-hood DiCaprio, sweating his way through a stressful career stint as scary arch-villain Nicholson's sidekick. Throw in a little Sheen and Wahlberg, mix with Baldwin and Winstone, and you have one enthralling movie. For glamour fans there's the delicious Vera Farminga, throwing a cherry on top of the fabulously convoluted plot. No matter that the story is full of holes and nonsensical, contrived situations. The appeal of this film is gritty, real-life relationships and dilemma. You can smell the fear and taste the blood, thanks to a director and cast who really know what they're doing. Quite why Damon's performance has gone largely unacknowledged whilst almost everyone else involved with the film has collected awards, is puzzling me. Playing such a complex and shifty character with great depth and understanding is apparently not enough - it seems you have to shout, wave your hands and make funny faces to win awards. Well done Matt Damon, in my books yours is one of the all-time great performances, and I'd give you an Oscar.
10.0~Living up to its expectations GucciGirl2 Sign in Permalink Before seeing a movie that has been hyped with such A list actors, one is hesitant on how well they will perform with each other. The Departed's cast blew me out of my seat. Nicholson, Damon, and Dicaprio each brought their own unique attributes to the characters they were casted for. The roles were both strong individually yet were given the opportunity to play off of each other. I can honestly say that this was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. The Departed not only keeps you on your seat but also intrigues you with a great story line. I would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat. This should definitely be considered for movie of the year!
9.0~Departed Affairs........... grey_outlaw Sign in Permalink It would be a shame to compare this film to the Infernal Affairs trilogy, though I would admit that I enjoyed Infernal Affairs(still didn't watch the later 2) but you shouldn't look at this film like it was the finger print copy of the Hong Kong version because it's completely a different film. Yes the story and everything else is identical to Infernal Affairs, apart from the language and location. All cars are running on the same concept since the day they were born, you need wheels to drive you, you need an engine to drive the wheels, you need a fuel to drive the engine, yet how come we got over a hundred different car manufacturers when its the same design under the hood?...think of it like this, The Departed is a luxurious Italian car while Infernal Affairs is a luxurious British car :), the problem is people's taste, not everybody in the world love football. This is a great movie, great acting and the cinematography is just simple and yet so complex. Jack Nickolson is still a great actor, though he did act like he was the joker from batman. If you're going to watch this film then watch it like you've never seen Infernal Affairs and if you haven't seen Infernal Affairs then I suggest you watch both but don't compare them.
8.0~Woot, great film Aggress Sign in Permalink Really enjoyed watching this one. DiCaprio was absolutely superb, he got the role down to a T, Damon was clinical and found him a bit 2 dimensional, I thought they could have shown a bit more of his vulnerabilities to be honest. Marky Mark, was good, but could have had a bit more depth other than verbal fisticuffs. Nickleson in parts was brilliant, you could really feel the malevolence. Ray Winstone, ignoring the accent had the best exiting scene for a long time, very good. The film meandered in parts and could have done with losing 30 mins, I never got bored tho and not having seen Infernal Affairs before was caught out by the ending. Will look forward to watching this again when it's out on DVD. Props to Scorsese, back on top.
4.0~Marty would have won the Oscar if he used trained chimps in this movie... heypally Sign in Permalink I didn't see the HK original, but I was still dissatisfied with the picture. Plot holes, inconsistencies, the female lead (Jack is always fun, but is always Jack being Jack...it didn't work for me here). Damon was monochromatic, Sheen was marginal, Baldwin and Wahlberg were cartoons, (and Wahlberg has had much better performances elsewhere like Perfect Storm). The screenplay didn't use its time wisely - too much time on stuff that didn't matter and too little on stuff that did. It was like a speech where all the bullet points are treated equally and the speaker rushes through it without stressing which ones are really important. Holding it up to GoodFellas, which Scorsese really should have won for, this was NO GoodFellas. (The use of Gimme Shelter seemed like an homage to it). Marty is an Oscar caliber director. But this is not his best and was a pity Oscar. He was going to win it this year even if this was a feature length film about Tennessee Tuxedo. Oh, And the rat on the railing at the end made be laugh out loud. Subtle, that.
9.0~Welcome back Marty and jack bigrichfilms Sign in Permalink Well. The departed is brilliant! I haven't enjoyed a film at the cinema that much for god knows how long. But it's a remake I hear you cry! a poxy unimaginative remake! Yes it is a remake, but it's a remake in the way magnificent seven and fist full of dollars is a remake in that it takes it's inspiration from an idea - a concept - and then the writers, director and producers have gone to town on it in their own style and their own agenda. It is not a remake like the Italian job or the grudge or the wicker man in that someone actually sweated over the script and martin scorsese gave the direction his full attention and all the elements in this make sense. All the parts are well written, a bit quirky and brilliantly acted. I'm sure I wasn't the only person watching it thinking that a hardcore gangster film with dicaprio, damon and whalberg would be a bit BBC3. But they are great. Every character is appropriately cast and completely excels in their roles. It's not "cool" in the way gangster movies are now. It is very low key direction in a way. Scorsese has very little flourish to his shots, he has just gone for one great and totally appropriate framing to another. It is such a pleasure to watch a master of cinema back on top of his game after (in my opinion) the disappointment of the Aviator and Gangs of New York. And to have nicholson back from mid-life crisis/am i over the hill roles in fluffy comedies to doing what he does best - acting his socks off and terrorising you - is a real joy to behold. There are a few potential plot holes that I'm sure I will dwell on when my happiness at having been blown away by this movie will subside and I'll be able to think about it all but everything about this was great! Very realistic and brutal but not gratuitous. often very surprising too. If you proper like movies like they used to make in the seventies (and scorsese continued to make into the 80's and 90's) then this is well worth a watch.
10.0~Who Can You Trust In This World? jzappa Sign in Permalink Possibly the greatest remake of all time, ripe, multi-layered and entirely its own beast, The Departed is a swarthy, vigorous and masculine film about two men trying to live social lives that are the fundamental antitheses of their internal sensibilities. Their efforts loom to undo them, either by breakdown or lethal revelation. The unfolding of their stories concerns an ethical maze, in which good and evil don each other's camouflage. It's not what it's about but how it's about it, which is invariably concordant with a Martin Scorsese film. A densely cached, morbidly hilarious and powerfully dramatic magnum opus of its genre, The Departed is set in Boston instead of, well, New York, L.A., Las Vegas. It starts with a soda fountain scene that would fit perfectly in GoodFellas. What is nonetheless purposefully missing is the basic luxury of that film. Rather than a kid who lusts after growing up to be a mobster, we have two kids who ripen as frauds: One becomes a cop who goes undercover as a gangster, and the other vice versa. Both men excel their phony personas. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan create sympathy and levels of histrionics in the film's early scenes by showing the "bad guy" mingle with top officials while the "good guy" is abused by top officials, the former procuring a high-class condo with a view from the top while the latter's family disintegrates. The plot's white-knuckled impact relies on frail humanity. After several years, both men come to relate to, and crave the respect of, the men they are misleading. There are implicit father-son relationships all over this film, every single male character being both father and son to another to some degree. And the scenario ties the extra knot of each man being validated by just one or two of the men on the side he's benefitting. If DiCaprio's boss dies, who can corroborate that he is actually a cop? Cunningly descriptive tiers of this safe deposit are fleshed out by the customary apparatus of cell phones and computers. When the directions of the two undercover men intersect, will they ultimately arrive on either side of the same phone call? When the police suppose they have a rat amongst them, what if they appoint the rat to hunt himself? Brief subtleties are fleeting but constant in the film's very tight, very layered editing, for instance the consecutive Catholic imagery surrounding a certain plot revelation. One of the informants following another and the subsequent foot chase is an extremely well-crafted sequence, nearly on par with Henry Hill's frantic cocaine-fueled day racing the helicopter in GoodFellas. Both show Scorsese's virtuosity in employing a panicky, hurried camera, sound and music placement and lots of quick cuts. The music---clever thematic connotations in the use of Lucia di Lammermoor among its rampant highlights---is so constant it overlaps. Only as the end nears is there any extensive pin-drop silence, which is that much more intense on account of our conditioning to the music. One of the film's rare silences is that long-anticipated interaction by phone, one of the final scenes before one of the arguable climaxes. It is so intense not only because of who's speaking with one another, but because at this point, The Departed has never been this quiet. It is fitting to gather that Boston blue-collar Irish-American men such as the predominant cast of characters were raised Irish Catholics, and that if they have drifted away from the church's laws, they have regardless not liberated themselves of an air of guilt. Now imagine the guilt when you are concurrently committing crimes and betraying the men who rely on you. Indeed, the motivators in The Departed are the oldest in the book, the notion of one's deepest selfhood, and how it affects each character's deeds, feelings and certainty. The roots of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's performances is that the familiar structure of movies implies that we trust most characters are behaving or communicating for themselves. Yet in nearly every scene in this movie, save for certain pivotal parts, they are not. Both actors channel this racking internal torment so that we can suppose and suspect it, though not see it. They're not sounding alarms to remind us of their betrayals. In that regard, the most truthful and candid characters in the movie are the good and evil men being deceived. There is another character who is entrenched in an ethical clamp, and may suspect it although she cannot for a long time realize it. That is Vera Farmiga's psychologist who works for the police, and who circumstantially comes to know both imposters. She is at first caught off guard by the "good guy"'s brutal eyewitness street honesty in a scene intercut with his unnerving experiences leading up to his seeing her. She is afraid of getting her feet wet outside her ivory tower status quo, but gradually her allegiance is not to her administrator but to her patient, and what a snarled thicket that turns into. Really, the entire cast serves a plentiful tonic of equally ornate and nuanced performances, from the leads to Ray Winstone's deeply felt right-hand man, Mark Wahlberg's becoming rendition of an abusive staff sergeant and Alec Baldwin's cheeky, restless veteran, and to fleeting bit roles. And in an utterly self-assured, spontaneous and Oscar-worthy performance, Jack Nicholson makes Frank Costello not just a godfather, turncoat or show-off, but a crafty and infectiously charismatic man whose betrayal runs so deep with his protégé it's horribly sad. And it's representative of his real-life inspiration Whitey Bulger's betrayal of his loyal and desperately dependent Southie community.
1.0~Wow! You people are easy to please. aeo Sign in Permalink I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called "Internal Affairs." If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese. Why do I hate "Departed?" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio. Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future. Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film. Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best. Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap. That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is.
7.0~The original was not that long, and way better and intense. Hunky Stud Sign in Permalink This movie is too long, and it has too many twists which made it less intense than the original movie. There was no reason to put in so many twists and killings which only made this movie a little confusing and illogical. Even gangsters don't just kill random people everyday. They could have focused on the two main characters, made this movie shorter, that would be a little more interesting to watch. I wasn't sure that this was the copy of the Hong Kong movie until I saw cpt. queenan got thrown from the roof top. Overall, this is a bad copy of the original movie due to its bad storyline. Of course, it had so many famous actors. Otherwise, it could never have got such a high rating, even higher than the original movie.
6.0~good but not goodfellas. come2whereimfrom Sign in Permalink Right lets get a few things straight this is not the performance of Jack Nicholson's career (although its good), it is not the return to form we were hoping for from Scorsese and neither Matt Damon nor Leonardo Decaprio are that convincing as the two main cops. All that aside this isn't that bad a film, there are moments of Scorsese magic, there is a stellar cast including Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin to name a few of the excellent actors here, it has a great soundtrack and a killer script. Sadly it is a bit too long and not as good as 'Internal Affairs' on which it is based. Where it does shine it really is very bright but the flaws hold it back too much to be a career high for anyone involved, it is a lazy 'Goodfellas' at best and a Snatch/Lock Stock hybrid at worst. The casting of Matt and Leo (neither of which I rate as actors) as the rookie cops is an inspired take on the original story but the fact that in Internal Affairs the two cops trying to rat each other out had been on the force for so long gave the film a gravitas that just isn't here. A rather flimsy tentative connection is hinted at by a love interest they both find themselves sharing but it never goes anywhere, in fact her character just kind of disappears out of the plot leaving unanswered questions. Essentially the script highlights, apart from Nicholson, come from the banter between Baldwin and Wahlberg as the two department heads set with the task of bringing down Costello (Nicholson) but neither having access to each others resources. Being a rare 18 certificate means that Scorsese can still get graphic if needs be and he does. There are laughs, winces and tension and enough twists to keep your head spinning. Scorsese has also embraced the technological revolution and made mobiles and texting a prevalent form of communication between the cops and the bad guys and especially for the moles to sneak out info. Without spoiling the end or any of the really good bits I cant really say anymore, just that this is an OK film, not brilliant by Scorsese's earlier standards but worth seeing none the less, certainly the best he's done for a while.
1.0~annoying! chico19891 Sign in Permalink i love gangster films and something with a little suspense but to completely take another films idea sucks and its annoying. I find the stealing of the idea annoying enough but it also copies virtually the whole original movie, infernal affairs a Chinese film. For example near the end the gangster pretending to be a cop gets given a mug of coffee... same as the Chinese film. the gangster betrays his boss... same as the Chinese film. the mob boss is running away and calls his guy undercover and u hear a mobile ringing and out pops the gangster pretending to be a cop... same as the Chinese film. the undercover cop finds a note with his handwriting and a word on it when a gang member asked him to spell a word out... same as the Chinese film. i apologise if that was confusing but i don't know their names! i didn't really watch it properly on Sky Movies!! Its a typical American thing to do... steal another country's ideas (the office from england being another example). the film, compared to the better Chinese one, is a lot more violent. The film is just too violent and too much swearing when its not needed. the reason why i like the Chinese one more is not because of the originality but because of the smoothness of the story... if that makes any sense! the music sells the film! overall i hate this film... a lot! because its rubbish, too violent when its not even needed, pointless swearing, and worse of all its stolen from a better original film! i don't recommend this to anyone. i do, however, recommend Infernal Affairs the Chinese one. i think it came out in 2001? not sure.
9.0~Scorsese's best? Second, after Goodfellas. the_rattlesnake25 Sign in Permalink The Departed (2006) "You've accused me of being a rat twice now, and if you do it again I swear I'll put a god-damn f*cking bullet in your head no matter who you are." Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the greatest director of the 'crime drama' or 'gangster' films that Hollywood has ever produced. Gangs of New York, Casino and Goodfellas, just to name a few of the excellent films he has directed and 'The Departed' is no different. Superbly written, brilliantly acted and a flowing story that is mesmerising. Typical Scorsese some will say. Leonardo Di Caprio (Billy Costigan) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), find themselves on the other side of the fence as one infiltrates the Boston State Police and the other the Irish Mafia, but as the discovery of 'rats' within both organisations arises, everybody becomes a suspect, especially those that are guilty. While Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) play the men at war from the different sides of the law. First off the bat, William Monahan's writing is next to nothing, but brilliance. The slick dialogue combined with Scorsese's stylistic direction makes this film what it is. From the aggressive nature of Detective Dignam (Wahlberg) to the father-like, old-school Police Commissioner Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen), Monahan has the dialogue down to a tee, while Scorsese's introduction of simple cinematography allows the other techniques to take centre stage. Scorsese uses lightning particularly well in 'Departed', just like in Casino, as the darkness represents the unknown, danger, the aggression, the light shows reality in its bleakest form. Every piece of music in the film, also compliments the film very well such as 'Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb' being played lightly over a scene that contains both sex and adultery. However the real brilliance is in the cast, Nicholson, Sheen, Di Caprio, Wahlberg, Damon, Baldwin, Winstone and Dalton and nobody let's the film down. Leonardo Di Caprio (William Costigan) is particularly stunning playing a tough-guy gangster that must hide his past or face the darkest of punishments, death. Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), on the other hand is less convincing than Leonardo Di Caprio, but his performance still doesn't let up, as his role switches quite instantly from the 'collaring-result-delivering protagonist' to the bad-guy mob man on the inside. While Martin Sheen (Queenan) and Mark Wahlberg (Detective Dignam) play there supporting roles, countering-acting 'good-cop bad-cop' exceptionally well. Nicholson (Frank Costello) played the role of the tough-guy gangster quite well, but his character was missing substance and felt a bit two-dimensional, but apart from that, the acting, just like the cast, was superb. Scorsese is quite simply the master of the Gangster genre and while some may say 'it's been done before' it feels so fresh and new to a period of cinema full of horror, thriller and romantic comedies. If this film does not get nominated for an Oscar, Leonardo Di Caprio should be instead for his best role since 'The Aviator' (which was directed by Martin Scorsese as well.) If you're a Scorsese fan you will love all two hours and thirty-six minutes of this. If your not, you will still very much enjoy it. 9/10
7.0~Not as good as Infernal Affairs crapsdealer711 Sign in Permalink Let me say right off the bat that I liked Scorsese's movie but it lacked something that the original had---"Heart". Infernal Affairs had heart. The movie made you really care about the Moles and the supporting cast. In Scorsese's film, Matt Damon's character is just despicable. In Infernal Affairs the same character is a conflicted man torn between loyalties and gains the audience's sympathy. In the new film you hated Matt Damon and felt nothing about supporting characters. It's really too bad. Scorsese's movie would have been better if the characters gained our sympathy like the original.....that was the purpose of the film. And what's up with Dicaprio banging the same woman as Damon? That's just flat out unrealistic and a stupid and unnecessary sub-plot.
1.0~An easy plagiarism lulea-1 Sign in Permalink I don't understand how Martin Scorsese can be acclaimed for this movie while its an easy plagiarism of Siu Fai Mak movie "Mou Gan Dou" (Infernal Affairs". This movie is, scene by scene, an American copy of the original one which you must see before giving any opinion on Scorsese's "Departed". If Martin Scorsese is a great director, it is certainly not thanks to "The Departed", for the simple reason that he didn't have to be creative at all. He just had to find some American actors and translate the original script with his words. The scenes are very precisely the same as in the original one ; He may be better than those who have tried to remake terrific movies like Rear Window, which ended to be Terrible ; still, The Departed remains a remake and must be seen as one.
5.0~Not Impressed - and No, I haven't seen the original David-Hatton-1 Sign in Permalink I haven't read all of the reviews of this movie, but the ones I have read seem to generally fall into one of two categories: (a) I loved it or (b) I have seen Infernal Affairs and this doesn't compare. Well I have not seen IA (although after all of the positive comments I have read in this thread, I hope to soon be rectifying that) but I was still extremely disappointed by this movie. It contains huge holes in the plot and the ending is nothing short of ludicrous. What's more it is over long and really did nothing but bore me for most of the 2 1/2 hours. ......... Spoilers Here ....... How could Sullivan not be considered as the main suspect of being Costello's mole in the troopers given that he is Irish and from the same nieghbourhood in Boston as Costello. How could Costello so readily accept Costigan as a right-hand man given his history? Why didn't the Costello man killed in the raid where Martin Sheen's character got killed not explain to anyone else that he had given Costigan the wrong address??? Did the makers really think that exposing Sullivan's buddy from cadet school as the other mole was worth doing. Not only was the 'twist' contrived, but the fact that he gets killed almost immediately makes it completely pointless. If Dignam was so willing to kill Sullivan without actual proof, why didn't he act earlier, e.g. on Costello??? And so on ... And on a final note: why oh why did they get the fine English character actor Ray Winstone to try and adapt that oh so poor American accent? I could have (begrudgingly) forgiven a phony Irish one (it wouldn't have been the first) but surely it sounded pathetic to a US audience??? Actually, even the US actors seemed to be attempting a Boshton (sic) drawl, and even to my untutored ear it seemed to miss the mark significantly.
8.0~Let's start with the bad points: karlhinze Sign in Permalink I think that one or two of the performances from the lead actors were overrated. Matt Damon, for me, seems to fluctuate between good and bad performances. He was great in The Talented Mr Ripley and The Bourne Identity/Supremacy. But I thought this was one of his worse films. His acting seemed quite wooden and forced, and I don't think he was comfortable in his role of a boyfriend. I also think that, early on, Jack Nicholson showed his age, although he did improve greatly as the film went on. On a positive note, Leonardo Di Caprio was outstanding. He's one of the most underrated and best actors around at the moment (he's come a long way since his teenage heart-throb status) and could quite easily have added this to his best actor nomination in the Oscars this year. This film would have struggled if it were not for Di Caprio. As far as the film in itself goes, I hadn't seen or heard much about the original Hong Kong version and was glad of it, as I could judge this solely on its own merit. It's thrilling, with so much suspense. Who's going to make a breakthrough first? Costello's men or the Police? I hadn't seen this before the Oscars, and at first I couldn't quite work out how on earth best Motion Picture didn't go to Little Miss Sunshine. But now I can understand why. All in all, simply brilliant.
8.0~OK Movie House-of_cards Sign in Permalink I think it was rather too long and the female connection ,Damons girlfriend and De Caprio's counsellor was unnecessary. It didn't do anything for the plot. Overall though very good, even if sometimes the soundtrack did not always capture the mood of each scene. Nicholson as always is very good. Martin Sheen is OK Mark Wahlberg is excellent ,very Funny Alec Baldwin comes across as a dumb ass. Leonardo de Caprios Best Movie ,no Doubt. Scorsese's best for long time ,but somehow he doesn't always hit it off. RayWinstone is always excellent ,showing how he can be a villain in the USA as well. At 149 minutes a little too long.
9.0~Fan-frickin-tastic indyfan2009 Sign in Permalink Raiders of the Lost Ark is the only movie I'll ever give a 10 to, but this movie is as close as you can get to that. I love this movie. This is one of the most engrossing films I have ever seen. The writing, cinematography, direction, and acting are all awesome. It is an intense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. And the ending is of this movie is beyond words. Blew me away. Damon is in my favorite role of his next to Jason Bourne. Jack is great. And even Dicaprio, who I am not a fan of, is pretty good. Marky-Mark of course is funny and great in his part. Martin Scorsese is a fenominal director and made this movie amazing. I love this flick. Kudos to Scorsese. He can make mob stories like no one else.
9.0~One Of The Greatest Movies rickyaaron Sign in Permalink Everybody with any interest in movies, must see this masterpiece of Martin Scorsese. From the beginning to the end this movie shows nothing but quality and perfection. The story is absolutely great and all the actors show their A-game. This movie will be remembered by anybody giving time to watch it, and you should. It is a breakthrough in movie history. Every second in this movie is exciting and the acting is mindblowing, Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Award for his performance. He shows that he can play any role, and he does it to perfection. If you haven't seen this movie, you better do it, you will be disappointed if you don't.
9.0~Scorsese Back in Top Form with a Stunning Cast for an Unbelievably Taut Thriller EUyeshima Sign in Permalink Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as "Taxi Driver" and "Goodfellas" with his latest offering, a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller, "Infernal Affairs". Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan, the now Boston-based story focuses in parallel fashion on two young police detectives who are leading deceptive existences, one is sharing the department's goings-on with local mob boss Frank Costello, while the other is undercover inside Costello's organization and secretly informing the police of their plans. The informant is Colin Sullivan, who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition. The other detective is coiled-to-the bone Billy Costigan recruited by Captain Queenan and his hot-headed assistant, Sgt. Dignam, to infiltrate Costello's gang. Both detectives are loners in one way or the other because they are moles always looking over their shoulder lest they get caught and killed. The movie dexterously goes back and forth between the characters with the linchpins being not only Costello but also a department psychiatrist named Madolyn. She becomes Sullivan's girlfriend and also Costigan's doctor. As you can guess, the destinies of Costigan and Sullivan intertwine like a tightening vise but not without several interrelated story lines battling for our attention. One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic, time-jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, infusing Scorsese's masterful direction and the adept unraveling-by-necessity character development. A stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio's riveting turn as Costigan. Under Scorsese's tutelage for the third time, he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do. If Matt Damon's solid work is slightly less electrifying (with a vocal resemblance to the southie he played in "Good Will Hunting"), it's primarily because the character is designed to be unapologetically covert and a braggadocio to boot. Of course, Jack Nicholson is getting the lion's share of the media attention because he is back in a showy role as Costello. Whether making subtly threatening non-sequiturs to the hapless in his neighborhood or sharing Costello's path to success with his young cohorts, Nicholson blazes without resorting to the scenery chewing we have seen in past roles. As Madolyn, indie darling Vera Farmiga brings an unexpectedly idiosyncratic quality to what could have been the standard girl-support stereotype, bringing not only vulnerability but a guarded sense of adventurousness to her character. In supporting roles, Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan, but it's the rapid-fire profanity spewing out of Marc Wahlberg as Dignam that remains more memorable. Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello's amusingly named henchman, Mr. French, and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby. It should come as no surprise that there are moments of shocking violence as the movie culminates into a series of scenes quite graphic in nature yet thematically resonant to the core story. Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies, "The Aviator" and "Gangs of New York", to produce an incredibly taut, character-driven police thriller. It's aces for this kind of work.
10.0~Intense and Gripping Throughout Floated2 Sign in Permalink The Departed as many as declared as Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. What's surprising here is that this is not an awards seeking film rather The Departed is purely a thoroughly entertaining mainstream blockbuster designed more to be enjoyed than to be analyzed. The Departed has been praised for several years, especially since it's immediate release. It is a great example of the difference that a visionary director can bring to relatively conventional material. The overall premise is clever, the action is gripping, production values solid all around. What really makes it stand out though, aside from Scorsese's style, is simply how much good fun it is. Laughs come frequently and loudly throughout the film, with almost all being character based rather than cheesy one-liners or goofy sight gags. The result is some tremendously smart and snappy dialogue interplays mixed with scenes which give the actors room to breathe and add their own style.
9.0~Scorsese's Oscar Carnevale Sign in Permalink Absolutely brilliant, super performance from every actor especially good old Jack and Dicaprio. And there are no excuses for not giving the Oscar to Scorsese this time !!! Also a good job by the pretty unknown Vera Fermiga who shines among the stars. Scorsese has done it again. My opinion is that this present time mob story actually is better than one of my favorites The Goodfellas. Very commendably. Problaby an Oscar for Dicaprio and another nomination for Nicholson. Its along time since we have seen Martin Sheen in a great role as Inspector Qeenan, Wahlberg does it good to. His role is a bit annoying but very important in the end (say no more). Damon is as always doing a good job but not as remarkable as Nicholson and Dicaprio who really shines. I haven't seen "infernal affairs" yet but after seeing The Departed I definitely have to see it.
10.0~Excellent mix of black comedy, drama, and action asam3122 Sign in Permalink This is quite possibly Martin Scorcese's best picture since "Goodfellas." It may surpass "Goodfellas," in fact. There is an excellent mix of drama, black comedy, and action. It is made even better with excellent writing, direction by Scorcese, and acting by its leads. We begin the movie with a monologue by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the crime lord of Boston, Massachusetts. It then shows young Colin Sullivan and how he begins a relationship with Costello doing odd jobs. When older Colin (Matt Damon) becomes a police officer, Costello has a new informant in the State Police. Enter the mind of Billy Costigan (Leo DiCaprio), a young undercover cop infiltrating the Boston Mob for the State Police. With a family history of criminals, Billy has an easy time fitting in with Costello's crew. He uses paroxysms of violence to show that he can defend himself and that he is not to be pushed around. When moles are believed to be in the State Police and the Boston Mob, Captain William Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Costello are on the lookout for suspicious behavior among their "allies." With both Sullivan and Costigan getting paranoid, the movie goes deeper into the BPD and the criminal underworld. Great supporting performances from Ray Winstone and Mark Wahlberg make "The Departed" a real treat to watch. 10/10
5.0~wow.. sorry it wasn't what i was expecting oodarkstalkeroo Sign in Permalink Taxi drive, Raging bull, Goodfellas, Casino...those Martin Scorsese films i have watched over and over again, every time finding a new reason why to watch it again. compelling plot, gripping character and a solid story from the beginning to end. Unfortunately (and I'm sure some wont agree) this movie only had one, the gripping characters. its almost like having the recipe down pack, and just letting it burn in the oven in the last step, and as a Martin Scorsese fan, i was not happy. Jack, Damon, Mark, and Leonardo all did a marvelous job in the movie, but unfortunately that did not safe the fact that a 2hr and 30min film managed to wrap up the entire story plot in a mere 5mins and 4 bullets. now its not like I'm expecting a long dramatic cliché ending where the good guy prevails, but with all the detail that was put in the earlier part of the movie, you would expect more satisfaction, maybe in the form of detail, when it came down to wrapping up a Scorsese film. now I'm not going to say it was not a good movie, because i know a lot of people have put this on their top 10, but for the quality that some of us have come to expect from Martin Scorsese, the ending was too cut and dry for the endurance of an 2hr rat chase.~darkstalker
7.0~Whether you think Infernal affairs or the Departed was better depends on which you watched first, and whether you are fluent in the languages. bloodandiron Sign in Permalink I watched Infernal Affairs when it came out. I thought it was a really good movie, with an original plot, and great actors. I watched the Departed a few days ago. I think to appreciate each film, despite some people saying that the language barrier doesn't matter, I think its a major component. Some people applaud The Departed in that Scorcese portrays the American setting really well. Well I can't appreciate that because I'm not from there. ALSO a big part of appreciating the movie is letting the plot unfold without knowing what will happen. I watched Infernal Affairs first, so naturally when I saw a lot of the plot and even minor details copied from the original, it raised an eyebrow and hindered the flow of the movie. A lot of things, like the plastered arm and envelope with the crossed out spelling. Another thing I like in Infernal Affairs over The Departed is that it has more contrast in emotion. There are moments of comic relief by the "Sor Keung" character, and, for example, DiCaprio's character in Infernal Affairs isn't yelling and punching people the whole time. The Departed has a bit too much violence and swearing to my liking, even if that is an accurate portrayal of what people were in that setting. To be honest, the biggest determining factors in people's preference of the movie is which you watched first, and which language you are more comfortable with. I watched Infernal Affairs first, and though I'm fluent in both English and Cantonese, I appreciate the cultural background of the Hong Kong version more. All in all, I can't really judge which movie is better than the other because I'll probably be biased, but I certainly enjoyed watching Infernal Affairs more.
1.0~Departed From Good Film-making CryptoGuy Sign in Permalink The Departed, a gangster flick with a twist, is one of the biggest disappointments to date. The film was overly laced with foul language that would make a sailor blush, extremely violent, and overly witty; something that I can look past if the story is there, but The Departed was all over the map. The dialog was forced and without life. The story was predictable. The direction was static. And the writing, well, let's just say I've read crossword puzzles that were more interesting. The only reason I can see why this movie was ever made, is that Jack, Leo, Matt, Alec, and Mark said they would do it. And the only reason they said they would do it is because Scorsese was directing and they trusted him. He let them down. This film has one thing going for it. It won't be in theaters too long. Don't bother renting the DVD either.
9.0~Just an amazing example of cinema ... SpiderbiteStudios Sign in Permalink I was not sure of how this movie would play out after seeing the previews for it. But I must say it is a fantastic movie in many ways. Great cinematic vision, filming, and all of that stuff. Excellent story, even if it does start slow and slow down in a few places. This is the kind of thing that you would expect from Scorcesse. Some moments in the movie make you think that you are missing something, because it doesn't make sense right at that moment, but have no fear, it will. Not a big DiCaprio fan, but I think he actually did a fantastic job. I like Damon in the Bourne movies, and pretty much everything else he is in, so this was no disappointment either. And of course Nicholson is a whack-job, so he fit right in with the character. A few of the scenes where people get killed came out of nowhere ... and when it happened to DiCaprio ... I jumped ... just a little. Mostly because I thought he would be OK by the end of the movie. But I was wrong. Great movie all around, anyone that says different has some sort of hatred of why movies are made in the first place.
6.0~rugby bk352 Sign in Permalink this is a rather minor point in the movie however i wish to make this clear to anyone and hopefully Hollywood if and when they would read this... Americans play rugby (at least in wisconsin and between minnesotans) NEVER allowing for such displays as suggested in the movie... we drink beer together at a kegger afterwards. rugby is the sport of brothers not of enemies. although we may hate each other on the field we are still brothers off the field and respect that honor. something you Hollywood writers shall never understand. you may and shall make fun of my writing and make fun of me (both a logically retarded move) however you shall never have the brotherhood that a rugby team has. you will never understand.
4.0~most overrated movie i have ever seen jtothap Sign in Permalink i was pretty hyped to see this movie when it first came out. the actors are top notch, the director is top notch, the locale of boston is top notch. how could it miss? ah, but alas it does... the story is so unbelievably stupid it makes me sad. nicholson is a major crime boss who befriends damon, a cop, without anyone knowing who lets him know all the "big time busts" going down on while an undercover cop, dicaprio, infiltrates his syndicate while being grilled by wahlberg and sheen. this sounds like a vehicle for van damme or seagal. all you need is some anti-environment oil drillers fighting some escaped prisoners and you have the complete stupidness of this "film" come full circle. i'll admit the acting is great but the story is so ridiculous it makes me want to throw up in terror. the terror of the popularity of this idiocy
10.0~Truly a master piece. Pwns the original Hongkong one. mr-siyi-deng Sign in Permalink It is no secret that The Departed is a remake of the successful Hongkong movie Infernal Affairs. I watched the original one in 2002, right after it was out. I wasn't so impressed then, plus it has been quite some time, so I barely remember any details. But I still can recall the general idea I got. It has a script with intertwining clues which generates considerable intensity, even if several leading actors' performances are mediocre at the best. I mistakenly extended my old opinion to the Departed, and delayed watching this masterpiece because I thought it could be overrated. As soon as I finished watching it, I realized that I want watch it again, right then. It is a completely new movie, spiritually. The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable, but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation. If the original Hongkong movie delivers the sense of cool and cool (sorry I couldn't find another proper adjective, since all what they tried to do is to be or pretend to be cool; anybody, anytime, anywhere.), The Departed is on the other hand all about crime, homicide and deep unrest. Infernal Affairs attempted to get into various profound philosophical topics such as causality, karma, the nature of human being. In my opinion it overextended itself to gain ground for none. The Departed starts less ambitiously and puts more effort on setting up the backgrounds. The psyches of the main characters become subtler and more authentic. DiCaprio's role rooted in the Irish Section with a family heritage being either bankrupt or criminal. This setting credibly fits into DiCaprio's expertise and explains why he is picked to play the mole. Another bold but effective modification of the original script is to combine the role of the 2 lead actress into one, a change proved smart in that it not only reduces redundancy but also creates an convincing love triangle. Even better is the award-worthy performance of its shiny all-star cast. Matt Damon (as Colin Sullivan) persuasively presented us a deceitful rouge cop, especially considering those dutiful roles (Private Ryan~) he used to act. Jack Nicholson (as Frank Costello) skillfully portraits the aged corrupt boss with a strange paternal charm. Vera Farmiga's Madolyn is gorgeous. Intellect and sensual, she is just the right person for this character. And Leonardo DiCaprio, eventually get enough matured to break the Jack-of-Titanic prince-of-charm stereotype, really outperformed himself in his rendition of Billy Costigan. (BTW Leo also did a great job in Blood Diamond, another highly enjoyable Oscar nominee.) In my opinion Dicaprio is the biggest surprise I got from this movie. Some people have been concerned about the excessive curse and violence in this movie. To me these are necessary materials to faithfully depict the restlessness of those who plays with darkness so intimately. The Departed is a timely reminder to the industry that good movies are made of solid storyline and engrossing acting, not of superficial CGIs or eye-candies. Cheers Martin Scorses, Cheers all men behind this great movie. If The Academy won't give you the deserving awards, surely the audience will hold a place for it in their memories.
4.0~OK... I am biased, but it doesn't worth an Oscar jason_sjc Sign in Permalink The Departed was adapted from the original police vs triad thriller "Infernal Affairs" produced in Hong Kong in 2002. IA had always been my favorite movie due to the intriguing plot, the convincing role plays by actors, the subtle meaning behind the movie,and the artistically molded scenes. It had been a miracle in Hong Kong's filming industry. I was thoroughly disappointed when it didn't claim an Oscar for the best foreign language picture. But at that time I knew that it would be remade into a Hollywood movie, and was convinced that it would be as enjoyable. But then I was disappointed. Maybe because the plot was tailor-made for Hong Kong's social background and culture, I just found the movie not convincing at all. The time frame was a mess. The characters were not as 3-dimensional as the original. The ending was a disaster. It's just not fair to compare the movie with the original one, but the Departed doesn't stand as an excellent movie individually. OK, I know I am biased because I live in Hong Kong and I saw IA before The Departed, but come on, you are not giving an Oscar to a movie that's appealing to everyone because of its plot, when the plot wasn't even original! I was utterly shocked when they announced the Departed as a movie inspired by J-A-P-A-N-E-S-E movie "Infernal Affairs". I mean, Oh my God, how could THIS happen in an Oscar?! I urge you all to see the Infernal Affairs after the Departed, which you will surely find the difference.
10.0~Great, greater, THE GREATEST dini-n Sign in Permalink Definitely the greatest movie with a lot of stars in it. When you see the cast you think is gonna be bad movie just because it has a lot of stars in it but that's not a case with this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is great like always he lives with the character, same for Matt Dammon, but what makes this movie even greater is no doubt Mark Whalberg, he is great and different from that what we are used to see him. And in the end Jack Nicholson, well you all know Jack, NO WORDS, he just has to be the best.... like always. So I am very pleased with this movie and I won't think twice about seeing it again. Martin Scorsese has done a great job and gave the real movie liker a great movie to spend 90 great minutes. I saw the voting and I think that this movie deserves more then 10.
4.0~The Departed is barely better than Mobsters with Christian Slater Navaros Sign in Permalink The Departed is barely better than "Mobsters" with Christian Slater. For those of you who do not know what that is, it's a really mediocre/borderline crappy mafia movie from the 1990's. I absolutely love both Goodfellas and Casino. They are both 10/10, no question. Knowing The Departed was made by the same guy and has a lot of good press, I went in with high expectations of that same standard from The Departed. But instead of getting a Goodfellas/Casino quality standard, The Departed instead has a "Mobsters with Christian Slater" (much, MUCH lower!) quality standard. I will concede that The Departed beats Mobsters in terms of acting talent. But that's where it ends. On every other level, the two movies are almost equal. Terrible characters, terrible script, terrible dialogue, terrible story, and no reason to care about any of the above. The Departed and Mobsters are completely on par with each other in these ways. At least Mobsters is better in one way though; Mobsters features some memorable scenes that are hilarious in cheesy way, whereas The Departed does not (maybe 5 seconds of Jack's tool, but that's it). I was honestly *shocked* that a Mobsters-quality movie has been made by Scorscese. What happened to his very high Goodfellas/Casino standards? Clearly, those standards have *departed* long before he made The Departed. Jack in The Departed has to be the stupidest Don in the history of mafia movies. Even stupider than the Dons from Mobsters. He had umpteen opportunities to realize that Leo was a rat, starting well-before he even employed Leo into his mafia circle. For him to ignore all those very clear, umpteen warning signs and just let Leo do whatever Leo wants despite that not making any sense whatsoever, shows that he's far too stupid of a Don to be worth caring about (as is the script). Plus doing everything himself for no reason, which even other characters in the movie are smart enough to warn him not to be so stupid about, just adds to the ludicrousity that a powerful Don could be so darn stupid. Besides all that, most of his dialogue was almost completely incoherent. I enjoyed Jack's acting style which was great as usual, but the stupidity of the character's actions/inactions and terrible dialogue makes it so even Jack's great acting can't save the character from being worthless. Here is a breakdown of the other "characters" in The Departed: Matt & Leo - Generic pretty boys, with no character development at all, and bland generic dialogue throughout the whole movie. Leo did a very good acting job, but again, that does nothing to save the fact that his character had no reason to make him worth caring about. Is the reason to care about him "technically" supposed to be; to care about him because he's pretty? Because that's about the only thing that the character has going for him. Not a good reason to care about him, if that is the technical reason one is supposed to. Shrink woman - Two-timing harlot. *Definitely* no reason to care about her at all. She adds nothing to the movie whatsoever. One of the most worthless main characters in the history of cinema. Mark Wahlberg was excellent and funny, but way under-used. The only interesting character in the movie, and the only interesting *thing* in the movie at all. But he doesn't have nearly enough screen-time to elevate the movie beyond a "Mobsters with Christian Slater" level. The Departed is *easily* the worst Scorscese movie ever made, and one of the worst movies of the millennium. Mobsters with Christian Slater is worth maybe 5/10. The Departed is worth 5.5/10 at the very most. Putting a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in a movie does *not* make the movie into a masterpiece simply because it has a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in it. Although that *does* seem to be the popular belief about The Departed. That belief is wrong. And it sets a very bad precedent that the bar can be set as low as possible and still a movie will be seen as a "masterpiece" by default *only* because it has a bunch of high-paid, pretty actors in it. The Departed is a mediocre/borderline crappy movie that is almost exactly as bad as Mobsters with Christian Slater is. Christian Slater and the makers of Mobsters got robbed. They deserve Oscars for their work in Mobsters every bit as much as anyone involved with "The Departed" does. That a shoddy movie like The Departed received so much critical and consumer acclaim is tragic.
6.0~Well shot, well acted, badly written budd60 Sign in Permalink I don't understand all the buzz around this movie. Sure, it has got a great cast and it also has a gripping atmosphere. But the plot is nothing special - And that is my problem. I don't see why a movie should be "one of the greatest movies of this year" (or even more) just because of great actors. There are way too many twists in the plot and at some point I just didn't care anymore. I hope that people will start judging a movie more because of its content rather than the names attached to it. There is one huge plus this movie has to offer though, and that is the beautiful cinematography. The setting, the colors, the atmosphere - all of that was great. But that does not make a great movie - unfortunately for Mr. Scorsese.
2.0~A chore to watch njdj74 Sign in Permalink I went along to see this after seeing various reviews, all of which said that this was a return to form for Scorcese etc... I was very disappointed. The casting has got to be one of the worst things about it. WTF is Ray Winstone doing in this film? Mostly spoiling it, along with Mark Wahlberg and David O'Hara. Their accents are really, really bad. The script itself had some good parts, had they been given to well-chosen actors they may have been more believable. The only thing I got any enjoyment out of was Matt Damon getting punched several times by Leo DiCaprio, whose performance in this film was the only highlight I can think of. He is definitely improving with age. Its also too long and upon leaving the cinema, all I heard were dissatisfied grumbles, no-one seemed to enjoy it and some people walked out before the end. I endured it hoping the conclusion would make up for the rest of it, but it didn't. Not a return to form in my opinion at all.
3.0~Definitely not as good as the original Hong Kong film yongkiat88 Sign in Permalink Now I hate to be the devil's advocate here but I honestly think that the HK version was definitely much nicer. I guess the key difference lies in the fact that mafia and triads are very much a part of the Chinese social fabric, which makes it appealing to movie viewers. Also, Jack Nicolson did not really pull off the big, bad wolf role that well. He appeared to be more psychotic than evil. Also, what's the deal with his woman companion? She did not serve much purpose in building his character in the show. And there was just too much bloodshed. What's up with all the shooting-people-in-the-brain scenes? However, I must applaud the 3 leading actors (Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg)They did pull off their roles very well. For those who did not watch the original HK version Infernal Affairs, I highly recommend you to watch it. It will be one of the best foreign films you will watch this year. Trust me.
1.0~Disgusting Language jpk476 Sign in Permalink My wife and I could not sit through this movie due to the wall to wall gutter language that Hollywood seems to think adds to the realism and entertainment value. This movie was much worse in this regard than most R-rated movies I have seen. Most people that I know feel that the four-letter vocabulary of Hollywood detracts from - rather than adds to - the entertainment value of a movie. I think that more people might want to watch a movie such as this if it were cleaned up. The question is, how many people refuse to attend a movie because it lacks crude language. There are probably a few weirdos who would not watch such a movie, but most people would probably enjoy such a movie much more without the obscenities. Hollywood seems to be of the opinion that obscenity and crudity equate to sophistication, realism, and entertainment value when exactly the opposite is the case. Hollywood seems to want to create movies that appeal to the less intellectual and more base qualities of their viewers. Unfortunately, there seems to be quite a number of viewers and this includes the Hollywood crowd themselves. They should be ashamed, but I know they are not.
10.0~The Departed cultfilmfan Sign in Permalink The Departed is an Americanized version of the Internal Affairs trilogy from Hong Kong. The film is about a young man named Billy Costigan who is assigned by the police to go undercover and be a part of the Irish mafia and do whatever their leader Frank Costello tells him to do. The police are trying to crack down on Frank and they figure if Billy gets enough information on him that he can lead them to him and they can make an arrest. Meanwhile another cop named Colin Sullivan is trying to help the police crack down on Frank as well, but little do they know that he has been a long time friend of Frank and whenever they come close to catching him Colin always tips him off, so he doesn't get caught. Frank soon starts to realize that he has a traitor among his men and tries to find out who that is and the police know that one of their men is tipping off Frank and they try and find out who that is. The rest of the film is a cat and mouse game of who ends out and top and who gets caught or not. The Departed has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The Departed is a smart film that has a good story and lots of neat twists and turns and you never know how the film is going to end. I thought everyone behind the camera and on screen did a great job and the story kept my interest and entertained me and kept me in suspense wondering what would happen to these characters. The conversations between these characters are very well written and the dialogue between them is very good as well. The film has a nice stylish look and at times also looks gritty which helps give the film the needed edge and feel that it needs. There are a lot of interesting things in this story and while the movie does involve several characters it never complicates the story by throwing in unnecessary side plots or other things involving the characters and when it does it all works well. This film is pulled off very nicely by it's cast and great director Martin Scorsese. For being an unpredictable, compelling and well made film that packs a powerful punch especially in it's last half I would say that The Departed is one of the best films of the year and another great film for Martin Scorsese's film résumé.
8.0~Sublime Scorsese pedofski-radar-cole Sign in Permalink Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection. The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing. While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time. I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently... All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you.
7.0~The Departed hbabe83 Sign in Permalink The movie The Departed grabbed my attention because of the fact that it features Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie is undoubtedly well- written, with many intricacies. However, I grew weary of the obscene cussing within half an hour, if not less. It would have had more of an impact if certain words were used more sparingly. However, Matt Damon and the other actors in the movie do a great job with the Boston accent. This is definitely not a movie you would take your kids to. Although it captures the mind with many plot twists and is very exciting, I would definitely not recommend this movie if the only reason you're going to see it is because you are a fan of Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio.
9.0~Acotrs play "de" "part" successfully in "The Departed" meeza Sign in Permalink There is no doubt that Martin Scorsese's instant classic mobster flick "The Departed" has not been left for dead. Not only has it received lauded critical success, but it also has been a box office monster. OK, I am going to rat and tell you what the film is all about. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as Billy Costigan, a novice cop who goes undercover and poses as a henchman to Boston Mafia Guru Frank Costello played by an unknown actor named Jack Nicholson. Kidding! I was just Jacking you off! Eventually, these 'Costo" brothers' pseudo-relation will cost them a great deal and not much is saved. Dicaprio continues to demonstrate that he is a true aviator in the world of acting and that his pretty face is not always in the clouds. He was impressive as Costigan, his character is likable and made you want to advise him "Billy, Don't Be A Hero" so his life will not be endangered. What can you say about Jack? Nicholson's Costello routine was wicked, wily, and wonderful. Ummmmm I smell a rat! That would have to be Matt Damon who was astounding as police rat Colin Sullivan. Damon was a little damon in this part , but the talented Mr. Damon has effectively played wicked before. I also dirkly digged Mark Wahlberg's performance as the callous Sgt. Dignam. I guess you can't take the dig out of Wahlberg's movie characters. All the aforementioned are worthy of Oscar noms. Acting vets Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone also gave "The Departed" a will to incorporate an outstanding acting ensemble. The only character which I thought was lifeless in "The Departed" was Madolyn (played by Vera Farmiga), the lone principal female character of the film bared no momentous contribution. Before I depart, I must mention that the iconic Marty Scorsese makes a triumphant return to the genre which made him a film director legend. Hopefully for his sake, he will not also be classified as a Susan Lucci legend by losing out on another Best Director Oscar. His nom is in the bag already. OK, I am departing now but don't you depart from ratting on to "The Departed". ***** Excellent
9.0~Departed director? no not at all... agourne Sign in Permalink At last Martin Scorsese privileged his numerous fun with one his best films ever after a period that lot's of cinephiliacs thought he is close to his artistic retirement! now is the time that all the cinema forums should praise on him and thank him for the generosity of his talent and the massive work has done. The film is as dramatic as an Greek tragedy with Di Caprio performing magnificently, as has never done in such a depth and closeness to his role, thanks to director of course. So good as the good fellas with the only difference that the new super actors become mature and brilliantly flourish in this very film and will dominate next decades, as De Niro, Ceitel and so many did in the past, one of director's main assets
9.0~One of the best films this year, despite a couple of flaws. Awakening124 Sign in Permalink Acting: Top notch. Everyone involved gives a top caliber performance and, let me just say, it's so good to see Nicholson being the crazy badass we all know and love again. Even though Baldwin doesn't have much screen time, he steals the show with almost all of his lines. Dialogue: I cracked up more than once, and I felt myself barely breathing the rest of the time. It went from darkly humorous to riveting in a flash, and did so brilliantly. Story: I gasped more than once during the ending, if that's any inclination. This movie's long, but it more than held my interest the entire time so I'm not complaining. So why didn't I give The Departed a ten? It was held back from true greatness by shoddy editing (I noticed at least ten inconsistencies, and I'm sure there were more that I missed since I was so entertained) and a very serious flow problem. It jumped from scene to scene so quickly that I found myself confused a decent part of the time, especially in the beginning, and a good portion of scenes were completely useless. For example, there's a one minute long scene of Nicholson's character throwing crack on a bed and telling a hooker to snort it 'till she's numb that comes out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly. You could say it was to show how screwed up his character was but, trust me, there was plenty of whacked out crap to serve as proof of the villain's madness, so the scene was useless. Despite its flaws, though, it shouldn't be missed. Scorsese does it again with this brutal, dark caper that keeps you guessing up until the end. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. There's one scene in particular, centering around a cell phone 'conversation' in which nothing is said and both characters stare at the phone, simply thinking. If the actors weren't as brilliant as they are, it'd be a waste, but their talent lets you practically be able to read their minds. Simply brilliant. If you're a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Scorsese, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg or Alec Baldwin, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.
5.0~Someone departed from the original joseph-cheuk Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of the original(The Infernal affair). I am so disappointed to see that "The departed"is really departed from the original. The Screenplay writer only read the script and never watched the original. They waste a lot of money to buy the story! The original is much more intense and emotional. I see nothing in this one. I feel nothing to be honest. I think you need to feel something even you are not from Boston. What kind of crime sense they put up? "Micro processor"? Give me a break! And the Cantonese in the movie make me sick! There will have a lot of Cantonese speaking audience know authentic Cantonese. Don't just find so America born Chinese to fool around. Don't be that cheap to pay fly some 2-3 lines Cantonese actors to do the role. The origin is use moose code to send message and use laptop computer to send message not cheaply cellular phone. No skill at all. The reason why Matt need to kill Nickleson is somewhat made up. I don't know why people praise Diclapio's acting. Please check out Tony Leung's emotional but no freaking out. I cannot add more to express my disappointment.
1.0~Why cast these two clowns as the leads? thadon-1 Sign in Permalink This film is a duplicate of the Chinese film Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs is one of the finest films i've ever seen and by casting the clown DiCaprio its an insult. The lead role of Sam cannot be replicated by Nicholson and the fact they changed the name from Infernal Affairs to The Departed is shocking. The basic story is there is a rat working for the triads in a high ranking police position and there is police man undercover is the triads. The two know each others moves but don't know who each other are which makes the film extremely tense and this makes it a superb movie. Also the outfits and characteristics of the original have not been carried over.Basically this is a Hollywood SHAM and although I respect Scorsese as a director, the movie is not good thanks to him, its good thanks to the original. Watch the original Infernal Affairs. It will be one of the best things you ever see.
10.0~The Departed: Long Awaited Satisfaction nmyres-1 Sign in Permalink The Departed released this week, directed by Martin Scorsese, I am compelled to say is the best movie that I have seen in my generation. This is the type of movie that recalls to all cinema effectionados the true reasons why we loved film so much throughout the years. It for one made me realize once again what a real movie is and should be; and understand for the first time all the grizzle that the film industry has been feeding us from each season to the next. Fueled with all the big names of the industry,(I mean Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Walberg); every actor's performance was an exquisitely wrapped, unexpected gift. Certainly Jack Nicholson's best role since The Shining or One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest. I have always been an avid fan of Scorsese's, having fallowed his career from Mean Streets to the present. Like a fine wine, he as aged to perfection. With the wisdom and guidance of his absolute wizardry, he has molded DiCaprio into who may be one of the most well respected artists of our time. It only seems like yesterday I had seen DiCaprio in Basketball Diaries thinking that one day he would amount to great things. That is an understatement. The film opens the underbelly of organized crime, exposing the relationship between what society has deemed the good-guys and the bad-guys. In this world, painted in brilliant shades of black and white, the cat and mouse game that plays out is a symphony to be reckoned with. It all begins with the paralleled lives of two aspiring Boston State Police Force agents. One is the all American, blue blooded thru and thru and the other a hardened, agent reject with a broken past. Both are moles for opposing sides: the Police and the Irish Mafia; each violently struggling to reveal the other's identity. It is interesting to see how this one ends, so I will not give you any spoilers. You can see the trailer at the link posted below . I suppose the next step for me is to see the movie for which it is based, Infernal Affairs, a Hong Kong Gangster genre directed by Siu Fai Mak. But for now, I'm just going to enjoy and savor the taste of long awaited satisfaction.
1.0~Another "Sympathy" Oscar wricketts Sign in Permalink I'm never going to be in a position to win an Oscar, so maybe I just don't understand how goshdarn fab it is to get one. Still, were I Martin Scorsese, I can't imagine not being too ashamed to show my face in public after receiving an Oscar for this claptrap. This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, "Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks." Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer.
6.0~Scorsese can go straight to... tommeekew Sign in Permalink ...the editing room. That's right. Another example of modern film-making's inability to tell a story in a reasonable amount of time. Much like Peter Jackson's bloated "King Kong", Scorsese's remake of another classic would have benefited from a good chopping of 30 minutes' worth of film. Oh sure, Jack Nicholson steals another film with his performance. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg didn't have to go to school to learn their Boston accents, which probably saved the producers a few dollars. I didn't see the purpose of the tug-of-war between Damon and DiCaprio's characters for the female love interest...it contributed absolutely nothing to the plot. In general, the performances were good, the bloodletting and violence were more than adequate to satiate contemporary film audiences. Overall, I'd call "The Departed" another big-screen exercise in tedium. Might as well go and see it. At least it's better than having a root canal without anesthesia.
1.0~Top 10 Worst movie of the year gjbrauch Sign in Permalink Scorsese has very little faith in the viewers' intelligence with his constant use of symbolism and visual clichés. Half way through the movie the repeated killings became "camp" and the audience I was with started laughing out loud. By the end of the movie it had clearly become a comedy for this audience. The final scene, which I assume was meant to be serious, had most of us leaving the theater while still laughing. Perhaps Scorsese meant it to be camp. If so it was a successful movie. If not, I would have to say rather than this being one of the ten best movies of the year it was one of the ten worst. Matt Damon was lackluster at best, Nicholson, while acceptable, still seems to have to do is "Here's Jack" face at least once in every movie, and the director doesn't seem able to control him. DiCaprio, whom I have found generally to be a weak actor, did his best job to date with a poor script. Sheen phoned it in. Wahlberg, at least, was interesting. If you like lots of "Jesus symbols", lots of Devil innuendos - get it? nudge nudge - an actual rat crawling along the balcony railing in the final scene in case you've missed all the references to all the rats in the movie, and finally what the constant cell phone has done to society message, you'll love this movie. If not, save your money. This is not the movie for you, trust me.
10.0~Amazing Cinematography, Brutally honest marriage of audio and video, never felt long for a moment canadianfunkymunky Sign in Permalink Absolutely awesome. I have had a hard time justifying going to spend the money on any of the garbage that has been coming out of Hollywood lately. But I made a serious point to go see this, something fresh from on old familiar face, or wait two, maybe three, or four, depends how old you are. One thing I think makes a great director is the use of inanimate objects as characters. If you haven't seen this film, watch the Boston State Capitol building appearances. It says more with no duologue than some entire scripts do. Some songs are used with more visual themes than others, but the audio counterpart to the eye-popping candy is so intense I just couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. And as for Jack well, very very good, best I've seen him in full tilt since the shining. Many people are saying this is Tarantino Based. I am almost thirty, I remember pre-Tarantino. Well pop Tarantino that is, pre Pulp Fiction who knew about his hits, only a few in early years of high school had even watched reservoir dogs. What happened to him is he's gone Hollywood, who else would take such interest in splitting a feature like kill bill into 2 parts, oh yeah ticket sales, revenues, I say CUT IT! The departed said what it wanted to say, THE RAT GETS THE CHEESE! America today needs more films like this that don't have a happy ending, and expose the dirtier side of "God's Country". Had me from the first scene.
1.0~Ninety Excruciating Minutes Too Long mark_dressel Sign in Permalink A hundred fewer Nicholson raised eye-brows. Make that two hundred. Remove the entirely gratuitous bashing of the Catholic Church - a Scorsese trademark. Cut the first fifteen minutes' pathetic attempt to give the film historicity and gravitas. Excise either one of the two main characters completely since neither's motivation to do what they did - despite the tedium of two and a half hours of celluloid - is at all adequately developed. Did I say adequately? ...and you've got yourself a fairly mediocre T.V. episode of... Did I mention how tired I am of Nicholson's eye-brows? Oh yes, upon reflection, I see that I did. But those who liked this film - and their number is legion - won't be bothered by redundancy. Will they?
5.0~Fantastic moviebut the ending has dragged it down casperlei0324 Sign in Permalink Overall this is a really great movie. Acting, storytelling, characters development The Departed got a lot of good stuffs that gave this movie such a high score at this website. I believe most people can tell all the good parts about this movie from other people's comment, and personally I agree with most of them. Therefore I will just focus on the part that I have different comments with most other people. Yes I have seen the original before, and I might be a little bit biased here, but for me everything is nicely done in this movie except the ending. Of course there are different styles for directors, so some scenes might be more effective than the original, some might not. But I found the ending for The Departed especially lacks of depth. Where I am not just simply comparing the ending with the original. I am just commenting on the ending of The Departed by itself. Seriously, the ending feels like a comedy, it kind of ruined everything that this movie has tried to development in the first 2 hours. It feels like "okay the movie has to end now so let's just blow everybody's heads off". When people began to get shot in the head near the end, most people in the theater began to laugh out really really badly. It is just too sudden and has no emotion. Bang! Bang! Bang!, okay now they are all dead and we don't really care. The only sentence I wanted to say to my friend when I was walking out of the theater was the sentence that they have abused during the entire movie: "what the xxxx". In conclusion, I think The Departed is a great movie before it reaches the end. The ending really has disappointed me a lot, and that's why I only give it 5/10.
8.0~''give me that Oscar'' dermottferry Sign in Permalink As Martin Scorsese collected the Best Director Oscar for The Departed he jokingly began his speech by asking 'Could you check the envelope again??' This came after an extended show of respect from the crowd for a man who should have walked those steps many years ago. It is a fact of life that you aren't going to win every time. But to not win at all with movies like Taxi Driver, Casino, and especially Goodfellas, well, thats just an injustice. As his name was called out it seemed a collective sigh of relief swept over the film industry as finally the man who has battled long and hard collected his award. Scorsese stepped outside his gangster film making home last time out to tackle the biopic with 'The Aviator', with mixed reviews. Although not a bad film, it wasn't the Scorsese we've come to know, and it was time to get back to basics in the search for that elusive Oscar. 'The Departed' tells the story of two men from opposite sides of the law ,undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia. The State Police's aim, led by Detectives Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Queenan (Martin Sheen), is to take down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), who has been terrorising the City for years. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is assigned the unattractive role of going undercover in attempt to do so. Costello's hand is made up of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is his mole in the Police Department. To add to the tension, both Sullivan and Costigan fall for the same girl, shrink Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). The story is as intriguing as it gets, and the acting is superb on all corners, including the terrific Alec Baldwin. Jack Nicholson is immense, DiCaprios improvement away from the bay faced actor continues, and Damon is one of the best actors around full stop. My only annoyance is that Robert De Niro, a man who has forged a great partnership with Scorsese over the years, didn't feature in the film that finally got the great man an Oscar.
10.0~Mark Wahlberg haters ...die akber039 Sign in Permalink I do not get why all these people are saying that Mark Wahlberg sucked in that movie. That was actually one of the movies that he was good in, and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot. The dialog was flawless from the beginning of the movie to the very end, Scorsese indeed has another masterpiece on his hands. I was very disappointed to see all the critics saying that Wahlberg delivered a terrible performance. "F**k" was used excessively, but I haven't seen a good movie that didn't have "f**k" in it every 3 seconds e.g. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs. He played a role that took a lot of balls I guess, and he did it pretty damn well. My favorite line was definitely, "Maybe, maybe not, maybe f**k yourself." Again with the flawless dialog. Directors like Scorsese and Tarentino really capture small talk moments that capture real life perfectly. They give you a different view than that of a happy utopia that so many movies portray. Utopia is bullshit. This movie goes into the heart of human behavior, and gives you a lot of good laughs along the way.
7.0~Hype hinders what could be a good film crimebusterofthesea Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese is the front runner to win a Best Director Oscar for The Departed.It's not that it's difficult to see why, but you feel this film is getting undue credit based on the hype surrounding it. Firstly do not pay attention to the films place in the top 250 list.It is most definitely undeserved.What lies beneath the hype of the film is a good story,well told,but still lacking.This isn't a crime film,or an action film,it doesn't know what it is and ends up moving around needlessly. The story is a good one and with a slightly better script this could have been one of the films of the year.
8.0~Wow!!! clouded_eye Sign in Permalink This is hands-down Scorcese's best film since Casino. I was amazed. Not only at the great storytelling, but at the performances as well. I am No fan of either Leonardo DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg, but they both gave excellent performances. Again, amazed. The rest of the All-Star cast gave performances on par with their best. Alec Baldwin has sadly become a scarcity lately and he is without a doubt the funniest man on the screen. Admittedly, watching Ray Winstone with an American Accent is odd, although he does it well. Jack Nicholson: what can you say, really? Jack's always great, but this is the best I've seen him do in years. Just great all around. I can honestly say that The Departed was the best movie I've seen in the theater in a long while.
10.0~Scorsese's best since Goodfellas! MaxBorg89 Sign in Permalink He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes. The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these "godfathers" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier. By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing). Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance. With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return...
1.0~OMG it's awful! rossvassilev Sign in Permalink This might be the worst movie I ever saw. The acting is bad from all parties (likely the director's fault), but Jack Nicholson's performance stands out as THE WORST--I guess he thought he was still filming "The Shining" because his voice and all his mannerisms are identical to those he used for Jack Torrance in the Overlook Hotel. Matt Damon was OK but even he couldn't save it. If I could give this film a rating of negative 20 stars, I would.
8.0~Who was Mark Wahlberg's character really? finkb9 Sign in Permalink In the end, when Mark Wahlberg's character (Dignam) shot Damon's character (Sullivan), did that prove that Wahlberg was also a mole just covering his tracks, or was it revenge for Damon being a cop killer? If Wahlberg was just getting revenge on Damon, the girlfriend must have given Walhberg the yellow envelope that Leo gave her. But if Walhberg was a good guy, wouldn't he just hand it over to the police? Why would he go and kill Damon and not let the truth out? If Walhberg was also a mole, he had to kill Damon to cover his tracks. I think that it makes more sense that he was a mole... or a rat, as the film cleverly portrays with the big rat crawling on the porch. They are pretty crafty in Hollywood.
5.0~One of the 50 best movies of all time? Really?? Irie212 Sign in Permalink "The Departed" isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly not one of the best movies ever made, yet as of this writing it is #49 on IMDb's Top 250-- a list which reveals far more about the reviewers than the films. One look at the Top 250 is enough to make any cineaste curse transient gods like Michael Bay and the Wachowskis. The list is so slanted toward movies that are both American and recent that a serious list of excluded movies-- from 1919's "Broken Blossoms" to 1939's "Rules of the Game" to 1959's "400 Blows" -- makes the Top 250 look downright silly. How silly? It includes the following, all of which have good qualities but nothing approaching best-ever levels: Inglourious Basterds, The Prestige, District 9, Kill Bill I, V for Vendetta, In Bruges, Benjamin Button, Big Fish, Crash, and an Eastwood quadruple-threat, Gran Torino, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, and Mystic River. (News flash: Eastwood is as talented a director as he was an actor.) Ranking "The Departed" at #49 is particularly strange because it isn't even as good as the Hong Kong original, "Infernal Affairs" (2002), which lands at No. 249. (Foreign films take a real beating on this list, which is why I cite many non-American filmmakers here. The USA is, after all, only one of more than 150 countries producing movies.) "The Departed" at #49 is also odd because it's far from the best work of any of the actors-- Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson, Winstone, Farmiga. (As for Oscar-nominee Marky Wahlberg, all I can ask is WTF. His apparent facial paralysis wasn't a particular handicap in his role as Sgt. Dignam, maybe that's why he was lauded. All he had to do was deliver profanities, but even at that Wahlberg is to R. Lee Ermey as Bud Lite is to Guinness Stout.) It's probably also true (for obvious reasons) that a lot of IMDb-ers have mainly seen movies made after they were born, and mainly American movies besides. No wonder they produce a list as lame as the Top 250. A lot of young people I know categorically dismiss black-and-white movies, which is probably a fair reflection of the number of idiotic fusspots in the world. But if you've never seen Gregg Toland's cinematography, how can you evaluate Wally Pfister's? One 20ish couple I know-- movie buffs who are well-read and savvy-- haven't even seen The Third Man or Grand Illusion or Rashomon, so I find it really impossible to take their uneducated opinions about film seriously. I also wonder if they really are fans. I don't see how they can be if they're not searching out Ozu and Leone and Lubitsch. Ultimately, IMDb's Top 250 is a good list if your teeth need grinding. As for the actual written reviews-- some of which are very very good-- the only profitable way I've found to read them is to customize them by eliminating all ratings of 1 and 10. Try it. It's an astonishingly effective filter because about half the reviewers don't seem to know that numbers 2 through 9 even exist. I just checked an unquestionably average-to-above-average film, "Rushmore": it had 592 comments-- and 452 (76%!) rated it 1 or 10.
10.0~Scorsese Classic arminazizian Sign in Permalink This is as great of a movie as you can get. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most complete movies of the 2000s. The story-line is engaging, breathtaking, and genius. The cinematography is what you would expect from an Scorsese movie, and directing is top notch. It won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Best Editing to back that claim. Then comes the cast of absolute all-stars. DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Baldwin. In today's movies, it seems like every time too many starts are placed in a movie, it backfires, but not in a Scorsese movie. DiCaprio delivered an Oscar-deserving performance, and was absolutely robbed by the Academy. Nicholson once again proved to everyone why he is one of the best actors of all time, as if anyone would disagree. Damon was great, although he struggled a bit to establish himself in accordance to his character's personality, however, he was able to pull it off one way or another and complete the story. Whalberg was as usual his own self, and somehow his personality translated perfectly to his character. Overall, it was a great all around effort by every actor in the movie, even those who didn't receive much screen time to prove that the casting was flawless. The story developed well, providing the essential back-story and taking the time to develop each character thoroughly. Although it seemed as if the ending was slightly rushed (even though this was a two and a half hour movie), the climax with all its plot twists unfolded as smoothly as the director intended. This is a must see movie for any fan of Crime/Drama/Thriller movies. It is also captures some of the best performances by all the main actors, whose fans can not go on without watching. -apologies for not putting the time to proof read this review.
3.0~F***ing s***, this won the f***ing Academy f***ing awards??!?? damnchobo Sign in Permalink First, is it me or is it still the in-thing these days to act tough by saying f*** ALL the time? This movie is littered with f*** every other word. It makes the movie so 80s. All the subtleties are lost by the poor dialogue. As you know, this movie is based of a hong kong made movie "Infernal Affairs". If you have the chance, watch that version. The plot is similar, but it has a lot more subtleties that this movie failed to produce. I'm very surprised that this movie won the best picture and directing. It's an entertaining movie, no doubt, but it's definitely not up to par....
8.0~Great movie, very minor mistake ajassem1 Sign in Permalink This movie is one of my favorites, it is good in all aspects.But I just noticed a small acting mistake: in Billy's funeral, the second after the third fire shoot the big guy who was standing behind Sullivan got shocked by the noise, he smiled and looked a the camera! I think that was easy to avoid the existence of this mistake in such an excellent movie.
10.0~A Stellar Movie geminidavid Sign in Permalink The sophisticated cell phones, which play an important role in the movie, are too modern. They don't match the dimorphism of the movie (Nineties, perhaps?) and for me that was a distraction. Otherwise it is A STELLAR MOVIE. Leonardo DiCaprio is incredibly intense and believable. Everyone, including Vera, who plays the girlfriend and shrink, is good in this movie, but DiCaprio shines. Well, of course Jack does too, as Mr. Evil. Most of them (except Wahlberg, who is from Dorchester, which is part of Boston right beside Southie) butcher and overdo the Boston accent (we don't all sound like Ted Kennedy!) but they can be forgiven. SEE THIS MOVIE!!
4.0~Another poor movie from Scorsese barone01 Sign in Permalink What an overrated filmmaker Scorsese is. I have just seen the film and I was tempted to quit all the way through. This film must be one of the worst film Scorsese has ever made. Worst than the Aviator and yes, even worst then the Age of Innocence, which had put to sleep. The problem it seems is that Scorsese does not know anymore what makes a good script. The script here is simply terrible. It seems a patched up affair of "yeah I like this lets put it in" or "yes this looks good, lets do it". The plot does not follow any logic and worst of all the film and its characters are totally unbelievable like the police shrink who is supposed to love Damon's character and then suddenly, oops, has a quickie with the other "rat" in the film DiCaprio's character, what a small world we live in, eh? Then of course, everybody plays double games, everybody is corrupt and so on all for the sake of convenience and because it sounds good and NOT because the script demands it! The script looks as if it has been written by a film school student. Then of course we come to Scorsese handling of the material and that of course, disappoints too. For the first half of the movie we hare subjected to a mean loud disco music which make the dialogue barely audible but is the overall feel of the film which lacks any class and timing, which is what you would expect from a filmmaker who goes by the name Martin Scorsese.There are simply a ton of bad film-making decisions in this film, too many to tell, think of the final rock song in Gangs of New York, totally out of contest and multiply it by ten. I only save the cast, here Scorsese has cast everyone competently and they all perform to a very good standard for the top actors that they are. My only doubt there being the casting of Walberg in a role where I would have seen better suited an older actor. The soundtrack might do good business and no doubt people who like mindless violence and no plot might find something in this but otherwise don't bother. Not a good movie.
8.0~Shock!! mr_col Sign in Permalink when i finished watching the movie, people asked me "what do you think??" i didn't know what to say , i needed some time to collect my thoughts and be sure of what i'll say them... this movie has everything that a good movie needs, stars , deep script, and powerful story. and what impressed me a lot, its not a typical Hollywood story story, and it has a new type of story closure.. i will call it "Mixed ending" . The performance of jack nicholson is brilliant, one of his best roles ever... Leonardo Di caprio and mat daemon did a great job too. I recommend everyone to watch it, because it's a movie that will be remembered for along time 8/10
8.0~Great movie but my quarrels with it thepiecesfit Sign in Permalink OK I just came back from the theatre. What can I say I love Martin's work. Was not a big fan of the Aviator. But let me say the characters were great. Jack Nicholson stellar performance from him, I love how he is kept in the without any lighting for a good portion of the film. My problems with the film well not big problems but here they are. 1) Casting of Anthony Anderson. I mean okay this guy is from scary movie he adds zero credibility to this film. I think having him in it degrades the quality of the picture. 2) the excessive headshots, okay Martin we get it don't have to knock us over the head with it. Overall the story was very involving and I love Dicaprio's part and the humor attached to the characters. I enjoyed this film very much. Any comments on the casting?? Was Alec Baldwin not serious enough for a captain?
10.0~A Perfect Blend Of Vintage and Contemporary Scorsese alexkolokotronis Sign in Permalink The Departed is a great film to say the least. The film centers around an entire police department's chase of a top boss in Boston. The plot may not seem original but the film gives you a feeling of something new with the intensity of that of a drama and the awe of an action flick. The acting of the cast all around is great with the likes of actors such as Leonardo Dicaprio playing a rookie cop getting his first assignment. As a result of his family's history of criminal activity his first job is to be working undercover gathering intelligence in the dealings of a mob boss played different yet brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. This goes without notice as Nicholson has his man on the inside as well. On the opposite side of the spectrum Matt Damon also plays a rookie cop starting out of the box with a good job though as a result of his honorable family history. There also plenty of great supporting performances by Martin Sheen and Ray Winestone as well as a breakout performance given by Mark Wahlberg. Despite so many explosive performances this film is driven by its story so perfectly directed by Martin Scorsese. With this film Scorsese uses his skill to show the hard and gritty tough life on the streets as he once did so often as well as his fine attention to detail with amazing plot dynamics. What both of these things culminate into is a well rounded and balanced film with an unlimited scope of cops and gangsters. The depth of the film is limitless as it is so well layered. Scorsese here makes the film of his life here throwing out everything he has. Scorsese and William Monahan, who so adapts this film so vividly, combine for one of the most thrilling and psychologically explosive movies in ages as the film so perfectly illustrates nothing is as it seems as well as a chain is only as strong as strong as its weakest link. We may think we know it all from profile and background checks but as long as we don't know whats going on inside a person's mind we won't ever know what the person is truly about.
8.0~Slow and first but then it's a wild ride aharmas Sign in Permalink Scorcese does it again, delivering again quality entertainment that is flashy and exciting but needs a bit more heart. The beginning of the movie hints at what could have done to make it better. All in all, the result is quite a piece of entertainment, with some outstanding performances, in particular De Caprio and Damon as the two sides of a character that is heavily manipulated by circumstances and a Faust-like figure. Damon, in particular, is very good in the way he portraits an ambitious yet hesitant corrupt police officer. He is a despicable character, who still manages to pull a few sympathetic punches. De Caprio is upstaged by Damon a few times, but he is still very effective. Nicholson presents another variation of his naughty persona, with a twist of evil to make it interesting enough. The man in charge is definitely Scorcese, still at his best with material that involves deceit, violence, and plenty of crime. The movie moves very well most of the time. The final 30 minutes are superb, but in perfect and unfortunate counterbalance, the first 1/2 hour is a bit thin and slow. It could have been an instant classic. Instead, it's a very good film. Enjoy it.
10.0~This remake is SUPERB! MorganMan1 Sign in Permalink Another remake, but a good one. The "Departed" is a remake of the Asian produced movie "Infernal Affairs". I enjoyed watching this movie and never regretted going to see it for one second. It was enjoyable and very well done. Sure you could find faults and "untied ends" left loose and never explained but over all it was one of the very best "gangster" type movies I have ever seen! Jack Nicholson had his part down almost perfect and Mark Walberg was great as an edgy, cranky cop on the good. But this movie did one thing very few movies can ever claim; it showcased and proved the actor of the decade, Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes, I would not have ever thought I would make this claim but He has earned it. If you like realistic violence, hard-hitting drama and edge of your seat suspense then this movie is for you. If you like great acting, top notch direction and some of the best story telling in cinema; please see this one. It is the best movie I have seen this year and I have seen a lot of movies. As a rule, I do not like remakes but this one is Superb!
1.0~Scorcese ceases to score Mary-Kelly Sign in Permalink Do not be deceived by favorable reviews. This is a bad movie from a director who has long ago lost his edge. It is a naked king's clothes, the Jonestown cool-aid, an Iraqi WMD, Iranian uranium for peaceful purposes only...all hype, no substance. A suicidal Scorsese confided in friends in 1980 that Raging Bull would be his last great film; he was not far off. King of Comedy was great. In a vacuum, Goodfellas was also exceptional...but, if you think Goodfellas was on par with Scorecese's 1970s triumphs then you should watch (or re-watch) Mean Streets, Who's that Knocking at my Door, and Italianamerican. Goodfellas is a big budgeted, sleek production that rehashes these earlier classics. Which leads us to The Departed. What is wrong with Scorsese? Has he developed dementia? Does he have permanent writer's block? Has his obsessive-compulsive disorder gotten the best of him, again? Why has he lost the precious ability to be artistic and original? In The Departed, the best Scorsese can do is abscond core themes from other great movies faster than Winona Ryder can stuff away apparel at Saks. The Departed, itself a remake of a recognized foreign classic (Marty, didn't you learn anything from Cape Fear?), grabs from far better films like Reservoir Dogs (e.g., the rat/informer) Donnie Brosco (e.g., the undercover cop in too deep) Mystic River (e.g., the gritty & violent underbelly of Boston) See these excellent movies and identify others that Scorsese has rubbed his dirty hands all over. Hey Marty, my version of The Departed has the Tigers' Kenny Rogers shaking your hand and leaving with enough smudge to pitch a few good ones, (at least until Tony LaRussa gets a look).
3.0~Pretty awful...I have to say, I hated it panquin Sign in Permalink I'm giving The Departed 3 stars pretty much for getting the film in the camera, and those cameras' ultimate direction by one of the greats, Martin Scorsese. But I'm being nice doing that, because this movie is really quite an awful thing to deal with. Awful to watch; awful to hear; awful to experience. Just plain awful. Where do I begin? First, the script: it's DOA. I've not seen the original movie The Departed is based on, but apparently the script is tighter than a flea's a**. If so, The Departed does indeed vary from the original in that regard - not Swiss cheese-style holes, but not exactly seamless and tight either. Second, the cell phones. I wanted to laugh out loud in inappropriate places when a cell phone in the movie went off for the 1,000th time. Laughable, and utterly without grace, and if you hated cell phones before, you'll really despise them after The Departed. Third, I didn't care about any character enough to care about what happened to them, whether maimed or killed or something in between. That's not good, you know? That's just about the worst thing you can say about a given story in general/film in particular, but The Departed has not-caring in bucketfuls when it comes to character. Take your pick, try to adhere to the character's base, see if you give a crap whether they're blown to smithereens or not. You won't. Jack Nicholson was ludicrously over the top - a Caligula for the ages who has (possibly) lost all respect for the acting form. Am I saying he's lost his acting chops? No; hardly. I'm saying that respect for the craft of acting has gone into utter and complete hiding. He treated his role in The Departed as a raft of pleasure built solely for his riding, a king both on screen and off, and I could care less, normally, except that Jack's character suffers due to Jack's excesses. And who wins when that happens?
6.0~A solid cat-and-mouse thriller but a disappointing Scorsese's film ... ElMaruecan82 Sign in Permalink Now, this is a film I wanted to love. I have a profound admiration for Scorsese which I consider among the best, and probably the most consistent directors, the one who never failed to surprise me in each of his brilliant movies. But if I liked "The Departed" as a solid cat-and-mouse thriller, I reckon I expected much more from Marty, and the last 10 minutes of the film confirmed my disappointment. The ending : sure it was one hell of a totally-unexpected climax, sure we already had a first taste of the movie's level of violence, but I had the strange feeling Scorsese let himself go with such 'delightful' visual effects -to create the most gruesome head shots with the most graphic blood splattering- that he forgot the story. It was so repetitive it almost became comical. At one point, I was thinking "Ok, who's next now?" It was just like watching a film set in a big city, and at the end, a big atomic bomb destroys everything and everyone is dead. Okay, I knew, this wasn't the kind of police dramas where the good guys would win  I even knew about the elevator scene, but just because something is unexpected and shocking, doesn't make it acceptable. I felt cheated. What's the point of engaging the viewer if it must end in such an abrupt way. Or is it supposed to show harsh reality, in an almost documentary-like style? Well, I expected more depth from a Scorsese film, maybe more poetry. He's one of the greatest film-makers of all-time, and this film left me cold. The cast : Jack Nicholson did a good job, but I would have loved to see De Niro playing this part. All through the movie, I couldn't stop thinking, why didn't Marty take Bobby for the part? It would've been perfect. Nicholson was good, but he was Nicholson. DiCaprio did a decent job too, but I guess I'm getting tired of seeing him always playing tough guys and banging sexy girls, and I wasn't that impressed by Matt Damon: he was good, but not 'Scorsese' good. And I didn't really care for the other supporting characters who were just your archetypal "cops and gangsters". The characterization was OK but would you really compare this to "Goodfellas"? Consider the female characters; their presence was a convenient plot device, using their sexy tight skirts as a foil for the whole male dominant cliché. Where are the Boxcar Bertha, Karen Hill, Iris etc.? I even missed the annoying Ginger, that's saying a lot. The writing : it tries too much, it's too smart, too intricate, too serious, too many characters, too much violence and at the end : no heart, not this emotional extra-push of dutiful sin and tormenting guilt Scorsese used to beautifully depict in his films. This torment I need to find in every Scorsesian character, I found it a bit in Di Caprio, but that made the ending even more depressing because once he died, I didn't care for the rest of the film. This is the kind of originality I hate, just like the Coen brothers thought it would be great to  well, those who've seen "No Country For Old Men" will know. Here, it's like Marty wanted to make the ending impacting in a stylish way, while there was more to do on the emotional level. All style and no substance. And even the style didn't provide this entertaining energy that made his gangster films so dark and flamboyant at the same time. At the end, "The Departed" is just a 'film' with a brilliant premise, and a script so smart every single element is used as a clever plot device: if only 2 persons know about Costigan's mission, wouldn't you guess already that something very bad would happen to them? Anyway ... my criticism wouldn't be so harsh if it hadn't won the Best Picture Oscar. I hated the ending for the same reasons I love old-school Scorsese who made masterpieces like "Mean Streets" and "Goodfellas", but in "The Departed": the bloodier it got, the cheaper it was. And this film ended like a self-parody, relying on cheap shocking effects instead of real character developments, or maybe it wasn't a character-based film, but just a cat-and-mouse thriller, then again, it didn't deserve all this praise. I was talking of self-parody, because sometimes a great director becomes like a label, you insert his name in any film, and it's supposed to be a masterpiece. I read Ebert's review and of course, he went again about the same "torment/moral/guilt/dilemma" analysis. There I knew he was biased, I know Ebert is Scorsese's number one fan, but sometimes this passion blinds him so much he loses the neutrality I'd expect from a critic. To give you an example, I liked "Casino" a lot, but couldn't help but notice some weaknesses when compared to "Goodfellas", a too similar plot line, too much narration, an annoying repetitive relationship between Ginger and Ace etc. Those points were highlighted by Siskel, but Ebert, as usual, started to analyze the traditional Scorsesian themes, the Catholic influence etc. That's how I started not to be influenced by Ebert's reviews on Scorsese, I don't blame him though for being unbiased, he has a soft spot for Marty, and I understand that. Marty remains one of my favorite directors, but "The Departed" is his weakest film, which won an obvious sympathy Oscar. So if this film won the Best Picture Award, fine, but then "Donnie Brasco" should have gotten more attention, because not only does the movie deal with (basically) the same subject, but there is a human dimension, a relationship between Lefty and Donnie, that makes it something more than your average gangster film. And this originality, this heart, I didn't find while watching "The Departed".
10.0~A Classic hawkeye3291 Sign in Permalink I really don't have words to explain this film. It is definitely one of my favorites. The story is compelling, the acting is superb. Hell even Marky Mark gives you a performance that you will not forget. It's amazing! With a fantastic cast to put extra icing on this already delicious cake, The Departed really does give you all you want and then some. I really want to give more details about the movie in this review, but it would totally ruin the experience. All I can really say is, go see it! Martin Scorsese was awarded a well deserved Oscar for his directing, and the movie taking best picture is a classic to be reckoned with for future years to come.
9.0~grabbed my attention from the very start kermit1953 Sign in Permalink This movie was a Scorcese wonder. It grabbed and kept my attention throughout the entire movie. The conflict between the two sides was intense and had me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Leonardo DiCaprio has finally grown up. Jack Nicholson reverted many times to his Joker role in the original Batman or maybe even the movie where he turns into a werewolf. Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, and Matt Damon were fantastic. I think Damon and Dicaprio mirrored each other well. I'm not sure if the small romance piece was necessary. I think the movie would have been just as great without this piece. The movie is violent and bloody, so if you take young children, be warned. I recommend you leave the babies at home and enjoy the ride. Kudos to Scorcse. I definitely will be seeing this one again.
7.0~Gimme a Break! "The Departed" is Pretty Good but Far From Great writerasfilmcritic Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is a fairly entertaining movie, although about 2/3 through, it definitely drags. There is simply too much reliance on cell phones as if, "Oh, wow, ain't it something the way we can call one another at any time and, gee, isn't Generation X really interesting to watch?" The answer is a resounding NO! You get really tired of yet another ringing cell phone and another kid picking up and blabbing away as if it's so important and so "heavy." Leonardo DeCaprio gives an uneven performance as the undercover cop who has successfully infiltrated the Irish Mafia in Boston. He starts out well, especially when he is being taunted by his superiors who are hoping to recruit him for undercover work, but it becomes increasingly evident that he has copied the characterization effectively utilized by Johnny Depp for "Donnie Brasco," a better movie about an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mafia. Even his facial expressions start to resemble too much those used by Depp. At times, his character does hit a sort of stride, but generally, the ride strains credulity. Were I the crime boss, I'd have greased this punk the first time I suspected he might be a rat, because his denials are unconvincing. However, his IS a likable performance, despite its limitations, and I especially liked his budding romance with the sexy young psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the buildup doesn't really deliver, save for an abbreviated sex scene, mostly because the plot doesn't allow it. DeCaprio's nemesis, Matt Damon, the gangster mole in the Boston PD, never gains our sympathy. This guy is a piece of sh*t, pure and simple, and you might expect that he had some redeeming qualities, which he does not. That he gets away with all his inside machinations and is never seriously suspected by anyone in power, once again, asks us to suspend disbelief a tad too much. Jack Nicholson, as the ruthless crime boss the mole often refers to simply as "Dad," hands in a reasonable performance that has been referred to as "absolutely amazing," which it simply isn't. There are one or two interesting moments, such as his imitation of "the dirty rat gnawing at cheese," but he fails to convince us that he is evil personified or incredibly mean and scary. This Nicholson is definitely not as good as the crazy caretaker of "The Shining," nor for that matter, the inspired bum of "Ironweed." He's pretty good in this movie, but not great, and definitely not as good as De Niro or Pacino in similar roles. In fact, certain of the gang members, especially his right-hand man, do a more effective job of exuding pure evil. This is not to say that "The Departed" is a bad film, only that it is clearly flawed. And the ending, jeez, it definitely IS surprising, I'll give it that, lending further credence to the idea that Scorcese wasn't really serious when he made this thing. It comes off as black comedy rather than the gruesome drama of his earlier efforts at portraying organized crime. But something about the ending, however startling, doesn't quite add up, if you think about if for a moment. With all the violence, one is almost tempted to push aside lingering doubts about several developments, but you won't get a chance to consider it until after the credits roll. The final scene sets things about as "right" as can be expected, but it's almost too neat and there is something unsettled here that all the hype can't sweep under the rug. If you can get in to see this flick for a discount price, it's probably worth it, because it is reasonably entertaining most of the time, otherwise, I'd advise you wait until it comes out on DVD.
5.0~if you ever see Hong Kong's The Departed... q-15266 Sign in Permalink After i saw these two movies, it occur to me which one would i choose see first if i have the chance to lose my memory. Since a Chinese guy i am(is it a correct sentence?I literally have no idea ..),longlong time ago in 2002,it just make me wow when i see《Infernal Affairs》(Chinese version of The Departed).like all the film cannot be compare with this one. and as we know,since millennium Hong Kong movies just affected by something and still on the road from worse to worst. i do hope you can have a look at the Chinese version.From my point of view, it is insane The Departed get this high score and good comments.i am used to saving good films in my computer, and The Departed just deleted immediately.Have a good time!
5.0~Gone, pretty much forgotten dan_woodward Sign in Permalink Having seen The Departed I'm The Disappointed. It's not in any way a bad film but it is a bad Scorsese film. The premise of the movie is fantastic but neither the plot or the characters ever really develop throughout. It's just too similar to Infernal Affairs, pretty much a remake, and it should have been so much more. The best part of the film for me was the brilliantly shot pursuit from the cinema, sadly it's virtually a lift which is what the film suffers from. There is too little jumping off from the original and too much retreading. The cast by and large do a good job. Mark Wahlberg's excellent and Leonardo De Caprio is extraordinary, I've never been knocked out by either in the past but they're great in this. Ray Winstone gives the same performance I've seen for the last five or six years but with a slight brogue and there are a couple of horribly hammy Nicholson moments that should have been jumped on. One thing I did like about The Departed is the look of it. It's really beautifully shot and the locations were perfect. If this had been directed by someone else it would have been decent enough but against Scorsese's best films it just doesn't cut it.
9.0~Lace curtan. AHOLDER-1 Sign in Permalink Sound: Dramatic use of pop music and orchestral score. Sound effects were good. The sound was well mixed. 80/100 Technical: Well shot, nice framing, excellent sets and costumes. 90/100 Narrative: Prologue sets up the protagonist and the antagonist. Excellent flow, constantly progressing, peaking, and climbing. We know everything but the ending that gives us the twists. We view this film from both the antagonists' and protagonists' view. 100/100 Acting/Character: Good villain in Costello. You hate Sullivan for the slime ball he is. You feel for the hero. Great supporting cast too. Excellent acting and dialog. 100/100 Did I like it: Yes, well paced and lots of emotion for the characters. I enjoyed Matt Damon getting his ass beat by Wahlberg. 90/100 Artistic merit: the tension and the plot structure are the keys here. Along with the very credible acting; nothing is out of place. 95/100 Total score 92.5/100
9.0~A big, bad, brilliant Scorsese thriller that even gets Boston right. RandomTask-AP Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese turns Boston into a bristling stage for a vicious adaptation of 2002's "Infernal Affairs". It seems an unlikely transition to make: Hong Kong to Boston. Going from a huge Asian industrial metropolis to a small burg that still looks as though half of it was ripped right out of England would contradict the very basis of the plot. Even the trailer fails to give the feeling that the setting is anything more than Pick-Your-City, USA. It just doesn't seem possible, but Scorsese with writer William Monahan bring their whole adaptation of "Infernal Affairs" to life and succeed in making it actually be about Boston. The powerhouse cast (with two hometown consultants built in) doesn't hurt one bit either. This review is certainly not alone in declaring that Mr. Scorsese has just turned in one of the best films of his portfolio and possibly the best film ever set in Boston. Frank Costello is a deeply entrenched criminal resident who has won the early loyalties of Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) before Sullivan rises into the upper echelons of the Massachusetts State Police. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes from a family of screw-up criminals, but he makes it through the police academy before his relations get him noticed. Those experiences and connections get him set up to be the police mole into Costello's crew. Sullivan's and Costigan's very separate paths bring them both ironically closer to one state psychologist, Madolyn (Vera Farminga, a sharp and talented newcomer). Both cops and criminals make small victories until the need to eradicate the other's mole comes boiling over. The hunt is then on, and no audience sensibility is spared as the reaping begins. The cast disappears into the story. Matt Damon is a duplicitous bulldog who slides scams by in a hair's breadth. DiCaprio uses an extensive palate of subtle expressions to make Costigan's own double-dealing troubles tangible. Vera Farminga crams more strength into her light frame than many A-list divas. Nobody, including the unpredictable and frightening Nicholson, is winking at the audience. That is not to say that there are no laughs to be had. Every time Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) ends up on screen he steals the scene by pouring a river of endless epitephs, slang and slander on whomever his target happens to be. He and Alec Baldwin's dedicated Ellerby are both priceless verbal whirlwinds. Scorsese is, of course, a master of his craft. The camera work is never more than it needs to be and he does jarring edits with sound to create a rough feel. Although this is Oscar-level work, there is never a moment that says this is what is on the great director's mind. "The Aviator" comes off as a BBC production of a Jane Austen novel by comparison. He wants the story to blow the audience out of their seats and does everything to facilitate that. This is not a moralizing tale, and the blood flows freely. Scorsese places events in front of you and lets them unfold across the screen. Location, production design and story all melt together. Boston is a difficult city to get down on film. History and politics permeate its often-twisted one-way streets. You can walk from Paul Revere's house past sites of the bussing protests and cross the river to the corporate headquarters of companies that are forging the future of medicine. Ask for directions, and they'll be given with geographic references that consist of Catholic parishes, bars and Dunkin Donuts shops. It's not the sprawling smörgåsbord of interchangeable scenery that LA provides. Although three-quarters of the production was in New York to take advantage of the more economical tax breaks in the Empire State, each location feels distinctly Bostonian. They even get the State Police office building right - and that is one of the most uniquely ugly buildings ever constructed. Places are specific and so are the people. There's no element of camp like Lloyd Bridges's big shamrock hot tub in "Blown Away", and nobody in the film is named Murph. Southie and the North End are dead on and actually were among the favorite roosting places for the infamous James "Whitey" Bulger, upon whom Jack Nicholson's linchpin character of Frank Costello was based. (If you're curious about how such a man could exist in this small city, pick up the book "Black Mass" by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. Stories about the real Whitey are even more terrifying than Nicholson makes Costello.) Wai Keung Lau, Siu Fung Mak and Felix Chong brought that rare new kind of plot thriller to the world with "Infernal Affairs". See the original because it is a sharp modern classic. See this film because it is perfectly breathless in its pace, and it never lets you go. 9 out of 10
5.0~Good story, powerful performances brentsoffcenter Sign in Permalink As in all movies, this one had its strengths and weaknesses. It was a great story, gripping, absorbing, well acted and generally very powerful. The ensemble interaction was right on the money, and though the twists and surprises sometimes tended to outweigh the plot, the movie was not terribly difficult to follow. Among the many strong points of the film, the cast was exceptionally convincing in portraying their roles. Also, the chemistry between Damon and Farmiga, and subsequently DiCaprio and Farmiga was top notch. The entire production showed excellent, realistic story development. On the down side, the movie was somewhat heavy handed and overly gripping, without a great deal of pause. In addition to the suspense and tension, the audience should at some point have a chance to breath. Also, there seemed to be almost no let up in the loudness, screaming, and language. Although we all understand that profanity is a part of reality, it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be the force fed main attraction of the entire story. If the level of communication among officers and detectives in this story is true to life, then one might believe that it is a requirement of all law enforcement officials that their language is always ridiculously juvenile. All of the action characters say the "F" word at a ratio of 1 to 4, throughout the entire movie. It makes one wonder what the actual median level of education is among the officers and detectives. (Among the hoods, it is a given). It also makes one ponder the possibility of the story and portrayals being just as believable and realistic if we were to cut back the language to about one third of what this film offers. (It was done seamlessly 34 years ago in The Godfather, when there was still censorship). This juvenile language aspect is obviously common among almost all current mob and agency related movies. But this installment just seems to go above and beyond. Then, whatever became of the age old formula where the good guys are the good guys without always being abrasive, and the bad guys being the clear cut bad guys? Then, the two sides fighting it out and the ones wearing the white hats win? This didn't happen. Also lacking was the audience's ability to be able to smile and be satisfied with a reasonable ending. In the incidental romantic subplot, we didn't see the truly deserving good guy drive off into the sunset with the truly deserving good girl (as in Payback, of seven years ago). Apparently, street language and an unhappy ending were more important than anything remotely resembling a vindicating or satisfying feeling about anything. Almost like the movie "Poseidon", only with no winners at all, instead of just a very few. Very few movies of this type can attain a perfect balance of reality, story, and satisfaction. Harder still is the one that satisfies all audiences, a virtual impossibility. But anyone who has a penchant for mafia and mobsters, cops and robbers, cover-up and covert operations should see this movie. And it is not for the squeamish, either. To enjoy this story, in addition to the above, one should have a strong appreciation for graphic violence, extreme profanity, and a no win situation plot.
1.0~Hollywood Rubbish jamesjamiesargent Sign in Permalink I went to see this hoping Scorsese would do Infernal Affairs (the original) enough justice for me to class the film as 'mediocure'. But I was horribly wrong. Scorsese instead filled the film with as much cheese as possible. The original was not a gangster film, that The Departed turned out to be. Instead it was an emotional film about the lives that undercover officers must go through. If we'd wanted to see a gangster film, there's plenty out there (all of which are better than The Departed anyway). I was amazed that so many good actors (such as Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen) signed up for this. Anyone who has seen Infernal Affairs would probably feel the same way as I do. If you have seen the original, it would be a complete waste of money and time to watch this. If you haven't seen any of the originals, I would strongly recommend that you at least see one of them. All in all, this is probably the most heavily Hollywoodised remake ever.
10.0~completely amazing... buriedxxmyselfxxalive Sign in Permalink this is absolutely on my top ten list...i went out with a group of my friends and we watched this film and it was absolutely breathtaking...the end was stunning and rather unexpected...especially when Leo's character was shot and the other detective was on the payroll of Nicholson...i love this film...my boyfriend bought it for me for my 16th birthday and i was so amazed...the soundtrack was amazing and the entire film ceased to disappoint...Martin completely pulled out all the stops and this is truly a masterpiece...the language is a drawback in mixed company but the film was so very well-done....i would watch it many times in one day and i definitely recommend it to those who love this genre. you will not be disappointed.
10.0~The Best willkirbyzgurl Sign in Permalink This is by far the best movie I've ever seen. I was never much of a Leo fan but I fell in love with him in this movie and am now going back and watching as many of his movies as possible. He plays an EXTREMELY convincing role as Billy Costigan. The movie kept me intrigued 100% and I was never bored. I knew the ending was coming up (based on the events) but found myself wishing it wouldn't end yet (even though it's actually a longer movie). I consider the movie to be of Matrix style in which you must pay complete attention to really grasp everything that's going on. The movie is complex and has a surprise ending. It does however, explain its title...The Departed. This is most definitely a MUST SEE movie.
10.0~A Crime thriller that will have you dropping your Rs by the end bostonworldchamps2004 Sign in Permalink My brother and i saw the Departd about a month ago, but were not sure that it would much different than the Boondock Saints. We left the theater in absolute awe, as the movie was just that good. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with a weak stomach, or is easily offended by graphic language. Being from the Boston Area, this film was a must see for me. If you are a fan of any action movie, such as the Boondock Saints, or Fight Club, this movie id most definitely a must see. If you are Irish, or are from Boston, you really need to see this movie. Be prepared however, it is on the longer side... somewhere around 3 hours. Overall i think this gets a perfect 10 stars, and I can't Wait until i get to see it again
5.0~I thought that Leonard DiCaprio and Matt Damon were the same person! stoprefreshprint Sign in Permalink I know that sounds stupid, but I came into this absurd (but entertaining) movie knowing absolutely nothing about it and actually watched half of it before I realized that there were two different (but physically very similar) actors playing two different police officers. Until then, I had thought that it was some kind of weird metaphor and that I was watching a surreal exercise on the order of "Stay" or, better yet, "Fight Club". (What a coincidence that "The Departed" was produced by Brad Pitt!) I was attracted to the movie because of my GREAT admiration for "Goodfellas" and "Casino", which in my opinion are the best of the gangster films - sweeping, thrilling, detailed, multi-layered, open-eyed pictures of organized crime to which romanticized pap like "The Godfather", for all of its virtues, can't be compared. (I've watched "Goodfellas" on cable over and over again, and I'm just as fond of "Casino", which isn't played nearly often enough.) And knowing nothing about "The Departed", I watched most of it believing that it, too, is about real-life gangsters. There really was a mobster called Frank Costello, and I assumed that the movie is a factual account of his downfall. My first clue was the cell phones and beepers, which left me asking myself when such devices first came into popular use. Surely not in the days of the real-life Frank Costello, I told myself. And my unease only increased as the story became more convoluted and increasingly ridiculous. By the end of the film, I had thrown up my hands in despair, having realized that I was had. I won't bother repeating what many other people have said about the film's plot holes, loose ends and incredible situations. I'll just say this, that it just goes to show you that even a great director like Martin Scorsese, intimately familiar with the workings of the underworld, can come up with surreal nonsense when he puts his mind to it, and when he doesn't have the real world to base his logic on. PS: Speaking of surrealism, I read on Wikipedia that the real-life "Frank Costello is the godfather to ABC reporter and FBI Assistant Director for the Office of Public Affairs John Miller, whose father and Costello were close friends." Talk about life imitating art failing to imitate life!
2.0~Ching Chong Chinese American Gangster?? recordplayer Sign in Permalink Excuse my poor English in this review yet I am addressing everyone to excuse the embarrassing and irrelevant Chinese dialog and characters in this film. Before I divulge as to why this disastrous verdict for The Departed - much of what was going through my mind was not only Asians. The annoying coincidence of romance with the same woman between the 2 protagonists (shallow plot), DiCaprio's identical acting to Blood Diamond (research boys?), same body language and facial expressions... (too easy), Jack Nicholson was someone you really aren't scared of... and Matt Damon was just a dumb a**...long drawn out scenes made the whole film slow and dry...weak acting from the Psychaitrist. OK back to the Triads. I could not get over the fact that they used American Chinese guys to play the supposed local Chinese triads. Their Chinese dialog was atrocious and embarrassing.Like Westerners trying to talk Cantonese. Did they run out of people to hire?? Whoever wrote the Chinese dialog part of that scene should be sacked. Very unlocal Chinese pronounciation the Chinese right and the dialog was like formal Chinese. Can you believe there was NO swearing at all???!!!... Weak. So if they had such a bad Chinese accent, why speak Chinese at all? They are obviously brought up in the USA. Sigh, another sad moment in a US film. That killed the film completely. My advise is to go see Infernal Affairs and realize that the original film is smart, original, very intense and at least you did not want the film to end!
10.0~Frame It...It's a Masterpiece. richmoves Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. Martin Scorcese's at the top of his game here. The cast is perfect. Alec Baldwin has scene stealing support role that he totally nails. The cinematography is faultless. The editing is spot-on. The sound is fantastic. The music is fresh and unexpected. The writing is sharp, full of whit and humor. Very good character development. The situations are involving and plausible. The story has a great forward momentum that never lets up. Everyone involved seems like they are so into making really good work here. Not one performance is lacking. The ending is great.This movie should be the box-office smash that Scorcese hopes it will be. I don't know how involved Brad Pitt was as a producer, but this film will definitely make it's $60 million production budget back, no doubt. If you like this genre of film, do yourself a favor and see how it's done r-i-g-h-t by checking out this film. Grade AA good stuff this time around from Mr. Scorcese. Bravo!
7.0~Quite good, too long, fine movie and acting. gazzo-2 Sign in Permalink This was a return to the old Marty S. universe of Goodfellahs and Casino, it's in between'em as far's how good it is. I really liked it-Leo, Damon, Jaack, Marky Mark-all good. Sheen and Alec B have smallish roles but are fine too. Boston locales are top-notch, the movie takes the great HK Internal Affairs flick and tosses the Whitey Bulger angle into the mix, complete w/ the FBI informant stuff and corrupt cops aspect. There were only a couple things 'wrong' with it from my point of view. One-it's about 20 minutes or so too long. The whole double-romance between the cop shrink and Damon/Leo is too cute by half(c'mon...it's Hollywood I know but still...), and slows down the pace after a fast first hour or so. Two-You don't wanna see Leo wind up dead. He was the heart of this movie, somehow that whole OK Corral finale at the elevator reminded me of 'Face Off' if anything. Not terribly believable. Three-Marky Mark bagging Matt Damon at the end-I liked it, but that's still sorta too neat. Good movie though pretty much. I do like this movie though, the character actors and the lot are solid. This will do well w/ the Academy, no idea if it wins. *** outta **** at least.
10.0~I'm voting for it but I can't find the 11 on the scale. joshua21-3 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese's "The Departed" is by far the best film of 2006. Winner of four Academy Awards, it is a work of pure genius and great film-making skills from all departments. Director Martin Scorcese shows his most thrilling and wonderful talents as director of this wonderful film. It follows a Colin Sullivan, played with much ease by Matt Damon, who is taken in by the notorious L-Street mobster Frank Costello, played by the remarkable Jack Nicholson. At the same time that Sullivan infiltrates the Boston State Police Department, a Billy Costigan, in Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance ever, rises up in the ranks of the police and infiltrates Costello's underworld. Costigan must face the dangers of leading a double life every day as well as confrontations with Sergeant Dignam, played exceptionally well by Mark Wahlberg, and is mentored by Officer Queenan, played by the always great Martin Sheen. Trouble ensues as the plot twists and turns in every single direction. With one thrilling scene after another, this film is remarkable in every single way, and will stay that way forever.
8.0~Action movie, with the good guys and bad guys exposed right away visualtrip Sign in Permalink The movie was predictable, even the ending. Acting was excellent and made the movie enjoyable. Directing was OK, but editing was at times choppy. I enjoyed watching the movie even while it had no value other than for entertainment. Good cops vs bad cops. With so much death I kept thinking of Pulp Fiction.... If this is the routine work of police at these type of jobs I wonder what type of people are drawn to it. The jobs certainly would not be for for the peaceful, live-and-let-live people I seem to know. I don't personally know any cops and wonder how much of this movie's carieer presentations can be considered to be accurate.
8.0~The Departed - Professor Scorsese teaches us all a lesson MovieZoo Sign in Permalink If you think this is the usual blood and guts gangster movie, you will be wrong. But I do not think you will be disappointed. There is so much more to this movie as long as you can put up with fiendishly clever and excessive, blood, guts, swearing and downright beautiful acting, writing, direction, camera work in an incomparable style that will be hard to beat at the next Oscar awards. It's easy to say that the people going to this movie want to see at least one of the numerous famous actors. By far the best was Nicholson, but for the rest, everyone very nearly as great, they were nose to nose at the finish line. I want you to know that I have not been a big fan of the grown but still young brat pack, Dicaprio, Wahlberg and Damon, but I am now a believer and no one twisted my arm. Seriously, everyone in this movie performed extremely well. If you have something against "blood and guts" movies and decide not to go, the choice you make will deprive you of the best group performance I have seen in a long time. The acting is very stylistic and sometimes comically over-the-top. The writing and camera work will almost make the normal mystery buff drool for more. And now, for the master himself, Martin Scorsese. Bravo! The way you manipulated the characters, drained the Red Cross of every last drop of their reserve and yet managed to make the story so easy to follow despite its surprises was sheer genius. On top of that, this was an extremely fun movie to try to figure out. When I knew there was going to be a twist, I was surprised each time how you tricked me. I suspect Jack has taken you to the dark side. Good move! Great movie!! I do not give bloody movies a 10, so giving it an 8 of 10, you can see how nearly perfect this movie was.
4.0~Great movie, great adaptation but hardly original yng10 Sign in Permalink All in all, this was a very well-executed movie and well-adapted from the original 2002 HK movie "Infernal Affairs" but it's still not an original movie. With such a brilliant director working on an originally excellent HK movie to bring it to silver screens in America, it is hard to see how it would not be a movie that would capture audiences. That said, it is much better done that other US adaptations/clones of Asian movies such as The Lake House (Korea's Il Mare in 2000), The Ring, The Grudge, Dark Water etc. I still hope that there will be an adaptation of Infernal Affairs II and III done.
3.0~It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA. bradbahmanpour Sign in Permalink It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA. I can't believe how Hollywood treat the audience. Lots of scenes, dialogues or even acting was the exact same as the original. Even most of the locations was the exact same as the original. The only different was the Hollywood ending. I am very very very disappointed, we can be more creative, this is very sad !!!!! I don't believe the screen play writer hadn't watched the original Infernal Affairs while writing the Departed screen play. I am sure everybody in the cast and of course the writer and Director had watched the Original for at least 10 times if not 100 times. The actors delivered the same exact emotions and writer and director just Americanized the story. Add some sex scene. Add few sub plots not related to the story and a happy resolution in the ending. Come on guys you can be a little more creative with 90 Million dollars budget. The other sad thing is how films are sold and marketed using actor names and not the story line. Infernal Affairs and Departed are great example of this. The Original Infernal Affairs when screened in US just made $89.6K, because in US there are very few people that watch anything made outside Hollywood. Departed made $289 Million by using the same story, plot, character and even dialogue, they just changed the actors and put the known actors and it made close to $ 300 Million . What can I say Viva Hollywood. Brad Bahmanpour
10.0~Scorsese + DiCaprio = Amazing... Three Times Over Tyler_Seymour_Wallach Sign in Permalink So, I've seen this movie for the second time, and it is still as effective as the 1st time I saw it, about 3 months ago. This is a recommended watch to all fans of either : Martin Scorsese, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Great Gangster Film or Great Cinema in General. In Martin Scorsese's 3rd film of this decade and 3rd straight film starring Leonardo DiCaprio he delivers only as he could. Leo and him have shown that they are an unstoppable force in the film industry, throwing out their (most likely) 3rd straight Best Picture contender. William Monahan does an excellent job adapting this film from the original Japanese films the Internam Affair Trilogy. He did such a great job recreating this film for America and other audiences alike. The most unlikely of events happened, the audience and critics alike loved this remake, unlike so many other films that failed to reach that goal. Combining the best of the best from the trilogy, he creates 1 of the Best Adapted Screenplays of the Year. Surprisingly this is only his 2nd screenplay written in his career (the 1st being Kingdom of Heaven). Though the fact that this film contains vituperation, it is astounding the potency is not lost or even degraded in the process. Mr. Scorsese's direction of this transcending cinematic masterpiece. He has total control of such a mob-thriller for the 1st time since Goodfellas and boy does he make it count. With perfectly placed violence, excellent pacing and fantastic scenes of intensity, it is no wonder why he is 1 of the moguls of Direction, for last generation, this generation and hopefully for the next generation to come. This is probably the 1st time I have ever mentioned this but, Ellen Lewis has done an amazing job casting the perfect actors for the roles they were placed. The best cast I have come across in a long time, and all thanks to Madame Lewis. After re watching this film I finally see what was so good about Mark Wahlberg. He does a really good job, but still, is #3 or #4 from the film, in my opinion. Though he does a great job with his anger and rage it is more surprising that in his midst of rage he is hilarious as well. The perfect combination, glad to see others enjoy his performances as well. Vera Farmiga is having her breakthrough year with 2 great performances, the other being in Running Scared. She is the extra subplot in the film, and could've been left out, but without her the emotional longevity is much less effective. She has great facial expressions and good use of tone in her lines. Nothing too spectacular, and in my personal opinion, she was better in her other film of 2006. Matt Damon, everyones precursor for Best Actor in a Leading Role in the summer, and now, is not in anyone's mind or on anyone's lists. Sadly overshadowed by 2 or 3 other men in the film did nothing for his performance. He was good, great portrayal of emotions, fantastic important scenes of tension, but for some reason, I felt it could've been stronger. Not saying he doesn't do a good job, but he could've expressed more rage in certain scenes, and more depression is other crucial scenes as well. Anyways, despite being under minded throughout the whole Award Season, he still her 1 of the better performances of the year. The funniest performance of the film easily comes to Ray Winstone who is also having a great year, starring in Breaking and Entering, The Propostion and the TV version of Sweeney Todd. He does a great job as Mr.French, delivering every scene with either a great punchline or a wonderful scene of emotion or action. Jack Nicholson is the most experienced actor of the lot, the Grandfather of Cinema some say. His performance was no less that excellent, playing Frank Costello a modern bad guy and a memorable character for years to come. He stole a lot of the scenes he was in and rightfully so. The fact that his performance was able to convince many that he was the character is fantastic. Many solid scenes, some funny, some intense but mostly all effective. Leonardo DiCaprio, the best performance in the film without a doubt, proving he will be 1 of the Best Actors in years to come. Teaming up with Martin Scorsese is the best thing he's ever done, and it has made him a sensational success. His performance is 1 to be reckoned with at the Oscars, due to the fact that he massively exceeds expectations, and if it weren't for Forest Whittaker, he would quite possibly be the #1 contender for the coveted prize. I am definitely looking forward to The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt when it is released in 2008, marking ScoCaprio's 4th collaboration this decade. The film editing of this movie is very significant in the pacing of the film, seeing as the 150 minutes passed by seamlessly due to it. The score is very beautiful, but yet, does not make my list for Best Original Score, though it is receiving some very nice praises among critics and "Buzzers" alike. The cinematography is very nice, but nothing to spectacular. Very important in some scenes but not important in a lot of them. The make-up, though minor, is not insignificant in the least. Majorly important in fight scenes, it does what it needed to do to create the utmost effective effect.
10.0~Great Directing, Great Editing, Great Acting photomanvince Sign in Permalink Leonardo's performance is edgy and convincing. He does a perfect job of creating stress that is palpable. I've probably seen this 6 times and I still cling to the edge of my seat each time I put in on. Wahlberg, does a really good job as well. Nicholson, well, he's playing his typical bad guy role but with extra gusto. Damon was pretty good as well. The selection of music was perfect for each scene. They put it all together with tight, seamless editing and came up with one of the best films of the past 10 years! Since there are so many fans of the inspiration for this, Infernal Affairs, I'm going to try to rent it. I can't imagine it being any more suspenseful than The Departed, but I want to see why there are so many critics insisting it was better. I don't know how Scorsese does it. He keeps making great movies. He is one of the greatest directors of all time.
8.0~It really deserves a spot among the best crime flicks. Syrchek Sign in Permalink I heard this film is allegedly a remake of a Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, which I sadly haven't seen before this one. That fact takes off a lot of the originality that The Departed would have poses if it hadn't been a remake. So I'll try to take that in consideration. But since it's a Scorsese flick I spent a little more time comparing it to his (still) better crime-drama, Goodfellas. In my opinion, just because of the pure chronology, considering that Goodfellas was made about sixteen years before The Departed, that alone makes it a more original piece of the crime world. Let's face it. The crime genre is by now a pretty well investigated universe. I'm not thinking just about films, but tens of TV series as well. So in sense of originality, The Departed does come a little short. However, the cast, the performances and the entire realization of the project are quite a different story. These are probably DiCaprio's and Damon's toughest roles yet. I've read one review of the film in the papers so far, and the critic described them as 'eternal boys', that just couldn't fully pull it off. But I think he was wrong, because the film doesn't rely that much on their brutality. Instead we really get a view into an intense struggle on two opposite fronts. I think most of the beauty of the film lies within Costigan's and Sullivan's insecurity and unawareness of who's who in this game. It kind of feels like good old fashioned voyeurism, since we are the ones that see it all from a bird's-eye view. And along with the story, the characters just get more and more corrupt. I would say that this one does deserve a good spot on the chart of best crime films in recent years. The only problem I see in it is that it doesn't appear to be that quite fresh. Like I've said the crime genre is already very well worked and tested. But if you take all the attributes into account I think it's very worthy to spend two and a half hours of time on it. ........ +4/5 ........
6.0~Horrible cinematography janaka-3 Sign in Permalink I can not believe people write reviews praising this movie, This is one of the very bad movie from good actors and a director ( which reminds me Ocean's Crap 11,12,13 ) I have watched, To comment on, This film is a continuous frustrating hilarious competition between the bunch of A listed actors to outsmart the others, The dialogues between police officers always beginning with xucking and insulting each other, sexist ego maniac abusive behaviour, If this is the true behaviour of state troopers in US, May god bless Americans. The real cops and criminals must be laughing their back out for this film and the lunatic acting, Acting of Matt, Jack Decap, Whalberg are pathetic. Silly plots all over, This film clearly show How much Martin Scorese is out of touch with the reality, People who compare this to the degree of god father must be hung, HongKong infernal affairs is not the best but ten times better than this crap, I was utterly disappointed with this film. I expected 100 times better from these actors and the director.
2.0~Deliriously loopy, hysterically bad adamk-2 Sign in Permalink I finally caught up with this only recently, and had to keep pulling my jaw up from the floor. What a deliriously bad, hysterically loopy film this is. It's as if Scorcese had dozed off in front of "Goodfellas" one night after eating a cheese and garlic pizza, and thinking, "How can I top this.top this.top this" And this film is the result. Not so much a film, but a dream of a film, one that defies any sort of logic. There's a rat in the gang. Could it be the ex-cop who's always on his phone? Nope, because after all  they asked him, and he said it wasn't. Well, fair enough. Meanwhile, there's a rat in the police force. Could it be the cop who grew up under the wing of the mobster under investigation, the one who leaps onto his phone in full view of everyone as soon as an operation against said mobster is announced? Naaaah. Meanwhile we also have a police psychiatrist who, as luck would have it, is gorgeous and who, as her sense of professionalism would have it, thinks it's okay to sleep with not just one but two of her clients. A definition of a bad film, (which I read on a website dedicated to bad films) states that you know you're watching a bad film when the plot will only progress if the characters act stupidly. This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those films. To be fair, Damon and Cipriano are surprisingly good, the latter, in particular, having developed a leaner, meaner look than he's known for. Unfortunately, these are balanced out by average, TV-movie performances by Sheen and Baldwin, a bogglingly bad one by Wahlberg (a piece of wood rolled on to bark rude comments) a stunningly confused one by Ray Winstone (what is that accent again?) and thenthere's Jack. Any hopes that this might be one those roles that allow him to recall his acting skills are swiftly ditched by the scenery-chomping on display here, as if Nicholson were bored and decided he could only get through it by making it as surreal as possible, meanwhile coming across as neither Irish nor Bostonian. He's no longer an actor, he is a performer, a grandstander, and this is what you get. If you don't want characterisation or subtle emotions, you call Jack. You also, in his wake, get the wildly uneven tone, veering into off-the-wall black humour (the hand at the breakfast table  what was with THAT?) and moments so throwaway it looked for all the world as if they were being made up on the spot (Nicholson appearing, covered in blood). The end piles on twist upon twist and body upon body which, on the surface, are entertaining enough, but just don't hold up to any sort of scrutiny (and the psychiatrist does what with the tapes?) A passable no-brainer action film, and an entertaining exercise in loopy film-making from a director who should know better, praised by fans and critics who should also know better.
8.0~class A movie antoniotierno Sign in Permalink This is probably different from other Martin Scorsese's movies but it's truly enjoyable. Cast is excellent and each one of "the splendid actors gives his best. Dialogues are strong and believable, soundtrack's really great and suitable; as far as I can see there's no moment when rhythm is not steady or story lacks of focus. Furthermore it handles subjects like power and loyalty in a way reminding Mathy's masterpiece "Good Fellas". We could say, to sum up, that Scorsese is back with his humor, his class A actors (Jack Nicholson is huge) and his creating Shakespearean atmospheres. "The Departed" is purely entertaining and gritty and its action is enjoyable 100%.
9.0~Serious men Kubris Sign in Permalink IMDb Top 250: 58 The Departed is like Goodfellas for the next decade. It has crime, music, and Scorcese at the reigns. While it cannot replicate the magic of Goodfellas, which will never happen, The Departed tells a different kind of crime story with great success. If you didn't know, The Departed is about the Irish mafia in Boston shown from both sides of the law. The tale is quickly paced, with lots of angry looking men. There's several twists and unexpected moments that will affect you in various ways. Gritty and violent, The Departed gets in your face. The film centers on men who are on both sides of the law, or so it appears. DiCaprio is excellent as Bill, a rookie cop in a family with a history of crime, who is sent undercover. His anger is very well conveyed. Leo does a great job. He is backed by Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Sheen may be the only reasonable person in the entire film, and he's a good foil for the vulgar Digham, played well by Wahlberg, who acted from experience. They're all going after Costello, in another superb performance, this one by Jack Nicholson. He's a little crazy, and a great villain. His informant in the police is Sullivan, played by a mostly straight Matt Damon. He does the role justice, but doesn't stand out. This is very evidently a Scorcese picture. Great shots, including a cool intro with Costello where his face is just out of the light until the reveal. The pace is fast, and the film is well edited. Music accompanies, but ends abruptly, or is nearly silenced. It doesn't work as well as Goodfellas or Casino. For some reason, Gimme Shelter is played- twice, as is the most- fitting Shipping Up to Boston. Crime fans and fans of Scorcese need to see this, and those who can stomach the brutal violence and copious amounts of swearing should see why this won Best Picture. Serious men indeed. 8.6/10
3.0~Is a coherent & satisfying story too much to ask for? stevencrozier Sign in Permalink I'll give Scorsese credit for assembling a crackerjack cast and borrowing an intriguing Asian action flick plot and hiring a clever American screenwriter to Westernize it. But am I the only person who's angry that he took all those promising elements, spun them out in 2+ hours of pretty entertaining cinema and then wrapped it all up by unveiling a second "surprise" rat w/in the police department who proceeds to casually blow the brains out of everyone who could rat out the first rat that we knew about for the whole movie? (And how, by the way, did the 2nd surprise rat know that Damon and DiCaprio were going to be up on the roof of the deserted building having a secret meeting?) This is lazy, sloppy, bad film-making, which Scorsese then tops off by having the first rat (who, surprise surprise, blows out the brains of the surprise rat) whacked to cap off this symphony of carnage and draw his film to a conclusion. Pathetic storytelling, rendered even more pathetic for having been committed by a man who knows better, or at least USED to know better. Hats off, ladies and gentlemen, Martin has departed the building.
2.0~Totally weak cdf-13 Sign in Permalink Mild spoilers here only. Read anyway and save yourself a wasted admission price. Well, what can I say about this movie? How about... "it sucked", because it did. My girlfriend and I went to this movie with high hopes having immensely enjoyed the likes of Scarface, Goodfellas, Heat, etc., and having read the fantastic reviews of The Departed posted not only by critics (e.g., Rotten Tomatoes 95%!) but also by users here. What a let down. There was a star-studded cast, and there were some moments of good acting, but on the whole, the plot line and pace were boring. Beyond the interesting idea of having a mob informant and police informant working at counter-purposes, nothing much of interest was done with this. The movie drags along until about the 2.5 hour point, when suddenly the producers must have said "hmmm... time to end this... what shall we do? I know... lets just shoot everybody in the head and be done with it!" And don't even start me on the totally unrealistic and totally contrived love triangle, which, by the way, was completely incidental and unnecessary to the plot. This show was lame. I'm sorry.
6.0~Not that good culmo80 Sign in Permalink Well I'm a fan of Scorsese but I just didn't think this was all that great. It was long, had a lot of well-known actors, had a lot of profanity and some short scenes of violence...but it just didn't rise to all the hype. This film just didn't have the depth that other films had. I never really felt involved in this film; unlike other Scorsese films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, or Casino. Even Gangs of New York drew you in more than The Departed. Perhaps it's because this is a remake or maybe Scorsese has just lost his touch, who knows. The problem I had with the plot is that for 2 hours, there's a quasi-cat and mouse game between the police and Nicholson's organization. Both have moles and both are trying to find them. Then of course there's the other plot line of the police actually trying to bring down the mob boss. Then suddenly, there's a random shootout at the dockyard where all of Nicholson's goons are killed including Nicholson by his own spy within the police because Nicholson was an FBI informant? The final 15 minutes or so are just too much...everyone dies. While surprising, once you think about it, this was really a dumb move...you end up wondering why you just watched the movie. Consider the exact opposite and you'll understand why...everyone lives and nothing changes, kind of dumb when you think about it. Another point was the abandoned romance sub-plot. In reality, you could have left that whole part out and it would not have affected the film one bit. And why would this woman who just moved in with Mark Wahlberg decide to cheat on him with Leo Decaprio? It was like they were going to make that an important part of the plot but it ended up being nothing. As for the actors. I think at this point in his career, Jack Nicholson cannot be any other character except for the deranged socio-path with sarcastic lines. Comedy, drama, you name it, he's the same guy. Mark Walhberg did an okay job but it seemed like they wanted to establish that he was the stereotypical tough-talking Boston cop really quickly. He was overdone in my opinion. Leonardo Decaprio has already played this role...Gangs of New York. Matt Damon was decent. The rest were okay. I think had Scorsese worked with the plot some, casted some lesser known actors like he used to do and gone more in-depth on the characters, it would have been better. In my opinion, if this movie had been made by anyone else, it would not have even been nominated for an Oscar. I've tried to watch it again, thinking maybe I would like it better...by the time Matt Damon joins the special unit, I was done...I popped it out and watched re-runs.
1.0~Totally in-justification of a masterful script! yypfu Sign in Permalink What a waste to a masterful script! Scorsese has totally wrecked the script by polluting it with unnecessary profanity, gore, blood and tasteless sex scene. The only good thing about this remake is Jack Nicholson performance (except for the rubber penis). The original is thought provoking and make you want to see it over and over again. The characters in the original are captivating. The characters in the remake seems shallow and pointless. You don't feel for any of the characters, even the supposedly good guys, i.e. Martin Sheen, Mark Walberg and Leonardo DiCaprio because Scoresese did not care spending the time to build the story behind the 3, instead he just overloaded Walberg character with mindless swearing and stupid insults to DiCaprio. What for?????? The last few scene of shooting is even laughable. What a mistake! This is just one messy remake of a perfectly good movie.
10.0~Fantastic Bro SoncoChairman Sign in Permalink Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.
10.0~Top Notch elmanahi Sign in Permalink Let me begin by saying that Scorcese is one of my favorite directors, but I've been steadily disappointed since "Casino". I thought Marty was slipping...finally infected with Hollywood Syndrome...I am so happy this is not the case. This is Scorcese at the top of his game...It's clear that only a director of his caliber could take control of such a talented cast and push them beyond anything they've previously done. In the hands of a lesser director this could have easily turned into cheese. Everyone is excellent. The editing creates a beautifully paced movie...2.5 hours feels like 45 minutes....see this movie. Haven't seen "Infernal Affairs", but now I am very anxious to see it.
10.0~Excellent bob-rutzel Sign in Permalink Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is a mole inside Costello's (Nicholson) crime gang. Colin Sullivan (Damon) is a mole inside the Boston Police Dept. When the cops and Costello find out each has a mole among them, things get more than interesting. It is more than nice to have an all star cast performing an excellent story. This doesn't happen often and doesn't disappoint. Plus the fact that it moved along at such a lively pace the 2 ½ hours didn't seem like 2 ½ hours. One can easily see how this was nominated for Best Picture (which it won) and also how Martin Scorsese was nominated for Best Director (which he won). And, one can also see how some of the stars could have been nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor: DiCaprio, Damon or Nicholson (but none were). But, there is one area that surely needs to be recognized and that is the film editing, and by-God it won for that too. This was a cat mouse-chess game and the shots went back and forth at a rapid pace at times and yet, and you didn't lose the thread. Great editing job. This is a movie you have to stay with. If you give yourself an intermission while the DVD is still running, you may lose something you probably need to know later on. So pay attention. When we saw the Academy Awards we saw Jack Nicholson looking like Mr. Clean, Lex Luthor, Kojack, or Daddy Warbucks (take your pick) and we feel the reason for this is because Jack saw himself in this movie and realized he had a really bad hair day all the way through. Also, did anyone but me notice some facial similarities between DiCaprio and Nicholson? Hmmmm. Everything was excellent, the cinematography, the dialogue, the editing, the acting and yes, the music was, at times, very good too. Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, Nudity:Partial, Language:Yes
8.0~Good crime -thrilling drama by a directing legend that features an all-pro cast. blanbrn Sign in Permalink Last weekend when I went to the movies to see "The Departed" I knew I would see a good thriller, and it didn't let me down. Being a big Jack Nicholson fan this was a must see for me as I see all of his movies, that was enjoyable but the plot and twist of this movie made it that much more pleasing. Also "The Departed" features an all-pro cast not only Nicholson, but you have Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and being directed by a legend like Scorsese made it well worth a watch. "The Departed" is a terrific cops-and mobsters tale that is complicated and compelling. You have the Massachusetts State Police ready to bring down ruthless mobster Frank Costello(played perfect by Jack)enter Boston bred police trainee Billy Costigan(DiCaprio) whose put undercover to dig dirt. The police captain(Sheen) and command sergeant(Wahlberg) are the only ones to know of Costigan's assignment and nobody else does. Scandals are unaware though when rising young sergeant Sullivan(Damon)is already in the special unit known only to his commander, and Sullivan secretly is loyal to Costello who tips Frank off about the moves of police. This movie then one by one becomes a puzzle hard to figure out as no one seems to be who they are. I really like Scorsese's use of realism of the violence and intensity he shows of this film, I guess that can be expected when dealing with the Boston mob though. You will love the blood soaked gore and bullet scenes the best I've seen in a while also. "The Departed" is a film to me that shows one by one how people depart from business or the very life they have one by one as you will see in the film. This is a must see because of the good plot and twist and the great acting.
3.0~Remake of his own work xaggurat Sign in Permalink I really didn't like this at all. It's another Scorsese remake of his own recent work, namely Gangs of New York. Similar phenomena we had with Casino and Goodfellas. Usually Scorsese's worst is still OK, but The Departed was so predictable I was seriously bored. Anyways, in addition to the default point, one point for decent photography and one for Nicholson, who is always splendid, even at his worst. Matt Damon was again as good as he was in Team America and Leonardo tried hard to get rid of his boyish appeal again. I recently heard he had threatened to quit acting after Titanic, I wish he would have.
9.0~Ridiculously amazing story about rats and moles WalterSoprano Sign in Permalink I am aware that this film is a remake of infernal affairs which I have also seen but didn't nearly enjoy as much as I did this one. Martin Scorsese took an amazing story about rats and moles and put his take on it and he couldn't have done it any better. Infernal affairs didn't execute the story as good as this one. All actors gave amazing performances and the conclusion is extremely un expecting and relentless. The story starts out right off the bat and complicates even more as it proceeds till it comes down to some extremely memorable closing moments which in this case is like the last 20 minutes. This is definitely one of Scorsese's top 3 best. If you are a fan of good stories and are a Scorsese fan I extremely highly recommend this to you. If you disagree, to each his own and this is my own.
4.0~Weak, bloated remake Tamio888 Sign in Permalink A major disappointment for people hoping for a sharp, original take on a great film. Scorsese and company add nothing new except trivial subplots and extra characters to service their need for mass market digestibility. Do we really need an improbable romantic triangle involving the two male leads? The Mark Wahlberg character is a superfluous addition whose only purpose is the provide a tied-up-with-a-bow ending. The original is edgy and tense and contains a deeper moral sense of good versus evil. It also has real acting in it. Nicholson overplays every scene and, of course, has to do his crazy devil thing. In the original, Andy Lau actually achieves some depth as the icy, distant, morally vacant wolf in sheep's clothing. In "The Departed", the same character, played by Matt Damon, is portrayed as engaging and charming, making his evil completely inorganic. Tony Leung in the original delivers the best performance of anyone in either film. In the remake, DiCaprio, in the same role, is stiff and artificial, as is most of "The Departed". Too bad, if you saw the remake first, but check it out if you want to see tense, nervy, original film-making of the quality Scorsese used to make.
10.0~My favorite film! PersianPlaya408 Sign in Permalink I finally saw the long-awaited classic film from Scorsese. This is one of the best films in the last decade and I am still having a personal discussion with myself on comparing it with some of the my ultimate favorites such as Goodfellas, Casino, Rounders, A Bronx Tale, The Deer Hunter and I am pondering even ranking it higher than my top 3 films the first two godfather's and taxi driver. I think i will need to watch it a couple more times before making such an important decision, but after seeing it once, one thing is for sure, The Departed is a masterpiece. Everything put together by Marty in his own perfect stylistic fashion. The violence is perfect, the cursing is perfect, the actors absolutely committed. Nicholson, Wahlberg, and Dicaprio check in for 3 of their best performances of their careers (and thats saying a lot for nicholson whose had an amazing career). Matt Damon was also good here, a bit subtle and overshadowed by his peers, but nonetheless always convincing. Vera Farmiga was charming and very good in the female lead. Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen were perfect in their selective small roles as well. Marty did a great job with this one. I liked Howard Shore's score a lot and Michael Ballhaus's cinematography was amazing, absolutely Oscar worthy. IMDb Rating: 8.4. My rating: 10/10
7.0~Just short of a classic tomq5p Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese has created another great film that will join "Casino" and "Goodfellas" (two of his earlier films) in the American mobster canon. However, this film isn't quite as good as Scorsese's earlier contributions. In fact, it doesn't really improve on "Infernal Affairs," the film it is based on - it merely Americanizes the story. The script is excellent for the most part. The dialogue is funny, quirky and effective. The actors do a great job (although the accents falter occasionally). Jack Nicholson is hilarious and believably crazy, although, admittedly, he is somewhat typecast as the character he plays in this film and seems to rely on standard grimaces and deranged smiles. Mark Wahlberg's character is strangely lovable, even though he plays a cop with very few redeeming qualities. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio convince us that they are, respectively, moles in the police force and an organized crime racket. Alec Baldwin's supporting role is also very entertaining. One thing that bothered me was the subtle and not-so-subtle product placement, which, in my opinion, took away from the film (Halls and Dell are two prominent examples). While many argue that we should just accept product placement as a fact of life, I believe that directors have the choice to sell out or not and should resist the urge to make more money while compromising the visual and ethical integrity of their films. If you have not seen the original film (Infernal Affairs), you'll probably love this movie. If you have, you'll still like it. If you enjoy repartee coupled with violence (something only mobster movies seem to be able to satisfactorily provide), you'll be in for a treat. And, you might have a taste for some Halls mints when you leave the theater... 7 out of 10
5.0~Bloated....overly long....but decent Vinegaroon3 Sign in Permalink I do not understand some of the raves about this movie. It was simply an average to slightly above average 90 minute thriller stretched into 140 (or thereabouts) minutes. The premise was sort of astonishingly unbelievable. Nicholson's character is a street wise gangster....who for reasons not really clear takes on a crew member who had just completed (or nearly completed) the State Police academy. "I am not a cop...honest" seems to be all he needs to say in order to go DEEP undercover in the Boston underworld. Right. There is no "trial period".....immediately this ex-cop turned gangster is made privy to the gang's most critical secrets, including murders and assorted other felonies. THEN, when it soon becomes apparent that there is an informer in their midst, they are unable to focus in on the obvious suspect. In addition, despite having irrefutable evidence of crimes that would put Nicholson's character UNDER the jail for 300 years, that is not enough for them to move forward with arrests and prosecutions...???? The movie also seriously drags in many places, like the ridiculous relationship with the police psychiatrist. The ending is completely unimaginative, and actually was sort of a surprise because it was so predictable. I was expecting at least some sort of a plot twist to be revealed. Wrong. This movie might be worth watching on DVD if you have no other good choices, but don't waste your money at the theater.
10.0~Stellar! akkoziol Sign in Permalink I think is a reworked version of the Chinese movie Infernal Affairs. I haven't seen it but after watching this it reminded me a little bit of Hard Boiled with Chow Yun Fat. Most of the time, foreign movies are reworked by American directors and it turns to crap. While I cannot yet comment on the original, if it's anything like this version, it must be pretty good. This is way above some of his best works, including Goodfellas and I LOVE Goodfellas. I couldn't believe he could top it but he did with this movie. I was sucked into the plot and white-knuckled all the way through the climactic end. Brilliant stuff here folks, don't wait another second.
9.0~Masterpiece! jochenliesbet Sign in Permalink The best movie of 2006! Brilliant casting & acting. Scorsese did it again! Topcast: Nicholson, Baldwin, Sheen, Damon, Wahlberg, Di Caprio. The Irish accent of one Nicholsons helpers is just marvelous. This masterpiece has the same quality as Goodfellas & Casino. Nicholson is one of the better and sure the most sadistic & flipped godfather in movie history! I'm not a big fan of Leonardo but I must admit that his acting in this movie is the best i've seen from him so far. Everyone who likes gangster/mafia movies has to see this masterpiece. One thing, don't be tired when you want to see the movie. Two hours & half, but never boring! 'As far as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster!'
1.0~The Departed is rubbish, go watch Infernal Affairs instead! ahui2610 Sign in Permalink The director practically gutted the original story. This is classic Hollywood doings. I've never seen a worse adaptation from an original movie. They basically added more sex scenes and cut out all the meaningful parts of the original stories, made the story choppy and hard to follow, then stick a couple of big names to draw the audience. The original Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs has a solid character development. Infernal Affairs also used more intelligent ways of communication between the undercover and the source, making you sit at the edge of your seat. Aside from much stronger story lines, it also portrayed mental health workers in a much more professional manner...the psychiatrist in the Departed would've had her license taken away in a snap as there are strict laws prohibiting dual relationships. Just like all meaningless mainstream movies, as if putting in a sex scene and showing some flesh would make up for the horrid chopped up story. The original made the psychiatrist-patient relationship more real and tapped into the inner workings of the psychiatrist working with an undercover. If you are looking for a truly well written screenplay with deep emotional plots, go watch the original Infernal Affairs instead!
8.0~Twisted corruption... talented cast wreednelson Sign in Permalink Wow... what a cast. Everyone in this movie brings it. The talent pool here is so deep the story lines could stink and the movie still may have a change to be good. Thankfully, this movie keeps you guessing as to possible outcomes until the end. Casting Bostonians like Wahlberg and Damon doesn't hurt either. No fake accents and attitudes make things more believable. The violence in this movie is grotesquely real. Gun shots wounds and brain matter are everywhere. The movie has very nice tension due to the undercover work and the havoc that plays on the life of an officer. Try to get past the violence and sit back and watch good actors do their thing in this movie... and by all means keep the kids away from this one.
6.0~Just another one from Scorsese Robert G. Sign in Permalink What's so special about this movie?! Looks like Hollywood is concentrated on entertainment only so when something "serious" comes out, it is called art. Oh come on! This movie is not a bad one, but it is also far away from being called a masterpiece. At the moment it is on #33 on top 250 of the best films of all times. Just one question for Mr. Scorsese: how many times will you shoot the same movie again and again? I mean, this one is the same as Casino, which was the same as Goodfellas... OK, the stories were a bit different, but they all look the same (the structure, the music, the acting). Hollywood has definitely lost the magic, all the movies are done the same way - you know what to expect. Just like you know what you'll get when you order a Big Mac. Again - this movie is not a bad one, but I don't like too much. It will be forgotten in few years.
9.0~A golden effort from a legendary director hassan-ilahi Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese has always been known as A legendary director. With masterpieces like 'Raging Bull', 'Good fellas', 'Taxi Driver', and 'Casino', Scorsese never fails to at the very least impress. This film proves that Scorsese is brilliant at doing what he does best. The Departed is an infuriation of excellence. Watching it is like watching exploding fireworks in the sky. The film captures an unseen, brutal part of Boston, showing it in an undeniably intensifying way. It's filled with excellent performances, outstanding direction, and a great screenplay. This thriller is filled with jarringly flawless performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's on-screen 'battle' is suspenseful. You can actually feel yourself rooting for one of them. DiCaprio is furious and exuberant, while Damon is smart and curious. Jack Nicholson makes for a charismatic star in this film. His performance is certainly worthwhile freakish. Lastly, Mark Wahlberg is hilarious. I really haven't seen a better performance from him. Other actors including Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Vera Farmiga are decent. Scorsese may not have ventured into this theme so much, apart from Goodfellas, but it mostly seems so. The different camera angles and intelligent shots are dazzling. Inclusive to some overdone foul language and blood/gore, it eventually pays off. I'm definitely counting this film as a worthy Scorsese brilliancy. It's not easy to write scripts, but this film has an engrossing one. From the start to end, the film is entertaining enough to keep on going. It has a highly suspenseful and sometimes abrupt climax, but otherwise, no problem. Overall, there's really not enough to justify this achievement. It may not come to the likes of people not familiar with substance material, but it's a must-see for any Scorsese fan. A star-studded cast, worthy direction, and 'exciting' screenplay back up as proof.
7.0~You would not want to be a cop in Boston! CalDexter Sign in Permalink This is a good movie from Martin Scorcese, about two Boston cops: Billy Costigan (Leonardo De Caprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who are involved with gangster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan is the 'good guy' cop who is sent undercover to bring Costello down, meanwhile Costello has an ace up his sleeve in Colin Sullivan, a man who has just left Police College and is rising high in the Boston Police Department within a short time. When Costello discovers he may have a 'rat' in the house he charges Sullivan with finding out the identity of the undercover cop thus placing Costigan in a very dangerous game of Cloak And Dagger. De Caprio is excellent in this film and Matt Damon shows us that as well as The Talented Mr Ripley, he can deliver a desperate bad guy when he tries. Jack Nicholson is his usual brilliant self, his Frank Costello reminded me of a cross between Jack Torrance and Darryl Van Horn. Kudos all around for the acting stakes. Special mention to Mark Wahlberg as a foul mouthed hard as nails detective, he really convinces as a hard bitten detective and he has good scenes with Alec Baldwin who is also very good in a small role. Oh and i lost count for the amount of people getting their heads blown off here, but take it from me if you enjoy fast paced violent thrillers you will lap this up. Seven Out Of Ten.
4.0~Could've been great, but ultimately lame Qanqor Sign in Permalink Very briefly: 1) I've never seen Infernal Affairs, so I'm not comparing this film to it. 2) I'm not sure if I've ever seen a Scorcese movie, so I'm not comparing this film to those. 3) Swearing doesn't bother me, so I'm not griping about that. This film is ultimately lame because it sets up a really interesting situation and engrosses you in a story... and then does absolutely NOTHING with it. Subplots dead-end and go nowhere, and the main plot resolves by the lame-brained expedient of having every character just get shot and die. In short, the ending just stinks on ice and ruins the entire film. There are other reviews here that go into the problems in great detail and do a fine job, I just wanted to second them.
10.0~The Best So Far For 2006 bob_gilmore1 Sign in Permalink My first thoughts walking out of the theater were, "wow that was great but it wasn't as good as Goodfellas." Few living directors have such built in levels of expectations as Martin Scorsese; his past will always be difficult to live down but he mostly does an amazing job with his all-star cast in The Departed. Given access to Hollywood's greatest talent allows him to create a vividly interesting and intensely watchable crime film. Everyone will have their favorites but for my money Alec Baldwin in the most consistently entertaining even with limited screen time. The film is long, but doesn't seem long. If you are weighing the film from an investment standpoint I doubt that there are many places that you can go for two and a half hours and be this enthralled for only about eight bucks. Back to The Goodfellas comparison. One of the reasons that that film had such a visceral appeal was that Ray Liotta was pretty much an unknown at the time. We got to know Liotta as Henry Hill, we didn't have many previous roles to work through in our establishing empathy. Sure he played in Field Of Dreams, but it was a brief appearance. In The Departed we never feel the same level of cathartic involvement because the actors are still just actors. In the end this is but a minor quibble as the action is so riveting, the performances so well presented and the story so engaging that it doesn't matter much that we don't have that same level of emotional involvement. Oscar time for Marty? Who knows. Most thought that the breakthrough would come with The Aviator (A great historical-visual masterpiece) but it was not the case. If the opening weekend means anything this will be probably be the director's most successful box office creation. Maybe that has been the real barrier to Scorsese getting over the top. While the violence is certainly ever present it seems to be less violent of a film than Taxi Driver or Goodfellas because of the way the violence is presented on the screen. It just sort of happens and it's happening just fits into the way that the plot unfolds.
1.0~major let down grumpy-3 Sign in Permalink what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull
10.0~Fim of 2006 mayer-fan Sign in Permalink I loved every moment of this film from start to finish. I mean its superbly written and lets face it with a cast like that and a great director it was bound for greatness Since "mob films" are generally one of my favorite genres i have seen a lot of them. Obviously the greats like "Goodfella's, Pulp Fiction and Donnie Brasco" but i have to say that this film was refreshing to watch. I think this is partially because of Leonardo Dicaprio. What an amazing performance, for me it was worthy of an Oscar. I've always regarded him as a great actor but this just solidified it for me. The way that both him and Damon played each other out throughout the film was brilliant. Always trying to out do each other but they had no idea what so ever, excellent! and i suppose thats down to the writer for the intertwined twists involved in the plot but i don't think that any other actors would have played these roles anywhere near as convincing as they did. For me this was the movie of 2006 i throughly enjoyed every bit of it and was greatly pleased with the end credits thinking WOW!
8.0~Remakes are seldom as good as the original lastliberal Sign in Permalink I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong). The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow. I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version. I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work.
1.0~The Untalented martinitaly Sign in Permalink The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics. Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits, which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg -- rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way, I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more -- as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo, and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial -- but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero, or it scared Damon, or God knows what -- just another loose end in this spaghetti-plate of a movie. Overall, hardly anyone in this movie (Winstone is an exception) act-ually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil, Jackie baby. By the way, the film shows cutting-edge developments in cinematic blood-squirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke, they sort of vaporize -- it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. This film has been larded with praise -- by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well, they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism, parodied in Scorsese's last film, The Aviator! What a joke. Right -- my last word, if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces, as one of the top-billing cultural manifestations of the year, expensive to make, heaped with praise and awards, exported around the world and seen by multiple millions--something about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?
9.0~The departed: Wouldn't let u parted till end.... akmishra_001 Sign in Permalink Its the movie you will remember and would buy another ticket for. Such lavish sets, competent screen play and photography. Excellent direction. but whats most aspiring is the casting and their performances. Every character fits in his own. May b its the commitment of director or actor whatever. They have given their best. Especially LeoNardo DaCApriciao and Nicholson. MAy be its climax is not much happening but the performances make it masterpiece of MArtin Scorsese. I would be glad to see this movie roll on Oscars red carpet..So go and enjoy the movie. U watch yourself and decide. Don't go by critics opinion.
6.0~Stories Grandpa used to tell ginsparks Sign in Permalink This film reminds me of stories my Grandpa used to tell. They always started out great and got you hooked. Then somewhere along the way Grandpa would lose his train of thought. He would then mix it up with some other story he used to tell and get completely off base. Then Grandma would come in and tell him to take his meds at which point he would give some quick wrap up to the story leaving us completely unfulfilled. I loved the characters, I loved the acting and I loved the development of the story. However, somewhere along the way the story becomes implausible and the ending falls off considerably. Worth seeing but not memorable. Oscar worthy in a slow year - maybe.
8.0~Best movie i've seen in a while! stevemall777 Sign in Permalink My friends and I had been talking about going to see The Departed since the first time we saw a commercial for it, surprisingly a short 2 weeks before it opened in theatres. As it came closer to us actually going to the theatre to see it, we saw more and more celebrities talk about it on talk shows and i had no idea there were so many great actors in this movie! This movie had an awesome, gripping, emotional, and at times funny story. Leonardo DiCaprio proves himself to be a terrific actor opposite Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon. The delivery of the story is smooth and leaves you wanting more. The ending does NOT disappoint! I loved this movie and it was one of the best i have seen in a long time, go see it!
5.0~HUGE disappointment kiga-1 Sign in Permalink Never boring, but the actors are so wired, the dialog so colorlessly profane and the plot so thin you realize it's a puzzle where the pieces don't fit. The most laughable scenes are Mark Wahlberg's at the beginning where he is taunting DiCaprio: it never leads anywhere and you don't know why he is doing it. Martin Sheen sits there doing nothing, either as an actor or a character. The only female character (who isn't a whore) is part of a plot so predictable you wonder why they bothered it has so little payoff. There are plenty of good moments, good violence and exciting chases. But the ending of the movie gets so cluttered, with so many twists, it undermines the original cat-and-mouse war between DiCarpio and Damon. The movie makes you think it is building to this classic showdown, but strange plot diversions, endless double-crosses and lame exposition from secondary characters ruins the tension and you are left with violence as a substitute for suspense. You have never seen so many great actors assembled for so little purpose and such mediocre results. "Goodfellas" represents ensemble work at its best. "The Departed" is selfish solo work that allows all the actors to do what they do best...except realize they are in the same movie together.
8.0~Very good movie carried by story and acting ltblack Sign in Permalink This is very good movie paying the nine odd dollars for a ticket in the theater is worth it. Would be a phenomenal movie is it wasn't for a few things. A certain brown envelope is never explained and was probably in some deleted scene. The ending goes so quick it is hard to process everything almost like they knew it was too long of a movie and just had to end it. Ending isn't bad just not up to par with the rest of the movie. Lastly the role of the female psychiatrist/love interest is not done well and I found myself annoyed with how she was portrayed and didn't find her part very believable. All of these problems aren't very big ones that ruin the movie, more like annoyances. I give the movie 8 out 10 on IMDb or on the more traditional movie rating system a 3 1/2 stars out of 4.
6.0~Better not win an Oscar. phantomx151 Sign in Permalink Sorry Martin, this felt very under par in terms of quality. There were parts of the movie where people within the crowd could feel the energy of a scene which lost its aim. There were laughs at parts where normal human beings would normally not laugh. Some of the lines were terrible. The editing at times looked like something out of a really bad student film. But what kept me going was the acting. When it was solid, it was SOLID. Matt and Leo are fan-freakin-tastic. The complexity of each of their characters dealing with their surroundings and the dynamic between Damon and Farmiga is amazing. Very true to life. But unfortunately the movie would anti-gravitize itself with a scene, sadly usually involving Jack Nicholson, which a line would be said or something would happen that seemed entirely out of place. Maybe that was the point to add a bit of awkward realism. But from a movie-going standpoint, it ruined the flow of certain parts. Over-all it was entertaining and the acting was phenomenal but definitely not a classic. I think Scorcese can definitely do better. I don't think I've seen so many people shot in the head in a movie before.
9.0~Great Film; liked it better the second time I watched it. lloosescrew1 Sign in Permalink This is definitely something new for Scorsese, and I liked it. He delves into the Irish mob this time around, and it allows him to switch things up. It has everything every moviegoer would like to see, and it sets a pretty good deliberate theme about being a 'rat.' Matt Damon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson all have a great take on an Irish accent and play their part well. Especially Nicholson. ;) So yeah, in closing, take some time out to watch this artistically beautiful movie, and remove the fact that it won 'Best Picture' from your head.
7.0~kindda disappointed etulips Sign in Permalink just finished the watching of TD around 10 mins ago, well, i have almost the same opinion like many guys who already have seen the TD and the original version have given. Kindda disappointed. Basically, TD is a good movie if we r not comparin it 2 the original 1. When I first heard this remake movie is going 2 be stared by Dic&Matt, I was holding a lot of expectation. Unfortunately,it doesn't work out that way as i expected. I don't like the performance of the both in comparison 2 Tony& Andy. I personally think Dic's performance is bit superficial, his eyes and acting oozed out 2 much fear. Lookin back tony's performance, it's more complex and dramatic intense. Well, as 1 fellow said, in this year filled with lame movies, it's still a good thing to watch a movie as TD. And 1 more tip, don't watch the original version before u watch it.
4.0~No respect! axsmashcrushallthree Sign in Permalink This remake of "Internal Affairs", a great movie in its own right, adds a Whitey Bulger-John Connolly Boston twist that just BEGS for brilliance - it's a can't-miss story line with a powerhouse cast. However, it's a huge disappointment. Despite such compelling material, Scorsese only skims the surface, opting for gloss instead of substance, adding confusing sub-plots that serve mainly to hook the audience. These sub-plots destroy the momentum of the film and pull the whole thing off the tracks. Without these (no spoilers), the film may have had a chance. Scorsese's trademark violence stingers are now overripe at best. Am I the only one who started to yawn when people were getting pounded over a loud soundtrack in "Casino"? I doubt it... There is some pretty silly ensemble work here, too - we're not talking "Glenngary Glen Ross" or "The Usual Suspects" here by any stretch. Most of the bad highlights usually involve Wahlberg's profane fool of a character. Overall, the individual characterizations seem to be either shrill, as in the case of the annoying Wahlberg and chest-thumping Damon, or flat, like Sheen's police captain. Nicholson's Whitey Bulger take is completely lacking in menace - it's amusing, if nothing else. Only DiCaprio's brooding Billy Costigan stands out, but he's got nowhere to go, both literally and figuratively - the sub-plots basically turn his character to face the wall... Much has been made of the ending here, but I would describe it with one word - "cowardly". I just couldn't respect this film much, particularly in light of "GoodFellas" and other Scorsese masterpieces. Overall, 4 stars and only because it's him - probably the worst best picture Oscar since "American Beauty".
5.0~remake of Hong Action movie Infernal Affairs reddoor3000 Sign in Permalink I liked The Departed a lot more before I saw the original. I'm a long time Scorcese fan, but I have to say I'm pretty disappointed that he remade Infernal Affairs scene for scene without making it clear in the states that The Departed is a remake. It definitely diminished my opinion of his version. The Hong Kong original is less violent and there's no explicit sex (can't say I missed either), but it is literally, scene for scene, the same movie. Nothing against remakes, but I think it's only fair to make it absolutely clear when a project isn't original. If you like the Departed, watch the original and see for yourself.
10.0~It can't get any better !!! dzenishankusic Sign in Permalink Let's break it down into separate pieces: Cast selection: 10/10 Storytelling: 10/10 Acting: 10/10 Directing: 10/10 Everything else: 10/10 If I have to chose the best part of the movie it would be the screenplay. The story, although very crazy and somewhat complex, it's pretty believable. And when you add Leo, Mat, Jack, Mark, Alec, etc to do the acting, and on top of that Martin Scorsese to do the directing, this is what you get - A true MASTERPIECE!!!
9.0~What a Twist! saxguy9345 Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed this movie, not like any cop drama I've seen lately. When Sheen took a dive, I thought Wow, a movie with the nuts to kill off the commissioner. After Wahlberg takes a leave of absence, and pretty much everyone but Damon is still alive, I felt they spent a little too much time setting up the final kill. As soon as Damon was alone in his hallway, and the old lady jerked her dog away !! rotfl, I don't know who couldn't have seen it coming. I just wanted some answers from the OTHER RAT that saves Damon from DiCaprio in the elevator! Where did he come from? And that raises the question, who did Wahlberg actually work for? I think the ending fit the style of the movie, being mysterious the whole way through. They still could've added, what? 20 seconds of film to tie it up with a few metaphors and receive the full 10 stars from myself.
8.0~A Work of Bloody Genius...One of 2006's Best Jonny_Numb Sign in Permalink For as much as I fancy myself a connoisseur of cinema, I have never been too heavily interested in auteurs like Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Scorsese--granted, they have made some films I've enjoyed, but on the whole, I lack the (seemingly mandatory) obsessive critical enthusiasm for their works overall. But "The Departed" (a surprising remake of a Japanese original) is the type of film that might finally inspire me to peer into Scorsese's extensive backcatalog. "The Departed," in addition to telling a story that's deceptively simple on first glance, but brilliantly twisted with complication as it progresses, also succeeds in assembling a cast at the tops of their respective games. The film actually deserves its biggest accolade for convincing me (finally) that Leonardo DiCaprio is capable of playing an adult role without a hint of the sappy, sentimental "Titanic" baggage that's long stigmatized him in my eyes (when his undercover agent roughs up two hoods in a convenience store, we buy it completely). Similarly, Matt Damon--who's often seemed like a pretty-boy recycling the same character--has a fine turn as a cop who's corrupt to the bone, whose long-standing relationship with Jack Nicholson's Bostonian mob kingpin only drags him further down. Parallels to "The Score"--the 2001 heist flick that united Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, and Edward Norton--are not out of place, but "The Departed" is more than a cinematic stunt revolving around a twist ending while the actors show their chops; there is a sincere, wrenching intrigue and dramatic force propelling this ride. Scorsese's implications--as we've seen in "GoodFellas" and "Taxi Driver"--are shattering, and "The Departed" is no exception. While the plot is intricate and I probably couldn't spoil it even if I tried, it is only a tiny part of the bigger picture. Scorsese's film might be the best fictionalized portrait of corruption among civil servants since 1997's "L.A. Confidential," and the double- and triple-crosses perpetrated by DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson interweave beautifully. While the script has its contrivances--a romantic interlude between DiCaprio and Damon's girlfriend (Vera Farmiga)--Scorsese not only makes us feel that something is truly at stake all the time, but is not afraid to align our sympathies with his corrupt characters at any given time. "The Departed"'s constantly spinning moral compass--and the coordinates it settles upon--is one of the film's major attractions, because it keeps predictability at a minimum. At two and half hours, "The Departed" is a tightly-paced crime thriller that maintains such strong momentum that its minuscule caveats are easily forgivable. In addition to the wonderful interplay between the three leads, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg also turn in strong supporting work. This is a surprising, enthralling film...one of the year's best.
9.0~Scorsese's Best since "Goodfellas" ClaytonDavis Sign in Permalink I'm very glad to say that this is his best achievement since "Goodfellas" and the best of his career. "The Departed" is a remake of the Hong-Kong film "Infernal Affairs" which tells the story of two men, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) whom are on two opposites sides of the law and seem to have their lives revolving around one of the most notorious gangsters, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy comes from a family of mafia lords and crime smugglers however, seems to find his way into the honorable profession of law enforcement and wanting to make a difference. After his graduation from the academy, he is made an offer that involves getting entangled with the roots of his family and becoming the one thing he swore to fight against. He is discharged from the police and serves a one-year prison sentence and upon his departure, join the crowd of Costello made up of scandalous thugs and convicts, in order to gain information and evidence to convict the felon. But Costello has some tricks up his sleeve and his infamous nature is guarded by the inside of the commandment. Many years prior to Billy's infiltration, Costello befriends a young boy and makes him his own personal messenger and protégé, Colin Sullivan. Colin is well trained and Frank convinces him to join the Boston State Police as his source of crime and information. He tips Frank off for police operations while quickly moving his way up the ladder of success in the department. The two men accept their tasks and we are thrown into the ultimate story of corruption, deceit and loyalty. Billy Costigan is the most complex character thanks to the powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy has his own personal demons and is in constant battle within himself from his crimes with Costello to his loss of humanization. Billy seems to lose himself in the film and is in long search of redemption of his misdemeanors. DiCaprio is truly a gifted and talented actor and continues to show us that he isn't the same boy/heartthrob from "Titanic," his "Billy" is perplexing and utterly haunting. DiCaprio's performance is the best of the cast but I'm afraid the role doesn't garner the much "Oscar scene" to gather true awards attention. He does have some powerful clips although, they're a part of an action flick that few actors can seem to find their way out of and onto a short list called the Best Actor race. The film would need to be a unanimous hit for him to pull off nomination #3. His Boston accent is great and the fury that he finds in his character is remarkable. I just don't feel his character can be appreciated and admired the way it should be. Matt Damon has been trying to show us a different part of him each time. Colin is the most hated man of the film, hands down. From his manipulation of the law to his constant deceit and betrayal of his peers, Damon truly finds his character's axis. Colin Sullivan is greedy in power, arrogant in thoughts, and degrading in aura. The powerful and well put together screenplay elevates what could have been a very typical story and turns it into an action genre with slices of drama sequences that some films could only dream to be. The pace of the film is just right with all the right decisions being made. Scorsese builds scenes with so much suspense that it's terribly hard not to become knotted in the film and be at the edge of your seat. Jack, I believe is on his way to another nomination. Frank Costello is one of the most malevolent, immoral, sinful men of recent film history. Jack is the man and while he deserves the acclaim that he hopefully will receive for the role, he is in no way walking to the podium to accept a fourth Oscar. Even though he does many wicked things in the film, you start to admire the spirit and reputation of Frank Costello. He is the best put together player, head to toe, from his monologues about his past to his devilish humor; he chews scenery so well that he bleeds out the screen. There is no real reason to reiterate how great Jack is but it is great to see those sunglasses at the Kodak Theater from time to time. While the film is jammed packed with suspense and thrills, there is a huge flaw that befalls the film and it's its extremely weak ending. The film builds you up to a climax you cannot wait to see and experience but unfortunately, the end result is rather dull, flat and bland. While it didn't destroy the film entirely, it did enough damage to not make it a cinematic gem. Also, the entrance of Vera Farmiga's character as Madeleine, the police authority psychiatrist who starts to date Colin and ends up webbed in a love triangle with Billy is rather forced and unneeded. It's a bit too cheesy to suffice and the dramatic elements were enough without bringing in a tedious romance. What are "The Departed" chances for the upcoming awards season? I'll say Jack Nicholson for supporting, the three-person writing team in the adapted screenplay category and a few technical nominations including sound, sound editing, editing and Howard Shore's potent score. Scorsese could find a spot in the Director's five but the film is too "something" and I can't think of what it is yet but whatever it is there's an overabundance. The Globes will probably snap at the film because it's very reminiscent of Scorsese's previous works like "Goodfellas" and "Gangs of New York" but there's no Weinstein's to truly get it out there and appreciated. The film rips at you from inside and leaves a lucid impingement for all areas to be felt.
9.0~Simply the most gripping movie I've seen this year lemon_magic Sign in Permalink Not everything about "The Departed" is perfect, but I don't care. I was absolutely knocked out by this movie. I'll put it this way: I have never been a real fan of Damon, DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg, thinking that they were all somewhat-to-highly overrated. But not anymore. Given a real story, and real direction, they all jump off the screen in the best performances I've ever seen from any of them. (Wahlerg's part is relatively small but he is 100% better than anything else I've seen him in). I'm even ready to forgive Alec Baldwin for becoming a bloated self-parody; he's taken what he's become and used it to great effect here, and I can hardly wait to see what he does next. The darkness, the violence, the bad language and the bleak cynicism of the screenplay may make "The Departed" a tough view for the average "soccer mom" and Oprah follower; but anyone who appreciates complexity, ambiguity and genuine moral anguish in their movies will find this movie well worth their time. In addition to all this, Jack Nicholson seems to have physically transformed into actor Rip Torn for this role, which is great...because the only actor I would have preferred to Jack in this role would have BEEN Rip Torn. I never saw the original Hong Kong movie this is based on, so I can't say how it compares, but it doesn't matter. Scorcese has proved, once again, that he is still one of the greatest directors of our time.
8.0~Brilliant movie, excellent acting performance. tom_dimaggio Sign in Permalink This movie was by far on the best last year. The main cast is excellent. Nicholson and Di Caprio have more complex roles than Damon and Wahlberg. But the 4 of them fit perfectly into the movie. The acting is just wow, ... and the story is actually quite simple in it's complexity. You can very easily see yourself in any of the main roles and "feel" what you would do in his/her shoes. The introduction was a bit on the fast side but you easily keep up after 5 minutes. There are parts in it when things happen so fast that you're still trying to "work" out what you just saw the next thing happens that makes you forget the first one. After walking out of the cinema that evening we were all still thinking about the movie for 20 minutes without talking to each other.
6.0~Fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction howard.schumann Sign in Permalink Based on the popular Hong Kong action thriller Infernal Affairs, Martin Scorsese's The Departed has kinetic energy, an outstanding ensemble cast, a world-class director, and tense non-stop action but ultimately fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction. Scorsese, whose Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas are classics of the genre, has come up with another gritty urban drama but, unlike his earlier efforts, it is filled with casual, "cartoonish" killing and a point of view that the excesses of organized crime and law enforcement are virtually indistinguishable. In an environment that does not distinguish between ends and means, there is no one to root for and those that do find a character to cheer for are begging for disappointment. Set in the mean streets of South Boston, The Departed is the story of an undercover cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) planted in the Costello crime syndicate and a mole (Matt Damon) who infiltrates the police force, pretending to be a cop. The film comes out of the gate roaring with the Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter providing the background to a street fight. The first Irish Mafioso we meet is Frank Costello, played by Jack Nicholson. In a flashback, Costello recruits a youngster named Colin Sullivan by buying groceries for his family. Later, Sullivan goes to work for Costello when he becomes a detective sergeant in the police force. Unfortunately, Mr. Nicholson performance is so over-the-top that we are all too conscious that we are watching Jack Nicholson, the actor not Frank Costello, the mob kingpin. Sullivan is played by Matt Damon as a one-dimensional Southie character just out of Good Will Hunting (I was half expecting Ben Affleck to wander into the scene with the rest of his drinking buddies). Sullivan's superiors are devout Catholic Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam in an Oscar-nominated performance by Mark Wahlberg. Dignam has the most quotable lines in the film, but his character is so foul-mouthed and antagonistic that he soon becomes tiresome. The most accomplished performance in the film is that of Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, a tough but sensitive undercover cop who comes from a family with a criminal background and fits into the Costello organization but has to swallow Valium just to stay on an even keel. There is some love interest in the film as well. Both Billy and Colin fall for the police mental health counselor Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). Ms Farmiga does a creditable job but her part is so underwritten that it feels extraneous. Both Costello and the police soon discover that they have a rat in their midst and Sullivan and Costigan are assigned the job of finding the fink. As the noose tightens, both men desperately strive to avoid detection and there is lots of action as the dead bodies pile up. The Departed is a finely crafted film, excellently photographed by Michael Ballhaus and for the most part very well acted. Unfortunately, the plot is very thin and there is little character development or seriousness of purpose. While Scorsese should be acknowledged for telling the truth about the thin line between criminals and the law, the ending is so downbeat that it leaves us wondering what point other than futility the film is trying to make. During two and one-half hours of gratuitous violence, betrayals, double-crosses, and one-note characters, the departed may include members of the exhausted audience.
10.0~Amazing Film--Stays With You Long After It's Over! MovieChickie Sign in Permalink OK, so I'm one of those people who likes indie films, and usually roots for them at the Oscars and so on. I watched Babel a few weeks ago, and that movie is REALLY GOOD (and I laughed so hard at Little Miss Sunshine, I think I peed myself a little), don't get me wrong, but there is something about The Departed that makes it basically a perfect movie. Obviously, the acting is perfect, so I won't waste your time on that. Why should you see this movie? Because of the incredible directing by Scorcese (who is not usually a favourite of mine) (I'll get back to this in a moment), and the characters that form from both the actors and the writing. So, the movie is about (NOT REALLY A SPOILER, but if you know nothing about the plot and don't want to, stop here) a cop who spies for the local gang lord, and a cop who is undercover in the gang lord's ring. But here's the thing, (and if someone has already pointed this out, I apologize for the repeat) and it's totally brilliant, they are basically the same character. They're from the same background, same age, roughly same characteristics. They are two sides of the same coin. And what makes it better is one leads a life of seemingly happiness, while the other just can't seem to win. To me, that's what makes this movie so incredibly GREAT!! And Scorcese directs this aspect of the film so perfectly, I just can't explain it. It's just perfect. Props to Monaghan (and the original Hong Kong writers) for doing this so well. And the thing I love about this is that as far as I can tell, it's really meant to be more of a gangster or action film, or that seems as though it was the original intent, but instead this jewel emerges and it's not about gunshots and running through dark alleys, drugs, strippers and whores, but about these two men and their lives in this brief intersection. INCREDIBLE MOVIE!!! SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERYONE!!!
3.0~Let down greatchicken Sign in Permalink I watched the end credits of this movie wishing I hadn't bothered. There were moments of the film when I was engrossed, but the whole thing tried too hard to be Scorcese, yet at the same time was just yet another formula Hollywood movie. Yep even Scorcese type movies have become formula. Good guy, bad guy, is the bad guy good and vice versa, who can you trust, and throw in a bit of violence, some of it that (i hope) has the intention of providing a twist. Easy. But not interesting any more. I may be a minority, but the best films I've seen recently have not been from famous directors, nor have they had casts of stellar A list actors. Think; Children of Men, Little Miss Sunshine etc. I avoided The Departed for a while because of the hype, I wish I had kept my resolve. If you must watch Scorcese, re-rent Goodfellas. Now that's a movie. (Edit:) How can other reviewers rate 9 stars and then also say they wouldn't sit through the movie again? Arrrggghhhh.
6.0~Interesting, but certainly not Scorsese at his best victor-macedo-1 Sign in Permalink This film is based on the Chinese (Hong Kong) thriller "Infernal Affairs", which in my modest opinion was much better than Scorsese's version. Certainly the editing, the directing and the acting of The Departed are all more sophisticated and more spectacular than in the Chinese film, but they sometimes tend to outshine the plot, like people wearing dinner jackets at their children's birthday party. The Departed is basically the story of two police officers working as undercover agents: Leonardo DiCaprio (who is the good guy) infiltrates a criminal organisation run by Jack Nicholson (whose performance is sometimes too over the top to be credible), whereas Matt Damon (the bad guy) is a mole for that same criminal organisation but working inside the police headquarters. The characters, though generally well played, are therefore not exactly "deep", so the film basically focuses on the twists of the story line, which had to be adapted to American tastes: there had to be a bit of romance (which might as well have been left out, as it is not essential to the film), a few references to growing up in tough neighbourhoods, a lot more violence than is absolutely necessary, a scene where Chinese criminals try to buy technology to develop a nuclear bomb (the "Iranian" and "Korean" scare), etc. These new, extra elements make the film much longer than the original version, and the last hour is painfully long as viewers are treated to a succession of boring scenes that only delay the conclusion everyone is hoping for. Martin Scorsese directed his best films in the 70s and 80s (especially classics like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull), but his more recent works have been rather disappointing: Gangs of New York was a rambling mega production about two-dimensional characters settling their scores amid no story at all; The Aviator was another mega production without a real story; The Departed is yet another millionaire production with a stellar cast but badly in need of a good plot. Has Scorsese lost his touch? Or are some viewers just not as easily convinced by his work when there are much better films like The Queen, Pan's Labyrinth, Babel or Little Children around?
5.0~Rent it don't buy it. beerandcookiez Sign in Permalink I really didn't care for it. I'd suggest renting it rather than buying it. Very disappointed, poor storyline. Ending was bad. Acting was good but how anyone would use this storyline is beyond me. If you like chick flicks, you'll love this. Its kinda like a wanna-be sopranos. So my final words are rent it if your out of ideas. Just a really bad storyline. You can tell someone was out of ideas or the movie was going over budget. They should have made it last 3 hours long and made a much better ending. Way too many ideas in the movie and plot really doesn't go anywhere. My advice is if your very intent on watching the movie, watch it until 32. After that your in a state of WTF.
10.0~The Departed is a REAL movie!! youramy1 Sign in Permalink I almost never see movies twice (there are too many out there I've missed the first time), but I saw The Departed twice in 2 days and might see it a third time. First of all, I'm a retired cop; did undercover work; investigated racketeers (most dead now, some still masquerading as fine citizens). DiCaprio blew me away (missed his other movies, now I'll go back and see them including Gangs of New York; missed The Aviator, too.)Okay, I saw the Titanic; didn't want to in the first place, hope he got a lot of money for it b/c it's something he's probably been trying to shake for a long time. But I digress....Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite movies, so I've bonded with Matt Damon from that and enjoyed him since. Obviously, Di Caprio had the better role but I cannot imagine anyone playing it better (I'm sure that excellent directing helped). What got me was how inner anger drove that character. Even when he engaged with Madolyn, he didn't go soft (okay, that sounds like a reference to Madolyn's problem with Sullivan). In watching the movie the second time, I thought what drove Sullivan was his inner child/core was good and the fact that he took the bait from Costello as a child and was groomed to be bad really did not come easily to his sense of himself, thus his "problem" with Madolyn. Of course, someone I saw the movie with didn't catch that "problem" at all. As Sullivan lay on the bed and told Madolyn he thought they could start fresh in a new city, I saw that all the deceit had just about broken Sullivan, unlike Costello who would not live any other way. There definitely was a theme of virility running through the 3 major characters: Costello had only the appearance of it/had lost it; Sullivan lacked it and only Costigan had it (I choose to believe the baby was his). I really appreciated Scorcese's movement from one character/action to the next; I heard some comments that it was choppy (not here) but it brought the "two boys" in sharp contrast. I saw Sullivan's quiet desperation and Costigan's explosive desperation more acutely. The lack of gore and lack of explicit sex was also appreciated; this brought a crispness to the pace of the movie. While I could never get away from Nicholson the actor and think of Costello as Costello, I do appreciate that it wasn't De Niro (one of my least favorite major actors) and it wasn't Pacino (one of my favorite major actors who plays this type of role too often). The one thing lacking for me was why Costello adored Costigan to the point of having his lawyer send the tapes to him as well as keeping him in his crew because he had plenty of crew without taking in a possible rat. (The cutting room floor could probably help me on that one). But then a lot of the movie had cop and bad guy incongruities and one has to give fictional movies poetic license... I hope the Academy will recognize DiCaprio and Scorcese. Kudos to Baldwin,Wahlberg and Sheen and Vera F. She was mesmerizing. Baldwin has great delivery (loved him in The Cooler).
4.0~Very disappointing richnindy Sign in Permalink I hesitate to even add a comment at this late date, especially after so many people have echoed my own disappointment with this movie, but clearly Scorsese won the Oscar because of his fine work on "Mean Streets," "Taxi Driver," "The Last Waltz," "Goodfellas," etc. I know a lot of people consider "Raging Bull" his masterpiece, and although I do not care much for it, I would even understand an Oscar given to Scorsese for it. But this bloated mess? I can't believe how LONG the damn thing is -- especially considering that the original is so much more powerful at only 100 minutes. And don't tell me the length was to provide greater character development -- the characters were much more expressive in the original and their relationships to each other were much better developed. And as others have mentioned: the profanity is nonstop, and the ending is laughable. And for once I can really say I had WAY too much of Jack Nicholson.
7.0~Brilliant...but be very awake, bright eyed and bushy tailed!! camrik505 Sign in Permalink It goes without saying that this is another piece of Scorcese excellence, however I made the idiotic mistake of watching it when I was tired and probably should have been in bed. A big mistake - you'll want to watch this when you're totally focused and enthusiastic, otherwise you'll have trouble piecing it all together and following the plot. I won't go into the story on this one; instead I'll give rundown of the actors' performances - and this is something anybody considering watching this flick will want to know given the celebrated A-List cast assembled. I have never been a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. (His performance in "The Basketball Diaries" was flawless. Other than that, he's been very ordinary). However, after watching "The Departed" I had to humble myself and admit that his delivery in this flick was nothing short of brilliant! He and Jack Nicholson carried this film, if no one else. And, in a way, this is a shame when you compare it to the other somewhat bland performances by the other cast. This is what upsets the movie and makes it seem disjointed, thus becoming a distracting factor in an otherwise brilliant film. Jack Nicholson doesn't seem to need to make any effort in his acting technique - he pulls it off each time. His performance is incredibly focused and well timed, with that trademark edge of demented deviance he brings to almost all his characters. I've ALWAYS been a Matt Damon fan. However - and I hate to admit it - but his performance here was almost wooden. I don't think it was a role he fully submitted to. Again, like a small handful of his other performances, he was playing 'Matt Damon'. You can detect a touch of self-consciousness in his delivery. However, this won't deter a lot of Damon's fans. Mark Wahlberg's arrogant cop was just passable, however I could see a touch of his 'Dirk Diggler' from "Boogie Nights" in the way he delivered his dialogue. In a documentary from the accompanying Special Features disc, he mentions that he was playing the type of cop who used to arrest him when he himself was a teen. And this seems to be precisely what he does: he imitates someone else, rather than putting his own interpretation on the role. A pity, since Wahlberg is actually a great actor. In a relatively small role, Alec Baldwin is actually outstanding. This might be the role which may reprise his career after all! Martin Sheen - do I need to comment? This guy is brilliant no matter what he does. A very focused performance. All in all, this film is incredibly well done, in true Scorcese style. A few continuity errors and audio overdubs/lip-synch changes are present, however, once immersed in the entertainment, viewers will be happy to dismiss these. (Or, perhaps, those who know and expect perfection from Scorsese may be somewhat shocked by these minor, yet mildly distracting errors.) Still highly recommended to any Scorcese fan or fans of the cast. Definitely worth the two and a half hours. SPOILER: A lot of the film's bung-ups have been mentioned already in full list, however one that I haven't yet seen is the audio overdub of Matt Damon's voice when he is asking his informants over the phone what fell off the building. His actually asks what fell off the 'roof', however the audio says, 'building'. The second time he asks the same question, both his mouth and audio deliver 'roof'.
10.0~Four Stars xander34 Sign in Permalink Jack Nicholson is widely known for playing characters like himself. The question for the audience of his latest film, The Departed, is, will you be watching his character or the grinning Nicholson we know and love? Veteran Director Martin Scorsese opens the film in a way that any speculation of whether Nicholson can pull off his nastiest role to date (his turn as The Joker in Batman comes close) vanishes on the spot. Scorsese shows Nicholson in shadows during the opening sequence, aided by The Rolling Stone's Gimme Shelter. Not until the audience has been truly sold that this is the brutal, malevolent, and immoral Frank Costello, does Nicholson's face reveal itself from under the shadows. The Departed, based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, carries some large star power. The director, Scorsese, is arguably one of the best working directors to date. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, the aforementioned Nicholson as Frank Costello, with supporting roles by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone. Catch any wind of that list of names and any expectations of this film go sky high. Yet despite gargantuan expectations for a film that was rumored to have so much tension on its set, the movie succeeds on almost every level. First off, the screenplay by William Monohan is brilliant. The fast, often surprisingly hilarious dialogue is coupled with the gripping story of two informers, one infiltrating the Boston State Police (Damon) and the other the Irish Mafia (DiCaprio). Scorsese's stylistic direction and old film school techniques assisted by Michael Ballhaus's slick cinematography make the story flow smoothly yet surprisingly fast-paced for a two and a half hour movie. The acting is phenomenal all around. DiCaprio proves his skill to everyone who denied his talent, even after his award worthy role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (his second pairing with Scorsese, the first being Gangs of New York). He truly gives a layered, emotional performance, and arguably his best. Matt Damon reminds us that he is still an extremely capable actor, yet his role feels overshadowed by DiCaprio's. Nicholson gives one of his best performances with his wild turn as Frank Costello. However, the very underrated Mark Wahlberg gives a scene stealing performance as Dignam, giving his best work to date. Just about every single word that comes out of his mouth is absolutely hilarious. Sheen also gives a surprisingly great supporting performance, as do Farmiga and Baldwin. The film is nearly perfect until a scene during its climax, where the action might appear over the top to some. But not to worry, the film's ultimate ending provides all the satisfaction one could hope for. The Departed is a remarkable film, proving that Martin Scorsese still has it after all these years, churning out what is possibly the best movie of the year.
7.0~Very well done BUT... kevin-1147 Sign in Permalink I would agree with most everyone that this movie was well done, had great acting, interesting characters and all that. BUT...for some reason when I walked out of the theater the movie failed to resonate with me at all. To me movies are supposed to provoke conversation or stir up feelings but while watching this I never felt sad, afraid, angry or really anything at all. Me and my friends who saw it hardly talked about it afterward. Being well crafted doesn't make a movie great. This one certainly will garner Oscar nominations in many categories but honestly I don't think I'll even remember it 5 years from now.
8.0~Entertaining Gangster Movie eastbergholt2002 Sign in Permalink If you like Scorsese you will definitely enjoy this movie. For those like me who are less convinced of his genius, it is still an entertaining gangster movie. Many critics voted this as the best movie made in 2006. The film is well-made but I have always failed to understand his Scorsese's films are so loved by critics. I know cops and I've worked with the Russian mob and the characters in Scorsese's movies have always seemed phony to me. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) are Boston police officers. Costigan agrees to go undercover to catch local crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello runs a protection racket and sells drugs. Some of Costigan's family members have a background in crime, so he is accepted into the gang. Sullivan has known Costello since childhood and becomes his mole in the police department. Costello's tips allow Sullivan achieve accelerated promotion and become the superstar of the police department. Damon and DiCaprio spend most of the film trying to unmask each other. They also become involved with the same woman (Vera Farmiga), a therapist. In Scorsese's world everyone men are macho sociopaths. There is plenty of high decibel screaming and swearing. His characters don't mind killing and torturing and violence is just another form of communication. Women are either whores or mothers or like Vera Farmiga's character they act like both. The cops and villains seem interchangeable. In fact half the thugs seem to be working for some government agency. Police Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) seems to be the only normal guy in the movie. The police behavior is occasionally so extreme that the movie loses credibility. Sullivan's boss, Alec Baldwin, beats up a police technician because he makes a mistake. Sergeant Digham (Mark Wahlberg)abuses everyone and gets into fisticuffs with both Damon and DiCaprio who are supposed to be on his side. Sullivan seems to be in it for the money, but none of his colleagues questions how a police officer in his twenties can afford to live in a large expensive apartment in the Beacon Hill area of Boston. It's not clear why DiCaprio, with a 1400 SAT score, would agree to go undercover and mix with psychos for an indefinite period. The movie has a cast of superstars, but Damon and DiCaprio both seem a little too familiar and congenial to be believable tough guys. Nicholson looked as if he had wandered in from a romantic comedy. He seemed too old and lacked the menace the part demanded. DiCaprio gives a one note performance as a grim, angry man. That said, if you like crime dramas you will be entertained. There is plenty of action and the actors ham it up to attract your attention.
6.0~OK movie, good acting, but Best Picture? No, and fizzles out at the end pc95 Sign in Permalink This movie has good performances from many of the leads, especially Dicaprio and Nicholson, but it's no-where near a best picture. The last 10 minutes or so got pretty ridiculous considered how long the movie dragged on. Yes it's supposed to be an epic crime yarn, but let's just have one more main character whacked for good measure at the end to make it a bloody mess literally. It's convoluted poorly - the ending knocked it down a bit. This is not Good-Fellas which was a better movie with better characters and more interesting from the social point of supposed crime and gangsters. Instead of a crime drama, The Departed is in essence a double cat and mouse game that feels overlong. Anyway, editing might've done the movie well. The side plot romance also was too much of a plot device. Anyway, a bit disappointing. Finished review....now, Last year's Crash showed how fickle and utterly poor the Academy's selecting is...The Departed as Best Picture is further proof that the Academy are lemmings giving-way to political tendencies rather than merit. In hindsight after seeing most of the candidates, Letters from Iwo Jima probably had the most merit. Anyway, if you like any of the lead actors, maybe worth a viewing.
5.0~Just another cop movie electriconion99 Sign in Permalink If you're looking for a good enough, but too long cop movie, THE DEPARTED is a good bet. If you're looking for a masterpiece, move on, because you won't find one. If it weren't for Scorsese's name on the credits no-one would be looking for one either, so you could say it starts off at a disadvantage. This is solid studio formula film-making, trying to give the illusion of substance by overloading the cast. In story terms it's a good premise with some good scenes that don't really compensate for the weak spots. It's at its best when De Caprio or Wahlberg are on screen, and at it's very worst when Sheen and Nicholson are centre-stage. Both elder statesmen turn in over the top cartoons that just stop the film dead for a bit of grandstanding. The rest of the cast vary, but Ray Winstone really should find a new ac, because his tough guy act is almost as much self-parody as Nicholson's scary monster mobster. Don't expect too much, and you'll probably feel satisfied. Just don't go looking for something this film isn't. It's just another studio picture that wants to be a blockbuster more than it wants to be a really good film.
1.0~I departed, and so did everyone else janet-f Sign in Permalink This film should be rated for language: not suitable for any age. I saw it in Argentina. At the cinema, there was one showing a day, at 11:45pm, and there were stern warnings that only adults could buy tickets. The language was so coarse and untranslatable that the audience gave up and left. I was the last to leave -- eerily watching the images continue on the screen in front of an empty room. I did discover that nearly all the characters were lying to each other, so it did not really matter that we could not understand what was being said. Upon my return to the US, I saw that the DVD is available and is labeled "not authorized for sale or rental outside the US and Canada." If only that had been the general policy for this film, we would not have exported such an embarrassment for US culture and especially for the City of Boston and Massachusetts State Police. In Spanish, the title of the movie is "Los infiltrados" which does not have the meaning of "departed," but everybody in the theater joined the departed, anyway.
8.0~Score for The Score man himself ghostfiendghost Sign in Permalink Every A List actor except Mark walburger man dies Hollywood is doomed
6.0~More style than substance doctorx2 Sign in Permalink Had The Departed been released in, say, 1986, it would have been stylish, edgy, and intense. But in 2006 it comes across as more an homage to the violent organized crime film genre (e.g., LA Confidential, Goodfellas, Traffic) than a stand-alone original work. After his many decades of solid direction, it was kind of the Academy of Motion Picture Artists to finally bestow the Best Director Award on Martin Scorcese for The Departed, although his 1990 effort, Goodfellas, was tighter, more innovative, and overall a better film. In The Departed Scorcese is assisted by an A-list cast of male actors: Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio and Damon deliver solid performances, although Damon's portrayal of the ethically flawed man (a la The Good Shepherd, Syriana) is becoming almost type-casting for him. Nicholson is big box office and always amusing to watch, but similar to the big stars of old Hollywood (e.g., John Wayne) he is more Jack Nicholson than any character he portrays, and not a truly great actor. In The Departed his on-again, off-again Boston accent was distracting. It also seemed that Jack's "screen persona" was being capitalized upon, with the florid torrent of obscenities and outrageous facial expressions his character displayed for the duration of the film. Conspicuously absent were A-list female actors, which also became distracting as the love triangle evolved between Damon, DiCaprio, and the female lead, Vera Farmiga. The viewer repeatedly wondered "who the heck is that actress?" The most solid and impressive performances were delivered by the supporting cast, notably Alec Baldwin (who is becoming the most venerable character actor of our generation); Martin Sheen (sort of the Hal Holbrook of our time, oft cast as "the man of integrity"); Mark Wahlberg (whose somewhat limited but important role was delivered with more energy and sincerity than any of the three principal players); and Ray Winstone, whose Mr. French was 100% on the money. The Boston setting is to die for, and the apparently unlimited budget allowed for elaborate sets, location shots, and special effects (shootouts and the like), so the film is visually appealing. The soundtrack weaves in and out with contemporary and traditional music, which feels stylish and modern, if not especially innovative. Sadly, the scripting was a bit flat, and many key scenes plodded along without evoking a lot of tension. The story itself was entirely predictable, with the exception of the "twist" ending, wherein another member of Nicholson's organization emerges unexpectedly as one of the cops who's been there all along, but only makes himself know at the very end of the film. This kind of writing is dismaying; it defies continuity, is thrown in merely for shock value, and cheapens the integrity of the entire story. It confirmed the sense of ultimate disappointment this viewer got from this film. All that being said, IF you are in the mood for a violent cops and robbers film, it is worth the cost of a rental. I am not sure what female viewers would think of the film (having heard from only two, who didn't enjoy it), but my impression is that The Departed is best viewed with some male friends, or alone with a six pack.
8.0~Outstanding...until the end miguelesmalo Sign in Permalink WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS I was at the edge of my seat, feeling sentiment for all characters, until everyone died in the end (almost everyone). The acting was incredible all around from main to minor roles. The screenplay was excellent. The plot was very dynamic. After reading several reviews, I was unsure why many comments compared the movie to Internal Affairs. In Internal Affairs, Garcia's character knew the entire movie that Richard Gere was the crooked cop. In this movie, DiCaprio had no idea who the was the crooked cop. The movie seemed to me more like Donny Brosco. DiCaprio's character experienced the same anxiety as Johnny Depp, both as undercover police officers inside the mob. The different angle for Departed, was that the mafia had an inside man penetrating the police. Half way through the movie I thought to myself that was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Then everyone in the end got shot in the head...in succession. It became so ridiculous during the elevator scene, laughter rang out through out the theater, and my wife shouted, "This is stupid." There could have been several better endings, either the "good guys" or "bad guys" winning. Such as Damon killing DiCaprio, and then Wahlburg finding the tape recordings on his desk. Something to leave you thinking, rather than the simple ending: kill everyone. Despite the ending, a wonderful movie worth watching at least twice. It ranks among the great mafia movies after Godfather I, Good Fellas, Casino, and Donnie Brasco.
4.0~not so great skillsaul Sign in Permalink The Departed is an occasionally engaging film, beautifully acted and photographed. It has powerful narrative energy as it breathlessly races the viewer through a complex plot. However, the praise for this film has been far overblown. The Departed is not as inventive as Taxi Driver and not startling and sublime like Raging Bull. In fact, Scorcese's new film is overly long and somewhat tedious. The contrived plot seems banal, and neither Di Caprio nor the bland Damon make their roles particularly interesting. Sadly, despite his technical virtuosity, it becomes apparent here that Scorcese has little more to say about his themes of urban alienation and the brutality of modern life. The film is grotesquely violent at times, and the viewer begins to wonder as yet another bloody shooting "goes down." Unfortunately, the shallowness of this film and its predictable brain-spraying violence disappoint the Scorcese fan.
5.0~So-So Effort finneganmichael04 Sign in Permalink I watched this movie (again) last night and it finally dawned on me what bothered me about it the first time I saw it. It's actually a pretty weak story. Too many big names.(very distracting). Pretty weak acting. Especially Sheen, Nicholson and Wahlberg. I really like Scorsese and Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films but The Departed isn't even in its league. Jack shows up, well, as Jack. I think the last time Nicholson actually played a character, other than himself, Reagan was still in office. I don't buy him as a powerful Irish Mob boss for a minute. Wahlberg just yells and cusses a lot for no good reason. And Sheen looks kinda like he had a minor stroke before filming started. He looks like he's trying not to soil himself in every scene he's in. Not a bad movie but Best Film?? Really?? I also noticed the Boston Police Department is portrayed as an inept bunch of clowns who do nothing but yell, cuss, and argue instead actually doing any police work. 5 stars.
5.0~Excellent actors, brilliant idea, smart beginning... Close_The_Door Sign in Permalink ... but perhaps I was expecting too much after all that? FOR The theme of the film was very interesting, and the editing was very good. Especially the beginning, I said, was extremely credible and I appreciated a lot the depiction of the complexity of real life in a police department and the difficulties ordinary policemen may face in their job. I truly valued the characters and the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio (Costigan), Matt Damon (Sullivan) Mark Wahlberg (Dignam) and Martin Sheen (Queenan). AGAINST I consider Jack Nicholson (Costello) has become the parody of himself. Moreover, there was a confrontation between Leonardo DiCaprio/Billy Costigan and Jack Nicholson/Frank Costello which made me literally burst laughing out loud in the cinema. The lines were absurd! And I'm afraid Europeans don't enjoy butcheries either, as at the end of the film everybody in the cinema was laughing. Vote: 7/10
10.0~all hail the mighty Scorsese luna_bella81 Sign in Permalink i didn't think it was possible for Scorsese to out shine himself, but he has achieved it with this film. everyone brought their A games to this show down. how scorsese makes his villains hilarious speaks volumes of his understanding of characters boarding on insanity. i've waited for this collaboration for years. nicholson shows that he is truly the villain of all villains. stellar performances by leo, damon, wahlberg, baldwin, and sheen. a powerhouse script. amazing absolutely amazing. i couldn't help but laugh at the frightened twentysomething next to me who obviously had never seen a scorsese flick as evidence by the fact that she nearly had her eyes shut through the entire film. someone should have told her, when you come to see scorsese you better come correct.
10.0~Scorsese for Best Director mooseman21 Sign in Permalink OK Scorsese better get the Best Director nod this time around for The Departed! I mean what more does this guy have to do. His movies are timeless and he deserves an Oscar more than anybody. Losing to Clint Eastwood for Million Dollar Baby was a tough one. The movie was really good and Eastwood has a particular style like no other. However, Scorsese did an excellent job directing The Aviator. That was not an easy one to do! I thought that movie was great. 2 1/2 hours of pure entertainment. Then we can down the whole list of his Oscar nominated movies. What was the movie he lost to when he was up for Raging Bull? Yeah exactly it's already forgotten. Well I hope he gets it this time around. I hope Scorsese and DiCaprio team many times more in the future. He has found his new Robert DeNiro.
1.0~America filling her cup omaldy_subs Sign in Permalink Yesterday I've seen a Nicholas Cage movie where after a lot of tension, he ends up in a... wicker cage - no pun intended - and... dies. Now this movie... America, what's happening? Listen, I'm Romanian and I keep blasting from the mike in a radio station where I work that Romanian movies suck because most of them lack morals and happy endings. The result is - people are despondent and try to get the heck out of Romania (even though we're all A LOT better off than when the dictator Ceaushescu lived). Movies and art in general should give people hope and a moral answer to the problems of life. Don't be deceived: the human intellect is becoming what it's feeding upon. You cannot watch something dirty and remain untainted, clean and pure! It seems to me that mindless, irresponsible individuals literally sell their souls to the devil in order to spread the moral decay and stupid pride that has been the fall of ALL the empires of the world. Which brings me to the title I gave these lines. America is filling her cup. God is looking at his watch. One day He'll say: "Well, nothing good is ever going to come out of this one." And the credits will roll as in a movie. I admire the great achievements of the American people, but you guys should get up and say: "We are a Christian people. Here: It's written on the dollar bill. Let's show Mr. Scorsese that he has got to earn these bills by cleaning up the foul language, the blood and the repulsive subjects he drools over!" Guys, I love America, but it's painful to see that her people are getting away from God as time goes by. Here in Romania they want the Orthodox Church be the first and last of our beliefs. Yeah, yeah, we have rights... but they put icons in schools and they want Protestants such as myself to feel it's OK... well, it's not OK! No religion in schools! Why don't they kick Darwin with his theory of evolution from schools, since they are so Christianly-oriented? I mean we were created after God's own image, right? Or... we evolved? This ought to be a dilemma... If God let us EVOLVE into His own image, why doesn't the Bible state this? Anyway, if we get back to our horror of a movie, it seems Hollywood thinks happy endings are obsolete. "We must give the people's minds something new to feed upon. WHAT IF I just die? What if the order of things is: YOU CAN'T WIN?" Sounds familiar? What keeps the people from killing themselves... "but that the dread of something after death..." as the Scorsese of the late 16th and early 17th century put it? Who needs this kind of "food", people? Can you put it in front of your children? It's not good for their mind? What makes YOUR mind impermeable to violence, foul language and pornography? Pray remember: we do not teach our children and others what we know. We ultimately teach them what we are. omaldy_subs@yahoo.com
9.0~my notes sstrunks-05245 Sign in Permalink Amazing movie with an amazing story connecting a bunch of people in ways they didn't realize. amazing acting from everyone throughout the movie. amazing directing with powerful scenes. so many things were subtly implied instead of just telling you, a treat for the advanced movie watchers. (about 4 viewings) SPOILERS what happens in the story seems "realistic" and what would happen in real life even tho it was not what the crowd wanted. the last 15 minutes of the movie were so shocking and blunt but made perfect sense and what dignam did at the end was perfect
10.0~Scorsese is in his prime with The Departed bobarino Sign in Permalink If there was any doubt about Martin Scorsese's craft as a film director, The Departed silences any critic of his. However, if there was any doubt in the first place I highly suggest quitting movies. Scorsese delivers an epic in a time where movies are being churned out with no emotion, no connection to the viewer, and reliance on gimmicks so the studios can earn a little dough and taking the prized honor of being the number 1 listed movie on a 12 year old kid's myspace page. The Departed delivers in every facet. The cinematography is well crafted - the camera positions to grasp the scene in its fullest while avoiding being generic and also straying away from overly "artsy" camera angles that make the film unwatchable. In fact, The Departed is probably Scorsese's most rewatchable film. There are more twists than a Chubby Checker concert which will make you both gasp and let out sighs of relief. The characters are believable and engaging. Jack Nicholson plays one the most accessible of all the mob villains of Scorsese's past. He is complete slime, but his demeanor is that of an uncle who permits you to watch the TV shows that your parents told you not to. Matt Damon as Colin is like one of those pompous pricks who cheat repeatedly and get away with it, and Leo as Billy Costigan grows on the viewer and as a character through his dangerous line of work as a police informant. The Departed is an American masterpiece.
3.0~It is not as good as it is tetsulovespunk Sign in Permalink I gave this movie 3 score because of the performance,and it was the only reason that the Departed got its applauds. I watched the original Hong-Kong movie before so I am able to know how bad this adaptation as. The music is bad taste. The plot is not well organized. After all, I became to hate the Director who didn't give a damn to other country's people in that he took no responsibility to convey to the ordinary Americans that we Chinese were war-lovers who always wanted to throw bombs on Taiwan's land. It's bullshit! I can't believe that it's the same director who shot so many masterpieces such as Taxi driver and Goodfellas. In the end, I really recommend you Americans to take a try at the original Hong-Kong edition!
5.0~Less than the sum of its parts imdbuce Sign in Permalink How can a remake of a great film by a great director with a good cast end up being less than the sum of its parts? We can blame it on the writer, William Monahan, who adapted it from the film Infernal Affairs. In Monahan's hands, he managed to rip out the heart of the original film leaving only the superficial cops and robbers story. Monahan turned a psychological thriller about the difficult choices complex characters face into a standard "I-am-undercover-and-I'll- do-anything-to-cover-my-butt" cop movie. Not that the superficial cops and robbers story is bad, it just isn't enough of a reason to remake a movie. If you have not seen Infernal Affairs, see it. Then go back and see this movie again. Then tell me that they really needed Mark Wahlberg's character and the Hollywood ending.
10.0~Cops and Robbers At It's Best! ajweiner-1 Sign in Permalink The twist and turns in this movie are unpredictable. But the plot, perfectly simple. This all adds up to a flawless emotionally packed who's-who crime drama with a bit of pulp to say the least. There is no one better to direct a crime drama, then Martin Scorsese. There's only one powerhouse director that could have pulled this cast of many superstars together, yet it not get in the way of the characters. You can't find a better cast! To top it all off, Scorsese once again merged music into film better than anyone, where the emotion of the music enhanced the image on screen. Having said that, and of course the soundtrack had to be a throwback to my favorite kind of music. As the classic rock soundtrack magically weaved itself from the beginning scene until the end, the cast of music stars seemed to echo the film stars. The music artists and song choices were if God came down to Scorsese and said that he has one list of songs that he can take with him to heaven. It absolutely hypnotized me. Ironically, the soundtrack gave the movie a modern or more perhaps shall I say timeless feel. I can't wait to see this movie again and again on DVD.
1.0~I hope this qualifies as a spoiler as the movie stinks okieindian Sign in Permalink That movies such as this are put up for awards is amazing to me. There was some fine acting, but the plot must have been left on the cutting room floor. It was another of those boring attempts by some pseudo-intellects to present who knows what. My sister in law watched half the movie, went out to get a coke, walked back into the wrong theater and sat there 30 minutes before she knew it was not the same movie. It IS that disjointed. She liked the other movie better. I did not see that one and I'm sure I liked it better also. I was bitterly disappointed that such a highly praised movie turned out to be such a PRIZE WINNING dud...
8.0~Another Scorscese Masterpiece ... jawwadaltaf Sign in Permalink Well what can one say about Martin Scorscese, everything he touches turns to Gold and so is the recent masterpiece. For sure the best movie I have seen this year. The thing with Scorscese is you give him any story and he will direct it in a way that it appeals and leaves an impression. Even weak storyline("Gangs of Newyork") are turned into directional masterpieces. This one however does have a potent script, and the acting by all the players is definitely good. I have always believed in giving credit to the director for Good or Bad acting. He is the captain of the ship and can work his crew around guidelines he so wishes. I am pretty confident he can even make Tom Cruise act better, and if you can do that, you're good... and Martin Scorscese definitely is. The departed is A Must See !!
1.0~An Endless, Terrible Mess RICKY-12 Sign in Permalink What has happened to Scorcese? This film is just plain bad on so many levels, from the dreadful lead actress, to the hackneyed and confusing and badly structured & written script. There are bells and whistles aplenty, but bad acting, verbose storytelling, and general filmic desperation are the salient aspects of this bad film. Scorcese deserves the Oscar for Mean Streets, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, but if he wins one for this dreadful movie, well, that's Hollywood. It seems Scorcese has been in Hollywood too long and is trying to impress the suits by parodying his early work...
1.0~Is Marty making fun of us? Utter disappointment... dumouchk Sign in Permalink A waste of talent, all around. Users have voted this #62 of all movies in the IMDb database? Are you kidding me?! Wake up, people - Scorsese isn't even trying anymore. The film was amateur at best, insulting at worst. The unnecessary homophobia and unresolved plot chunks (I hesitate to call 20 minute digressions "threads") were pointless, detracted from the 'plot' (I'm comfortable with the scare quotes), and left totally unresolved. Character development, consistency...give us something to hang to here, Marty. Total disappointment.
3.0~You know what, I didn't like it! himdol666 Sign in Permalink You know what? I really didn't like this movie. I saw it a little while ago... & honestly i found this to be so pointless. I just watched Babel... & I told myself,god this movie should have won best picture,not The Departed, because in Babel the twists & turns are so well put, that its unbelievable. But in the Departed, the irony of Jack Nicholson trusting the only person he shouldn't trust is just stupid to me...I will NEVER forget the general laughter at the end of that movie,when all the brains were splattering on the walls. It was pointless and gratuitous and gave a false impression of the police. I mean there ARE moles but this was just gratuitous violence and a pointless depicting,very wrongly made. I'm sorry to say that this movie was too f***ing over-rated(excuse my language) but this movie was really realllllllyyy bad & boring. It had its cute scenes,for instance the misspelling on the envelope,that Leo made on purpose,so he could track it. & for those who are wondering WHAT was in the envelope that Leo gave to Matt's girlfriend(I don't remember her name anymore....it was THAT bad:P) well it was the evidence against the entire mafia, against jack Nicholson in particular, simply because he was completely surprised when he figured out that Matt was the mole;) hehe there you go I SAID IT! :P It was a bad movie, thats all I want to say. It was so cheesy & gory that it really died for me. Shame on you Scorsese....i am VERY disappointed.
2.0~Sad, sad, sad aurlb Sign in Permalink Granted, it’s pretty well shot. Although… in between two brilliant pieces of cinema, you have many talking heads with reverse angle shots. Not easy to do away with that when you tell a story for the cinema. Granted, it’s pretty well acted, especially by Leonardo Di Caprio. But what does this movie say about life? What is the point? Also who is the protagonist? Whom are we supposed to identify with? Logically, it should be Billy (Leonardo Di Caprio) who is the honest cop undercover in the mob. But since we often follow Colin whose character has been given Matt Damon’s pretty mug, it’s not that clear. The double romance is not milked at all. It’s just shown in parallel. And on top of that too many characters play a double game. Even the bad guy (Jack Nicholson) is an informer for the FBI. One of the thugs doesn’t turn Billy in although he has understood who he is. If “The departed” is 43 on the IMDb top list, before “City lights” , “Groundhog day” and “Mr Smith goes to Washington” we are in big trouble. Sad, sad, sad.
9.0~Awesome Remake jayk_bakner Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese! The greatest director never to win an Oscar? Or overrated, homophobic trash-monger? You hear a lot of things thrown about concerning the mono-browed director. But whatever is said about him, he's delivered something special with The Departed. Essentially an 'adaptation' - I'm tentative to use 'remake', for reasons discussed later - of a hugely successful Hong Kong cop thriller, Infernal Affairs. The action takes place in Boston, USA, and follows two men - Leo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan and Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan - from opposite sides of the law. Costigan is a cop (of sorts) who goes into deep cover in the Boston Irish Mafia; Sullivan is a mafia plant within the Police Force itself. And basically, they're assigned to find out each-other's identities. What follows is a fantastically tense movie; masterfully directed by Scorsese in such a visceral and epic manner that you just get caught up in it all. Honestly, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen - despite it being just over two-and-a-half hours long! It's truly an achievement that Scorsese is able to hold a movie-goer's attention for such time; all the characters are compelling, the plot twists and turns, and goes through a fantastic series of close calls before reaching it's more than a little bit iconic showdown. Another surprise is the quality of the performances; in particular, that of the two central leads. DiCaprio simmers brilliantly as the troubled police mole Costigan - whose position means he has absolutely no idea who to trust, and DiCaprio capitalises on this fact by infusing Costigan with an incredible sense of desperation, both to retain his own identity and to find out Sullivan's. Damon (a few odd accent moments aside) is in parts evil little **** and enigmatic young detective; balancing the two aspects of his character brilliantly. Jack Nicholson devours scenery as the ridiculously - occasionally hilariously - malicious Frank Costello, juggling the more humorous parts of the character perfectly with a mean streak a mile wide, and relative newcomer Vera Farmiga brings a touch of sass to the ensemble, with her sensuous police psychiatrist Madolyn becoming romantically involved with both protagonists. But the true star of the show is Mark Wahlberg - which is a shock to say the least. He's only got a supporting role, but he grabs it with both hands and wrings it for all he's worth. He's on screen with such quality actors as Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, and his brash, foul-mouthed portrayal of Dectective Dignam - one of Costigan's handlers - drags your eye straight to him. That and he gets some of the best lines in the film - 'Maybe...maybe not. Maybe **** yourself!' being one of my favoured examples (you'll get it if you watch it). Now, 'remake'. I said I didn't like using that term to describe this particular film, instead preferring 'adaptation'. This is because, whilst it does share major plot-points with Infernal Affairs, it is vastly different in it's handling. Infernal Affairs is a ridiculously serious, slow-paced cop thriller, whereas The Departed - whilst not exactly light-hearted - is a lot less serious, and there are actual some genuinely funny - occasionally in a bizarre, slightly twisted way - moments. It's also a lot faster in pace - despite the 150-minute running time - and all these things means it views as almost a completely different film. Basically, this is a damn fine film. It's in parts nerve-wrackingly tense, thrillingly exciting and funny in the kind of way that you know you really shouldn't be laughing, and it all comes together beautifully. I honestly couldn't recommend this film more, both to fans of Infernal Affairs, and to newcomers to the series.It's by no means ground-breaking, nor highly original, but it is an entertaining piece of film-making that you should definitely check out if you can!
10.0~Departed ... a Suspense Thriller for Men otis_hill-1 Sign in Permalink It isn't often I give a MUST SEE recommendation, so lets cut through all the bull Departed is that one movie really worth seeing even for $10 a ticket. I give Departed 5-stars out of 5. To get a 5-star rating in my book, a movie must have a very interesting story; great writing to tell that story; great directing to interpret the story; great characters; great visuals; and great acting. Departed has them all and Jack (Nicholson) doing his best work in ages. Director Martin Scorsese made the large big name ensemble cast put their bigger ego's aside and what we get is the best of movie making. Yes Jack dominates as Jack will, but Leonardo DiCaprio, who I initially thought was miscast, is terrific. Matt Damon who I also couldn't see as a Mass "Statey" has perhaps the best role he's had to date and gives by far the best acting he's done. And add to that a solid supporting cast including Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg (putting aside for ever all those snide remarks about "Marky Mark") and even a decent performance by Alec Baldwin. Departed is a "Man's Movie" with several strong male leads. It has only two women in the movie and they are both minor roles... one, of Jack's girlfriend is a throwaway. The story revolves around a crime boss in South Boston's "Irish Mafia"  think Whitey Bulger  and two Massachusetts State Cops, one who has infiltrated Jack's boys and the other a crooked cop on Jack's payroll. To add tension each "Rat" is trying to identify the other first in a kill or be killed suspense story.
6.0~I like this film, but I certainly don't love it o-31546 Sign in Permalink "Infernal Affairs" is one of the most successful films in Asia, and it became internationally known when Martin Scorsese adapted it to shoot "The Departed". This is a very good movie - I loved the parallel stories of the undercover cop (DiCaprio) and the bent cop (Damon.) Listening to their Bostonian accents made me think they'd be perfect as the Kennedy brothers - they certainly look the part, especially Damon. So many great performers here - including Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga - and of course, whenever Jack Nicholson is on screen he just wipes everyone else out by sheer force of charisma. He's not only a great actor, but one of the few true stars still with us. But the Chinese one still a better version than the Departed.What the remake did wrong was making the girlfriends of our protagonists into the same person, adding a love triangle, which was unnecessary and distracting. ---From Yidioo
8.0~Oscar???? Idgykitty Sign in Permalink Best movie i have seen this year ,so ,i reckon it is probably justified as the best picture. But yea its a great story with some great performances,similar to Crash really,but for an Oscar as best Pic don't you think it should be more than just a good story. Now i'm confusing myself,i suppose the purpose of this web site is too recommend a movie and avoid anyone watching the dross they produce nowadays ,so that in itself ,i will conclude that The Departed is a very well recommended movie which we enjoyed immensely.........but is it an Oscar winning. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course Jack Nicholson puts in another quirky performance that we expect of him and i am never disappointed with Jacks name in the credits.Martin Scorcesse once points fun in the direction of the criminal and organised crime,sometimes i think that it glamorises ,but hey its a movie.Thought the sex scene was a tad unnecessary,but no real overuse of bad language.great really enjoyed.
10.0~If you are going to see one movie in the theaters this year, see The Departed! Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink Oh, my God, what an incredible film! Of course, how could we ever expect anything less from Martin Scorcesse?! He is so brilliant and has brought us another instant mafia classic! He's working with the big stars today, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Anthony Anderson, you get the idea. The Departed lives up to it's reviews, plus more! It's about a man named William, played by DiCaprio, he's trying his best to be a cop, but do to his violent past and family, is put on probation and can only join if he does a special assignment for Oliver, Martin Sheen, and Digman, Mark Wahlberg. That is to spy on Frank, played by Jack Nicholson, the leader of the mafia in Boston, and find out information that will put him behind bars. But there is one other problem, there is a rat in the FBI gang that William is trying to get into, Colin is informing Frank that there is a rat in his mafia gang and will capture William. Who's the true rat? You'll just have to see! This movie is amazing on so many levels, it's not just the acting or picture, it's the story. It kept me going 'till the end, I just loved every scene. I think my favorite was how one of the mobsters, not knowing that Leo is the rat, tells him to meet them at an address where the unknown rat is with the chief of the FBI is, and he gives Leo the wrong address accidentally, but... well, if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about, but I don't want to give any spoilers. This is without a doubt the best movie of 2006 hands down! Has anyone else noticed why movies are getting better this year? They are being directed by the classic artist: Martin Scorcesse and Francis Ford Coppola! The real artists, they are incredible and are bringing us terrific films! Please, like I said, see this movie the theater! You will not be disappointed! 10/10
10.0~Don't compare with Infernal Affairs marvin344 Sign in Permalink I went to see this film yesterday after reading all the wonderful comments along with some slightly bitter comments from people that have watched Infernal Affairs and were not entirely happy with Scorsese's take on the Hong Kong original. The first comment I would like to make is that I saw the original Infernal Affairs a week ago meaning that it is still fresh in my memory. That film was a very complex thriller that got straight to the point. The Departed on the other hand focuses on story telling and whilst staying faithful to the original, it becomes its own film. Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development. If fans were expecting a shot-for-shot remake, they obviously don't understand why Scorsese is regarded as one of the best directors of all time. The acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles. Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year. Offcourse no film is perfect (Although this comes close) but the only disappointing aspect of the film will be from the perspective of those that have seen the original. I am ultimately referring to the ending. Whilst anyone seeing this film for the first time will most probably embrace the climax, anyone that has seen the original will know what I mean. That aside, this movie has marked its place alongside such classics as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Scarface.
9.0~One of the best movies I have seen in years egarry Sign in Permalink This was without doubt one of the most entertaining edge of the seat clever thrillers to come out in years and I hardly noticed the two and a half hours going by. The cast is the strongest i have ever seen assembled and no one disappoints. Jack Nicholson is awesome in the sleazy old time gangster role and Mark Wahlberg puts in one of his best performances ever. The two lead characters who I have never liked in most f their movies before are strong and Dicaprio obliviously likes working with Scorsese. All in all a classic that is up there with Goodfellas, Scarface and Carlitos Way. Superb Stuff. If this does not get Scorsese a long awaited Oscar then it is a crime.
5.0~Shame on you Martin dswanson35 Sign in Permalink How over the top will this movie be? How many times will Jack Nicholson do his Satan face in one movie? Will we see Leonoardo be an apprentice to another gangster? Is this an Irish Goodfellows or Gangs of New York set in Boston? And...just how many really bad Irish accents will we hear in one night? How many brain spatters can you have in one movie? Jack Nicholson dropping in and out of his accent and Martin Sheen sounding like John Kennedy made some scenes look like Saturday Night Live parodies. After the finish that put most of the characters out of their misery, it was a relief to put this movie out of its misery. I was looking forward to this, hoping that maybe this time Scorsese would finally get his Oscar. After all, had had half of the major male lead actors in Hollywood - Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, Matt Damon, Mattin Sheen. By the time this movie wound down to its end, the mainly middle aged adult, affluent audience (not the crowd I associate with laughing at extreme violence) was reduced to chuckles and relief when the credits started to roll. What a stinker.
1.0~low hgoldenfox10 Sign in Permalink I don't want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get (or will get)a bigger success then the original movie.I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original. It is better to search for original ideas then to play the role of the copycat in our society. I wanted to say my opinion to those who appreciate the American movie industry so much.(and surely this movie) good examples of remaked movies are : the ring , the grudge , the seven samurai, Godzilla , (masked rider) and more (they planned also to make an American version of Battle royale) Even if they remake it well they will never win my respect and i will consider it like fake. thank you
10.0~Scorcese in my top three movie makers of all time craigsh11 Sign in Permalink I have loved Martin Scorcese for years and never realized that he had not won an Oscar. Jeez, Raging Bull alone should have garnered one... anyway. When I went to the theater, I knew that I would see a great film but also a grotesquely bloody one. Both assumptions came true. Jack Nicholson was at his best since Cukoo's Nest, Matt Damon was great, Leonardo DiCaprio (whom I've not liked since Titantic) was very good. Mark Wahlburg Was my favorite however and for the first half of the movie I was thinking he was going to turn out to be the mole in the cops because he was so in-your-face anti-criminal. I love Scorcese's use of period music, this was first best seen/heard in Goodfellas and his use of comedic dialogue between bad guys. I disagree with any of your reviewers who said the movie was too long, MS needs every moment of movie time to weave his films. BUT, I had to turn my head/cover my eyes at least 6 times knowing there was going to be yet another head shot with too-realistic splatter (This is from a guy who used to watch Scarface every weekend for a year). I would not attend or tolerate such gruesome killings in any movie but one by Martin Scorcese (loved Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver and have seen all multiple times). If Raging Bull had been in color I doubt if I would have seen it more than once. My other two favorite film makers are Woody Allen and Spike Lee (Clockers was produced, incidentally by Martin Scorcese). I would completely recommend this film for any adult without combat experiences because it would surely evoke PTSD-like flashbacks in it's realism (I'm a psychologist BTW who works with vets daily). MS should have won Best Director multiple times already. He should win it here as well as a life-time Achievement award (I think he already has one of these no?).
3.0~Terrible Film, simply awful TouchdownGlenn83 Sign in Permalink I have seen Infernal Affairs(the original) and the Departed is really terrible in comparison. The scene for example where Damon's character pretends to be a lawyer was MUCH better acted by Andy Lau in IA. Jack Nicholson character was over the top and annoying. IMO, Jack comes off as a low class, dirty, scumbag than a "mademan" mafioso top dog. The scene with Nicholson holding the severed hand in front of Dicaprio was just an stupid scene all together. Mark Wahlberg?? What was the point of his character? All he seems to do was act like a hoodlum and curse when he is speaking. I was very impressed with the storyline, the acting, and subtlety scenes in IA, but TD just left me uninterested in the story all together and this is the SAME FILM!! THE Departed is a terrible film with bad acting, by Hollywood A-list actors. Sorry, but I didn't buy the plot, the acting, the emotions in TD. But then again what do you expect, its a Hollywood knock-off of an original. I couldn't finsh the film that was how terrible it was.
10.0~The Mean Streets of Boston zardoz-13 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese's crime thriller "The Departed" doesn't look like the typical Scorsese crime thriller because virtually everybody in it hasn't worked with him. This brilliant multi-faceted melodrama about the tooth and nail struggle to jail a well-known criminal boasts several surprises, primarily at the end and a number of sensational performances, with Jack Nicholson ably cast as Boston crime boss Frank Costello taking top honors. DeCaprio is cast as an undercover cop straight out of the academy who joins Costello's mob, while Costello grooms Matt Damon as his snitch inside the department. This cat & mouse thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as one mole in the mob circles another mole in the police, and Scorsese and scenarist William Monahan patiently construct this elaborate complex thriller without wearing out their welcome. A must-see for die-hard Scorsese fans as much as crime movie fanatics!
6.0~Not a ripoff but not a good remake!! Original was better!! harpocrates23 Sign in Permalink This film is not a carbon copy ripoff, its a bad remake of the original. The story line was kept exactly the same...so much the same that the dialogue was kept the same...exactly the same. Basically anything Hollywood takes from other countries and tries to remake it..they do it badly. Whether its Japanese horror, Chinese action films or anything for that matter..they fail. Why cant they just promote the originals instead, since those who thought them up did a great job and a much better job than Hollywood can ever do. I'm not saying nothing good comes out of Hollywood...I've seen a lot of great films from Hollywood...just never one that was made better than those who thought of the original foreign version. Do yourself a favour...don't rate this higher than the original..its disrespect to the Chinese who did a great job!!!
10.0~Fantastic Movie; A New Classic RichardJFlorinoJ Sign in Permalink Hopefully this will gain Scorsese the Director's Guild Award and an Oscar at long Last!!!! The man should have won for Taxi Driver, Raging Bull & Goodfellas!! This movie soars from the opening shots. The acting was also magnificent. DiCaprio should win best actor for the most intensely existential role since Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. You can feel the loneliness and alienation etched on his face in every shot. All were great including Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon & Jack Nicholson. Also best ensemble cast at the SAG awards is guaranteed.The camera work by Michael Ballhaus was also perfect and of course Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is again the standard to beat for the guild awards and from the Academy.
3.0~would be OK if it were not a remake - just my personal opinion cugel_the_clever Sign in Permalink When I started watching the movie I had no idea it was based on IA so it seemed like an okay flick. Not great by any stretch of the imagination but a passable B-movie with A-list actors. Mark Whalberg's character was annoying and just seemed too unstable and unfit for his position. Still marginally entertaining as I was not expecting a serious cinema and paying more attention to the visuals and Jack Nicholson's familiar antics. Once it became clear that this was a remake the whole impression just totally crumbles as you just notice only deficiencies and see no added value. To be fair it's not a one star movie characters are two-dimensional but there's some entertainment and shock value in it. Finally movies are goods to be sold let's be honest how many people among the average US movie going public have heard or watched IA? Like one performer said once "people will gobble it up anyway" so that's another McMovie
1.0~Tripe wisewebwoman Sign in Permalink I'm still in shock that Martin Scorsese (who had such a hungry look on his face all through the preambles) got an Oscar for this senseless, blood-filled, curse-filled, demeaning, poorly acted and executed effort. I saw the ratings on IMDb and thought (after I had sat through the painful time it took me to watch this dreadful dumbed down copy of the Japanese original - Internal Affairs) that this is a joke, right? It must be whole truckloads of families of the many involved in this shambles rating the movie on IMDb. Anyone with even a knuckle-dragging IQ couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, admire this effort. Seriously. I don't understand what Mark Wahlberg was doing in it. At all. Apart from insulting (the all male) team by calling them GIRLS. Oh what an insult. I should have walked then. And the shrink, breaching every ethic in the book without a blink and a moronic dialogue burbling from her lips. One doesn't believe her for a second. And Jack Nicholson right out of The Shining - and this performance continued even to Oscar night - Jack leering at one and all and showing a lot of teeth and just being POPULAR. Irish Mafia. Indeed. More like the court jester to Martin's king. And on. I could write pages and pages but what's the point. There was no character development, no bonding of the chief and the mole (a very basic part of the original plot) downright plagiarism in parts. I was constantly confused between the characters played by the ingratiating Leonardo DiCaprio and the smarmy Matt Damon. They look/act/behave/hairdyed the very same. The movie paying public shouldn't have to work so hard at character identification with each scene. A plot and better direction and a modicum of a screenplay would have helped. Appalling waste of time and money. 1 out of 10 because IMDb doesn't allow a minus or a zero. Avoid.
10.0~best movie ever!!! atallahban Sign in Permalink just kidding of course well have to wait and see how the departed compares to the likes of the godfather movies and the shawshank redempion but scorsese has truly created a masterpiece which was to me truly unexpected. these days most movies, being action, have only that, action. most movies that are drama have only drama. but scorcese was able to create a movie that was not really targeted at the mainstream movie watchers, however, this movie was just so awesome that many will see that a movie can have action drama and characters that one can really relate to. also, the plot was awesome, i think even better that that of the original godfather. seriously, and leonardo dicaprio will truly blow you away, and nicholsons just plain old nicholson- fantastic
9.0~Great Movie! Leonardo has changed my perspective of him. alleah27 Sign in Permalink I have to say the entire cast in this movie were all shining. However after being such a Leonardo DiCaprio hater, he was the one who I truly took notice. Long gone is the baby faced actor trying to be a man.. He has completely shed that persona, and I only hope he continues to amaze the movie going public with more creative and assertive roles. Jack Nicholson was his normal greatness. Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg added weight, depth and dimension to the film, without their characters overpowering the each other. Martin Scorsese was able to tell a story with directness and no overkill. This movie deserves an Oscar for Best Director! Hats off to Martin Scorsese!!!
8.0~Dark and brutal.Scorsese's most accomplished and entertaining film to date. HiddenVoice Sign in Permalink One could look at The Departed and can get the idea that this is less a remake than it is a re-imagining of the riveting crime Drama INTERNAL AFFAIRS.It's more of an inspiration than it is a direct lift off.The story may be the same,but there's a vast difference between Scorsese's epic and the Hong Kong Classic.And for that,this film is truly a fascinating look at the ugly worlds of the two sides of the law. Rookie Cop Billy Costigan goes undercover and is assigned to work for Crime Boss Frank Costello and get really close to him to deliver some information about his crimes.Costigan gains Costello's trust and gets involved a lot deeper in his crimes.On the other hand ,a rising police office is actually a mole in the department, informs everything about the Police Department's movements to Costello.But things get deadly when both men are about to have their secrets exposed and the Mobs and the cops discover that there is a mole/informer,and a traitor who's getting things messed up on both sides.And then they both try to save themselves from each other and the Mobs.They slowly get confused with their dual identities and things get deadlier for the both of them as their delicate balance with the Mobs and the Cops gets them too involved with the world they're into.While both men are in love with the same women,one of them has to suffer the consequences.Leading to a shocking conclusion to this epic.There are intense scenes of violence and action and twists that you never see coming. A Martin Scorsese film is always dark,graphically violent,raw,hard edged,and filled with memorable powerhouse performances.And this film is no exception.The Departed is something new and different .Its complex plot unfolds to an even more powerful story ,with characters colliding with one another and facing terrifying situations.Scorsese shows that what it is like to be a cop.Your life is in danger 24/7 ,and that every minute is a risk when you're undercover.Your only fear is having your true identity be exposed.And then,it's all up to the person who's holding a gun to your face. It's a tough film he carved out,and to be honest it's a perfect example of how a remake should be made.It's actually as good as the original,even better at times.And shows that when it is helled by a legendary director who knows what he is doing the results are always great for a remake.To compare the original and this one,I would say this one is slightly better than the original.Otherwise,it's just as brilliant as the Hong Kong version.But the thing about this film is that even if you've seen the Hong Kong version,you'll still be blown away by the Hollywood version.However,comparisons are inevitable. What else can you ask for when you have a cast this big?I could only recall one such film that had such a huge cast at the moment,and that was Ocean's 11.Where that film didn't do full justice with its cast,this film makes use of its actors and gives you a rare piece of entertainment that is thought-provoking and ingenious.Scorsese really have given a great piece of work.I wouldn't say this is his best work ever,his best directed film was GANGS OF NEW YORK ,which he should've won an Osacar for,but it certainly is one his best work since Goodfellas in the crime genre.It's got the usual trademarks of the director.The script is fantastic.The writer has done a terrific job in this remake.It makes the film a standout from the original.Rich CinematographyThe cinematography is rich,and the editing is sharp. The Score is superb,Scorsese's choice of music is great.And the look of the film and its sets are brilliant,getting us old and new Boston.And lots of cell phone use. Well,you're wondering who's the show stealer out of a giant cast like this.Everyone got to do something with full satisfaction.But the real standout here is Di Caprio and Damon.The actors have only gotten better and better recently and here they pull it off again.They are complex and tough characters to play and they play their part brilliantly.Di Caprio's emotional stature is strong.He manages to bring the character's fear and confusion with full conviction.You do feel sad in the end for what happens to him.You will be shocked and it was unfair for the character.Damon on the other hand is superb as the mole who informs the crime bosses.Their face off and rivalries are intense and suspenseful.And of course,Jack Nicholson couldn't have had more fun doing a film like this than doing another sad comedy.His and Scorsese's collaboration is another reason,altogether a different reason, to watch this film.At this age,he could still pull off juicy performances,and do all that he's done on screen really makes you wonder if he's ever gonna do another film with Scorsese again.And his over the top performance is really fun to watch.Wahlberg is great in his role as the tough cop who talks tough to his co-officers.Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are both terrific.Vera Farimiga was a real surprise as a women who falls in love with both leading men.She plays her part really well and you kind of feel sad that why didn't she chose the character that deserved her. Of course, this film is not without its flaws,and I expected it to end with a bang,whereas the writer seemed to have abandoned the script's energy and just concluded it somewhat like the original film.It was an uneven conclusion.And I just wasn't sure why was it necessary to do what the writer did to the main characters in the end.But regardless of that the rest of the film is a tour de force raw drama. A modern classic and a definite must-see of the year.This film can count on its chances of being at the Oscars next year.A sure fire success.The Departed is the most exciting,fun and thrilling dark crime Drama of the year.And it's fully satisfying and very entertaining.Highly Recommended.
10.0~The best film of the year and of the many years conchimdr Sign in Permalink What a great film!!!. It is masterpiece and a lesson of cinema. Martin Scorsese is not only a brilliant(genial) director but a teacher of how good cinema must be done. He reaches the perfection. The movie goes in crescendo, the distress and the tension are increasingly strong, up to the final explosion. The plot keeps the spectator interested at all time. The actors are incredibly well directed, emphasizing undoubtedly Jack Nicholson (there can be a better actor in the world?)and Leonardo DiCaprio. Is one of the best movies that I have seen in many years. All lovers of cinema must go to see this film without waiting! I hope this movie will win many Oscars but it is the winner, undoubtedly, with awards or without them.
10.0~Great movie. Doesn't feel like 2 1/2 hrs at all. I wanted more. ferreira0665 Sign in Permalink Everybody cries about the ending. Honestly I believe everyone got what they deserved to. Even the so-called good guys. They had a choice and they made a bad one. The ending was perfect. It brought complete conclusion to everything. Mark and Alec played wonderful off of each other. And the dialogue with everyone was just brilliant. If this movie is not nominated for best picture I would be shocked. Leo is starting to more and more show himself as an adult actor and doing some exploration with characters. I happened to see a preview for The Blood Diamond which looks good as well. This movie was very well done. I praise them all. DiCaprio, Nicholson, Walhberg, Baldwin, Sheen, Damon and Farminga. It was perfect.
10.0~Unbelievably gripping and a perfect cast. wandering_rose Sign in Permalink I wouldn't want to spoil one second of this perfectly crafted film by giving anything away and you should do the same when recommending it. Often the advertising hype and public frenzy about a movie proves to be ill-founded. However in the case of "The Departed" it was well deserved. Martin Scorsese drew stunning performances out of already incredible actors. The seamless dialog and high emotional intensity didn't let up for a moment. Nicholson was the ultimate sleazy sociopath mob boss and Damon portrayed the pretty-faced bad boy to perfection. DiCaprio continues to astound me with his deep complexity as an actor. I was quickly drawn into his precarious situations and often found myself literally holding my breath on his behalf while awaiting the outcomes. Even Wahlberg and Baldwin, though their roles are supporting rather than lead, maintain a powerful presence throughout. Oh, and let's not forget Martin Sheen(Where has he been, anyway?)excellently playing one of the lone good guys in the film. I am not generally a fan of violent gangster-type movies, and I admit to much cringing and eye-closing. But the story, the acting, the dialog and the edginess hooked me right off. Nicholson's voice-over in the first minutes introduce him as a man with a definite idea of who he is, where he belongs and what he wants out of life. The interactions are snappy and believable with a few really memorable volleys between Wahlberg and Baldwin. We actually had to pause the DVD at times in order to fully enjoy them lest we be still laughing instead of paying attention. I appreciated the non-Tarantino-like directing. Rather than making the violence twistedly funny there are humorous moments within an intense and violent story. And the scarceness of "Naked Flesh" kept the story true to its purpose. Well done, Mr. Scorsese.
1.0~If you value your cinematic experience watch the original... davidawson Sign in Permalink I feel compelled to write my first ever review... Before we all get all excited about this movie "The Departed" which it has just been my misfortune to view, I would like to suggest to you, the viewer, if you value your cinematic experience, to watch the original film this "movie" is made from: Infernal Affairs http:// www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/ The original film is excellent and possibly the best "cop" film ever made in my opinion. A Hong Kong made film which is truly gripping with the characterisation just pulling you into the story-line. The outcome of the original film also leaves you with questions and a real sense of being someplace else, a sense of journey. A sense which, unfortunately, this hash re-make does not. Scorsese has failed me on this one! Why re-make a film that is perfect. One word to describe this movie: rubbish. See the original and you won't get disappointed. Check-out more world cinema and these hash re-makes in "English" won't get made. For example: À Bout de Soufflé (1960) (aka Breathless) remade as Breathless (1983); Abre Los Ojos (1997) remade as Vanilla Sky (2001); L'Appartement (1996) remade as Wicker Park (2004); Boudu Sauvé des Eaux (1932) remade as Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986); Les Compères (1983) remade as Fathers' Day (1997); La Cage aux Folles (1978) remade as The Birdcage (1996); Les Diaboliques (1955) remade as Diabolique (1996); Et Dieu... créa la femme (1956) remade as And God Created Woman (1988); La Jetée (1962) remade as Twelve Monkeys (1995); Nikita (1990) (aka La Femme Nikita) remade as Black Cat (1991); Nikita (1990) (aka La Femme Nikita) remade as Point of No Return (1993); Profumo di Donna (1974) remade as Scent of a Woman (1992); Taxi (1998) remade as Taxi (2004); Trois Hommes et un Couffin (1985) (aka Three Men and a Cradle) remade as Three Men and a Baby (1987); Yojimbo (1961) remade as Last Man Standing (1996); Rashomon (1950) remade as The Outrage (1964); Jules et Jim (1961) remade as Willie and Phil (1980); Shichinin no Samurai (1954) remade as The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Mou gaan dou (2002) remade as The Departed (2006) The list goes on and on but I have just selected the originals which I personally have seen, which are all far superior to the re-makes. They say the greatest form of flattery is imitation, but just for once let's leave the original alone can we... --- post script: OK time has passed, i have watched this film again, alongside the original... OK it has some merit and is quite good (for a remake). tip my hat humbly xxx
10.0~Martin's best ever... popcorned1 Sign in Permalink I haven't voted "10" for a movie before - I've always felt that giving a "10" rating is that's like saying there's no room for improvement, and there are always elements that could have been done better. And no matter what you're doing, there's always room for improvement. But this was a definite 10. The pacing, the plot, the characters, the performances... This was a terrific movie. There's no doubt that in the future The Departed will be the new benchmark for this genre. The cast is brilliant. I have always been a fan of Nicholson, and here he is even better than usual. Some say he is too over-the-top, but I disagree. The character he plays is himself over the top, and I think it is a perfect performance. Damon's Colin Sullivan is a stunning picture of evil. A man with terrific abilities and, the way he looks to that golden dome, a man with dreams of other better things, but he is so hooked into his patron that he can't get out, and in the end embraces the entanglements as what his life is. Leonardo is such a classic tragic figure in this. Unbelievable... To be willing to sacrifice himself in this way. I think it shows a more realistic picture of what this kind of double life must be than anything I have seen. Every supporting character is just as flawlessly portrayed. I may never vote "10" again, but this one deserves it. Scorcese's best ever.
7.0~Not as good as the original valery-v-bentsianov Sign in Permalink I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake's case, but this one really got my hopes high. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case this time. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still great, it just falls below expectation. Yes, Di Caprio is great for the first time (he was good in some movies before, but here he is just superb). Nicholoson - is over the top, being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals. The rest of the cast is just good, no flaws. Whenever they tried to stick to the original - everything worked great. For some unfortunate reason they decided to over-complicate already sophisticated screenplay - and spoiled it. There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess, some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for. And also the ending - I do not know, ending in the Hong-Kong movie was reasonable and understandable, here it is basically the same - but messy. In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did, and they lost it here. My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint - and here they actually made it black and white. And no, don't forget about Taxi Driver:) this one is very good (especially if you have not seen the original), but not great.
9.0~A great movie with an all-star cast and an intriguing plot line, The Departed has very few flaws. danbarr000 Sign in Permalink Storyline The plot line that the departed follows is sort of cat and mouse type set up. It is the story of two rats, one who is loyal to the Massachusetts state police and the other to Boston Irish crime leader Frank Costello. Billy Costigan is the man who is a good and some what honest cop who Queenan and Dignam are prejudice of because of his family history. While Colin Sullivan who looked up to Costello as a sort of father figure in his youth is the mole inside the state police. Both scramble to find the identity of the other while billy's superiors use him to gather evidence against Costello, while Costello is using Sullivan to keep the state police from gathering evidence against him. The Good The irony to the plot line creates an interesting concept to follow. The man who would become the undercover officer the police needed and who could be potentially essential to bringing down Costello is at first quickly rejected from becoming a regular state trooper, while the man who is an informant for Costello is quickly accepted. The twin story lines creates a good effect on the viewer by allowing both stories to unfold around the characters with their paths crossing. Another excellent aspect of The Departed is the characters, the characters have a lot of depth so much so that they seem like they could all exist, from the criminal Costello to the humble cop Captain Queenan. This movie has a large amount of incredible actor some considered to be the best around, with Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen topping the list. This movie entertains you through its entirety until it comes to an unexpected and satisfying conclusion. The Bad Some have said this movie is over done when compared to the original Infernal Affairs. This could seem confusing to some who don't follow it closely because of the two different characters it follows almost an equal amount of time. and The Conclusion This movie can entertain almost anyone, with a great storyline and a fantastic cast. Thats why the departed gets a 9/10 from me.
8.0~Watch with lesser expectations narayans80 Sign in Permalink Very mild spoilers. This is the first time I've caught a Scorsese movie in theater, that too a non-biographically styled modern one remade from 'Infernal Affairs' (which I haven't seen yet). 'When I was your age they used to say you could become cops or criminals. What I'm saying to you is this... When your facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?' the Frank Costello's pretty much summarizes the movie. There were 2 unusual things which was'nt a part in the previous Scorsese movies I've seen (Casino, Goodfellas, Aviator): 1. The movie had a contemporary setting (few years back is contemporary too ;) ), and I did quite miss the antique settings in this movie, especially the soundtracks. 2. It had a feminine key character, the rest of them (except Sharon Stone in Casino, who probably would'nt give you the feel that there was a female character) appeared in roles that were'nt important to the plot. Being a remake, I would'nt delve into the plot although it was one the strong point. The screenplay and dialogues were typical Scorsese sprinkled with dry humour, guns and loads of blood spatters. Jackie boy, Leo, Mark Wahlberg were the ones who stealed the show. Like Reuben says in Oceans 11 'What am i saying. You guys are pros, the best' :) The only source of disappointment was Matt Damon, he still looked kind rookie-ish. I could'nt make out if was scared or not from his facial expressions (which his role required him to do). Maybe thats why Marty assigned him to be Sullivan and (thankfully) not Costigan. Leo on the other hand had lots of scenes to his credit: his first meeting with the counsellor, a couple of scenes after Queenan dies are some i can think of. Overall, I would'nt place this movie in the 'Best of Scorsese', but certainly recommend all mafia movie lovers to watch it (with lesser expectations).
10.0~Unbelievable hollywood2007007 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I look at reviews and I've followed this movie since it was in pre-production, and I saw it tonight and I had to tell anyone who looks at this to please see this movie. I was totally blown away by every scene, and I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies. Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Sheen, Baldwin even, had some of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I knew this movie was gonna be good, but I had no idea it was gonna be THAT good. I'm not exaggerating when I say this movie is amazing. If its not the best movie you've seen in 2006, I would be really surprised. I recommend seeing this one
10.0~The Departed By: Rick Radman of Radman_Art radman_art Sign in Permalink The Departed By: Rick Radman of Radman_Art Awesome! I absolutely loved this movie. In a decade of bad movies I can barely believe a movie like this was released. Martin Scorsese is a genius, we should cherish this man and honor him before he leaves us like Stanley Kubrick. Like myself and thousands of other artists that never get to create to their full potential. They are ignored by a industry that has completely lost touch with it's audience . But I know the way things are going, the people that hate will stay on the top of the hill destroying all that is TRUE entertainment. "All we need is love", The Beatles. My dad was a cop in Connecticut all his life and his friends where my friends. Life is cheap back east. I thought in that sense this movie was accurate. That is why I love the west. We are kind out here. This is our world. You have to live here to see what I mean. Don't get me wrong I am from Middletown, Connecticut for as long as I live. My family's family is from there amen. If you want to know why I do not move back there or even visit. Then please contact my sister and two brothers and ask them. Although family sticks together they also (like the movie) turn against each other at the spire of the moment. I loved absolutely every thing about this move. Except. Who's brilliant idea was it to make Jack Nicholson the stud? A man at his age he isn't performing any thing remotely similar to the stud he is made out to be in the move. It kind of makes me sick to think of such a thing. Other than that his performance was perfect. It was so cool to see him play a bad guy again. Like in the movie Batman as the joker. It was a thing of beauty. Like I said before, we will not know how much we appreciate someone like this until they are gone. Oh and how about Alec Baldwin? I just could not hold it in during the conversation at the putting range I began laughing and so did the couple behind me. This is the man at work in such perfect form. It felt like the last scene in "True Grit". I only hope for more cool movies like this. I think the movie industry makes it's mark like rock music in the 60's and 70's. This past decade of compromise is a mark against us all.
8.0~David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com rdjeffers Sign in Permalink "Who the #&%* are you?" "I'm the guy who does his job. Who are you?" How often have moviegoers observed that "So-and-so hasn't made a decent film in years " How often has that observation been true? Given this consideration, Martin Scorsese's latest film The Departed is an astonishing surprise. It is every bit the equal of his greatest triumphs. His portrait of Boston's Irish Mob, with its mix of loyalty, deception and underlying legacy, is told with a breathtaking visual narrative of explosive violence and its consequences, in the compelling style Scorsese is famous for. At its heart, The Departed is Jack Nicholson's film. He dominates the screen as the personification of willful menace and pure evil. The remaining cast rivals any Scorsese ensemble, with career defining performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Ray Winstone. With an unforgettable screenplay and a well-balanced score featuring everything from The Rolling Stones, to Patsy Cline and La Traviata, The Departed fulfills the promise seen in Scorsese's earliest work.
6.0~Doesn't deserve the ratings stephenftlauderdale Sign in Permalink Sigh. After seeing the raving comments here for this film, I have to do a double take. I watched it and enjoyed it, but it's just an average movie, with big stars and a famous director. It's OK at best. Worth a watch, but not worth getting to excited about, which is why I think there is a reality distortion around the ratings here. I think most people will watch this in 10 years and wonder what all the fuss was about. It's probably because this is the first film of this type that has been made successfully in a while, and so subconsciously we must be pretending it's going to make us feel warm inside like True Romance or Goodfellas; probably because most people haven't seen Internal Affairs and so the main plot is new to them; and probably because it bagged an Oscar and everyone figures it's hip to dance at the winning party. Lets be clear, the original Internal Affairs worked because it left gaps, which helped get a sense that time had passed and you accepted that each of the main characters had gradually worked into their respective positions over many years. This gave a sense of increasing tension as each of their relatively comfortable positions were made more vulnerable, when essentially, they were activated for the first time by each of their masters for the end game. With this remake, it fails because they tried to fill those gaps with well known actors and then provided them with excess dialog to warrant their appearance; as a result the situations the protagonists find themselves in, feels forced. If Costello was really the evil, guilt free gangster Nicholson was trying to portray, then frankly, he'd have had no hesitation taking Costigan outside to dance with a few bullets and put the doubt out of his mind once and for all. It reminds me of another Scorsese film where an evil, guilt free gangster had a few doubts about his associates and did exactly that. It felt real in that film, because, well, it was based on the real events and well... thats what evil, guilt free gangsters tend to do. As for the Oscars, well, it says something I suppose. The Aviator was a better made film, both for Scorsese and DiCarprio who nailed Howard Hughes. They should have bunged it Scorsese's way then, now it just feels arbitrary and robbed Little Miss Sunshine of best picture, of which it most certainly is.
7.0~Well done carol_tuck Sign in Permalink A well done movie, but one too many dead heads in blood puddles. The acting was great and the plot satisfyingly complicated except for the ending. ** How did the guy who killed Colin know he was the rat. ** Why didn't Madolyn turn Colin in? ** Why didn't Colin kill Madolyn so she couldn't turn him in? Vera Farmiga (Madolyn) was especially likable. She looks like a real person rather than the typical beauty queen which most directors choose for their lead female roles. Overall the 2 and 1/2 hours went fast. I would recommend this movie with reservations for the violence.
4.0~Departed Tankard22 Sign in Permalink Not much to commend on this movie! The original Hong Kong film was much much better. This movie was rambling, predictable, and at times reminded me of a college student film with its forced irony. Okay, so Dicaprio did do an excellent job, and Sheen and Damon were okay but the acting of Nicholson was atrocious and Marky Mark has been much better in other things. His acting limitations were obvious in this film. What was the corpulent Baldwin even doing in this film, outside of the director giving a handout to a fellow down-on-his-luck lib, who shouldn't even have been living in the United States for the past six years? This film shouldn't have gotten all the good press that it has and it absolutely shouldn't have been nominated or won anything. And no, I am not bitter for wasting any money seeing this film because I was given a free copy of it and I actually looked forward to seeing it. Now that I have seen it, I wish it hadn't departed from the original movie as much as it did. The whole thing of trying to incorporate the Boston bi-sexual crime-lord Whitey Bulger into the storyline with the Nicholson character was stupid and hit a bad note too since this mass murdering former male street hustler is still on the loose!
10.0~The new born departed westreal Sign in Permalink This is a totally awesome movie from start to finish..a great cast..some undisputed performances...everything is almost perfect..From a Director that knows his best angles..specially in a story like this..comes a work of art that touches (even with such gore) and i might say that nobody expected the ending (unless there's a book ).All the actors have done an outstanding job but Jack performed "crazy".He is an actor which you can't get enough of watching..and although he was the bad guy (in a way) we still felt sorry for him in the end.My only disappointment is to the Head Shots scene..i think it was a little too "fake" ..specially because there was a key element missing (spoiler). All the Departed were the new born (as their life were turning points)!!! Go watch it..i's fabulous !
8.0~What great acting iohefy-2 Sign in Permalink I waited to see The Departed with antisapation and having just seen it my wait was not in vain.The acting in the movie was the tops, including Leonardo De Caprio, Matt Damon, and of course Jack Nicholson who is great in anything he appears in. Even the bit parts by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were outstanding. The problem I had with the movie was how similar DiCaprio and Damon looked in this movie, I got sort of confused as to who was who. This is a different kind of cop story and I am sure you will enjoy watching the artistry of this unit of actors in this fine movie. It is the best two hours I have spent in a long time, so go see this outstanding movie and you will certainly enjoy it as much as I did. This is Oscar material for sure.
2.0~Near scene for scene rip of Infernal Affairs. zaff_guk100 Sign in Permalink Sorry but as a huge fan of the Infernal Affairs films this just bored me. Its a near scene for scene rip of the original. They dumbed it down by placing F**K in nearly every sentence as well. Now I don't care about swearing, I swear a lot as it is but why ruin a good script by adding F**K in every sentence??? The basic plot is basically the same as IA but the adaptations of the plot line ruined it completely. So the bad guy dies at the end what fun is that? They both want the same doctor the same as the HK version (and sorry Kelly Chen is ten times prettier than whoever played the doctor in the US version). The acting is no where near as good as the HK version either. For those who haven't already seen the HK version then perhaps this was great but for me I spend two hours bored witless. Nice to get it off my chest, a nice vent over wasting £15 on a night out to a bad film then having to walk home is good.
10.0~One of the best Scorsese ever did eliot_axelrod Sign in Permalink This a great remake. Just like the Magificent Seven was a great remake of the Seven Samurai. This was a great remake of Infernal Affairs. I mean that in the most positive way. The Departed does a great job of taking an Asian movie and transforming it into something as American as apple pie. Scorsese creates great distinctly American characters. Damon, Nicholson, and Wahlberg are outstanding. I just saw Infernal affairs about a month before The Departed and I I appreciate them both more. One movie doesn't spoil the other, they explore the plot in different ways. I highly recommend both movies.
5.0~Most annoying soundtrack. okami_ito Sign in Permalink Frankly, i think Scorcese suffers from a personality crisis for quite some time. This movie is another example that this director, who made milestones of Hollywood history once, totally lost his style and constantly tries to follow tired trends. That he's successful with it, tells more about his audience then the quality of his recent movies. A good example for this is the nerve-wrecking soundtrack of this mediocre remake, which dive-bombs the viewer with one blaring rock song after another. Who does Scorcese thinks he is? Quentin Tarantino? It would be excusable for a beginner to over-spice his first movie with his favorite mix-tape. I like music and i like movies. What i don't like is to be pestered with someones dated musical taste when i want to see a gangster-movie. My God, just read the list of songs at the end credits. It's insane! You have to be numb to endure this.
8.0~Martin Scorsese nearly got it. avtotar50 Sign in Permalink I'll give credit where credit is due. If any one could have pulled this movie off, it was Scorsese. I have been a fan of "Infernal Affairs" since I first saw it 4 years ago. I have always been a fan of Asian films such as "Friend" and "Shiri" and when I went to see "The Departed" I was not aware this was a remake. After the first 30 minutes, I realized what it was. The cast put together was most superb and the acting had me entrhalled. I noted that many of the emotions in the movie held true, yet many of the subtleties did not. I must admit, knowing what was going to happen, other than the end, did not hold me in suspense. Watching the cast pull the movie off did. DiCaprio has had his best role yet. Better than "Catch Me If You Can." SEE THIS MOVIE. BUT SEE THE ORIGINAL TOO. Both stand on their own as excellent movies. Now to remake "FRIEND"
3.0~Awful Romster Sign in Permalink If you have seen the original this film is awful in comparison. Read any of the reviews by people that have seen it. The average rating among them is probably 4/5, not 8.6. Its a shame more people haven't seen the original. To quickly sum up: 1) The characters are weak compared to the original (apart from Sam) 2) Infernal Affairs (the Original) is like Heat but shorter. This is a poor remake - just like all the Hollywood remakes have been Infernal Affairs is miles better - and this is from someone that hardly ever watches foreign movies (because I can't be bothered reading subtitles) :)
9.0~Scorsese at his best guidocasati Sign in Permalink Excellent plot, breathtaking plot-twist, stellar staff. This movie is just great! You'll probably feel strong emotions and won't be disappointed.
4.0~Like comparing a brick with a samurai sword show_pony Sign in Permalink Would I have rated this film higher if I had not seen the HK original "Infernal Affairs"? Probably - but when you have, it's like comparing a brick with a samurai sword. Set in the gritty underbelly of Boston, "The Departed" is a story of two men working undercover on opposites sides of the law. DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a graduate State Trooper handpicked by Cpt Queenan (Martin Sheen) to infiltrate crime boss Frank Costello's (the manic Jack Nicholson) milk-bar raidin', computer-chip and drug dealin' "organisation" of what appears to be about 5 or 6 thugs. The sixth or maybe seventh guy in the gang is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), whom Costello has groomed in his own image since childhood (stricly in a criminal sense - two Jack Nicholsons running your neighbourhood would be too scary. Unless the other Jack was only 1/8th the size (MiniJack), in which case it would be quite sad/funny. Together they would turn away from their life of crime to star in their own music video about building castles in the skywell, in either case, there goes the neighbourhood), to be his mole on the force. The ingredients are there for a tense and thrilling cops n robbers drama. Instead, The Departed ends up as a blunt, violent film with comedy where's it's not intended. Its main problem is an utter lack of finesse. Mak Siu Fai's screenplay led you to see for yourself the increasing sense of frustration, isolation and fear of the good cop (played superbly by the excellent Tony Leung) - much like Nicholas Cage's tormented good guy trapped in a bad guy's body in Face Off. Scorsese meanwhile, needed DiCaprio to literally yell and whinge about how frustrated, isolated and fearful he felt, because if he didn't, I would've missed it. I mean, what loneliness? What isolation? If ever he felt the onset of undercover angst, he had the comfort of jumping in the sack with Damon's girlfreud or going to Cpt Queenan's house for supper and a chat - try working in a cubicle 8 hours a day. Sure, the prospect being found out as a spy is pretty rough, but if your boss is Jack Nicholson, he's just as likely to grind you into mincemeat for spilling coffee on his tie. Subtlety is a dying art. Case in point is a scene where the bad cop shows off his policing chops by conning a crook into giving up his associates. When confronted with the impasse in IA, Andy Lau walks into the the room without missing a beat. Calmly, coolly, smoothly, he feeds the guy a line or two and then hook and sinker as well. In TD, when confronted with the same uncooperative thug, Damon looks a little confounded, but lo and behold! He spies with his little eye a mysterious briefcase belonging to no one that just so happens to be lying around. He then furrows his brow to indicate thinking. Finally he says to his chums "I know! I'll take that mysterious briefcase belonging to no one but that just happens to be lying around, go in there and pretend I'm the guy's lawyer and trick him in to giving us the information we need!" The other big problem is some of the casting, which means some of the acting. Leo rings in an emotional but always believable performance and I think a little gold man is probably well due him at some stage. Nicholson is Nicholson. The choice of Martin Sheen as Cpt Queenan however, is a little odd. This character (played with heroism and wit by Anthony Wong in IA) should be to Nicholson's Costello what Professor X is to Magneto. Instead Sheen appears blatantly impotent in contrast with his arch nemesis. The inclusion of Marky Mark as the tough talking nutjob Sgt Dignam was as much a mystery as the briefcase in the interrogation room, though as comic relief, you can't help but laugh at his foul-mouthed antics in spite of yourself. Then there is Alec Baldwin. Unfortunately, I've not been able to take him seriously since Team America - unfortunate, because that wasn't his fault. Fortunately, I can now not take him seriously on his own merit. According to Mr Baldwin's Book of Acting, senior police officers always, except when playing golf, default to an arms akimbo, chest or gut stuck out position (the more senior you are, the lower the body part to be stuck out) and crack one liners. To make matters worse, he lent a copy of his book to Marky Mark, who compounded the error by reading it. There is a scene in which they are standing together in a room, BOTH with arms akimbo, cracking one liners and giving "the brief" to the junior officers. Maybe it's just me, but one guy with his hands on his hips is fine- he commands respect, either because he is the boss or Hercules. But more than one just looks ridiculous. I suppose that's why The Three Amigos were so funny. There are other moments of unintentional comedy you should discover for yourself. Be sure to invite along a friend who actually speaks Cantonese to watch that scene with the "tough" Chinese gangsters. Many critics have hailed this as Scorcese's comeback blockbuster, and the box office might even give you the numbers to proof it. As a movie in its own right, it certainly is not without merits. But compared with the original, The Departed is dumbed down, heavy-handed and completely unnecessary. I realise Hollywood is starting to run out of ideas - but why remake an excellent movie when the ones that need redoing are the bad ones?
2.0~What a wretched pile of f**k. MarshallStax Sign in Permalink Over-directed (pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what's happening on screen with the plot or characters), over-scored (save me from the freakin' metal Irish jig and the Stones, both heard twice in this thing), over-edited (the movie is awkward: scenes flow neither internally or into each other) and over-acted by Jack Nicholson (so far beyond the point of self-parody that it ceases to be funny), this horrid, horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters (except for Madolyn, the worst psychiatrist who never lived, who lacks even a second dimension) and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at. Really, I've never been a Scorsese fan, but this movie owes any praise it deserves for its twisty, turny plot to whatever was left over from the original "Infernal Affairs". Yes, in case you didn't know, this movie is a remake of a far superior Hong Kong film. As with "Dreamgirls", another inexplicably over-praised 2006 release, there's just no denying the nudity of this emperor. Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful, Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all-too-predictable praise that's been heaped on it. "Instant classic", "best film of the year", etc... I'm sorry, but the technical competency of the filmmakers is questionable and the emotional impact of the story is zip. By the last few minutes, as blowing a person's brains on the wall is becoming more of a cliché than you would ever think possible, I found myself hoping that some deus ex machina would descend from the sky and just kill everyone so it would just be f**king over already.
2.0~No plot jminetto06 Sign in Permalink Did anyone else notice that there was no plot after 45 minutes in to the movie? The whole laptop scam was the only idea that geared any sort of central plot. The rest of the movie was dedicated to finding the rat which the audience already knew. So, what, the idea of a nice ending was everybody dying? Really original. It may not have been a 2 but I was so angry about the inflated rating that I wanted to make it realistic. The acting was decent but not as good as the actors should have been. Interestingly, Wahlberg has the only dynamic character which is very odd. Damon and Dicaprio have mirror character and both are strong just not very original.
1.0~if Marty was trying to parody himself he's a genius. i don't think he was trying. annettecigarette Sign in Permalink so lame. you didn't believe any motives behind any character. Nicholson & marky mark make you laugh i hope on purpose. Matt Damon doesn't get hit in the head nearly enough. there's a funny nod to jack's joker. do not expect goodfellas. don't even expect a chainsaw sequel/prequel. think more like scary movie 2, but without trying. do Southey's ever get tired of being made fun of in movies? between this and mystic river, i'd be real upset. i get it, Irish guys love their moms and miss their dads. the only thing that could have made this worse is if ed burns was in it. the best performance was the lady with the nose plugs.
9.0~Scorsese's best since "Casino" is a masterpiece fertilecelluloid Sign in Permalink This is Martin Scorsese's best film since "Casino" and another classic to add to the director's incredible oeuvre. It signifies the return of the brilliant director to the streets he knows so well. A remake of "Infernal Affairs", a great Hong Kong film, it sticks closely to the plot of its source, but it pumps greater depth into all the characters and is a harsher, grittier piece. Every sequence is stamped with Scorsese's sizzling hot, take-no-prisoners style, and every music cue is inspired. The performances, from Ray Winstone's Mr. French to Leonardo de Caprio's Billy Costigan to Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan to Mark Wahlberg's Dignam are superb. This is Caprio's break-out movie and I loved him in this. He carries a large burden on his shoulders, but he carries it with total conviction and finally busts out of his Pretty Boy bubble. Also worth noting is Alec Baldwin's killer turn as the gruff, no-nonsense Ellerby and Vera Farmiga's pitch perfect performance as the police psychologist who takes her work very personally. Michael Baullhaus, who also shot "Goodfellas", creates stunning, organic visuals. Thelma Schoonmaker, who cuts every one of Scorsese's films, delivers a masterpiece of clarity and visual kinetics. Everything works here. Everything resonates. Everything means something. Everything pays off. The film is a textbook example of how to make a film with substance. And how refreshing it was to see a film not filled to the gills with flashy cutting and ostentatious camera-work. This is dynamite film-making that feels like a return to the dirt, grime and psychological insanity of "Mean Streets".
7.0~Good, but not as good as the original coryand Sign in Permalink Just got back from seeing this in Taiwan (where it opened yesterday, in time for Mid-Autumn festival) Good movie, but decided to re-watch the original (Infernal Affairs) back home... and the original edges over it in terms of emotion, pace and character development. 'The departed' is great once it gets going and the premise really starts to kick in,and jack Nicholson is incredible, but I can't help feeling that the director was going for too much humour - from the 9at times0 overly witty dialogue to the closing scene. And some of the set pieces - the elevator scene near the end, for example, are not handled as well as in the original (the audience laughed out loud during the elevator scene, and I'm not sure that was the intended effect). All in all, a good film, but I feel it just misses out on being a great one, especially when compared with its Asian counterpart.
8.0~Scorsese hits the jackpot..... again !!! Sparrowmaniac Sign in Permalink The Departed is one of the best contemporary thrillers that I have seen. True its a remake, and critics will be be saying,"So what the Chinese did this before and even made sequel to it.." But Scorsese's Departed is a whole new thing. Firstly Jack Nicholson.(Screw me, but I'm a big fan of him...) Even though Nicholson is the villain, the movie doesn't give him much of a headway. He starts off as a local absconder and rises up to a mafia boss, but throughout the movie he rules about every other actor. Be it DiCaprio or Damon. Even in the scene where he dies he commands an aura of respect. Second point making this a must see, is undoubtedly its marvelous star cast. True again that some of the actors were not used to their potential like Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg but still no one would be able to resist the temptation of such an unbelievable cast. Thirdly Martin Scorsese. The bloke has given Hollywood some amazing movies over the years. He may go down in history as the greatest director not to get a Academy Award(I cant see him bagging an award for this, since its a remake) but he truly is a genius. And lastly Pink Floyd. If you people are wondering if I have lost my nuts, then no. Indeed Floyd's most remarkable song,"Comfortably Numb" does feature in the movie in the love making scene between DiCaprio's character and Vera Farmiga. No point harping about the story cause many people saw the smash hit, Infernal Affairs and its a clone of that. Every odd scene, leaving out the ending. The technical bits was good. Screenplay was solid, acting out of the world, there was some bits for comic relief. Some real cool stuff shown with cell phones. Matt Damon, DiCaprio and Martin Sheen all were very good. Vera Farmiga also looked good, even being a new face. Alec Baldwin was vastly underused, so was Mark Wahlberg. But end of the day Jack Nicholson owned the movie. He set the tone, and even at the age of 75, he commands such respect. The scene at the porn theater, I couldn't comprehend Nicholson enacting that masturbating drama, but he pulled it off. Its like a tug of war, with all the heavy weights on one side and the 75 year old man on the other. So bottom line Departed is one hell of a movie, a rated must see. 8/10 !!!!
10.0~Excellence in contrast and delivery adsdmnel Sign in Permalink As ever Scorese has brought together an array of outstanding actors. Jack Nicholson's performance is as usual competent and a well thought out character study. But the gem of the film is Di Caprio, he is awesome it is as though he is growing in stature and becoming a much more grounded actor with immense passion. He really does enlighten the scenes as his character continues to struggle with the conflicts and demons that he faces. He is in the same form as he was in The Aviator in which he deserved an Oscar nomination, maybe a little early to tip him for an Oscar, but certainly worth another Oscar nod for Best Actor. Scorese is such a clever director, this is probably the only mixed form film he has made. The film ventures to the two extremes of comedy and drama within this film, Scorese carefully delivers the most appropriate balance of comedy to lift the gloomy content within this film (for example the very last shot on the window as the film ends). He continually shows his early influences in many scenes, particularly the scene when Di Caprio is following Damon after the cinema visit (enough said don't want to spoil the story), this reminded me of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets. Another great partnership is the combination Scorsese with Schoonmaker's editing. She has won several Oscars when working with Scorese and this is certainly her best work. The editing is snappy and executed superbly, creating immense tension especially towards the climax of the film. Thelma Schoonmaker is an outstanding editor and deserves another Oscar, well done. The complex, clever and intertwining narrative enables the script to follow an excellent structure which never detracts itself away from the core action. Overall an excellent film, well done Scorese!
8.0~Good Movie barberoux Sign in Permalink "The Departed" was good but not excellent. Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie. If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much. Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh!t I always thought was in him. He was great. Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have. Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character's personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and, for me, he was very believable. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles. Vera Farmiga was OK. I guess I didn't believe her as a therapist. I think she need a bit more meat, emotionally, and as the girlfriend, physically. I didn't see the original, "Infernal Affairs" so I can't compare the two. This version's story, especially towards the end, seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie's cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles. If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great. It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much. Well worth seeing but not Scorsese's best. His best are icons, "Raging Bull", "Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets". "The Departed" was just a good movie
9.0~What's the Difference? ferguson-6 Sign in Permalink Greetings again from the darkness. I will admit it upfront. It is very rare that I don't enjoy/appreciate/respect Martin Scorcese films. What I will say to his detractors is this is his best work since "Goodfellas". Yes it is based on the 2002 Hong Kong film entitled "Infernal Affairs", and Scorcese is so respectful that he actually notes this in the closing credits. Prepare for a a no-holds-barred all out blazing explosion of film making! And so much fun to watch. If the "f" word bothers you, stay home. It may rival any Tarantino flick for harsh, but real in-this-world language. If violence bothers you, stay home. There are some moments of extremely brutal and realistic violence and bloodshed. On the other hand, if you are a fan of complex story lines, amazing cinematography, top level acting and crackling dialogue, rush out now to see this film. Oh my ... the acting is as good as it gets (pun intended) with Jack Nicholson as the personification of EVIL as Mob boss Frank Costello. This is a very bad man and Jack is in his element. Sure the guy is a great actor and can pull off fluff like insomnia with Diane Keaton, but this is the Jack that we have loved for decades. He literally spews venom with his lines and facial expressions. Matt Damon, back in his Boston comfort zone (remember "Good Will Hunting") pulls off the role of informant with a truly believable lack of conscience that will hit you in the gut. Now what to say about Leonardo DiCaprio? I promise to never call him "Little Leo" again! He is now a man and flashes the acting maturity that Scorcese has been pushing him towards for a few years. Sure, he steals some mannerisms from DeNiro (watch him flick a cigarette) but his simmering emotions are plastered on his face throughout and trust me when I say, this dude has a LOT of emotion!. As is Scorcese's custom, the supporting actors are also solid, believable and disappear into their roles. A bloated, washed-out Alec Baldwin is remarkable. Martin Sheen is fine and Mark Wahlberg had to be laughing out loud when he first read his lines ... I know I was! Few could pull off three or four of Wahlberg's hilarious lines without sounding like a stand-up comedian instead of a wily, veteran cop. Also fun to watch is relative newcomer Vera Farmiga who falls for both Leonardo and Damon in what is one of the few story lines that could have been better developed. Toss in Scorcese's legendary pacing and camera action, an eclectic soundtrack that somehow combines the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison singing Pink Floyd ("Comfortably Numb"), Badfinger and Dvorcak, and the most complex use of cell phones yet, and you have one amazing film that will keep you glued to the screen. A bit of warning ... there is no good time for a potty break during this 2 1/2 hour film so don't buy the large drink!
8.0~better than expected craig-brown-1 Sign in Permalink I expected just another big star ensemble piece from this movie. I knew it would be well made and directed. I was confident of the cinematography and sound. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and weeks later upon reflection I agree that this is one of the better gangster films made. Regardless of what people say Nicholson does a great job as a gangster. The people who think he is too much of a caricature should get out more. The cops in this movie are all excellently acted. The script is great and interesting and is a great portrayal of the characters. And most importantly there is that something special that permeates the whole feature. Anyone who likes a good gangster flick will get this, so will the Scorsese fans and film illiterati. If you are heading to the video store this week and haven't seen it yet - just get it.
10.0~Makes other movies look bad bren7575 Sign in Permalink The thing with Scorsese films is that each time you watch one of his movies, you pick up something new. I loved this movie, entertaining and so well acted, and fun - funny to say in a movie where most of the major (SPOILER!!!) characters are killed off, but the fun is in watching people like Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Baldwin and Walhberg in the same flick at the top of their game. Everyone was excellent but kudos esp. to DiCaprio - mesmerizing and heartbreaking. Recommend highly but don't go if your taste runs to the typical Hollywood pap.It requires the viewer to think; the storyline may appear simple but there are so many sub-layers to the characters and their relationships. An added plus is the soundtrack, not just the usual Rolling Stone songs that Scorsese loves but also the original instrumental music.
9.0~Unbelievable film freaky_dave Sign in Permalink The Departed was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. The characters, including the minor roles, were spectacular an humorous. The story itself was well done and for a movie over two hours long, it sure wasn't boring. Martin Scorsese is one of the premiere directors of his generation. He helped make Robert DeNiro one of the greatest movie actors ever, and with the Departed he shows that he still has what it takes to make a clever movie. With movies like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Mean Streets to his credit, The Departed fits rather well in that great selection of movies. The plot is not real complex. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello, the leader of the Irish Mafia in Boston. The police department is trying to find hard evidence on him so they can finally arrest him. They use a spy of their own named Billy Costigan(Lenardo DeCaprio) to try and get the information they need too finally catch the man. However unknown to the police department, Costello has his own mole planted in the FBI. His name is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and he always lets Costello know what's going down before the police can ever catch him. This cat and mouse game is played throughout the entire movie and has the audience wondering how both characters, Costigan, and Sullivan, are going to manage this all without being caught themselves. This all leads to a violent conclusion which had everybody in shock. Some people were disappointed and some were just plain surprised. I was one of those that was surprised by what went down because it happens so quickly that the audience of the film has no time to react. The final scene on the other hand is somewhat predictable and that alone is probably the only weakness of this film. Overall this film is probably one of the best I've seen all year. All the characters were great, even the minor ones. Mark Wahlberg in particular has a hilarious role, and I mean that in a good way. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were also very good as was Vera Farmiga who plays a clinic psychologist for the police department. Very well made movie and worth the ticket price.
9.0~Finally...the Scorcese I like andre-250 Sign in Permalink What can I say about this movie? Well for starters I haven't watched anything that stands less than a mile from this movie for quite some time. Scorcese is back with a vengeance and for all those people who loved Casino and Goodfellas, I have three words for you: watch it NOW!! Scorcese somewhat deviated slightly from the habitual Italian mafia movie style in the sense that the film is based on the Irish organised crime in Boston. Having said that, mafia is always mafia and if you're turned on by ruthless killings, major drug deals and gangster etiquette, this is the right film for you. The story line is very gripping and the ending gives credit to its master mind. I expected something more when it came to the dialogues between characters, however that's just me wishing that De Niro was part of the crew...everything else is just perfect.
10.0~Amazing. Just incredible. stc010 Sign in Permalink Wow. I'm just speechless. I just got back from seeing this movie, and I still can't believe how incredible this movie was. What I saw tonight was what all movies should try to live up to. Martin Scorsese has created an instant classic with this movie. First of all, this story was an intense thriller that captured my mind from the first scene. It was a good cop/bad cop scenario taken to the next level. This movie forced me to think about the twist turns and connections between the characters. The acting was incredible. Every word, every line, every gesture was true to the character and enhanced the story to the point that I cared about each of the characters and was worried about what would happen to them. To be honest, I expected this this to be a good movie, but I wasn't ready for the awesomeness that pervaded the theatre. Not a word was spoken, because everyone was on the edge of their seats. P.S. The one-liners were incredible. Be ready to laugh in the midst of everything else taking place.
5.0~Vastly disappointed at Director Martin.... felt it could had been done better gu_babe Sign in Permalink I went into the cinema with high expectations on this film because of two reasons: big cast w/ renown director and a Hollywood budget production. I am so sorry but in my personal opinion INfernal affairs in terms of plot was defo miles ahead of The Departed and here is how I would explain it, the major fault was the failure to display the characters inner struggle at the mental level: 1) excessive use of foul language to an unnecessary level... a level that actually hindered me from understanding what the actors were trying to say off their lines. 2) Felt that the director struggled to find a rhythm for the film, and tried too hard to fit in original scenes into this one, e.g. the cast-breaking scene when Leo D had his hand smacked on the table. golf practice scene. Being inspired and plagiarism are two diff things in which unfortunately this film belongs to the 2nd CAT. 3) I don't see the core elements shining thru as much as IA, the contrast between good and evil despite a mis-match of physical identities. the contrast between the good vs. bad group is not presented strongly enough. e.g. how they got young version of Matt Damon to pledge loyalty to the crimelord.......surely any kid wont understand what it meant when the crimelord helps him the 1st time literally for nothing... seemed like Jack Nicholson decided to be Santa that day and walked into the grocery to make sure the kid receives food/things under his name and practically not items from HIS shop but a poor food shop owner who had been harassed for protection fees just 3 mins ago. 4)the killing scenes?? supposedly a battle of wits, now it;s become random killing occasions. I cant see a trace of premeditation here, even the killing of Nicholson by Matt D was made to look as a total accident (i.e killed him out of self defense) From a viewers point of view I was thinking... Oh! just another one down, it kinda became a laugh at the end when 3 person where consecutively shot dead outside the lift........ and us poor viewers totally had NO clue what the motifs were at all. OH not to mention that the death of Martin Sheen was so awkward!! deliberately slowing down his fall from the building... geez it nearly did made me think that it was a doll. 5) whats up with the Chinese crime org trading with the Irish gang? cant even speak cantonese properly...nor did he sound cruel. I really dun know how the crew picked their cast, esp knowing that a cantonese audience will be watching this film. 6) apparently bits and pieces of the plot were transferred to TD which for a person like me who had seen IA before found it stale, unoriginal and most importantly bored. This film had failed to convince me to view a story with a similar backbone from another perspective. Because of a fragmented plot line, I can only give it a 5 at most. However I think Leo D's performance was a breakthrough and he deserves praise for that. Jack Nicholson also played the crimelord well... cruelty without an expression of fear or guilt, perfect. The psychiatrist role was also pretty good...playing justice for the both of these moles, although I would prefer if Vera played the wife of the crimelord cos she seemed to be witty and sly at times. I bet Martin was prob sticking with his goodfellas blueprint and decided that women in mobster films should always be the dumb blonde.
6.0~Both fortunately and unfortunately, it's what we've come to expect from Scorsese shattenjager777 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese was once one of the world's great filmmakers, but the truth is that he has been rehashing some combination of "Raging Bull" and "Mean Streets" for the last quarter-century. Even his latter-day masterpiece, "Goodfellas" repeats the revisionist gangster themes of "Mean Streets" with the visual language of "Raging Bull" almost exactly copied. In this way it's unfortunate that "The Departed" is more of the same. However, even in his darkest hours of imagination, Scorsese has always been a competent storyteller whose films are filled with excellent, vibrant performances, spot-on editing and of course his much-revered knack for choosing score material. In this way, it's fortunate that "The Departed" is more of the same. The story is one that inherently involves all of Scorsese's favorite themes: violence, identity, and loyalty. It tells two essentially identical inverted story lines: (Slight spoiler, but no more than the commercials told you) A young man who has grown up learning from gang leader Frank Costello becomes Costello's mole inside the state police and a young man who has grown up surrounded by criminals becomes an undercover police officer who infiltrates Costello's organization (spoiler over). The intertwined stories are perhaps the most interesting part of the film, since this take on narrative is something new to Scorsese's repertoire, but it unfortunately is not handled perfectly. Some of the editing is coarse for no obvious reason and yet Scorsese does not provide us with any visual cues that either show that we are supposed to be confused or help us orient ourselves. Meanwhile, the acting is perfect all the way. Mark Wahlberg may be a one-note actor, but his character is his note. Meanwhile, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent in deep, layered roles, though Damon does not have the opportunity DiCaprio does to chew up the screen now and again. Martin Sheen is used perfectly in the type of role we're getting used to him playing. Most importantly, the borderline-campy theatricality and evil of Jack Nicholson is used to absolutely perfect effect in devilishly comic portrayal of an underworld kingpin. Oddly, one place where the film goes awry is in its use of music. While certainly the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter" is used wonderfully, to great effect and absolutely appropriately (almost as well as the instrumental section of Derek and the Dominoes' "Layla" in Goodfellas), some of the music was annoyingly distracting. This problem also crept up on Scorsese's last film, "The Aviator," at a few points, which is a disturbing and disheartening trend in the director's career. It almost sounds as if he is trying to insert more "hip" music with which he is less familiar (and which he may even like less) and thus is forcing it into place far more than when he uses some of the classic rock anthems and classical standards he has used to such great effect in the past and even in this film. The presence of composer Howard Shore obviously doesn't help, either, as the master of the Very Standard Score delivers the same thing he nearly always does--a bag of clichés. Overall, the film is worth sitting through once, and probably worth more than that if you're unfamiliar with Scorsese's work. However, it's not much more than that. Watching "Raging Bull" (or "Goodfellas" or "The Last Temptation of Christ," for that matter) again is definitely a better use of one's time. It also certainly wasn't the best picture of the year--"United 93" was.
10.0~Great movie! snailgirl4 Sign in Permalink OK...I know there were some issues that ended up being unbelievable, and some talent was wasted, and I've never seen the original, but still.... this is 10 times better than any of the other crap being put out in movie theaters! I mean, to satisfy you guys does it have to be the most insanely brilliant movie possible? Where do you even find movies you'd rate a 10? Of course it's not perfect, but at least it was intelligent. The ending was a bit much, sure, but it's still better than any thing I've seen lately by far. Because I think this movie drew a fairly intelligent audience with higher expectations than most, I think it's getting knocked unfairly. It's not perfect but I still think it's just so much better than practically any other movie in the last few years. If people are only giving it a 5 or lower, how would you rate "The Holiday" or some piece of dribble? Maybe it's not up to your expectations, but on a scale in comparison to other movies, this clearly tops the majority. I REALLY enjoyed the movie, liked the acting, the storyline, the direction, everything. My biggest problem with the movie was the bizarre Boston accents...even Matt Damon's and Wahlberg's were a mess...and they're from Boston! Both my parents grew up there so I've heard some pretty strong ones, but they didn't sound like that. OK, rant over, there's nothing wrong with pointing out a movie's flaws but I just can't see how this is getting dismissed as a crappy movie by so many people.
1.0~A film filled with unnecessary and nihilistic violence and profanity zach-175 Sign in Permalink Do you know the story about the king who left his palace naked and everyone in the crowd watching him were commenting on his splendid clothes? This is how I feel after reading reviews from well-known and "respected" critics on Scorcese's "The departed". Because that is what Scorcese's film is-it is naked, devoid of any rhyme or reason, of any reason why things happen, of any values. To me it is just the ranting of an older man, it is Scorcese fantasizing about violence, sex, corruption ; it is Scorsese thinking "wow it is so clever to show all this blood and to have my actors swear all the time, yeah this is art" . Well, I am sorry, but this isn't art. This is about Scorsese repeating himself and indulging in his obsessions and us congratulating him. I am not a conservative person- I just feel like the little boy in the story who cried out that the king was naked; like the little boy who wasn't a hypocrite and just showed things as they were.
10.0~you fellas come from providence? joshrez818 Sign in Permalink The Departed is a thoroughly thrilling, provocative gangster drama with the gritty climax and morality that has director Martin Scorceses past triumphs. Featuring amazing performance from an excellent cast that includes Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg. The Departed marks as one of the most triumphant, exhilarating films of 2007. Great Story, Gritty Climax Amazing Performance & Martin Scorceses. The Departed got it all. One of Scorceses' best reviewed film since Goodfellas. I give this movie a 9.8/10. Just a great, over the top notch thriller.
10.0~As Good As It Gets kjarvis1212 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese, perhaps the greatest American film director of all- time, delivers in a major way with The Departed. The movie represents a return to the material that made him a superstar in the first place. And the result is one of the best American crime dramas ever made. Aided by a brilliant script (William Monahan), and an outstanding ensemble cast, Scorsese is in top form here. It should be noted that The Departed is technically a remake of the Chinese action hit, Infernal Affairs, unseen by me. It also uses the true story of infamous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger as a template for the Jack Nicholson character. But I think it would do the film and the viewer a disservice to think of it as a Bulger picture. It is not. It is its own story with its own characters that stands on its own. The film opens with a young Matt Damon in a local diner, listening to Nicholson's notorious local gangster spouting off in his own poetically vulgar way about how cops and crooks aren't so different. Instant flash forward to the future, and Damon's character is being sworn in as a Massachusetts state police officer. Meanwhile, so is another character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. We learn that Leo's character comes from a family with an unsavory, non-law-abiding past. He's confronted by his superior, Martin Sheen, and his sidekick, Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg might be the single most enjoyable aspect of the film, which is saying a lot. He steals nearly every scene he's in as a foul-mouthed, results-driven hothead. They present Leo's character with an ultimatum: quit the force, or join their undercover operation as a mole in Jack's gang. It's a risky proposition, but one they all know is feasible, including Leo. On paper, he'll quit the force and get back into crime, including an assault conviction and a short jail sentence. Then work his way into the Nicholson character's world. At the same time, Damon's character has been handpicked to run a top secret task force out to snag Jack once and for all. But it appears he's still in Jack's debt. One cop who's really a gangster pretending to be a cop, and another who's really a cop pretending to be a gangster. What unfolds is an epic, wholly believable and ultimately satisfying tale about just how thin the line between good and bad can be. It's difficult to overstate the quality of the acting performances in this film. DiCaprio is incredible as a vulnerable savant looking for some sort of salvation, spending his spare time sitting next to a hospital bed occupied by his dying mother. Damon delivers a strong performance as the wormy overachiever who says all the right things and shacks up with the department's psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga in a very effective performance). Alec Baldwin has some great lines in a small but solid role as one of the squad commanders. Sheen is perfect as the wise and cautious bureau chief (or something like that). When Scorsese has material like this, as in Goodfellas or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Mean Streets, its as if he's transported to another time and place that allows him to tell the story with an impeccable sense for placement, color, angle, emphasis, and tone. It's like watching Michael Jordan or Jimi Hendrix. It's a special thing when an artist has such control over their craft. If you're the sort of person who likes a well-written, impeccably acted crime drama, and for some inexplicable reason have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and see it.
6.0~Honestly !! perla_arabia Sign in Permalink If this movie makes a win at the Oscars then this entire business is becoming disgustingly lost for art or entertainment. This movie was predictable, story was lost for reality or credibility, characters were shallow and of course, the violence was too much for nothing. Only couple of scenes were really worth it in the entire two hours. The only real good performance was by Alec Baldwin !!. Leo really is getting better but the voice doesn't help much. Somehow every leo character in black leather and a white T brings to mind one of my teenage stretched pin ups of Brad Pitt the resemblance scary. Anyway, really guys come on the violence was made so easy and with such a star stud cast everyone will vote for guns as a house hold consumable. Good luck cleaning zero self minded people after this. Anyway.. glad i didn't pay a penny to see this movie if you can do the same by all means do it. Thank God most of these good actors already proved they can act before this movie.
8.0~Excellent - but not as good as Infernal Affairs - SPOILERS dslacker Sign in Permalink ***** Contains Spoilers ****** The Departed takes the Hong Kong classic "Infernal Affairs" and moves it to Boston. Skipping yet another plot summary, I'll concentrate on strengths and weaknesses. The writing, directing, and acting is absolutely first rate. Scorscase has assembled a great cast. Unfortunately, Jack Nicholson ONCE AGAIN feels the need to do slapstick and face-muggings in many places where simple acting would have been better. Leo DiCaprio gives what may be his best performance to date - he's riveting as a man so deeply uncover that he's losing his way and losing his mind - thanks to the immense pressure he's under. Having said that, I must also say that Tony Leung's performance in the original was even better. Mr. Leung is probably the best actor in Asia and maybe anywhere. Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and others also do exceptional work. My nit-pick is this: The thing that elevated "Infernal Affairs" to classic status was not only the intricate story (that is preserved in "Departed") but the emotional connection that the audience had with the main characters - even with subtitles. When Tony Leung's good cop went down, it was devastating. When Leo DiCaprio's good cop went down it too elicited gasps from the audience I was with. But it was immediately followed by several other shootings and by the end many audience members were engaging in nervous laughter at the over-the-top violence. There was so much violence in "Departed" that the each occurrence held very little meaning and very little emotion. In "Infernal Affairs" most of the violence evoked true feelings in the audience. I highly recommend "Departed" - its an excellent film - but rent the "Infernal Affairs" DVD - and watch it with subtitles - the dubbed version is crap.
3.0~Departed...? Left the building more like... julianem Sign in Permalink You can include Martin Scorsese in that. Was looking for greatness tonight in this film and I knew we were in trouble when Ray Winstone opened his mouth. Why hire the guy then give him some odd transatlantic accent? He should be a no nonsense gorblimey Londoner. And so the film went down the pan. Crap plotting - didn't know or care who was who or doing what to whom. Jack was 2 dimensional like The Joker without the makeup and the rest of it was like a foul-mouthed Ocean's 11. Michael Mann's Heat was a better two-handed cop flick by miles and I never thought I'd find myself saying that about Martin Scorsese. Two of the greatest films of all time under his belt - need you ask? - Raging Bull and Goodfellas. And now this. Lack of attention to detail and a pursuit of the box office have brought the Master low. Yes Di Caprio worked for it, but his best ever performance was in Catch Me If You Can. And when will Matt Damon stop swanking around and get back to playing Jason Bourne? And why oh why the Psycho and Third Man ripoffs? Just to show he can do it? The rest is silence. Gone. Departed.
8.0~Good, but it lack the resonance of Scorsese's more notable works. refresh_daemon Sign in Permalink I watched The Departed the day after it's general release. While watching, I tried to set aside thoughts of the move it's a remake of, Infernal Affairs, aside to be able to assess the movie clearly. Now, I haven't seen Infernal Affairs in a while, so this wasn't too hard to do, however, since I was privy to plot foreknowledge, nothing was all too surprising. Since I'd lived in Boston for three years, it was quite a treat to get to see that city again (well, some of it wasn't Boston, but enough of it was). The presence of the Yankee accent was okay, although I honestly wished that some of the less successful users had just gone without the accent altogether, because having it come and go sort of dropped me out of believability at times. There are enough long-time Boston natives that don't have it, that it wouldn't be weird for someone to lack the accent. Almost all of the performances were overwhelmingly solid. At times Nicholson and Baldwin seemed to go a little too over-the-top, but it was forgivable. The direction was canny, careful and generally nuanced. Scorsese has always been an able director of actors and pulled out performances and matched it with an eye for visual that's both invisible, yet entirely specific at the same time. I did have some issues with the film. First of all, Nicholson's character got too much screen time. He's not the emotional center of the film and a lot of what we see of him throughout the film may do a fine job of characterizing him as a badass devil-man, but we get that at the start. We need to focus on DiCaprio and Damon's characters and their stories (they are the centerpoint to the film); adding in all this excess Jack actually detracts from the film. The film's already a little bloated, running 2.5 hours, so a little chopping of extraneous scenes would've been good. The ending was another problem. It all came a little too fast and was a little ridiculous--causing the audience to burst out in laughter--when Scorsese should've taken a little care to lead the emotions to that point. And then there's also the groan-inducing last shot--that really just took the ridiculousness of the end over the top. So, what needed to be done to the ending? More attention needed to be paid to the moles. Towards the end of the film, DiCaprio's Billy comes across as wanting out so much that there's little motive for him to do what he does. The lack of motive leads to a lack of believability. I think focusing a little more on Billy and how the life of crime is breaking him down would've helped the drama, especially towards the end. This also goes for Damon's Colin. The impact of the life of being a good guy on his life really should've played a bigger impact. The events towards the end partially don't make sense because there's not enough motive for him to do what he does with Jack's Costello. Since his characterization breaks down towards the end, the finale just doesn't have a whole lot of resonance. This movie really needed to be more about these two characters, even with the intricate plot. That's where the core of the drama should've been focused, but the attention of the film was spread too thin to allow the end to be convincing. Now I'm going to start comparing with Infernal Affairs: * The encapsulation of the two female characters from Infernal Affairs into one had a lot of potential. In IA, the female characters seemed less whole. Unfortunately, the Departed doesn't give her enough attention to pull any real drama. This is made worse by some cheap dramatics thrown in via a photograph and made a little ridiculous by the change in relationship between her and Billy, which wasn't really believable based on her characterization. * Although I liked Walhberg's performance, his character wasn't necessary. The only reason for Dignam to even exist is to create the American ending. This is where Infernal Affairs manages to get it better. It better crafts a relationship between Leung's Chan (DiCaprio's Billy) and his police boss--the boss is the only one who knows and so when the later events occur, it's that much more devastating--and gives sufficient motivation for Chan/Billy to do what they do in the finale. It also prevents the believability hole that Billy wouldn't seek Dignam after those events. * And this is another place where Infernal Affairs shines--the focus on the two moles. The movie really explores how pretending to be someone else can affect the way someone thinks and behaves. Chan is just as desperate as Billy to get out, but Chan also keeps a better eye for justice, despite his problems. Likewise, Lau's character (Damon's Colin) has to grapple with the life afforded him by being a goody-two shoes and figure out just where his loyalties lie and why. This leads Infernal Affairs' ending to be more effective than the Departed's, because it's not cheap and the impact of Lau's decision weighs with him even after the credits roll. No one laughs at the end of Infernal Affairs. * The Departed doesn't have Infernal Affairs' flash and bang, but that works to its advantage--it's restraint, at least stylistically really helps what drama it has. Having come from a long tradition of Hong Kong films, the style pushes melodrama at times in IA. All complaints aside, The Departed really is still quite an enjoyable film. The craftsmanship of all involved is highly polished and immensely engaging. Even though they share the same base, Infernal Affairs and the Departed are both different films, although they could've learned something from each other. The Departed is really good, but it lacks the resonance needed to bring it to the level of Scorsese's more notable works. 8/10.
6.0~Just the matter of styles changkoehan2001 Sign in Permalink For most of our Hong Kong audiences who would compare the original one and the departed after they watched it because most of them have watched the original one before. I would like to say it is not necessary to compare that which one is better or worse and it is not necessary to argue that the scenes are not good enough when compare to the original one. The departed has huge difference of place and cast; it is just the matter of styles. As Martin Scorsese says "I took the device from Andrew lau's film but the film turned into something else form how it began" "we do what we do and they do what whey do in Hong Kong" If you just want to watch it. It is not necessary to watch the Departed after you have watched the original one and It is not necessary to watch the original one after you have watched Departed. What could you get from your comparison? If you really want to compare, you have better to watch the difference of two of them, May be some scenes are better or worse, Jack Nicholson and DiCaprio has absolutely different performance. Just the matter of styles. Please don't forget the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak.
4.0~A Very Disappointing Re-make gromit-17 Sign in Permalink I went to the screening with high hope but was very disappointed for several reasons: 1. The movie is way too long. It added too many uninteresting sub-plots which distracted from the original taut and suspense story. It's confusing and anti-climax. One time during the screening, my friend turned to me and whispered he's lost with what's going on. 2. The movie has a very inconsistent tone to it. From the trailers, most people would think the background of the movie was set a while back, and it said 'Some Years Ago' at the beginning of the movie. However, if you count how many scenes used the compact cell phones and annoying text messaging over and over and over again, then it didn't look right! The mob still acted like mob in 60's but they were using latest cell phones dealing with 'micro-processors'. Eh?! The movie feels and looks like an extra long version of cell phone commercial. What happened to the original nail-biting Morse code tapping scene? 3. The cast has no chemistry! It took me ½ hour into the movie to distinguish Leonardo from Matt. The lead actress is very 'ordinary' and not very interesting at all. Jack is Jack, doing his psychotic hybrid of 'Shinning' and 'Joker' from the Batman. Mark Wahlber (who I usually like) was obnoxious! Alec Baldwin thinks he's still in 'Saturday Night Live' doing all the gay jokes. That lefts Martin Sheen very little screen time to gain my sympathy for his character's death. 4. The key pivotal scenes were let downs from the original, including the falling body and elevator scene at the end of the movie. It supposed to evoke sadness and shock, not disgust and laughs. (Seriously, audience in the screening started to laugh at the elevator scene, which I don't think is the response the movie intended to get out of viewers). And the 'extra' ending was so lame! OK, it got the cheers from the audience, but it was so art-less from the original. Sometimes the ultimate punishment is not death, but to be alive and to carry the burden of shame and guilt forever. I'd rather watch the stylish original 'Infernal Affairs'.
1.0~The original version is better MasterH Sign in Permalink They sure know how to make their version real 'American' with all the F words. That seriously was annoying, how every actor in the movie always needed to curse, I should have counted them. The original (Infernal Affairs/Mou gaan dou) is way better. Why? Cause the most important key was missing! In the original movie; the mole (Chan Wing Yan (as Tony Leung)) in the mafia gang had a great bond with the head guy of the entire case. He gave him a watch for his birthday. At that moment you could see how those two has a bond with each other. That would explain the grief that he showed in the movie when the head guy got killed. The American re-film: Billy and Queenan totally had NO connection in my eyes. All Dignam could do was bash him with the f words. Why the hell would Billy give a crap that Queenan died? They had no bond. I think supposedly in both movies the death of the head guy was the twist in the cases. The both moles (mafia side aswel the police side) realized this cannot continue anymore. Afterwards they had to take strong measurements to the case. That all cause of the death of that head guy. So yeah, I advice everybody to watch the original one first. I think this movie is too overrated. I sure hope they won't re-film part II and III of Infernal Affairs (it is possible you know...).
3.0~What's all the fuss about? ahodara Sign in Permalink Scorsese wanted to give us cops. criminals, mayhem, and suspense. But he didn't seem to care enough to craft an ending with any subtleties, twists, or psychological resolution. For this we sat through 2 1/2 hours of complication? Some other major failings: the opening is too long with lots of unneeded exposition; and that female lead...what a bore. Did she actually have lines? I didn't notice. DiCaprio was great, Damon wooden, Wahlberg surprisingly good, Sheen likable but the Boston accent unconvincing. And then there was Jack. As one critic says, he plays himself. Note the little "Shining" grin at one point. There was no stretching here for the old Lakers fan. Can I get my money back?
10.0~wicked mandyn Sign in Permalink Just simply brilliant, looking at the quotes just cracks me up again. The acting was great. Scorscese just seems to get the best out of actors. good to see J.N. back in a bad guy part. Dicaprio was great too. Even though he's a pretty-boy, he's way talented. I really grew to hate Damon through out the movie, so he did a good job i reckon :p. Even Walberg managed to make me laugh. especially when talking to Baldwin about his wife and mom, ha ha. The cast was just great, and all performed at their best. Love it, just loved it. Length of the movie was pretty good, shouldn't have been longer. 'ne thing i didn't really get was the importance of the therapist chick. And why they didn't pick someone else for it. But besides that, it was all good.
5.0~Holes you could drive a truck through - Spoiler Alert genwebadd Sign in Permalink Sorry, just tired of Hollywood underestimating the intelligence of the audience, there's some great gratuitous violence in this movie if you're into that, but the rest of the movie is pretty weak. Matt Damon has his usual non-existent chemistry with female love interest and displays some extremely wooden acting which worked very well in the Bourne series but not here. So onto the spoilers: How could Nicholson's organization not figure out that the State Trooper drop out (DiCaprio) in his midst is the rat, DiCaprio even refused to give up his social to the gang, even I could get his social off the internet? The scene where Nicholson's entire gang including himself commits suicide by cop, what the..?? Nicholson turns out to be an FBI informant, what the..?? After figuring out that Damon was the Mob mole & after playing it so smart throughout the movie, why would DiCaprio just run out of Damon's office leaving him to figure out he's onto him? Why didn't he just have Damon arrested right there with the evidence sitting on Damon's desk? After the blood bath in the elevator, Damon gets busy wiping prints off DiCaprio's gun, wiped prints, no that wouldn't have looked suspicious? In this scene there's 4 cops, three of them end up dead except for Damon who later recommends DiCaprio for a medal, so if he didn't hang the killing of the other two cops and attempt on his own life on DiCaprio, then who killed the cops and why? Don't they have forensics in Mass, it'd be pretty obvious that it was DiCaprio's weapon that killed cop #2 and that cop #2's weapon killed cop #3, do they give medals for that in MA? Why would a sociopath killer like Damon leave his pregnant police shrink girlfriend alive to tell? She knows everything, especially after Damon sees her weeping for DiCaprio at his funeral. Damon already knows that DiCaprio was seeing her as his counselor, he has to be wondering if DiCaprio is the father and not him? I did love the part where both Damon and DiCaprio are on the roof calling each other homophobic slurs, LOL, too funny, nudge.. nudge.. wink.. wink.., know what I mean? Come on?
1.0~Scorsese Doesn't Score in This One Minerva_Meybridge Sign in Permalink It amazes me how the fact that a director has made his mark will cause him to garner praise from the movie-going masses. It's like all of those who stare at a white canvas with a black dot in the center an proclaim it to be masterful art. Martin Scorsese used to be masterful at generating emotions through violence. Lately, all he seems capable of is generating yawns. I watched the Gangs of New York for a second time a couple of months ago. I felt like I was watching a National Geographic special. There was nothing particularly special about it and Daniel Day- Lewis's voice/accent in it reminded me of Popeye. Scorsese seems to love irritating accents. The Departed is replete with a Massachusetts grate (among the most annoyingto meaccents the English language possesses.) The movie is overlong and takes forever to get anywhere. I loved Leonard DiCapprio in Titanic, but after trying to watch this blubbering whale of an attempt at good cinema, I kept thinking it would have been so much better if his career had stayed submerged. Dicapprio, Walhberg and Damon are all identical pieces of cardboard when it comes to acting and they are all the same type. It's like putting Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Anna Nicole Smith all the the same picture. There's just no telling them apart. The dialogue is flat. The story moves at soap opera pace. The cinematography is the opposite of John Woo. If I hadn't been watching this at home on my wasted DVD purchase, I would have walked out on it and I was almost tempted to, regardless. I remember I actually did walk out on What Lies Beneath years ago. But here there is no beneath. There are no layers. Hey, give me $90 million and I can make a film, too. So, watch out Michael Cimino, you have a contender for the Golden Raspberry Award, because this film is a bowlful. An additional note: Yesterday I tuned in the last half hour of the Academy Awards and have mixed feelings about the fact that the Academy is apparently allowing those who are both blind and deaf to vote the best picture and best director. Apparently, all the sympathy votes for Scorsese finally came in. Argh Gratia Artis!
3.0~Horrible jim-sampair Sign in Permalink This was just not a good movie, it should be free, not for purchase on demand. Screenplay was written terribly, and the directing or editing was bad. It was sort of a bad joke. Not worth repeating. There were time warp issues where things didn't fall into play correctly. It seems like they got finished filming and decided there were too many big names to just scrap it and pretend it didn't happen. The most disappointing was Jack Nicholson and Martin Scorsese were involved and they couldn't even save it. It might have been Jacks' most uninspired acting job of his career, but I think the screenplay was so poorly written as though to dumb it down as much as possible so that the audience would realize how unsophisticated the Boston Irish really are. DeCaprio and Damon were equally bad and Alex Baldwin and Marky Mark were just behind them. The characters were bad, and the attempt to have us understand them was missing except for the vulgar language. I swear, Scorsese must have a deep hatred of Boston and the Irish to portray them so badly. What was good? the shootings and violence were pretty good. I think the script caused this all, it was so bad the top actors and directors couldn't save it. I'm really surprised it made it out. I'm more surprised it is rated so highly online, but now i understand why it took me almost ten years to see it.
6.0~Reverse proportioned performance to the Cast asenkron Sign in Permalink It is one of the rare films that has an enormous Cast and bad performance at the same time in history. I didn't watch it in the cinema and I am not regretful not to do that. Because it is really "disappointment" with one word. One positive side of it is about Di Caprio and he has started to become a candidate of most wanted actors in recent times. Nicholson is like always and he displays his skill in spite of all negative factors. The Director tries to use twist and turns but I think he isn't successful. Most of people could think that my comment is funny but I will say that : The last scenes in which everybody shoot everybody and the scene that detective has been thrown down remind me Tarantino's style. Lastly, it could be watched but it's not an obstacle to criticize Scorsese.
1.0~Another Serving of Scorcese's Overbaked Ham blackwalnut Sign in Permalink If less is more, then more is less. That is a lesson that, in all his years as a film maker, Martin Scorcese never seems to have learned. Never satisfied with mere excess, Scorcese continues to take original, intricate and downright terrific ideas, and bludgeon them into twisted ruins of predictable, derivative, deep-fried sleaze. Scorcese never saw a story so simple he couldn't pack a ton of gratuitous mayhem into it, or a concept so straightforward he couldn't belabor with a ton of profane verbiage, or a character so layered he couldn't redraw it as a cardboard cutout, or a plot so complex he couldn't dumb it down to the level of a five-year-old. As has become habitual with Scorcese, none of his characters can get shot just once, or break his neck instead of splattering on concrete, or get cut with a knife instead of an ax, or survive the movie at all if Scorcese thinks he can get a cheap gasp out of killing him off. Perfect fare for an audience so saturated with decades of Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis garbage that no one bothers to ask for logic any more, and starts to fall asleep if denied a hemorrhage for ten minutes at a stretch. The plot developments and time lines in The Departed are so far-fetched as to reek with implausibility. I won't repeat these; others have enumerated them. But Leonard DiCaprio -- a terrific actor, by the way -- is so ludicrously miscast that his own cat would know it. Here he is, flying into a cold rage with his baby face and beating up on gangsters with his skinny arms... If this milk-fed child were put within a hundred yards of the sort of people he so blithely cons and pistol whips in this outing, he would drop dead of fright. His nemesis, Matt Damon, is every bit as cardboard an imitation of evil as Leo is of good. And Jack Nicholson is... Jack Nicholson. Which ain't bad, or at least it wasn't bad the first fifty or so times we saw it, and we've seen him do it better. Scorcese's female "characters" -- one supporting role to a film -- are usually given little more to do than bob their heads up and down in some guy's lap. He departs slightly from his usual crass misogyny in this film. At least this woman has a job she can perform standing up. But one must wonder how effective she can be in her chosen field -- that of psychiatrist -- being so indecisive and obtuse. A head shrinker who doesn't know her own mind, indeed. Scorcese might tell you that the choice is intentional, and ironic, and therefore somehow meaningful. Nonsense. He can't help it. He must undercut and dilute any strength his women might have. His treatment of them is consistently dismissive, stereotyped and mean-spirited. His whole body of work, in fact, is so testosterone-drenched and chauvinistic, he seems to be begging us to believe he's a heterosexual, when no one would think to doubt it if he didn't protest so much. The only good thing about this hash is the soundtrack. But there's nothing original about it. Scorcese just hired someone to go down to a music warehouse and shuffle out what fit the picture. Not much way you can go wrong, shoving "Gimme Shelter" into just about anything. So go buy the originals. Not the soundtrack; it will only add to the profits for this overblown mess. There is a great story buried in all the junk weighing down The Departed -- realistic, ironic, bitter and layered -- or there was a great story, until Scorcese's ham-handed execution turned it into this childish blood feast. As in "Casino," "Gangs of New York" and that preposterous trash about ambulance drivers, there is an underlying reality that could have been brought to life and memorably rendered. The great pity is that Scorcese has real talent. He has shown it on many occasions, and throughout "Raging Bull." It comes through even as he's trampling on his own better instincts. There's a great director in him, but he doesn't trust himself, or the adolescents he is apparently making movies for, to remember that subtlety, simplicity and grace are cinematic virtues, even if employed occasionally. No, he has to ramp up the volume and the sarcasm and the adolescent rage and the bloodletting until the whole business is just annoying to anyone but a pre-teen. He loads every scene down with inhuman dialog, over-the-top action and ludicrously improbable plot developments -- and then presents it as raw realism. If he was dealing in science-fiction, that would be something else. But he isn't. Boiled down to their basic elements, most all of his films are simple, straightforward stories. Seldom does any of the excreta he piles onto them elevate them to the level of originality, and never to art. It only lowers them to run-of-the-mill cinematic pabulum. Scorcese is bound to share billing in future textbooks on film making with Oliver Stone, another artistic quack who routinely kills his healthy patients by over-prescribing medicines they never needed in the first place, and then chopping them up on the operating table with a chainsaw to compensate. But all this makes heaps o' profits, and ensure that Scorcese will never lack for an audience or his next directing job. Lamentably, all he is really doing is contributing, in his own way, to the lowering of the national IQ. And there are far, far too many vultures — in the media, in politics and in entertainment -- already working that angle.
1.0~not worth the hype miltonmunster Sign in Permalink Saw this again as a friend hadn't previously & I actually couldn't stand to watch anymore the first time due mainly to damon.The highly forced & often disappearing accent & totally,broomstick up my ass,wooden 'actng' from damon just drove me crazy.Even Jack,of whom I'm a big fan,really overdid it where as the joker etc was great this was just poorly & tackily scripted. The story of the newcomer becoming the boss's main man has been done to death & as mentioned by others out of small crew suddenly can't figure out who's the mole.Then there's whiny DiCaprio taking on 2 mafioso's,the meteoric rise through the ranks of both characters,no IAD or senior officials investigations although the mole in the department seemed to be common knowledge. Anyway the whole thing seemed overdone,forced & disjointed compared to the IA it's based on & nowhere near Goofellas etc..The only really convincing one in the whole thing was Ray Winstone,as usual,everyone else seemed either too forced & stereotypical or just pointlessly bickering.But the main reason I couldn't watch the whole thing the first time was damon I just couldn't take his terrible 'actng' there's plenty more to dislike about this but enough for now.
9.0~Scorsese's Back! tghoneyc Sign in Permalink As an avid fan of the original "Infernal Affairs" I can say this one just about equals it. Borrowing a premise and a few memorable scenes, it creates an original vision by substituting the Irish gangs of South Boston for the Chinese mob of the first film. Jack Nicholson, as mob boss Frank Costello, creates an honestly larger-than-life character. A monster who chews scenery as only Jack could. The first scenes feature a younger Costello, roaming his neighborhood in the mid '80s, and help set the pace of the entire movie as he recruits and trains a young boy named Colin Sullivan--later to join the State Police in the form of Matt Damon. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is probably the film's best performance as the other side of the coin, Billy Costigan, recruited by fatherly Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his controversial colleague Sgt. Dignam (an explosive Mark Wahlberg). With few exceptions, DiCaprio has never really fit his roles (he was great in "The Aviator," but he looked too young). Here he perfectly portrays the manic, stressful situation he's been placed in as the cop infiltrating Costello's crew of thugs. Both men end up falling for psychiatrist Madolyn (the very talented Vera Farmiga) in what feels like a Hollywood love-triangle. But given the rather low-key way it is played out, it doesn't feel too corny, despite the improbability. Alec Baldwin offers some hilarious scene-stealing moments as Damon's superior. And British actor Ray Winstone gives a cold, menacing performance as Costello's bodyguard, Arnold French. Scorsese's direction feels fresh, not necessarily from his style, so much as the cross-cutting style he uses feels so totally different from anything else out there recently. And his use of music, as always, works to great benefit. The cast is absolutely stellar. William Monaghan really gives these characters depth. Jack does too. And Scorsese is at the top of his game once again. All I will say about the ending is, I thought I'd never see a movie end this way. But to be vague, it's all tied up in the end. Will this movie win Oscars? Maybe. It's got the acclaim, but I still wouldn't be surprised if it gets overlooked for whatever reason.
10.0~it was one of the top rated movies ever vamsi269 Sign in Permalink excellent! i saw this movie lately and i felt the work by martin was amazing! i story line and the acting by one of the major hero's was good. i think this movie would remain as one of the top movies at least for 3 decades! Leo's character and acting in this movie would be the best of his carer.Direction by martin was fabulous. mark did a very well job and so as Matt.Consider it the return of the real Martin Scorsese.A relentlessly violent, breathtakingly assured piece of mean-streets film-making.While Nicholson relishes his role, there is such a thing as too much relish.After watching The Departed as well as the original Hong Kong movie Infernal.
10.0~Your quality of life will improve after watching THE DEPARTED slb2431 Sign in Permalink Alright, as a Boston area native I was excited to see what the A team could deliver. Honestly I was blown away. Leo delivers an amazing performance and bad ass of the year goes to Marky Mark. Hopefully everyone not familiar with a Bostonians sense of humor will appreciate the amazing witty insults hurled back and forth. Everything from the plot, to the score to the cranberry juice was fantastic. Please watch this movie with an open mind and remember Boston isn't just about chowder and the Red Sox! (The only thing missing was the Westfield State shoutout we were promised 2 years ago!!)
1.0~One of the worst movies I've ever seen! james-bowden Sign in Permalink If there was any socially-redeeming value to this movie, I missed it. It was gratuitous gore, violence, and obscenity from start to finish. Not only that, the whole thing played like a preview: cut, cut, cut every few seconds, jumping around in time and space to the extent that the actual storyline was a confused mess. The language was of the foulest imaginable. Every other word was the F word. No, I take that back. Some multi-syllable words had the F word inserted between syllables! It was almost like a parody of a real crime film, cartoonish and exaggerated. If this is the modern American's idea of a great film, I fear for the future of this country.
10.0~One of Martin Scorsese's finest movies. Period. Superunknovvn Sign in Permalink It's hard to start a review about a movie when you're still so excited you don't know where to begin. Let's take a deep breath for a moment... okay, and here we go: Although he was snubbed by the Academy over and over again Scorsese never stopped working on ambitious projects. He just kept making movies, and they were all solid and good. Still, somehow Scorsese's work lost the importance and the excitement of the director's best movies. "The Departed" brings back a Scorsese that glues your eyes to the screen, that makes you forget time and space around you. This is a film that keeps you thrilled for the entire two and a half hours running time. Truth be told, Scorsese doesn't reinvent himself with this movie. The violence, the callous dialog and the soundtrack including "Gimme Shelter" and other classic songs from the 60's and 70's - none of that is new territory. Still, it's a hell of a treat to watch the master at work. There's no one who makes a gangster movie like Scorsese. He understands exactly what the story needs, how it needs to be paced. Scorsese's direction serves the plot and not the other way round, which is what sets "The Departed" apart from some of his other masterpieces such as "Raging Bull". Quite a lot of movieshave five, six or seven top stars in their casting list. In the end you're often let down because some of them don't really have important roles or only very limited screen time. In this movie all of the big names make something of their role: Mark Wahlberg as the amazingly unfriendly but unbribable cop, Martin Sheen as Nicholson's opponent and DiCaprio's father figure, Alec Baldwin as the frustratingly idiotic boss and Matt Damon as the slippery traitor. The two actors that make "The Departed" what it is, however, are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio. Jack Nicholson is just Jack Nicholson. He does what he always does, which means that he's great. He was born to play the bad guy. It's quite amazing that he hadn't worked with Scorsese before and it's like a fanboy's dream come true to see their collaboration working out so well. One can't help thinking: "What if DeNiro had played the part?". Sure, that might have been interesting, too, but it's doubtable whether DeNiro would have been able to pull off a villain as clownish and sexed up as Frank Costello. Speaking of DeNiro, Leonardo DiCaprio clearly has proved himself a more than worthy successor as Scorsese's steady collaboration partner. His performance as the tormented undercover cop is once again outstanding. His hounded look alone creates half of the movies' tension. It's quite amazing how versatile this little babyface is. "The Departed" should convince even the last skeptics of this guy's talents. At the age of 64 and after movie classics as legendary and influential as "Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull" and "GoodFellas", Martin Scorsese has delivered one of the very best movies of his entire career. Its characters may not be as iconic as the ones from the movies mentioned above, but the superb storytelling and the amazing acting in "The Departed" make this nothing less than a true masterpiece. It's Oscar-time, Baby!
1.0~Awfully made mandizu Sign in Permalink It's like a set-up. You would never know how much you regret on watching this miserable faulty s*** until it's ended. Then you know you better think it carefully next time when a film filled with F words and holding the attitude of every-one-die-by-the-end type of film came out. Even though I haven't seen Internal Affair before, I thought the idea of such plot very disappointing. The only contribution we could expect from this film is the art of dirty words and the thoughtless placement of death to key roles. It's awful to see such a fast-food movie to be so lengthy, think of the time we wasted, they are murderers.
6.0~Not That good,, here is why... spoiler.. (just my opinion) speedy-gonzales-1 Sign in Permalink many things that I did not like about the movie... (try to keep it a little bland to keep movie interesting if you haven't seen it.. even though you know this is a spoiler) * the girlfriend was into the bad boy thing.. but when she finds out that her boyfriend that shes cheated on has broken the law on occasion she is ready to leave him for it, and go to the criminal guy.. ? * the envelope she is given if "whats his name" dies,, she never opens it.. she does open the other one.. the scene of her getting it had no point.. * to many names to remember,, they could have fixed this.. Mark Walberg played his role excellent.. but his character was not needed.. the movie would have been better without his character. * Movies that kill all the main characters, seem to have no point.. i'll take some Shakespeare where the message is in the death,, but this wasn't like that.. is shake is spelt wrong,, he didn't even know how to spell it.. * the rat on the railing.. how cheezy. and like that building would have that rat problem.. if it was left there ,, why kill him before he sees it? * the killing at the end,, why would he kill him? and the way he did it.. no one is going to notice a guy in a fancy high end condo walking around in a plastic outfit, that body would be noticed very fast. and what a horrible death.. why show all this guys fight and reflexes, and football skills and leadership, just die with no fight.. from his point of view,, he's just killing a good cop.. and he (walberg) was not a rat.. he set up everything that had to be undone.. just my opinion,, acting was excellent,, 3/4 of the movie was really good.. maybe there is a directors cut that will change a lot of these points.. I still give it a 6 out of 10..
10.0~Superbly intricate and inhumane Dr_Coulardeau Sign in Permalink Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
8.0~Unforeseen Tragedy jon.h.ochiai Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is captivating movie-making. "The Departed" is not the year's Best Picture; although it seems destined for the Oscar gold. Director Martin Scorcese generates powerful and compelling performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Jack Nicholson. Writer William Monahan's story is based on the screenplay for "Infernal Affairs" by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. "The Departed" starts off great and has a stunning Act 2. However, Act 3 is horrible in the sense that the movie suddenly turns stupid, and then desperately and unconvincingly ties up loose ends. I think Martin Scorcese wants to demonstrate that along with his preoccupation with the darker side of humanity, he also has a sense of cinematic justice. This is a feeble attempt at best. The going in premise is an intriguing look into intertwined cultures from the perspective of cultural moles. Colin Sullivan is a smart sharp kid in Boston, virtually raised by Irish Mafia kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin (Matt Damon) becomes a Boston Police cadet and quickly rises through the ranks of the Boston Police Department. Sgt. Colin Sullivan remains beholding to Frank. Colin becomes a key player in a federal task force that infiltrates the Boston Irish Mafia. On the polar opposite, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a bright police cadet with questionable family ties which does not bode well for his career as a police officer. We witness Billy burying his dead mother. Billy's late father was a man of honor, an Airport worker who refused to join Frank Costello. Billy strikes a deal with Boston Police Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Detective Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to go rogue undercover and disavowing any ties to the Department. Billy's job is to get in with Frank. Along the way Colin romances police staff psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). Farmiga has the thankless job of essentially portraying a plot device, as charming as she is. The performances in "The Departed" are amazing. For that acknowledge Scorcese. Leonardo DiCaprio has grown into a powerful leading actorhe commands the screen. He is edgy and dangerous. It is puzzling that Matt Damon did not receive more acclaim for his role as insider Colin. Damon balances a slick soullessness and believable consuming desperation. Jack Nicholson as Frank displays unrecognizable restraint in a compelling performance. Ultimately, the script fails the movie. During an early scene in the movie Billy (DiCaprio) quotes Nathaniel Hawthorne. Detective Dignam (Wahlberg) makes the snide remark that he was expecting him to quote Shakespeare. Ironically, "The Departed" is not great tragedy. It is not Shakespeare. Unfortunately, it seemly intended to be so. This in itself is tragic, given the promise of the story's premise and the superb cast. My friend Chuck said that "The Departed" would have been great if it ended before devolving into senseless violence. His comment is brilliant and insightful. There is neither great catharsis nor any grand noble act in the end to redeem "The Departed". What we are left with is a harried mess. And that is truly a tragedy.
1.0~Everyone shoots everyone. ooops I gave away the plot! Tilyou1 Sign in Permalink Jack Nicholson does his impersonation of Rip Torn, Dicaprio and Damon are distinguished only because one of them (but which?) has some facial hair, and all of them and everyone else puts on a lousy "Southie" Boston accent so even the actors natively from there come across as fake. Except a few actors put on a fine Irish Brogue so you know they're Irish. Such entertainments are needed in this remarkably plot-free orgy of camp, grumbling, meaningless shootouts and poignant cell phone usage. I haven't counted to see if cell phones are used as often as guns, but no doubt a future thesis on the theme is lurking. Jack Nicholson at one point refers to the John Hancock building. That's a building in Boston. Wow, Nicholson was so in character he might have just winged that. Everyone calls everyone else a rat, or an undercover, and sometimes they say things like "He's undercover!," What undercover?" "No, he's my undercover." Abbott and Costello more humorously expressed it: Who's rat's on first? There's also authentic Hollywood crime lingo, like "were you tailed" (a play on rats perhaps). Everyone informs on everyone else and in the end, everyone shoots everyone else, except one person who's character is so vague you can look him or her in the eye and not know who. "I want my identity back," says one character, mysteriously. All of this highlights the key themes of the film, that everyone is everyone else, and in the end, only cell phones survive. There's also a lot of looking in cell phones, presumably because to Hollywood types, even more than the rest of us, looking at cell phones is done often and always is a thrill. This movie is a really good argument for having movies directed instead of run by mugging improvisers; alternatively a future film can dispense with actors entirely, and focus entirely on cell phones and computer screens. However the City of Boston, played largely by itself, is convincing. T
5.0~Why is everyone raving about THIS film now when it's a drawn out remake! w-martyn-1 Sign in Permalink Hi Everyone. For those people who don't know, this is a remake of a Hong Kong classic trilogy Infernal Affairs. Infernal Affairs is a better, more compact film that has more tension,a great ending and it just flows better for 2 hours. Don't get me wrong, The Departed is a good film, with many great actors, but you don't need these actors in this movies, I think this takes someone away from it. People didn't go to watch films like Reservoir Dogs or Donnie Darko for the actors, they went through word of mouth, because the films sold themselves. Why does Hollywood remake ideas from other people and then get all the credit for it? "Scorsese, what a genius, he should win an Oscar". What crap, you tell me why he should get credit for this?. If anything Andrew Lau & Alan Mak should get credited. I can only hope that Hollywood do not get credit if and when they remake 'Oldboy', 'City Of God' and 'Downfall'. Perhaps Downfall will be set in the Whitehouse at the end of the Vietnam War. Watch Infernal Affairs first, then you can pass judgement.
9.0~Directing Expertise And a Phenomenal Cast jamheigei Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese once said about this movie >>it's the first movie I've made with an actual plot<< (not the actual quote but you get the point) and compared to most other crime films of the 2000s, that's very true. It's complex and every aspect of the plot is displayed in a manner where yes, you understand it, but you're also often enough busy figuring out who knows what (because you the viewer know everything). What really makes the movie outstanding though is the cast and production. Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg play amazing and the performances of Leo DiCaprio and especially Jack Nicholson are truly impeccable. Not a false note anywhere; I might have given Nicholson the Oscar if I could. The last (and greatest) aspect of the movie is Martin Scorcese's directing. Just by watching the movie and not even paying attention to what's going on in the story, you see how much of a directing veteran he is. Every shot has a purpose, every line fits perfectly into the scenes. There are so many details that even other great directors don't remotely think about. I've found this kind of attention to an immersive world only with one other man in a similar way: Steven Spielberg. Don't get me wrong; other directors create immersive worlds and have a wonderful directing style (Fincher, Nolan, you name them) but few do it as seamless and effortless as Scorcese and Spielberg.
10.0~Academy Award Winner of Best Picture for a reason Lord_Crypto Sign in Permalink When I went to see The Departed, I was left with a feeling I very rarely have after watching a movie. I usually either feel satisfaction or disappointment, but The Departed left me craving. I wanted more! I did not want the film to be over! There is never a dull moment in this film! I really do not care if some people feel it is a copy-cat film of the Chinease movie "Internal Affairs". I absolutely love this movie and I am glad so many people enjoy it as much as I do. Martin Scorsese is able to somehow grab a certain story from real life and just turn it into an unbelievably good movie. He does that here. He is able to take the terms and lifestyles used in an original historical Boston setting and incorporate them into this film. The story itself is terrific. It focuses on the part of two "undercover" agents working against each other! One is a police officer inside a Boston mob organization and one is a member of that organization inside the police force. The entire story sets up nicely and builds up to a huge climatic point where to put it simply, "the $hit hits the fan!" The filming of this movie is fantastic! Every scene looks perfect! There is plenty of action in this film and a lot of humor. There is never a point of boredom or uneasiness! The movie flows so perfectly that you can follow it easily! If I were to put this film into a genre, it would be a mixture of a comedy/action/drama/suspense/thriller. The casting in this movie is self-explanatory. Just look at the names; DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg, Winstone, M. Sheen, and Baldwin. Everyone plays their hearts out! DiCaprio and Damon are good in their two lead roles. Nicholson was up for an Oscar Nomination for his role which is fantastic! He plays the stylish and dangerous mob boss Frank Costello. Alec Baldwin is pretty darn funny, he plays the head of a special investigation unit of the police department! But the best actor in this film is without a doubt, Mark Wahlberg. He got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his character, Dignam! He stole every scene he was in! He was extremely funny and serious at the same time. A terrific performance on his part. All the actors in this film feed off of one another brilliantly. You can pick out the intensity they have when they are shooting this film. It is phenomenal! And although the actors do a great job in their roles, the characters created for them are perfect! Every character created for this film has an important part and they all do something memorable for this film. Everything about the actors and the characters in this film rocked! I love Martin Scorsese and I truly believe, in my own opinion, this is his best film. I know it is my favorite but I think it may also be his best. This film has everything a good movie needs! Yes, you can expect violence and a lot of vulgar language, but it is worth it! The vulgarity in my opinion only adds to the intensity of the film. I truly believe everyone should see this movie. It may seem long at 2 and half hours but it is worth it. If you (the previewer) does watch this film, I hope you gain the same respect for it I have. Because 30 years from now, people will still remember this movie and those people will remember how fantastic it was.
7.0~Humor and Playful Touch Save Scorcese's Latest from Tedium steverino171 Sign in Permalink As an English teacher, whenever I had students write short stories in class the boys would always end them the exact same way: total mayhem where everyone gets killed. There is something juvenile about killing off all of your characters to tie up a film. Scorcese is known for that; in fact, you could say it's his signature. From Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his film's resolve themselves in explosions of violence. Just like my fifteen year old students' stories. But my students worked under time constraints (50 minutes), they were writing in a foreign language, and they're fifteen. For a professional filmmaker such a hackneyed means of tying up a story demonstrates an unfortunate dearth of creativity. Nevertheless, The Departed's script, some fine performances, and some restrained direction from Scorcese distinguishes the auteur's latest cops and gangsters film from the myriad others he's directed. Scorcese certainly lacks subtlety. And he holds steadfast to familiar themes: organized crime, pervasive corruption, anti-social hypermachismo, and of course, purgation through violence. The Departed certainly has all that. It revolves around an undercover cop who's infiltrated organized crime in Boston, and a mole for organized crime entrenched in the state police department. While the police probe their own department to find the mole, the Irish gangsters try to smoke out the rat among them. The dialogue is a Mametian pitter-patter of obscenities and insults spewed forth like high school poseurs trying to impress upperclassmen. It's all tough talk. Until all the tension and wrath culminate in a fiasco of gunfire and instantaneous death (I've never seen so many clean shots to the head before). Still, the dialoguebut not the story, with its gut-wrenching yet trite endingis the film's saving grace. The Departed's all-star cast fire off snappy one-liners like rounds from their Kalashnikov's. "Who am I? I'm the guy who does his job. You must be the other one" barks Mark Walburgh to an impudent but incompetent video technician. When Vera Farmiga tries to give a flirtatious Matt Damon her business card so they can meet for lunch, Damon's smart-ass reply is "No thanks. I'll find you. I'm a detective. Just kidding. I need the card." In spite of all of the mayhem and macho posturing, the film has a breezy sense of humor that eases the tension. And to his credit, Scorcese handles it well. Unlike his previous two efforts, The Departed never gets too heavy-handed or brooding. Also, certain much-needed playfulness in the performances keeps the movie flowing smoothly. Thankfully, Scorcese doesn't indulge in any forehead grasping moodiness that might've halted the show dead in its tracks. He gamely keeps the tension and humor brisk throughout. And the performances of the all-star cast are nuanced and subtle. In a nice touch while Farminga keeps the pahk the cah on hahvahd yahd accent under leash for most scenes, she lets it loose when she gets emotional. And still more credit goes to screenwriter William Monohan for drawing distinctly similar yet discrete characters. The film could just use a more interesting, perhaps less bloody ending. If he had that, it could've been one of Scorcese's more distinguishable films. Instead, it's just a furiously entertaining one.
10.0~Wonderful Movie! christinadanielle182 Sign in Permalink I only went to see this movie because I am doing a project in school about Martin Scorsese. I did not really think that I was going to like it but it was so great!! Martin has a way with doing things in his movies that make them so much different than any movie that I have seen. Leo Decaprio really shines in this movie as does Matt Damon. Actually the cast was a total "A" cast. Mark Walburg will keep you laughing every time he is on the screen. This movie has a lot of cussing so I don't think that kids should see it but I would recommend it to anyone else! I promise that you will not be disappointed in this movie. Oh and it is pretty long but it is full of action the entire time!
4.0~Seriously? *CONTAINS SPOILERS* sssfk16 Sign in Permalink This has to be one of the most overrated films of all time. What cheap commercialized ethnic pandering. Anyone can figure out exactly what is going to happen up until the end, when they have to invoke the oh so popular deus ex machina. Whatever happened to a good script with credible dramatic irony and foreshadowing not pulled completely out of its own ass? And good directing? The man has done the same movie for 40 years! If he can't do better than this then he needs to retire to one of his 26 mansions located in the city limits of New York/Boston/L.A. You want the formula for a "great Hollywood movie?" It's quite apparent: 1. Target an audience with a great sense of ethnic pride centered around a profession and exploit them. 2. Hire a washed-up director with a good reputation. 3. Add a twist at the end, even if it doesn't fit at all with the film. 4. Add a love interest that has nothing to do with the plot even if you build it up for it. 5. Make sure Leo dies at the end, it works every time. Even if he's not in the film, just throw him in at the end with a random knife wound or something.
10.0~You think you know everything, but you will be on the edge of your seat anyway. fender12str Sign in Permalink I can't remember the last time I watched a movie that could keep me so engrossed from start to finish. This movie is a reminder why Martin Scorsese is a director's director. There no point in this movie that says formula. It is original and packed with incredible acting. This is by far Matt Damon's best performance. I generally like his movies, but I always saw him as one of those actors that looked like they were acting. He sank himself into this part and deserves recognition for great acting. Scorsese knows how to bring out the best in his actors because even the legendary Jack Nicholson out performs himself. A superb film
3.0~Language jane-392 Sign in Permalink The movie is good, but I am curious to know why the writers have to resort to so much bad language. Many great movies have been made without inundating the audience with senseless cursing every other word. In reality the "F-bomb" was dropped, on average, every thirty seconds. I would think that the "writers" could try to convey their message by using more powerful writing. It's too bad. I can't really recommend this movie because the foul language is the only thing thing that stuck in my head instead of a good story. It's no wonder people today speak in such a disrespectful manner. It's all that Hollywood throws at them.
8.0~flick watch tmc75 Sign in Permalink the movie kept me in the whole time i was watching violence. the flick doesn't seem to be about much more than violence, thats fine. in fact, im ruling out its about crime and violence, so basically, its a film about violence. the duality, i thought, was elementary. there wasn't much of a build up, to what ? Jack was bad ass. mark was uncharacteristically limber.. was interesting. the scene where the 2 say nothing to each other is great, but its not that significant of a showing. the same goes for when baldwin punched the guy for setting up the cameras, which did make me laugh. in summary, there is nothing anyone can say to stop this movie from being hugely successful. it didn't do much for me, other than keep me interested the whole way through, on the first view. its a movie for amateurs.
9.0~A well crafted film Krispur Sign in Permalink I have watched it once and will do it again! It is a very well done movie. If the whole story doesn't shock you, the ending will. The plot is set very well. I would say that it has a bit of different types of movies - comedy, theatrical, drama, crime - all in one. The performances were very enthusiastic, every actor played their best. Bringing all of those well known actors together - Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg - in one film, is the icing on the cake. If it wasn't set up the way it was, I would consider it to fall in the lines of a "chic flick" - only for the actors in it. Most of them are still what most ladies would consider to be the "ladies man". The entire movie is so spectacular that I would definitely recommend this movie to others, and I definitely look forward to seeing the sequel (if they make one).
6.0~Without Nicholson, Departed Would Have Been Better mike-925 Sign in Permalink The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction. Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was probably a superior script. I'm rushing to get a copy from Netflix as we speak. The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston Police Department. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime. Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews this weekend, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process. The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop. There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script. Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too. But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio. Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star. Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time. The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.
7.0~Masking Good and Evil DaveDiggler Sign in Permalink The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live. With films like "Raging Bull," "Taxi Driver," Goodfellas," and more recently "The Aviator" and "Gangs of New York." Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with "The Departed." "When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?" This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you've done; when death is staring you in the face, it takes no prisoners. Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello's next and future pawn- the wise, savvy, charismatic, charming, and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon, who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro's, "The Good Shepherd". From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia. His counterpart, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello's crew for Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen). Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are the only two people that know Billy is a cop. Academy Award nominee, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking, always ready for anything, humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama. Dignam can be cold, callous, and most of all, a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU. As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields, the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello's crew heats up in search for the rat(s). There are twists and turns in every direction. As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins. The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner, William Monahan. The two opposing figures in the film- Colin and Billy- frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist, named Madolyn. Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about, but has no clue how grave her situation is. The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to. Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl, and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl. One is putting on an act at all times, and both men struggle to keep their identity in check. Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him. Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career, and an Oscar worthy one at that. The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them. This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia. Costello is not your typical gang leader. He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him. He like's to go and listen to the opera. He loves fine wines and lobster dinners (with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy- especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan.). He also doesn't mind indulging in a little annoying fly, that may be crossing his face at the wrong time, or even a little coke to set the mood so that he's comfortably numb. He has his flaws as every man does, but Frank doesn't recognize any weaknesses because he's just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder. The very deep characters surrounding Costello, along with Costello himself, make this a "must see." We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out. They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn't result in death. Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back. Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives. This is where we see the characters become three-dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters- good or bad. We see what they are and how far they've fallen. Their weaknesses make them so humane that it's impossible to not feel or root for them. As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing. The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed. For most directors this would be their crowning achievement, but for Martin Scorsese, it just another classic to add the resume.
1.0~Sell-out! vinceb-3 Sign in Permalink In a society where being rich and famous is everything, it's sad to see a former rebel succumb to his nation's core values. Martin Scorsese decided being a celebrity with all the material trappings were what mattered most to him, and dreadful films like Departed and Aviator are the result. Perhaps Mr. Scorsese can rationalize his admirable work on film restoration and figure he's doing his part for the greater good, but I'm not buying it. In fact, I no longer will see a film simply because Martin Scorsese is the director. I wish he and Mick Jagger would take their champagne and yes-men to France, and leave the film and music-making to more eager and less corporate fellows. Also, as much as I respect Roger Ebert's analysis and writings, I can not take seriously his review of a Scorsese film. Don't know if their buddies, but if Scorsese directed The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh, Ebert would give it four stars.

I mean, if he is a puppy that is awesome, and I love him. However, if he is not a puppy, I will never allow his name to be mentioned in my dorm room ever again.
9.0~Departed has left the building, stratospherically pantera1 Sign in Permalink The world is divided into two; those who believe Scorcese has been victimised and deliberately ignored in the Oscar stakes and those who think he's trying a little tooooo hard to worm his way into the Oscar Academy's graces. Okay, so TAXI DRIVER (9/10) could've won but it was also against NETWORK (9/10) and the eventual winner ROCKY (9/10). And who could forget the incredible KING OF COMEDY(10/10) with Bob De Niro playing the wanna be standup Rupert Pupkin with Jerry Lewis playing the straight man. Yes, with his last two films, you watched them and go "so what?" GANGS(6/10) was almost camp in some of its violence with the cartoonish Daniel Day Lewis , while THE AVIATOR (6/10) made one look on in horror at Leo De caprio's miscasting. And made you wonder what the hell he saw in Leo apart from his pretty blue eyes? He's back. This is gangster opera. Ebbing and flowing through a sometimes complex film with more crosses( and double ones) than a Lourdes shrine. And put any TITANIC (6/10) misconceptions to rest; this film shows Leo can act. He plays an undercover cop, Billy Costigan, who goes so deep that he finds it hard to come back. An emotional tour de force, and force majeur. Makes me look forward to seeing BLOOD DIAMOND in the coming year. The basic premise is of undercover infiltrations into the violent ganglands of Boston; not the first natural milieu for the genre you'd think of, in this most mayflower of cities. Jack Nicholson plays a crime boss who does it as much for the love of the game as for the profit it brings. Matt Damon is an ambitious cop with plans for the future which take him outside of the force. But his past won't free him and he knows it. An at times unbearably tense film, it gripped me throughout. Great support by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, alec Balwin, Ray Winstone and the not so insignifcant love interest Vera Farmiga. And expect to see Marty up on the stage come February 25th, with his cheeks shining with tears and Jack in the front row, slow clapping him up with his trademarked grin.
10.0~Another Scorsese Masterpiece phyzzique Sign in Permalink 'The Departed' is one spectacular film. Martin Scorsese has directed another masterpiece. The action, suspense, tension, excitement that this production generates is amazing. Each shot keeps your attention - you can't take your eyes off the actors. And what actors! Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan is so good that he even keeps up with the legendary Jack Nicholson - scene for scene. And often surpasses the master. Mr. DiCaprio will definitely be nominated for the Academy Award this year and should win (but the ultra-liberal academy will vote for Will Smith). The aforementioned Jack Nicholson is just plain wonderful as Frank Costello. Matt Damon is chillingly perfect as Colin Sullivan, giving a superb performance. This is certainly Matt Damon's year, with this film and 'The Good Shepherd', both 2006 releases. Alec Baldwin is in both films as well, and boy has he become a great character actor. Personally, I think he still has lead actor quality and ability. In 'The Departed' he is great, just great. One more actor I wish to mention is Mark Wahlberg. Mark Wahlberg has never given a bad performance - that said, he is amazing as Dignam, the hot-tempered detective. The rest of the cast is fantastic. Scorsese's casting choices are right on target. The soundtrack music is terrific. I noticed that there are two versions of it. Guess I'll have to get both. Great Film!
6.0~Huge disappointment quentar Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is being hailed in some circles as Martin Scorsese's return to a genre he knows like the back of his hand -- the gritty crime drama. And to be fair, there are moments of grit in the film. The problem is they are just that -- moments. Nothing ever builds to any tangible feeling of dread. The film's effect (if it has any at all) dissipates the moment the credits roll. The acting is serviceable at best, but the much touted script by William Monahan barely gives the main stars anything to sink their teeth into, with the exception of Mark Wahlberg. He's the only actor who registers anything resembling a real, live human being. Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon try their best, but when they're not spouting exposition they're floundering with dialogue that tries in vain to give their characters some color. (The session between Leo and shrink Vera Farmiga, for example, drags on to embarrassing length in a dismal effort to give Leo some shading.) And while most reviews praise Nicholson, he's more of a distraction than any kind of menacing character. For all his offbeat touches, his character never come across as dangerous; in fact, the longer the film goes on, the less interesting he is and the more goofy and unbelievable he becomes. (There were times I wondered if anyone could possibly follow him into a life of crime.) As for Scorsese, whatever gritty touch one might think the master would bring to a supposed throwback project is sorely missing. At 2 1/2 hours, the film has a noticeably slack pace, and many scenes are surprisingly flat, considering Marty's way around a camera. The only scene with any real tension is the rooftop scene between Costigan and Queenan. The photography, editing, and acting all combine in a perfect example of film suspense. Nothing else in the film is nearly as exciting. And the less said about the ending the better. It feels like Marty is trying to channel Quentin, but it just gets more and more outrageous until all connection with reality is sapped away. Too bad. I wanted to love "The Departed", but I can barely say I liked it.
2.0~An utterly depraved production. ac4aq Sign in Permalink The Departed is the film which sets a benchmark for depravity in a production by a major motion picture studio in that it amounts to little more than star-studded snuff porn. It features filthy dialogue, completely implausible when spoken by disciplined law enforcement officers in an open forum. It includes murder by gunfire ad nauseam, not unlike viewing the Zapruder film of the assassination of President Kennedy a dozen times in swift succession. The script is mechanical, the plot turns are shocking but certainly not surprising. The development of the characters is poor, just the usual suspects. On the lighter side, the demise of Det. Queenan (Martin Sheen) provides comic relief, falling to his death in the manner made famous by Wile E. Coyote in numerous animated short subjects, all that's missing is the whistling sound effect. Regrettably Queenan is not indestructible and is not resurrected in the next scene. What remains to me the greatest shock of all is that this feature release won several awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year! It must have indeed been a vast wasteland in Hollywood in 2006 for this can of raw sewage to be so voted. I must look in the almanac and see if Private School (For Girls) won Best Picture in 1983, as it certainly was a more deserving production. Folks, life is short. Don't waste on hour of it on The Departed. And don't reward those who profit from it with so much as a nickle. If you feel you must view this, watch it on a friend's cable TV, as I unwittingly did. jHh
10.0~Oscar nods whill4 Sign in Permalink How in the heck does Mark Wahlberg get a best supporting actor nomination and Di Caprio get nothing. The Oscars have truly become the least credible movie award, and yet they maintain their glamor. WHY???? Also why does it seem that an actor with two wonderful performances in one movie year only get one Oscar nomination?? How many times are actors and actresses get nominations for a performance that was only half as good as another performance in the same year? An example is Sean Penn winning best actor for Mystic River when his performance was much better in 21 grams. Anyway this is just my rant because I like Di Caprio and he deserves at least an nomination for his performance in this movie, especially since he was a supporting character. I guess the Oscars have a lot of trouble deciding who is the main character in a movie where there is no main character only supporting characters. It saddens me that the best performance 'I have seen' all year didn't even get a nomination.
8.0~Scorsese has done it again! forindcine Sign in Permalink Director Martin Scorsese has done it again. In the 70s through 90s he was the mastermind behind the films Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ the epic Kundun and the great Goodfellas. In the last 5 years he's spent time directing, Gangs of New York, The Aviator and now - The Departed. Scorsese is the kind of director; character actors rush, hope and pray for an opportunity to work with. Watch any film in his extensive filmography and you will understand in an instant. The Departed is a story about two informants in the Massachusetts State Police department who work for and against the Boston mafia. The film includes a laundry list of supporting actors. They include Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, and Martin Sheen but it leads with Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and my man Leonardo DiCaprio. Damon performs another solid role as the mob mole working in a special task force inside the state police. Nicholson plays "himself" as the dangerous Irish mob boss but he has finally re-invented himself into a dangerous, believable and refreshing character - imagine that. Then we have DiCaprio, one of the best male actors on from the left-coast. Scorsese starred him in "Gangs," trusted him to play the mysterious Howard Hughes in the "Aviator" and has him sneak around inside Nicholson's mob in this thriller. Dicaprio is completely convincing as he moves in circles, unable to trust anyone. Departed places you in the middle of a world filled with murder and much aggression, all necessary to convey this intense story. The film is easily followed but full of credible twists and turns. Scorsese introduces a new character that should be given a Best Supporting nod if only it had a heart. He has taken our modern day convenience, the cell phone and turned it into a character never before seen on screen. As with any mob film, there is plenty violence but don't let that deter you from seeing one of the best films this year.
10.0~One of my all time favourite movie! hazhussain Sign in Permalink Fantastic from start to finish. Unbelievable cast, great twist and you really get into each character in the movie. Superbly directed too.. Must see !
10.0~Absolute Classic adrian-419 Sign in Permalink after watching this film i was reminded why i enjoy movies and why they are one of thee most powerful mediums that exist! Leonardo and Matt just show that they can hang around with the guys of acting skills the likes of the big Jack! Fooking brilliant film!!!!!! The minute the film ended i wanted to watch it again, i was buzzing at what i had just watched as were the family and friends that were with me.If only there were more movies of this calibre i would live at the cinema!!Not a family film i will add, but if you like Scorsese you will love this film!Leonardo Dicaprio is has now become one of my favourite actors due to this and the Blood Diamond! If he does not win an Oscar this year then the Oscars might as well hang there hat up for good!!!!!
8.0~Not too entertaining if you've seen the original, Infernal Affairs. janjaali Sign in Permalink The key to enjoying this movie was to not know,in the middle of the movie, what happens at the end . I didn't know that this was a rip off of an Asian movie. I had watched Infernal Affairs (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/) a while back, with subtitles, it was very entertaining. This is an excellent movie if you don't already know the story; but if you do, well...then it looses it's value half way through. I'm surprised about how exactly they copied the original and didn't add any good twists to it. Remaking Asian horror movies might work, as they are so open ended. But this remake was nothing more than putting new faces to the actors. This movie is great if you haven't seen the Infernal Affairs; if you have, I suggest spending your $10 on something else.
1.0~I guess watching paint dry can be Oscar material bigdupe Sign in Permalink Make it long, add top star billing, and spend a zillion dollars, and I guess anything can receive an award. Silly me, I thought original, provocative, and at the very least, plausible story telling was needed for good drama. Let me start by adding, that "great" actors are useless when miss-cast. I'm sorry, but Damon and DiCaprio's persona's and looks are both too soft to play hard edge characters. Wahlberg and Sheen were so absent of realism, they compromised important plot dialog. Baldwin's attempt to add some comic flare came across as more buffoonery then wit. Even Nicholson's part was more cartoon then character. (Quintisential Jack)! Costello should have been cast by a hungry unknown, (from Boston). What makes this very pretentious movie really bad, are the "holes". This movie leaked like a sieve. Allow me to address a few: 1) The premise alone. You have a large police department investigating a large crime family, yet only three members, (one of which is not even out of the academy), will alone without the resources of the department infiltrate an organized mob presumably using a mole. 2) If costigan is suppose to have been dismissed from the force, then why is he being seen by a civil service police psychiatrist. 3) If costigan was pulled out of the academy specifically for the benefit of his anonymity, then why does everyone he meets, know him and his family. 4) Does the department acknowledge the existence of costigan or not? His entire identity can not be conveniently eliminated from all record and then later resurface for a meritorious award. 5) If Costello was an F.B.I. informant, were the hell were the F.B.I., and better yet, what bigger fish would the F.B.I. want, then Costello himself. 6) Speakng of other agencies, were the hell were the Boston police during all these inner city homicides going on inside their jurisdiction. The ending alone was most pathetic due to the fact there was no feasible conclusion possible based on the story's lack of continuity. I don't mind the enigmatic challenge of a smart and sophisticated screenplay, but please don't mollify me with vapid subplots. Too much budget, and not enough substance. Unfortunately, I seem to find the latter in only foreign or independent films. Hollywood needs to to produce more movies that don't just rely on its marquee. Next time the director calls, "That's a wrap", there should be no loose ends..
10.0~Deserving of every accolade it received. The rebirth of gangster film. The_Amazing_Spy_Rises Sign in Permalink I'm not going to pull any punches here. 'The Departed' is the definition of a crime/thriller. Any fan of Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and gangster films will absolutely love 'The Departed', which deserves to go down as one of the best films of the last 25 years, if not of all time. It is near perfect in every aspect of film making, and is a non-stop, heart pounding, gripping, and brilliant thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Gang lord Frank Costello (3-Time Oscar Winner Jack Nicholson) is practically the most feared man in all of Boston. For years, he has controlled the streets with unparalleled authority. But now, that could change. The police has assigned a young man from another gang family turned police officer, Billy Costigan (3-Time Oscar Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio), to infiltrate Costello's system with hopes of bringing him down once and for all. Meanwhile, Costello has assigned his most loyal and trusted friend, Colin Sullivan (Oscar Winner Matt Damon), to be a mole within the Massachusetts State Police Department. When both sides discover that they have a mole in their midsts, it's war between the police and Costello. The real standouts of the film are DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson, director Martin Scorsese, and writer William Monahan. The cast is phenomenal, probably the best ensemble acting this year. DiCaprio gives the second best performance of his career (only to Blood Diamond, an Oscar nominated performance), a role which really is an actor's role. There are so many emotions involved with the character of Billy Costigan, and DiCaprio expresses them naturally. The feelings of fear, hate, depression, and indecision are displayed naturally and perfectly. It would have been very easy to nominate him for 2 Oscars in 2007, but they don't allow that. Mark Wahlberg gives the best performance in the whole film as the menacing cop Dignam. He steals the show in every scene he's in with his intensity and no holding back approach in this Oscar nominated performance. He upstages just about every other actor in this film, and looking at DiCaprio and Nicholson, that's extremely impressive. Jack Nicholson is the villain of the film, and he is just plain scary. There are moments when you will jump in fear of him, and you won't laugh at his jokes (not because they're not funny, but because you're scared to laugh at him). DiCaprio and Nicholson feed extremely well off of each other. DiCaprio has a thing for working well with other great actors (see Johnny Depp, Daniel Day Lewis, Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou, and Tom Hanks). The other stars, while they are great, are not at the level of Wahlberg, DiCaprio, and Nicholson. It's not really his fault, but Matt Damon just doesn't seem right with a Boston accent. He does capture the essence of his character very well. Colin Sullivan is a character you may not understand at first, but as the film progresses, you'll know his motives and understand his actions. Well done by Mr. Damon. Vera Farmiga is proving to be one of the next generation up and comers with her second golden performance of the year (Running Scared was the other). Her ability to display powerful emotions such as anger and sadness pave the way for her to eventually become a leading lady in the caliber of Hilary Swank or Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as the conflicted and truly good Madolyn is one of the best of the year, and it's a shame she's been overlooked so much in the awards field. It must be because her character has the least connection to the main story, while she is strongly connected to Damon and DiCaprio's characters. Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone give great performances, both being in small supporting roles. Winstone in particular stood out to me. In the smallest supporting role is Anthony Anderson, an actor generally known for comedy. With Hustle & Flow, and now The Departed, Anderson is proving that he is one of the more versatile performers in the business with a good and likable performance. Writer William Monahan pens an excellent script adapted from the Asian thriller 'Infernal Affairs'. Monahan does not allow the story to slow down at all, making it feel much shorter than the 2 and a half hours it runs. Monahan develops every character extremely well, and that is the strong point, because there really aren't that many twists, and no huge one either. Monahan won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar because of the excellent characters he created. Legendary director Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film because his film-making here, and all the time, is simply amazing. From the cinematography, to the sets and backgrounds he created, to the direction of a trio of phenomenal leading performances and a couple great supporting performances, Scorsese is at the top of his game in 'The Departed'. It's his best in a long time, possibly his best film. It's extremely hard to find fault with 'The Departed', except that I wish Mark Wahlberg had more screen time...but that was just because he was so damn good. 'The Departed' is one of the best films of the last 25 years, and should not be missed by any true fan of the movie industry. Remember, it won Best Picture of 2006, which it rightfully deserved. I absolutely loved this film, and recommend it to everyone age 16 and up, due to the brutal violence, strong language, and sexually explicit dialog. The 'f' word is spoken over 200 times, if you need an idea of how severe it is. 10/10 --spy
3.0~The Departed is a remake, original much better egodraconis Sign in Permalink As many of you well know, "The Departed" is a remake of a 2002 film from Hong Kong called "Mou gaan dou" / "Internal Affairs". I have to say that I enjoyed the original movie much better than this remake. Many of the original classic lines from the film did make it to this Hollywood knock-off such as, cutting up Leonardo DiCaprio and feeding him to the poor. The method of passing messages involving the use of Morse code in the original far surpasses the method of using a cell phone text message as well. If you really did enjoy "The Departed," then I highly suggest renting or purchasing the original. If you enjoyed the original, then I would not disappointed yourself by watching this remake.
8.0~Suspenseful, superbly acted Micthocar Sign in Permalink The Departed is story about a man from the mob who's infiltrated the police and a man from the police who's infiltrated the mob, adapted from the 2002 film Infernal Affairs. Let me just say the film was incredibly well directed, with slight quirks in the cinematography and every actor influenced by Scorsese to shine within their roles. The overall film is well rounded, with realistic performances and a standout setting. There's not weak link in the line-up; every actor has been cast perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon each play the lead roles excellently, managing to sustain deep and original characters throughout. Jack Nicholson, with his rugged, aged looks and unique quirks allow his role as the domineering mob boss to stand out and provide a lasting impression. One scene in which he's trying to find a rat in his organisation provided a platform for him to subtly, yet menacingly imply accusations upon his crew. Mark Wahlberg (who received and Oscar nomination) played the potty-mouthed straight up cop to a tee and Martin Sheen played the understanding, experienced detective greatly, managing to keep a cool performance, only slightly changing when faced with death. The film provides deep suspenseful elements and a fast paced, clever plot. Moments of excitement are juxtaposed by meaningful scenes of heartbreak and character development. If you want to see an intelligent, memorable thriller, watch The Departed.
9.0~Excellent Boston based story. kennprop Sign in Permalink Loosely based on the Whitey Bulger? story this is a Boston based epic. The Godfather was a NY story and of course on a bigger scale. Boston is a smaller place and its old Irish ethnic neighborhood of South Boston is the setting for this gem. The statehouse sits shining on its hill and the state govt. is riddled with corruption. Whitey Bulger survived and flourished for years as a gang head and was an FBI snitch. He worked with a FBI agent who was born in his home neighborhood. This agent eventually was convicted on corruption charges and went to prison. Whitey mostly gave info about th local Mafia and several convictions came from this. The Mafia ran Boston from Providence RI and its "offices" were located on Federal Hill. Bulgers brother was the Speaker of the Mass. State House and later the head of the University of Mass. !!! Whitey was a fugitive for many years, was caught and convicted only to be murdered in prison. Probably for being a rat. This movie has several stories going at once. Undercover police, Corrupt police, honest police, gangsters both Irish and Italian. Local color and Catholic religion role in the area. You have a heavy duty cast here with several important character roles by Sheen,Baldwin, Wahlberg and others. Dicaprio is huge in this and Nicholson is excellent. They dominate the screen. Matt Damon is very bean town but is just not in the same class. For me he lacks something in his roles. He is a major star but of a lesser magnitude of presence. I found the music in this to be overdone and somewhat distracting. My wife felt it was a very good, intense,tension filled movie. She thought the ending was weak, unlikable, not up to par??? At least the corrupt ones got what was coming to them and that does not always happen in reality.
1.0~A pale remake of an Asian classic andrej-zupanic Sign in Permalink The Departed, the winner of the academy award for best motion picture, is just another remake based on a Chinese original. Critics called it one of the best movies of the year 2006, but in my opinion it is a disgrace to the Chinese original, called The Infernal Affairs. And it is also Scorsese's worst film ever. Even Gangs of New York were more original than this film. Let me explain why I didn't like this film. First, the characters are empty. There is no emotion and the characters don't develop throughout the film. They are just like chess figures on a board. If I go on, this is two and a half hour long remake of a trilogy of at least six hours in length, so many important things were left out, so the story is full of holes that really need to be patched. As it is typical for Hollywood the body-count must always be bigger. Many characters just die for no reason at all. It seems like Scorsese thinks that if he delivers us a messy massacre the film will be a success. Just return to your basics Scorsese. Your older films are much better than your recent crap that you call a movie. Another big mistake is that Nicholson's character is more developed than the characters of Damon and DiCaprio, maybe because Nicholson really did a good job and acted as a professional. But this is the only bright point of the film. And this is the reason for my two stars, because Nicholson is the only one who keeps this movie above one star. A disaster in every way and a very unfair decision of the Academy to claim this movie as the best motion picture, especially to the Infernal Affairs, which deserves an Oscar for the best motion picture more than this poor interpretation.
1.0~whack fusi0n Sign in Permalink for reasons that many others have pointed out before me, this movie was horrible. i could only apologize to my girlfriend for making her watch it with me, because i was so exited about it after watching infernal affairs. firstly, on the film on its own, its horrible. gratuitous, unclassy, and just plain bad. i was bored throughout the first 1/3 of the movie. though DiCaprio did a decent job, i do not think any other character was played very well. Nicholson does a poor job portraying a mob boss, and comes off more of a schizophrenic crack junkie than the leader of an organized crime syndicate. Alec Baldwin's character was neither funny, nor appropriate for the movie, and i believe mark walbergs character is completely unnecessary except to come back and kill Matt Damon in the end, which i think is a poor change to the story line. the ending was also excessive. and except the the change in storyline, that was looking at the movie without comparing it to IA. IA is just executed much better, with more class, and more intelligently. watch it, instead of this Hollywood trash. this movie definitely has scorsese's mark, but it does not fit the theme and tone of the movie and the story. watch IA. ditch the departed.
10.0~Best Film of the Year scheidlerbarry Sign in Permalink Wow! Best Film this year. Scorsese has matched a terrific cast and a great story and pieced together a masterpiece. In the deluge of mush touring American theaters in 2006 appeared this diamond. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are outstanding in the leading roles. The best performance of their careers. Jack Nicholson should win the Oscar for his role as an Irish godfather. The supporting cast of Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Mark Wahlberg were excellent. Vera Farmiga is terrific as a psychiatrist torn between the "nice guy" and the "bad boy". Be warned, like any Scorsese film, violence is explicit and disturbing.
8.0~Boston, Massachusetts macfarlaneseth Sign in Permalink Set in Boston, Massachusetts, the story follows two main perspective moles operating undercover. One for the police and the other for the Mafia.
8.0~Noteworthy Cast! **some spoilers** karenlynn1 Sign in Permalink This film was rather impressive. Plenty of action, intriguing characters, and brilliant acting from an all-star cast. I feel that the violence could have been toned down a bit-the swearing and racial epithets could have been kept to a minimum. Other than that it was brilliant. Scorcese outdoes himself with this mob vs. cops drama that makes us keep wondering whoif anyone at allis one of the "good guys". Jack Nicholson delivers a punch with his over-the-top performance as Irish mob boss Costello. He's a self-indulgent, arrogant, domineering control freak who rules his neighborhood with an iron fist. It even seems as if Costello has the Boston State Police Departmentever on his trailunder his thumb. This is mostly thanks to a Detective named Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who began working for Costello when he was a young kid, and is forever indebted to Costello. Working both sides of the coin, in secrecy, Sullivan helps to keep Costello one step ahead of the "Staties" that are hot on his trail. The Staties have a mole of their own. Young renegade officer Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent in to infiltrate Costello's gang, under orders from his superiors (Baldwin, Sheen, & Walberg respectively). With some felons in Costigan's family tree, and the rumor that Costigan was thrown out of the academy, he receives acceptance from Costello's men. But soon he meets the man himself, and his loyalty is tested by undergoing a small yet painful ritual. The story heats up, with more action, a lot of shooting, and a rather confusing love triangle involving a young psychiatrist who is forced to face too many truths all at once. Nicholson's portrayal becomes increasingly more manicalmost resembling his performance in The Shiningas his organization begins to unravel and turn on each other in search of the "rat." However, many scenes were stolen by Mark Wahlberg as Dingam. The plot gets confusing at times, and the ending will seem like a cop out (no pun intended), but it's the sort of thing that if you look at the events that led up to itit seems to have followed a logical conclusion. Who really is a rat? And who real are the good guys? Very well-acted, and intriguing picture. I give this an 8/10.
10.0~Scorsese is back to the genre that he created ben-badger Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese has to be the best directer out there. He has not made a proper crime film since Casino. The Departed is a classic crime thriller on the streets of Boston thats actually a retelling of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. The Departed is about American/Irish gangster Frank Costello(Jack Nicholson) who has placed Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) in the state Police. However the police are a head of Costello and has placed rookie cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo Dicaprio)as a undercover cop in the mafia. All through the film you are gripped and thrilled by Scorseses classic use of ultra violence. Now the ending of this film is blood soaked with an excellent lift shooting and has enough gore to have gore hounds licking their lips.
3.0~Watch the original before this one termita01 Sign in Permalink I don't understand how can it have such great marks when the original version is way better. It's pretty much the same as the original except for one particular thing that was one of the best parts of the original film. And the thing that really pisses me off is that it was given the Oscar for the best adaptation... it was adapted from another film (tell me how difficult it can be) and the good parts are all the same. It may be true that the actors did it very well and that the plot is excellent, but the original actors are as good as these ones and the original plot is even better so I highly recommend to watch the original one first (Infernal Affairs). You won't regret it.
7.0~Scorcese Imitating Scorcese? clintfive-1 Sign in Permalink When I put the fact that Scorcese directed this flick against the finished product, I was left scratching my head. Scorcese has always had the goods where gangster films are concerned. But, I have to say I'm now inclined to think that there WAS a time when you could go to see a Scorcese movie and know you were getting first class. You never had to worry. THE DEPARTED may have killed that notion...at least for the time being. I went straight out and bought the double disc edition with the movie script booklet purely based in the fact that Scorcese directed it. (Note: in FIRST run of the DVD in Australia, released February 14 2007, the second disc's special features don't match those advertised on the box cover - there are fewer on the disc itself than printed on the back. This is a print error that Warner Brothers have since acknowledged and will be rectified in future prints.) It is not a bad film by any stretch; it's still very entertaining, however, the actors didn't quite reach the level of authenticity I would have expected - especially since the cast is a bevy of Hollywood's A-List male actors. Jack Nicholson is a brilliant performer - he always brings an intensity to any role he plays. And he did this here, occasionally throwing in that jagged edge of insanity he is famous for. However, I just couldn't believe him as a mob leader specifically. Matt Damon - always been a favourite of mine. But what's going on, mate? Here we see him attempting to achieve the persona of a sly, corrupt cop in the way he THOUGHT it should be played, rather than actually becoming the role. In a number of his roles, he has come across as somewhat conscious of how he is delivering the character, and this was no exception. For me he didn't quite fit the role. Mark Wahlberg's sharp mouthed, a-hole cop was almost unnecessary. I couldn't piece him into the picture; the film could have easily survived without this role, regardless of the fact that he was required to round out the plot in the final scene. But, his angle on character delivery was too forced and exaggerated, and in placing him into the full context of the story, his existence was more a hindrance than a help. The only really solid performance here was Leonardo DiCaprio. And this is something I never thought I'd admit to. I have never been a fan. However, in this film, he has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a main player. Overall, THE DEPARTED didn't quite showcase the legendary capabilities of Scorcese as a director. And for this reason, the final product looks more like a film made by a lesser known director trying to IMITATE Scorcese's style, but doesn't fully achieve the equivalent. Thus, we don't see the full potential of what we know to be a brilliant cast. The flow of the movie is left somewhat disjointed and scattered, making it difficult for the audience to fully submit to the plot and the experience. And this is a pity since you really need to pay attention to the plot to catch the wave and stay with it. However, it is entertaining. Most people will probably enjoy it - if not for the juiciness of a violent gangster flick then certainly for the cast. Still very worth the watch if you love Scorcese.
10.0~Best Picture of 2006 Puckman751 Sign in Permalink Matin Scorsese does it again in The Departed. Like his previous hits (Goodfellas and Casino), he takes movie making to the next level and when you don't think it could go any higher, he takes you there. The Departed is an intriguing story that revolves around Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello, an Irish mafia boss. He befriends Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan, who eventually becomes a Massachusets State Police officer. Frank uses Colin to make sure his deals run smooth. On the other side of the law, Leo DiCaprio's character, Billy Costigan, goes undercover for the State Police and takes orders from Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. 2+ hours of great film making ensues. I previously had thought that V For Vendetta would be a front runner for Best Picture but after seeing this film, there's no way I can see it win. Scorsese deserves a Best Director and Best Picture award while everyone else in the film, especially Leo DiCaprio, deserve huge amounts of attention for their acting. The story is fresh, intriguing and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing. Finally, when you think you have it all figured out, you realize just how wrong you are. This film should and will go down in history.
4.0~It is a record of the f-word abuse gjdenooij Sign in Permalink OK not really a record, but it looks at a good attempt. Words cannot describe this movie, I absolutely hated it. first of all because it is so vulgar, understand me well, I do not care if you use the F word or similar, like: "what the F-word do you think you are doing" or "die F-word die". But in every sentence it becomes unrealistic and very irritating. Lets say a conversation like: Hey extended F-word What the F-word do you think you are F-word doing? Shut the F-word up Cs I will F-word do What I F-word Like. Let's say in anger or fear you use terms of abuse, this adds to the realism of a movie, if you use them in every sentence you are just looking for an excuse to use them. Get My point? If you do not care or even like this in a movie, fare enough I suggest you watch it you will have the time of you're life. But in reality no one communicates with each other in this way certainly not police officers, Not that I ever have been to the US, but in Europe this is certainly not the case. I can only hope they respect each other as much in the US. But besides these vulgarities the movie has many shortcomings in my book. In the first hour the storyline was swift, that is in a bad way. At one time you are at the this point and suddenly somewhere else and then again somewhere else. The scenes do not connect well. There is a lack of storyline in the beginning which makes it strange to watch, as if you are watching different movies of 2 minutes. My guess is the movie was too long and was edited in a bad way too make it shorter. Besides 2 actors look too much alike, some people might have trouble keeping them apart in the beginning. The movie however does become a little better in the end, too late to save this movie, but still better than nothing. I actually started to feel some tension, but them came the many twists at the end, as if they wanted it to end in a certain way, I do not want to spoil it for you so I will not tell the ending, but you will know what I am talking about when you have seen the movie. All in all a bad movie which could have been very good if the director was not looking to use the F-word so much and the storyline connected a lot better than it did.
3.0~I couldn't believe this film won best picture... imdb-18156 Sign in Permalink I am not a real film buff, and neither is my wife. I had heard that this film was supposed to be good, and rented it. Despite the excellent cast and good production values, I couldn't believe how labored the script was, and how much overacting was taking place (much of it by Nicholson). When we finished watching the movie, I remarked to my wife that I must have gotten the film confused with some other. I went to IMDb to see what rating it had gotten -- I figured maybe a 6.7 or something. To my disbelief, it lands in the top 100, and won the best picture Oscar! I went back to tell my wife that it had won the best picture, and she thought I was joking. Then her reaction was that someone had hacked my computer. As far as the comments here, I would have had to think that there was a large astroturf component. But with the film winning best picture, I guess I am just seeing one of those occasional mass delusions that happens in the world. But what I *really* can't believe is that it won best script. Un. Be. Lievable. This script was so bad, and so unconvincing, that after I told my wife that it had won best picture and director, I remarked that for sure it couldn't have won best scriptwriting. But it did. I simply don't understand what people see in this film. The plot is sophomoric. The involvement of Costello in routine pickups and deliveries, and the immediate trust and access to the boss given Costigan, is so implausible that I find it difficult to believe anyone can take this film seriously. Is it supposed to be camp or something?
10.0~Worth seeing twice reidster21 Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie. A lot. Frequently when a movie with this much talent is put together, it seems like a lot of it gets drowned out by some other element of cinematography, but here, the film making process actually did what it was supposed to do--it acted as a supporting mechanism for the brilliant actors. I have to admit that the casting was superb. Leonardo did a great job... he really came through in the clutch with one of the most difficult acting jobs he could have been assigned. Likewise, Nicholson was AMAZING. He was the absolute perfect man for the role and he will leave you wanting to like him, but the whole time knowing he is the bad guy. Damon again does what he can with his rather bland personality, which happens to be perfect for this role... he was the right casting choice and fits into the movie perfectly. The two big surprise actors in this movie are Wahlberg and Baldwin. Both have minor roles, but are hilarious. Wahlberg especially. He provides the necessary comedic relief to make this movie feel like a dark comedy at some points rather than a drama. Also the Boston element really comes forth within this movie... there is a heavy emphasis on the Irishness of the town not seen since Boondock Saints. The character development that we see is really a major plus to this movie. Watching the characters change and suspicions arise does just as much for this movie as the action does. The reason that I didn't give it a ten is because the ending leaves a few questions that give the viewer a solid amount of confusion, and in a movie like this I feel like it would be best to answer those questions. However the ending is great--its shocking and brilliant and leaves the viewer with a deep satisfaction that most movies these days do not. This is the epitome of a good film, don't let this one pass you by.
10.0~A great film on every level alienlanguage Sign in Permalink I saw this movie today with very high expectations. While I loved "The Aviator," and moderately enjoyed "The Gangs of New York," I was very excited to see Scorsesee doing what he does best; street-grit mobster movies. Of course, he did not invent the genre, but with this movie he proves that he has mastered it. Many others have described the plot, so I will not, only in saying that the plot is rather intricate, but it proves to be very rewarding and entertaining if you stay focused and glued to the screen, which is not hard when you're dealing with a top-notch cast that clearly enjoys the material. Leonardo DiCaprio proves that his brilliant performance in "The Aviator" was no fluke, as he shows a new level of depth in this role. Matt Damon is superb, but Jack Nicholson steals the show. His performance is in turns creepy, hilarious and realistically disturbing. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg deliver fantastic supporting performances as well. Am I crazy in saying that Alec Baldwin is turning into one of my all-time favorite actors? His supporting roles in recent years have been simply incredible. Another aspect of this movie that I enjoyed was the humor. The dialogue was great, and some lines were just plain hilarious, funnier then most comedies. Go see this movie. Movies this amazing are becoming few and far between.
8.0~Another Blockbuster Hit seeissnookie Sign in Permalink I thought this movie was great. It had action and suspense and your were kept guessing throughout the entire film. You never expected what happened next. The chemistry on set was excellent and Jack Nicholson gave an outstanding performance as always, think of when he did the Shining, you loved and hated him. The movie also had great one liners. You will be on the edge of your seat wanting more. Marc Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio were also excellent. Leo gave an other performance worthy of his in the Titantic and Gangs of New York. The only problem I had with the movie is I thought it was a little long. Definitely A Must See!!!!!!!
10.0~Scorsese is GreaT. shiv_mehta1988 Sign in Permalink The movie is awesome. Great Movie. First credit goes to Felix Chong and Siu Fai Mak for writing an excellent screenplay. This is a complicated story to tell on screen. I don't think anyone can beat Martin Scorsese in Directing after seeing this movie. He deserves an Oscar for best director for this movie hands down. Cinematography was superb. Acting performances were great. Scorsese's favorite Leo DiCaprio displayed another acting masterpiece. Matt Damon and Mark Whalberg too. Although I thought that Jack Nicholson was not in his best especially in the scene where he suspects Leo while sitting in the restaurant. Although Leo and Martin have done tremendous work in the past, they've been nominated too for Oscars but the time has come that both artistes get their well deserved Oscars for this movie.
8.0~Good action and drama movie beards01 Sign in Permalink The movie The Departed focuses around the police trying to convict a well-known gangster in Boston. With corrupt police and being a very powerful gangster this becomes a large struggle for the police departments. The quality of the actors is magnificent in this film; it features Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy, Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello (gangster), Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan, Mark Wahlberg as Dignam and Martin Sheen as Queenan. In this movie Billy graduates from the police academy and is picked to work undercover as one of Frank's henchmen. Earning Frank's trust is the first task for Billy to accomplish. Billy does this basically becoming a thug, beating up people who own money to Frank. Billy reports directly to Queenan and Dignam on his findings of the illegal activities that are being done. Unknown to Billy, Frank has several police officers on his payroll including Colin who Frank helped as a child by giving him groceries for his family and promising to give him a job if he ever needed to make extra money. Billy being under tremendous stress uses drugs to help him get the undercover assignment and is required to seek the help of a female counselor Madolyn played by (Vera Farmiga) who turns out to be the girlfriend of Colin. Billy becomes sexually involved with Madolyn. Madolyn is also the source in which Billy gets his drugs. Billy starts to suspect that Frank has informants in the police department making it hard for him to trust anyone. He is constantly torn between doing the undercover work, wanting to have a regular life and his growing feeling for Madolyn. Billy gets to the point that he is almost paranoid. The action in this film usually revolves around violence. The beatings and killings that take place really do a good job of demonstrating a lot of drama. The lighting plays a big part of the film; much of the filming is inside dark rooms or bars. This helps set the tone of the activities being performed. The film angles in which some of the shooting and fight scenes are shown to enhance the action that is being portrayed. This film has a lot of the same theme as the gangster movie Goodfellas, only in a different time frame and location. The ending of this movie takes many by surprise just because it is unexpected of how all the events takes place. I will not indulge on the ending leaving that to the audiences who have not seen this movie yet. It is definitely worth seeing. The actors do an excellent job portraying their characters.
8.0~incredible tyranid_slayer Sign in Permalink I have just borrowed the departed from a friends since i missed it in the cinema. My mum really wanted to see this as well so we both watched it. It was definitely worth all the hype. This movie was absolutely fantastic and brutal. My mum pretty much had a huge gasp at almost every point in the film. The gasp-o-meter: I am going to put certain events from the film into how much my mum gasped at it. I will try not to give too much info out but here we go. When a certain character falls from a roof gasp rating 5 When a key character dies at the end gasp rating 8 When someones broken arm is smacked against a table gasp rating 7 When an extra character gets stabbed in the face with a coat hanger gasp rating 4 I might have passed off the departed as way too violent but it is intelligent which i can't say about many other movies out today. The departed is worth all the awards all the praise and all the hype definitely worth all your time.
6.0~An American Hack of Mou Gan Dou (Infernal Affairs) and its a winner of 4 Oscars. wynonasbigbrownbeaver Sign in Permalink I shouldn't discredit this movie too much, I still think The Departed is still a good movie. I recently watched Mou Gan Dou prior to this and it still fresh in my memory. I predicted how it was going to end and who was going to die. Shame on us Americans for stealing other imported ideas, like Ringu, Rec, La Femme Nikita, Let the Right One In, and now this. I am sure the originators in China are getting credit of crafting such an incredible story line and the producers and the writers of The Departed have done their best to warp the script and implement new intriguing characters the best way possible. But everything else is an obvious carbon copy of Mou Gan Dou. It was well acted, produced and directed. I can't possibly give it a higher score because I saw the derivative of this movie first. If I saw this movie first, I would have liked it more and I probably wouldn't have noticed the Chinese Predecessor. Overall, I will still recommend it. The entire cast is enjoyable to watch even though it gets pretty shallow in the end, just like the original.
7.0~For 3/4ths of the movie a Good Film, and then, the ending!? justmy2cents Sign in Permalink Several friends and I have been discussing the cheesy ending of this film and it's not just the elevator shoot 'em up. About that silly rat on the balcony railing! Hello?????? Does NO ONE feel that is the most over-the-top moment in a film? Was this in the Hong Kong version everyone's talking about? I can't believe no one close to Martin Scorsese didn't point out to him that terrible visual. Okay! OKAY, we got it, he was a rat! We got it! What, you needed to make us laugh at the end on top of the sloppy ending?? Totally silly, cheesy moment on film. A luxury apartment in a high rise, obviously high up and suddenly there, on the balcony railing, a lone rat balancing precariously on the railing with the capitol dome in the background. The only thing that could have been more ridiculous is if they'd had the rat take a swan dive off the balcony! This movie was so good, so compelling up until the last 4th of the film. Even if it was a remake, considering the director could have remade the film in his own vision, why didn't he improve on that ending? Martin, what happened!!??? Definitely not his best film.
1.0~A Heavily MIsguided MIssile by a fading master of the Mob Movie barev-85094 Sign in Permalink THE DEPARTED, Scorcese 2006 Viewed at the first Rome Film Festival, October, 2006. A Misguided Missile by a fading maestro of the Mob Movie and A bloated regression into crass commercialism. An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston. NOTA Bene: The Departed is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong actioner, "Internal Affairs" ~ This one shoulda stayed in China. Today's email from colleague and editor Tom Dirlis, in Prague; "Ahoy, Alex: Sounds like you're having a helluva time over there — la dolce vita and all that! Did you see the new Scorsese flick? How was the press conference? Haven't been too impressed with him lately and Di Caprio can kiss my butt, but Marty did make a few great ones. Always waiting for the comeback. Tom". ————— REPLY : Ahoy, Tomasso — Yep, Life is pretty sweet here in Rome at the moment, and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese! I was just getting ready to knock out the usual cagey, journalistically correct (JC) review of "The Departed" but with you I don't have to hedge my bets and can tell it like it is — the Hole Truth, and nothing but The Truth So, for openers; The bottom line is, NO –this is NOT the great comeback for Scorcese — in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was "Aviator", which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horse manure. To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were SERIOUSLY miscast — The best role in the whole film is MARK WAHLBERG, who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of the phony stars who get to walk away with all the credit (as if there was anything creditable to speak of) while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through. For one thing, too much rapid artsy intercutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda "stayed in bed", which is too say, in Hong Kong, where it started out, and where it belongs. An exercise in bloated glossy bullshit all around. According to Scorcese in the following Press Con, this was an exercise in "experimentation". Well, maybe that was the problem — It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad –the police psychiatrist, played by an unknown (and unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For Christ Sake — Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family — in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. — "The Departed" sucks heavily. Glad you asked. Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance (paid-off?) press hype to the effect that Marty is "back in stride doing his gangster stuff", I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will flop in America, but somebody watching the parade just has to come out and say it –when the king ain't wearing a single goddamn stitch! As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself as the Devil in "The Witches of Salem", or play an old creep on constant viagra overdose. To my mind, he's had an interesting career, but it's time for him to stay in bed –for good! Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle -- (A moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it) -- his face and name still sell tickets at the B.O. Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. As for Leonardo — well, to see the way he beats the living govno out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic, with the greatest of ease, you'd have to think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly. This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in "Red River". Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best — a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it — and just remember: Never trust a film critic! — not even Yours Truly. Ps: Marty did get his long overdue Oscar in 2007, providing him with official entry to the exclusive Spielberg-Coppola Club -- which only goes to show that the Oscars are more about anointing selected breadwinners than recognizing art.
7.0~good movie spoiled by unexplained/confusing events owen9825 Sign in Permalink It was intriguing to see the gang and the cops predicting each other's moves, except this play of deception suddenly stopped making sense towards the end of the film. It shouldn't have been too hard for the cops to work out that when Capt. Queenan was killed, the mole was either Colin or one of the officers following Queenan that day, yet nobody mentions this. When Colin orders the followers not to pursue the van, it makes it even more evident that he's the mole. During the meeting with the Chinese, how do the FBI tapping everyone's phones not spring Colin? Before Frank's downfall, why does Billy try to convince Frank that he's about to be sprung? Once the psychiatrist discovers that Colin is a spy for Frank, why is she left alive? Instead of running away and master-minding a failed plot, why didn't Billy run straight to a high-ranking cop and reveal Colin as soon as he noticed the envelope? How did the FBI mole know about Colin and why would he protect him? How did Dignam find out about Colin? The police wouldn't have told him or they would've arrested him themselves. Madolyn could have only told him if Billy had given her Dignam's contact information, but he was never around the police computers to check and any contact information relevant to Dignam's former position would have likely become invalid as soon as he quit (I assume he wouldn't have used his personal number to contact Billy)? Besides, if he had Dignam's contact information, why was there any need to leave the evidence with Madolyn? If Billy knew Dignam's contact information, he would never have had to arrange the risky meeting with Colin, as he could've relied on Dignam to back him up in the case that Colin had erased Billy's file. Why did that come as a surprise to Billy anyway? Shouldn't it have been obvious? Considering that Billy wasn't aware of his file being erased, what was the point of running away then later arranging the meeting anyway? His only request in the extortion of Colin was to get his identity back, which he could've got easily if he just stuck around at the police station instead of running away. The fact that he could arrest Colin at the meeting left him in the same situation as if he had stayed in the police station, as he would still need to explain the story to the rest of the police. Why does nobody spot Colin during the presumed investigation of the Chinese cook's murder/assault? Even if they didn't know that Colin was a detective, surely they should've spotted Colin in the footage then done a search for him? Forensics experts might've seen problems with Colin's explanation for Billy's murder and why any of them were there in the first place, but that's not a big deal compared to the other problems in the movie.
10.0~Fantastic Thriller/Crime movie baz_trinity Sign in Permalink Wow! Martin Scorsese is a genius. What an accomplishment, completely deserved of the various awards it was given and easily a future classic. The movie tells the story of Frank Costello (Played by the magnificent award-worthy Jack Nicholson), a leader of the Irish Mafia, to which he places various people into the Masachusetts Police Academy, in order to gain high roles in authority. However, when Billy Costigan (Played by a surprisingly on-fire Dicaprio) goes undercover for the MPA, in order to infiltrate the Irish Mafia, both begin to smell a rat in each others organizations and things get tense and let it be said, violent. Superbly done, intelligent, cleverly-crafted dialog and a genuinely simple story with underlying complexities makes The Departed an intense, intriguing thriller, coupled with a fantastic cast makes this a personal favorite and no doubt the feeling is mutual amongst many others. Simply a must see.
4.0~Inexplicably terrible with amazing acting. njmoorhe Sign in Permalink Perhaps then worst Oscar winning film I've ever seen. How a movie could be so disappointing with such amazing acting is beyond me. There is little or no character development and several inexplicable plot choices. Without giving the film away, several things happened that made no sense other than (as my film-making father would say) "the director said so." I'm not sure that the failures of this film can be attributed to any of the executors of the film (director, actors, cameramen) since all of them seemed to execute the filming to near perfection. Rather, the failure is either with a shoddy script, poor editing choices (fault depends on the amount of control the director had), or a combination of the two. A viewer could easily find this to be one of the better films they have watched recently, or one of the worst, depending on several factors (including whether they are seeking a well developed). Look for the best, but prepare to be disappointed and perhaps confused.
9.0~Highly recommended hellonoto Sign in Permalink To much are mobsters romanticized, the mob is full of the most depraved and horrible people on the earth and Scorsese certainly showed that in the Departed. I kept hearing about this movie before I seen it, about how good it was, and I certainly was not disappointed. It has a complex storyline and even more complex characters, and are brought together in a great way. The acting is fantastic, every actor in the movie gave the performance of their career. I loved this movie and it is a rare movie that is full of suspense, actions, and stills has a deep impact on the emotional level. This is the only must see movie in the last 2 years, and it is best Scorsese has ever done.
9.0~Scorsese did it again ! I_Was_Incepted Sign in Permalink I just came home from the cinema and i watched " The departed " i knew that Scorsese did a splendid job with all his maffia movies , but this one is the best he ever did ! Dicaprio is wel cast in this picture , so is Matt Damon and last but not least Jack Nicholson with the funny , sick crime - boss . The storyline is good but you'll have to be a very attendfull viewer because every second of the film is important , Dicaprio's acting performance is top of the charts , it's his best picture since "Gangs of New York". Not the forget the producer Brad Pitt. Jens Naeyaert
8.0~Good, but Overrated PoisonKeyblade Sign in Permalink From what I had heard, The Departed was supposed to be an amazing flick, but it really ended up being just a little above average. I was one of the big supporters of the film at the beginning. I had people all around saying, "That looks so bad," but I knew it looked like a great movie. How can you possibly go wrong with a cast consisting of Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nickolson, and Mark Wahlberg? First off, the performances were probably what made this movie. If not for the sensational acting, The Departed just would not be worth watching. Leonardo was great as the lead, and Jack Nickolson was classic as the crime boss. Matt Damon was good, but he didn't really play that big of a part until the very end. However, the performance that really stood out here was that of Mark Wahlberg. He REALLY proved he can act here with an incredibly memorable character. The plot felt like something new, and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. However, I had many issues with the film. For one, the ending made me want to throw up. One of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen! Secondly, there were just too many plot elements that were left wide open and many things that were never given any explanation whatsoever. The Departed was good, but if you want to see an amazing crime movie, stick with Alpha Dog. Alpha Dog is underrated, so you won't really know what to expect.
8.0~A riveting tale of deception, violence and organized crime brettchatz-1 Sign in Permalink Film Review: The Departed Cast: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon; Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen Director: Martin Scorsese Screen legend and celebrated actor, Jack Nicholson lands a knockout performance as Boston's most feared crime boss in The Departed. It's a tale of murder, drug-trafficking, duplicity and ruthless violence. DiCaprio sheds his pretty-boy image and does justice to his acting pedigree by delivering a powerful performance as an undercover cop working for a mob outfit. Matt Damon plays the snitch inside the Police Department, feeding vital information to Nicholson's character. It's as much a story of betrayal as it is a high-octane thriller. Neither cop knows the other is working for the enemy. It's this deadly web of deceit that ultimately forces Nicholson towards increasingly violent behaviour. If nail biting suspense and gritty action is what you seek, The Departed is the summer blockbuster film to see!
10.0~A Brilliant Film yh_ihy Sign in Permalink If i was to define this masterpiece in one sentence it would be: Martin Scorsese's crowning achievement. This film is absolutely stunning, this movie is a rare case of a movie remake that surpasses its original in most ways. The acting is stunning, performances from high profile actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio,Matt Damon and the legendary actor Jack Nicholson are just a part of what makes this film a must see. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is his best, and perhaps Jack Nicholson's best film since the shining or even one flew over the cuckoos nest. If Martin Scorsese is the Beatles of mob movies The departed is his Sgt. Pepper. Although an amazing film, the departed can be difficult to follow and at one point is victim to choppy editing. The movie is complete with a fantastic score including the rolling stones classic "Gimmie shelter", the Beach Boys, the allman brothers band. All in all, one of the greatest movies of all time. Well done Scorsese
6.0~Fair, but nothing spectacular pocilja Sign in Permalink The Departed left me cold, much as many in the movie end up. It was fair, but fell far short of the hype that has been heaped on this flick. Plodding in the middle, with a lot of unnecessary exposition, the movie is too long - perhaps a sign of Scorcese's age. It is nowhere near the level of Casino or Goodfellas, but the plot is interesting. The last 25 mins make the movie exciting. Unfortunately, it closes on a note that makes me question what the actual point was. Acting was generally good. Nicholson, DiCaprio and Damon turn in decent performances (especially DiCaprio, who I doubted could pull off a tough-guy role). Wahlberg's character is extremely irritating and unrealistic. There is no way that a character like his would be present in such a high-ranking position at the state police level. Sorry - people just don't talk like that. I didn't find the movie any more violent than any of the director's previous work (perhaps even less so). However, a major problem I have is that the movie goes out of its way to be VULGAR. I found it quite tasteless and it detracted from my enjoyment of the film. There was a lot of nasty sexual talk in reference to women, etc that not only made it difficult to enjoy with my girlfriend, but felt unnatural. There is also plenty of racial humor to throw around which could possibly be overlooked for the sake of realism, but in light of all the potty mouths also comes off as a bit much. No better than your average misogynistic rap video, I hate to say it, but I don't think this should've been released as an R. It is worse than that. With its decent acting, witty lines and intensity nearly derailed by it's vulgarity, watch and weep for the end of taste in Western cinema.
6.0~A shocking remake tomwebb3432 Sign in Permalink How can this movie be rated so highly when it has very little originality? Infernal Affairs (I tried to name the original movie in Asian and they said it was a spelling mistake) was far superior.. but some people do not relate to Asian movies because they are in the closet racists. 8.5/10... what's wrong with you people? Even if you were unaware of the original made only 4 years ago and the fact nothing has changed in the movie except ethnicity... it was not that good... and the Irish input ha ha Soon they will be remaking Oldboy :( Is nothing sacred?
1.0~Inferior Remake st_reilly Sign in Permalink This film should have just been called "Infernal Affairs - Slightly different ending". All the ranters and ravers of how glorious a film this is are those obviously oblivious to the existence of the far superior Hong Kong original. I'll admit I'm a huge fan of most of Scorsese's other work & was highly anticipating this release but upon watching this I was hugely disappointed, so much so that I almost fell asleep, & the only other times that has happened was during the remake of The Wicker Man - enough said there. Advice for anyone who has not seen this would be see the original & pray Hollywood doesn't make a sequel.
10.0~According to my expectations..and a little more krusteva-1 Sign in Permalink I saw the movie couple of times. I go to see a movie more than once very rarely and the main reason is to keep the first impression mostly 'untouched'. This time things were different, not only that I wasn't scared of damage the good feelings that the film left me with after the first seeing, but the desire of doing it again made me think of it even with more delight. I really liked it obviously. First I was attracted by the way it climbed in the IMDb Top 250. I keep my eye on this chart and in the last months I haven't seen such a fast going up-to-the-top . After 'Heat' and 'Mystic River' I don't remember to have been moved that way by a movie in that genre from the latest years. If I have to be honest, the only thing that bothered me was that DiCaprio is playing the main character. After 'Titanic' I thought nothing can make me go and see him playing again. Well, that's the funniest part - exactly he and his acting are to be thanked for making me see this movie again...and again if you ask me. Sooner or later I think he and Martin Scorsese will have their own Oscar statuettes at home. At the end - why not this time?...
3.0~spoiler warning ...what a piece of c.... pacmanmty Sign in Permalink Blame it on me. Probably too many years of going to the movies makes me skeptical or cynical, but to tell you the truth, I can not tolerate the ending of The Departed. What originally was made a movie about two individuals that begins to emphasize with their natural enemies because of their interaction with their surrounding environment is transformed thanks to Hollywood in a very potent movie about fatality and no honor among crooks. And the movie was absolutely marvelous until the last three minutes That ending,..that freaking ending. Damon leaving the elevator and the dog that dodges him, Whalberg there to kill the "bad guy" and the damn rat on the window. Damn !!! Why not to finish the movie -like the original - with the ceremony of the deceased DiCaprio ? Why to kill the bad guy ? Whay they did that if not of because the "moralistic Bushian" way of life ?. Why not to understand that evil wins a lot of games ? what a way to trash a movie !!! Imagine this, you are preparing a delicious dish at your house... and at the very end you add three spoons of crap (s.it) would you still eat it ? would you still think of that as a great dish ? do not fool yourselves. Sex without orgasm is plain crap. This movie was ecstatic and missed the point at the very end.
5.0~Arrrrggghhhhhhhh!!!, Det_Sipowicz Sign in Permalink Honestly I am surprised. This is by far the worst movie from Scorsese ever. It is Nothing more than an action Hollywood clichéd movie... But way gorier than the average ones although it is good entertainment Terrible Performances (Why was Jack Nicholson cast, when you have actors like Robert DeNiro or William Hurt who can play a gangster better?) DiCaprio playing (once again) himself and Alec Baldwin... well. Mark Whalberg was good, so was the guy who plays Mr. French, and Matt Damon was not bad either. Vera Farmiga was underused (No wonder Scorsese wanted someone new, a famous actress would have never taken the role). The movie could have been pretty good if it weren't full of racial slurs and many carbon copied scenes. There is no way to deny that this movie got a pity Oscar, and pity awards, courtesy of 'critics' that felt sorry for Mr. Scorsese long 'overlooked' career... But I'm more enraged that it won screenplay unless that category has been changed to 'Best copied screenplay' If you value cinema as an art form, avoid this and watch the original but if you want to be entertained watch this instead and don't expect a lot
5.0~Great opening, slow middle and a poor ending sidyaqub Sign in Permalink After watching 'Infernal Affairs' I thought to myself 'Why are the Americans making a remake of such a gem?' There was no need. (especially after many TERRIBLE US remakes of Eastern movies) Then I heard that Martin Scorsese was at the helm. I thought 'there is hope'. When it comes down to the crunch, it's the weakest crime drama from Marty (compared to GoodFellas, Casino and even his breakthrough Mean Streets), as well as being heavily inferior to the neatly-written, slick Hong Kong original. When going to see this with a few of my buddies, I was expecting a great film from all the reviews it had received. It had started out great, the use of home footage of Boston riots and great dialogue from legend Jack Nicholson. I thought: maybe this is different from the Hong Kong movie, with excellent use of the song 'Gimme Shelter' by The Rolling Stones. Nicholson plays Frank Costello (the ONLY real life character) an Irish mob boss who takes a young Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) under his wing. Years on Sullivan has become a Sgt in the Boston Police and an inside man for Costello. At the same time William Costigan (Di Caprio) enrolled in the State Police, since he's the nephew of a well-known gangster Jackie Costigan (who's already dead at the beginning) Senior Sgt Dignam (Wahlberg) and Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) allow him to be a cop only if he were to be an undercover and infiltrate Costello's racket as a mole. Over the year, or 2, Sullivan has worked up the ranks of the police and remains the inside man for Costello. But Costigan has endured a violent streak and mind games from Costello who questions his loyalty over numerous occasions. After a botched deal with Chinese mobsters on both sides of the badge, the moles are aware of each other's presence and must find out who is the 'rat' before they are caught. When it comes to acting and the cast, it was terrific. Damon, Nicholson, Wahlberg and Di Caprio work their magic really well under Scorsese's astute direction. There is good support from Alec Baldwin as a foul-mouthed Police Captain, yet Martin Sheen and Ray Winstone are badly underused and their characters do not show the best of their abilities. The film begins on a different, gritty note from the original, but halfway through becomes an over-violent, quickly chopped rehash of Lau and Mak's masterpiece (like the writers just thought of something quick), which makes the screenplay seemed hacked up. The original trilogy did a great job of telling the story in 3 parts, exploring philosophical aspects as well as providing a backdrop for characters with a prequel. The Departed crams the Infernal Affairs Trilogy into one nearly-3-hours movie and becomes quite flabby and just tries too hard to be a cool crime thriller than the original. Scorsese may have won the Oscar, but it's only after being snubbed over many occasions (makes me wonder WHY he never won for 'Raging Bull'), the Academy owed him an Award for his previous work which is a distinct piece of cinema history, so they had no choice but to Award 'The Departed'. It is a reasonably fare crime thriller but not a classic. Check out the original.
10.0~Purebred Scorsese Excellence johnryanbragg Sign in Permalink First of all, wow. Just wow. Wanted to watch this film for months and months now and good God, it's everything I've ever wanted, AND MORE. The chemistry between the characters, the actors performances, the writing, all a big fat 10/10 in my book. Wow.
5.0~It was not that great~~ ede559 Sign in Permalink Having watched the original Hong Kong version - Infernal Affairs - I personally thought The Departed was lacking in many areas. Leonardo Di Caprio portrayal of the undercover cop character was not as good as Tony Leung. I am a big fan Tony Leung's acting. He has a very good screen presence and has a smoothness and charisma to his acting. In many ways the characters and scenes where better portrayed in Infernal Affairs when compared to The Departed. For instance, when Martin Sheen died (in IA, this was Anthony Wong), Di Caprio's reaction was more 'what the hell' than that of sadness. Also a lot of the 'copied' scenes, was overdone in The Departed. Martin Scorsee always tries to overdo things and he does it again. Trying to re-think and re-do a perfectly fine scene to try make it his own. A see people, commenting whether or not there will be a sequel. Well in Hong Kong there were 2 sequels. Well kind off. The second was like a prequel that mainly goes back to the beginning to tracks Andy Lau (Matt Damon) and Tony Leung's (Leonardo Di Caprio) rise and how the came to be the person they were in Infernal Affairs 1. The third actually continues from the first film and concludes the trilogy. But it will be hard to re-use this idea in The Departed, cos a prequel was kinda included in the start of The Departed. Also i did not know why Scorsee wanted to create the love triangle when it was not necessary. I mean in IA, they had separate love interests. Tony and Kelly Chen was a good pairing and it allowed Tony's character to put down his guard and be himself when he went to see her (oh, she was his shrink)... ..Anyways I would certainly recommend Infernal Affairs to anyone. If you liked The Departed, you might want to check out Infernal Affairs. I not sure whether or not ppl will like it. I really loved Infernal Affairs. and that was maybe why I found the Departed to be a bit of a bore...maybe you'd feel the same if you watched The Departed before Infernal Affairs....
4.0~Better watch the original – Infernal affairs" Maziun Sign in Permalink Talk about undeserved Oscars  This movie definitely didn't deserved them . It's a sad thing that Academy decided to honor Scorsese with Oscar not only so late , but also with movie that didn't deserved it one bit . It's even more sad that so many people think it's a good movie . I disagree with that opinion. The movie suffers from bad acting from the three leading stars : DiCaprio , Damon and Nicholson. Matt Damon doesn't act at all . He just is in this movie . He breaths , he has open eyes and he speaks. That's it. Jack Nicholson plays his part in such way that would fit Burton's "Batman returns" . He's overacting . He's campy , cheesy and not one bit dangerous. Unless you think that killing and eating a fly makes him dangerous . DiCaprio is also overacting , but at least he's switching from being "very nervous" to "very angry" from time to time. And who the f*** casts Anthony Anderson in a serious role of cop ?! That fat and unfunny piece of meat sticks out here like a sore thumb. The supporting actors are surprisingly much better than the trio of stars . Alec Baldwin , Martin Sheen and oh my God Mark Wahlberg give the best performances of the movie. I wasn't surprised by the fine performances of Baldwin and Sheen . I didn't expect Wahlberg to give such a good performance as the tough asshole cop. It's his best role since "Boogie nights". The movie has it's share of rather ridiculous twists that are hard to swallow . There is a big plot-hole involving a certain object that seems to be important for the story for almost 70% of the movie , yet it strangely disappears and none of the characters seems to care ! Not to mention the indestructible cell phone. The movie is badly directed . Scorsese fails to recreate the psychological tension of the original, so he uses the simple way to do it – by making characters shout very often and punch each other . The wonderful sense of sorrow and tragedy that you could feel in the Asian movie is also gone . Instead there is a lot of loud music . And the shootouts look absolutely terrible , like something that Michael Bay could direct. The movie ends differently than "Infernal affairs " and it's a really bad thing . Not to mention that the whole symbol with the rat is just pathetic . In the end you might realize that you have just seen an empty and bad cop thriller. I give it 4/10.
7.0~Not as good as the HK original misanthrpy Sign in Permalink If you thought that was good go see Infernal Affairs. It's in Cantonese but they have subtitles! The original is better then The Departed and I didn't see Infernal Affairs in theaters so that must say something. Maybe its just that Andy Lau is so hot hot hot who knows... They have to get the right to rip of plots don't they? I hope so because if not that would be totally lame. I wish that they would have given some hint in it to the director of Infernal Affairs. If hes not getting a chunk of money from it then Martin whats his face should have at least gave some credit to the director of Infernal Affairs. Leo Dicaprio did a good job portraying the good guy, I hope when the DVD comes out that they have alternate endings, since the original did. I'm just going to leave it at that I suggest you go rent Infernal Affairs (blockbuster has it) if ya liked The Departed.
1.0~Don't watch this bloody awful killing fest!!!!!! cbluvsact Sign in Permalink This movie SUCKS so just be warned, it is the sickest bloodiest movie I have ever seen and there isn't a descent plot line!!!!!! Towards the end of the movie it turns into a mess w/ know direction where everyone is killing each other off. I actually liked it until the part where they blow Leo Dicaprio's brains out. Don't WATCH THIS MOVIE!!EVVVVEEERRRR!!!!! Sorry some might enjoy it......errrrrr. This movie is based on A mob leader (Jack Nickelson) who helps out a kid (Matt Damon)who becomes a police officer. When the Boston Police send a warrent to arrest the mob leader Matt Damon acts as a rat and make it impossible to find the mob leader, so the police decide to send out a under cover cop (Leo Dicaprio)to be a rat for them. Matt's girlfriend cheats on Matt w/ Leo.....everyone dies, rat runs across screen etc. BBBBBAAAAAAADDDD MMMOOOOOVVVIIIIIIEEEE!!!
8.0~Infernal Affair is better jashugan0 Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie with Infernal Affair fresh in mind. I wanted to compare the two. and I did. I thought The Departed was really good but not better than Infernal Affair. there were a few changes but they were more upsetting than making the remake better. Matt Damon is not as charming and cool as Andy Lau in his character. I feel that they have soften the character for Matt Damon. Leonardo Di Caprio was pretty good in his role though I must admit that i was more 'attached' to Tony Leung. Overall, I find that The departed is just a remake of Infernal Affair: it didn't really add up much. SPOILER: i really hate the The Departed ending. Why did they end it like that? They should have stuck to the same ending as Infernal Affair. But then, if they did, Mark Wahlberg's character would have been useless... Even though it's Scorsese, it cant beat Infernal Affair. I give it an 8 because I gave Infernal Affair a 10.
10.0~Ass Kicking Good Time bobwal2-1 Sign in Permalink Since this movie is coming out Tuesday on DVD, I have to remember the night that I saw it. It was opening night, and we went to a theater in Lawrence, MA which is a pretty tough area. The theater was packed, and from the first ten minutes the crowd was going crazy. Whole groups of people were cheering or laughing out loud at some of the films funnier lines. It was the best experience I have had at the movies since "Gladiator". Being a huge Martin Scorsese fan, I was thrilled to see him get back to the gritty movies he was so famous for from "Mean Street" to "Goodfellas". Of course the movie is violent, but not in a gratuitous "SAW" type of way. When Billy Costigan punches the guy in the bar, he breaks his hand. That is what really happens when you punch someone that hard, and little things like that make the film stand out to me. Being from the Boston area, I know all about what a sicko Whitey Bulger was. Frank Costello is loosely based on him, and Jack Nicholson's performance was chilling. Asking the girl if she had gotten her period yet was something that the pederast Bulger would have done. Nothing against Mark Wahlberg, but I felt that it was Matt Damon who deserved the Oscar nomination. Colin Sullivan was a sociopath, someone with the looks and charm who will cut your throat when you aren't looking. He was based on John Connely, the scumbag FBI agent who was Bulger's lookout for 25 years. I felt that this was Damon's best performance yet because it was so against his nature. He was just so unpredictable in this movie. Everyone will be talking about the Oscars and if Scorsese will finally win. With a movie like this, it will be great if he does it on his terms, and not trying to pander to the voters with films such as "The Aviator". This is one of his best movies ever, and anyone who likes mob movies will love it, Oscars or no.
7.0~Decent but not award-worthy ca26 Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong - it's a good flick. It's just unable to live up to the hype and I don't see why it won any award. Read Bigprisc's excellent comments for a detailed analysis and comparison with the movie upon which The Departed is based. Ultimately, this movie is Donnie Brasco mixed with Reservoir Dogs. Unfortunately, it's not as good as either. Both of these other movies did better at what they set out to do. Donnie Brasco really delved into the tension and emotions of being undercover. And Reservoir Dogs did a much better job of showing how all the rats turn on each other and no one really winds up coming out ahead. Both of these other movies are at the PEAK of their respective categories. The Departed just can't decide what kind of story it wants to tell and doesn't tell any story convincingly. What IS good? The editing, the soundtrack, and the acting. Those are all wonderful. But as we all know - there's no way of knowing how much of a role the Director played in those aspects. So there's no way of knowing whether Martin Scorsese truly deserved a nod for this movie, or his award was just a "lifetime achievement" award. If you like "mob" films - this is another goodie. But it's far from the best. And the ending leaves you unsatisfied.
6.0~Wonderful cast, but bloated, overblown, & never-ending pangraz-2 Sign in Permalink Nicholson is always worth the admission price, and other cast members do a creditable job. But in the end this is a movie that's wayyyyyyyyyy too long, weighed down by endless clichés of the genre (top Mafia boss is endlessly clever, a real sex machine, and full of philosophical one-liners in street patois; police management is too gullible to remain alive; when educated women meet tough guys they can't wait to leap into bed with them; etc. etc. etc.) As always with Scorsese the film is technically brilliant, but never comes alive (no play on words there) except now and then in Nicholson scenes, and quite often when Dicaprio is on camera--he does very well. Did I mention that it's formulaic and way too long? The Sopranos handled similar plotting and material ever so much better. Another proof--if needed--that "Oscars" mean little except for their enticement value for the gullible. (I don't know what a "spoiler" is--does that mean giving away key plot details?)
7.0~Informants number exaggerated. hhsynby Sign in Permalink The way of Billy's infiltration to gang group was so foolish. What is more annoying more than this is the leader of gang group accepted Billy after a very short testing and took him in the main operational gangsters' group for no reason. Secondly Lazio mostly uses abusive language and the chief of Lazio expects the officers and most probably the audience to accept it. The language in his role was unnaturally showy. Number of informants and the battle of different departments of enforcement agencies each other on these informants are so exaggerated. The gang leader even appeared as FBI informants at the end of the movie.😁 It is the most silly part of the movie. In terms of players' acts and cinematography, the movie is outstanding and worth to watch.
7.0~Not Bad, But Not Great Either Murdoch584 Sign in Permalink I have become less impressed with Scorsese over the years. His earlier movies had an authenticity to them which right now is sorely lacking. It seems he's become a lot like Travis Bickle in the sense that he reacts with more violence and sex the more disillusioned he gets with the world (watch Scorsese on Scorsese on disc 2 of The Departed to see what I mean). Which brings me to The Departed. I had seen Infernal Affairs before The Departed and was naturally somewhat jaded. The plethora of American remakes of Asian movies has made me somewhat irritated as with each successive remake, the quality has decreased. The Departed is no exception. To make things simple, I'll make a list of problems with this movie. 1. Acting: I couldn't help but compare Martin Sheen to Anthony Wong. Wong conveyed confidence and power in his role whereas Sheen always looked like he'd be better off being an accountant in a side office somewhere. Sheen can play confident too, just watch The Dead Zone (of course he was a villain in that movie, that's beside the point). And that brings me to Walhberg. Forget that his character wasn't in Infernal Affairs. Ask yourself why his character even needed to be in the movie. He served no purpose except to show everyone that he was unable to utter a sentence without saying the f-word about 500 times. And he got an academy award nomination for that? It certainly was not that difficult of a part. In any event, his antagonism is, I believe, to make him seem like a drill sergeant but in the end it makes him seem more like fifth grade bully. The rest of the cast pretty much sleepwalks through their roles, each on one setting. DiCaprio and Damon don't give the audience a sense of their torn duty which was such a powerful element in Infernal Affairs. It was that inner conflict in IA that made the audience empathize with the main characters. In TD, there is no grey area (which is odd since Scorsese says on disc 2 that everything is grey), the cops are good, except for Damon, and the bad guys are bad except for DiCaprio. But enough on that, on to... 2. The Direction: Overall, relatively unspectacular even from a technical standpoint. At the very least, Scorsese usually works in some unique camera shots (extended steadycam mostly). Not this time. Also, I really wish Scorsese would stop putting music over almost every single scene (he really overkilled this in Casino). Fellini, of whom I'm not a particular fan, once said something to the effect that when the director uses music too much it means there is nothing interesting going on with the story. He didn't take into account that maybe the director was manipulating emotions, which is fine. But that's the thing. Scorsese's use of music doesn't fit what's going on on the screen. He's become obsessed with musical counterpoint which, ever since Goodfellas, he's overused so much that I no longer pay it any mind. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS (for both IA and TD) 3. The Ending: It almost comes across as a slapstick comedy with people getting shot in the head left and right. The real crime (no pun intended) was the killing of Damon's character. In IA, the fact that his character had to live a lie despite the fact that he tried to make things right was so much more powerful than the bland ending of TD. In IA, that character had to live with the knowledge that he was responsible for a good cop's death. Since it's already been established that he's been trying to be a better person, this makes it all the more potent. Damon's character is a robot set on "bad" and therefore there is no empathy for him at all. In conclusion, TD is a decent movie, but nothing more. It's not a masterpiece. And if any parts of it are, it's because of the movie it's based on.
1.0~People are nuts, film is an overdone disjointed mess lvscott Sign in Permalink This film has to be the most over rated and over hyped film ever. First off, Nicholson is terrible in his hole, miscast and over the top bad. 2nd, The film has no real pointed direction, it wanders around aimlessly as if it is searching for a real thought out plot, only never to find one. Murder, Death, Murder Death << that is the entirety of this film, its a piece of garbage, seen many times before. Bas cop = good cop = bad cop = well he might be semi bad, no wait he might be semi good, murder, death, murder death.. People here saying this is this film's director's best work? ROFL!! Are the movies so bad these days that people will convince themselves " if a big name director has directed it, it must be good"? I give it 4 stars only because Dicaprio did an excellent job of acting, whereas "Jack" was terrible ( you guys also need to put away the Nicholson fan boy attitude, his acting was over the top terrible, I would nominate him for a Rasberry if I could for this film) Damon was OK, the rest just OK. I will make it my business to see "Internal Affairs" which cannot be worse than this film. The bad; 1. no pointed direction 2. no real plot, film wanders around looking for one 3. no motive or character definition "why did they do what they did"? 4. Nicholoson over the top over acted miscast >> plays the roll in a cross between his roles in "as Good as it Gets" and "Batman" 6 same old bad cop, good cop, well decent cop, well could be bad cop" regurgitated trash. If this film gets nominated for anything, maybe I will end up "with a bullet in the head" as it appears everyone else did in this film. Don't waste your money!!
9.0~Very much worth the credit it received! xander_MA Sign in Permalink You don't have to be a New England fan to love this movie. The scenery is authentic Southy Boston. The story is phenomenal. I am personally very impatient and can barely sit through an episode of Friends or Sex and the City, but the two and a half hours of this movie passed by in no time. If you like movies similar as Goodfellas then this one will top it. A strong story that keeps you focused to the screen for a long time and you will watch it again. The story is about two graduate Mass. State troopers. One of them is deemed so intelligent, he is offered an under cover position to uncover Castello's mob network in South Boston. The other one is a rat in the State police revealing information to Castello's organization. Definitely worth making it to the IMDb top 250.
8.0~A rip-off of "infernal Affairs". An excellent movie nevertheless. urian_alf Sign in Permalink "The Departed" is a remake of a 2002 Chinese film entitled "Infernal Affairs". The main and almost only difference is the exceptional heavy-weight Hollywood cast that has been thrown into Scorsese's version. DiCaprio's performance is excellent (as always), but Matt Damon's somehow falls short of his usual standard. The character played by Nicholson has a bigger and more eccentric role in this version as compared to the Chinese version, which does not come as a surprise considering that it is Jack doing his thing in his own way. Nevertheless, this time Nicholson does not steal the film like he's done in previous times. Considering all the big names in the cast, and if I could go back in time and change something about this film, it would be the choice of Damon as the mole in the police dept. I think that role required either a different approach or an actor with more personality so that the public could identify more with the character, like in the case of DiCaprio's. After all, the whole point of the movie is the tension created by the possibility that either one of those two characters is going to be caught. The film is excellent but I can't give more than 8 out of 10 to it considering that in some scenes it is a frame-by-frame rip-off of "Infernal Affairs". If you can watch any of the two versions at any given time, I would recommend to watch the original version first because In my opinion it comes across as the most honest of the two.
2.0~So much potential... ct_spruce Sign in Permalink This movie had so much potential, so much star power; the directing, the casting: everything. But I hated it. Why? It was so incredibly dirty. Every other word is f**k this or c**t that. Jack Nicholson's character owns pornographic theaters, the sex is over the top, and the blood is a little excessive. I have a hard time believing this story because everything is just so over the top. There's just no way that any real people can be just so twisted as this--and here it is, on my TV! Mostly the language bothered me. I think I could have gotten over the rest of the shortcomings if it wasn't for the language. I just felt so dirty for having witnessed such a film--I actually shut it off. And for those of you who think I just can't handle it: I'm a 21-year-old guy who loves action movies.
9.0~I never thought I'd say this but DiCaprio is perfect in this. michael-hall202 Sign in Permalink I've just watched the Departed and I'm a big big fan of Infernal Affairs. I must say, I enjoyed The Departed immensely. It was smart, very funny in places and the performances of DiCaprio, Wahlberg and Winston were fantastic. I really didn't think Leo would be able to make me empathise with his undercover cop character the way Tony Leung did. But I must say, I was wrong, this is the film where DiCaprio comes of age as a fine actor. He deserves and Oscar nomination for this in my opinion, no question. There is very little between Leo and Leung in terms of performance (I perhaps lean slightly toward Leung as he is the finest Asian actor of the modern age I believe). All in all, a great but flawed film (some additions to the plot worked, some did not) and a return to form from Scorsese
10.0~Fabulous Scorsese movie, watch it 3-4 times farhad_hamed Sign in Permalink The movie starts from a childhood of Matt Damon and then he is in military training courses with Dicaprio. At the final stage, Damon is accepted to be police but Dicaprio is rejected. Police and Mafia want to have rats in each organization. Damon and Dicaprio, who was once rejected are employed. Many meetings of Mafia and the reactions of the police are betrayed. So the police decides to choose Damon to find the rat inside, unaware of he is the rat himself. After lots of great scenes, the rats are found. This movie has to be watched at least 3-4 times. But I think it had some mistakes, i.e. ending parts of movie, in the elevator, Dicaprio is very amateur, never a police stands besides the hostage, always behind it. But the death of Capitain was wonderful. It shook me up. Martin Scorsese's movies are always great.
1.0~Most Horrible & Overrated Film of 2006! Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" was WAY BETTER! eragonbookfan Sign in Permalink I want 151 minutes of my life back! Laugh-Out-Loud, Unmitigated Crap. Interesting...but not in the way intended. Somehow watchable, but NOT Good! So ridiculously bad, it's hilarious, but still a waste of time. The moral decline of the western culture. Way too trite and poorly acted. If only I could go back in time to stop this movie from being made! Propaganda in service of oppression and hypocrisy. A little self-awareness might have made this a much better film. What a ridiculous load of crap! Cringingly bad! UGH! No really, this was the stupidest movie I ever watched. I do not recommend it one bit! And the f-word being uttered like EVERY other sentence, almost to the point where it gets kind of annoying! An excuse to put DiCaprio in it & try to convince us he can act. Don't watch it unless you truly want some hardcore violence & just want to hear DiCaprio scream & yell like a insecure deranged maniac (like just about every other film he's been in). Get this "Awful Movie with Awful Characters doing Awful Things" movie out of my head! Oh, if they only played it for realism. Exhibiting the WORST of Hollywood ! I mean, so we ALWAYS have to have films showing the dark side of the human person?? Why not more feel-good movies that would be encouraging or inspiring! If we're always making soings about loving each other, then why do we tolerate garbage like this?? All it will be is just a BAD, I repeat, BAD influence! Screw this movie... except for DiCaprio getting shot in the head - that part was gold. 1/10 PS: Want a better film from the year 2006??? Then by all means, watch "Apocalypto"! In my opinion, it's much better & suspenseful than "Passion of the Christ", or even MORE Oscar-worthy than this "Departed" trash.
10.0~Best Movie of the Year beattiej18 Sign in Permalink This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and was redoubtably one of the top flicks released this year. The acting was amazing (but would you expect less from the beyond all-star cast?) and the plot was entertaining. Even if you go in simply looking for a thrilling movie, you cant help but appreciate the artistic value of the camera angles and the music. I would recommend this movie to anyone... well, if you can get into a Rated R movie, this is a hardcore R. As for the people giving negative comments, I see that they all are saying that the speech is not realistic.... yet they are all from other countries. I'm from Boston, and trust me, the script did the city language justice. We swear, nonstop. F**k is common. As for those claiming Scorsese is washed up or has run out of ideas, get off the crack. This film was amazing. As controversial as he is, Martin Scorsese is a damn good film maker.
10.0~2 thumbs up angelahuntmail Sign in Permalink great movie. i mean i was expecting great with those stars in it. but honestly this movie was great. a little confusing and had some comedy. but i'd say it's one of my favorite movies . Jack Nichlson plays this f.b.i. most wanted man. and Matt Damon is a cop. Jack Nicholson greatly helped him as a kid so Matt Damon is giving him info about the cops. Leanardo DI Caprio is a cop that is undercover in Jack Nicholson's gang. while they keep on exscaping and the cops keep trying with no idea the rat is Matt Damon. will they find each others sectret's the question. great plot and long movie but very very entertaining.great surprise ending find out what it is. i think you will enjoy this movie as much as i did.
10.0~Scorsese deserves an Oscar for this film filmmakr03 Sign in Permalink Like most of us, when news comes from Hollywood that an American filmmaker is doing a remake of a foreign film, my stomach cringes at the fact (i.e. The Grudge, The Ring). However, imagine my sheer excitement when I learned that Martin Scorsese was attached to direct one of the best HK crime films I've seen: 'Infernal Affairs'. Usually, I'm not optimistic about a remake but I had to make an exception. Anyways, the film succeeds in matching up to the original, reminding me why idolize Scorsese in the first place. Scorsese, with the help of a solid and interesting screenplay by William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven), crafts a story of deception and tragedy set in one of America's most celebrated but equally infamous cities. Casting is everything in a film and The Departed is no different. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one his best performances as Billy Costigan, the undercover cop sent to infiltrate Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crime syndicate. I totally bought DiCaprio as the man who was trying to distance himself from his family's dark past. His struggle in leading a life of deception is very chaotic and thrilling. He deserved an Oscar nod for this role (I haven't seen Blood Diamond yet). Matt Damon, as he demonstrated in the Bourne films, showed a darker side as Colin Sullivan, Costello's rat in the Boston State Police. I sound a bit biased, but I think Damon should have gotten at least a Golden Glode nod for the film. Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson. His casting was key in the success of this film as he provided some of the most comical and sinister scenes of the film. It is a crying shame that this is the only film Nicholson has made with Scorsese so far. Alec Baldwin is great as Capt. Ellerby, even though he has very little screen time. However, the performance that caught me by surprise the most is that of Mark Wahlberg as Sgt. Dignam. He is very convincing as a no nonsense cop with a chip on his shoulders. His disdain for Damon's character is very genuine and it makes what transpires very chilling and justifiable. Overall, this film is at the top of my film list for 2006. If you haven't seen The Departed yet, please do. It is an unforgettable experience. Also, will the Academy please give Scorsese the Oscar come March?!?
10.0~Scorsese's best eruizsalgado Sign in Permalink Calling a movie one of the best movies of all time tells you that movie is a masterpiece. Well, The Departed is one of the best movies of all time, and it could be argued it is the best movie of the 2000s decade. Everything works and its all perfection. Sincerely, there isn't that one thing that brings the movie down. This is trully a masterpiece that will be discussed for years to come and has made its mark in cinema history.
5.0~Good but not as good as the original PhoCris Sign in Permalink Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary, not a master-piece, not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch. Some things are better than in the original (Infernal Affairs) like character development. It is especially true for DiCaprio's character (not really for other character). However the scene, when Wahlberg cites all of DiCaprio's family connection to the mob, takes too much time. They take a long time establishing how DiCaprio sells drugs with his cousin and finally get into Nicholson's gang. However after that it doesn't take long for Nicholson to give his total trust (in one year and a half to two years), which bothered me. This takes the first hour of the movie and i think it could have been cut by at least 20min. Some scenes have a lot more impact in Infernal Affairs than in The Departed. I'm gonna cite 3 scenes which are some of the most important in the story in my opinion: -The death of Wong/Queenan: in IA, Wong falls suddenly, lands on a taxi cab taking Yan by surprise. When Yan realizes Wong is dead you can feel the suffering Yan goes through by the loss of the only person who knows he's a cop but also/mainly by the loss of his friend. In The Departed we see Sheen falls in slow-mo until he hits the ground in a splash of blood. There's absolutely no connection, no friendship between DiCaprio and Sheen. We see DiCaprio almost on the verge of crying. But Why ? He's not his friend and there's still Wahlberg to prove he's a cop. -The death of Sam/Costello: In IA, Ming seems to show a desire to redeem himself and become a good man for his girlfriend. When he confronts Sam in the parking lot during the raid, he kills Sam to remove any evidence he's a mole and restart on a blank slate. In The Departed, although Damon slightly mentions starting anew in another city, when he kills Costello he does it just to cover his a-s-s. Never after he seems like he might become good. -The elevator and final scene: In IA, the meeting on the rooftop is between two men on each side of the law but sharing so much in common. You can even sense that Ming has some respect for Yan. There's no violence until what happens in the elevator. When Yan dies you can see Ming didn't want this to end like that. Yan's death is really emotional, all sounds are drawn off and only an opera piece is playing. When the second mole gets killed by Ming you only hear gunshots. In The Departed The final scenes are a mess. Damon and DiCaprio just hate each other's gut, the token black guy shows up, the 2nd mole shows up and everybody executes everybody. They just stand there to get shot. The scene seems really rushed. And when Damon open his door at the end of the movie to see Wahlberg waiting for him, it was the cherry on top of the cake. Everybody was cracking up. How many shots to the head do we need to see ? Was it really necessary to kill Damon and provide the audience with a happy ending ? Although The Departed is a good movie I felt a lot more satisfied with Infernal Affairs. They have very different feel to them. One is over-the-top street violence while the other one is more subdued, concise and nuanced. For those who says that The Departed is way more psychological than IA I would have to disagree. Infernal Affairs shows how two men struggle to know what defines if they're good or bad. Is it their actions or their allegiance to one side or the other of the law? In the end they're really similar. Yan tells the Psy he's a cop and lift that weight off his shoulder even if it's for just a second. Ming wants to redeem himself and prove his girlfriend but also himself that he's not that bad. Others before me have also commented on the buddhist notion of eternal hell so I won't talk about it :) The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end. The Departed 8/10 Infernal Affairs 9/10
10.0~The most addictive movie you will ever see! divine_theory235 Sign in Permalink From the beginning of this movie I was captivated! The whole plot is well thought out, it is absolutely mind blowing! I sat wide eyed the entire movie wanting to know what would happen next. The actors played their parts well, specially DiCaprio. Sullivan and Costingan's opposite characters were absolutely genius. One a "bad guy" who gets everything and the "good guy" getting basically nothing. However, I did not expect the end to end up the way it did. I mean, everybody died! I was completely convinced that Costingan would arrest Sullivan, then a happily ever after with Madolyn. But the end was so different from what I thought it would be, so Kudos for the unexpected. Even thought the end wasn't the perfect "great happy ending" to the movie, I can't help but LOVE IT!
10.0~instant classic Outfieldking3489 Sign in Permalink Despite some outlying bad reviews by say the New York Times, the film The Departed directed by Martin Scorcese is an instant classic. In this film there is an all star cast followed by an all star director, one of the best of the last fifty years. With Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, you cannot go wrong. From the moment that the beginning of the movie started, I was compelled. I have watched movies intently all of my life, watching classics from the past fifty years as much as I can, and I will definitely say to you all that this movie will now be included in the list with Scarface and Goodfellas. Martin Scorcese is able to bring an Irish gangster film about killing and deception to that of "a Shakespearian tragedy." That in my mind is the most pivotal point in this movie, Martin can bring this movie of cunningness and lying rats to that of masterful proportions. This movie will never be forgotten and I can promise you that. When I say it is my favorite movie of all time, I literally mean that, and I only saw it on its opening day, yesterday, October 6, 2006. The combination of amazing directing, superb acting, a very suspenseful and moving plot and excellent film work, will shoot this movie instantly to the status of the classics that we all know and love, that is a guaranteed fact.
7.0~Great performances - but over rated, over all cfeaton Sign in Permalink This was a very good film and I would recommend it overall. Riveting and interesting up until the last several minutes. But the ending was 'cheap' and did not capitalize on the story and the character build-up. (SPOILER!!!!!) So much more could have been done after Damon and Di Caprio knew about each other - but the writing tanked at that point. Overall, very good direction. Fantastic performances from Nicholson, Damon, Di Caprio, etc. But a very flat ending that was done, seemingly, for shock value and nothing more. A disappointment. For those with a dark sense of humor (like mine) it was very funny - and Nicholson was in his element. I expect some nominations out of this, some of which would not be warranted (picture, screenplay, possibly even direction). But again, the main players were great in their roles - primarily Damon, Di Caprio, and Nicholson.
8.0~"The Departed" Won't be Leaving Anytime Fast frankwhat Sign in Permalink There were a couple complaints about this film's length during my screening, as clocking in at just over two and-a-half hours, it's a long movie. But there's a big difference between good long movies and bad long movies, which this is most certainly the former. The time flew by and not once did I find myself checking my watch. That being said it was also a fairly original idea, despite actually being a foreign remake. I think it's definitely safe to say that none of the important parts were lost in translation during the conversion. The finished product easily did justice to the original, especially considering how poorly the majority of Americanized releases have turned out lately. As far as the acting as a whole was concerned, it was way above par. Jack Nicholson effortlessly played a great insane gangster, whose level of psychosis steadily increased. Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the dedicated but extremely sarcastic administrative officer. In fact I think it was the combination of these two characters that led to the perfect blend of comic relief that made it much easier for the conservative audience members to digest some of the harsher subject matter. The star turn was definitely put in by Leonardo DiCaprio, who displayed such naturally conflicted emotions and added so much inside depth to his role that at times it was even scary. Leo's both physical and various forms of mental anguish could be felt by all. I could really feel what he was going through the whole time without ever having those exact same experiences. This is one time where it'll be tough to ignore him at the Oscars again. Matt Damon gave a pretty flawless performance, but it also felt that he had the least interesting of all the characters despite having a lot of screen presence. Mark Wahlberg was surprisingly good in a different role than he's accustomed to, although he did drop his accent a couple times. Somewhat newcomer Vera Farmiga was passable, but not overly convincing and did seem to get clunky. Overall the character development could've been better as the viewers just received a surface glance at them, but I wound up caring for most of the individuals regardless. The cinematography was excellent and contained some beautiful scenes of Boston along with some not so desirable shots of its seedy underground. The soundtrack was amazing and not just for the wonderful songs themselves. They really heightened the emotions by being blasted at some intense scenes as well. Needless to say this particularly grabbed my attention. Finally, the editing was tight which also helped with the quick pacing and the script was smoothly written into several layers but at the same time not being formulaic. Even if the scenario mainly dealt with translating the "Infernal Affairs" story for audiences over here. This was a highly enjoyable flick and I fully recommend it on just about every level. In fact, my only real problem with it was that the ending felt rather contrived and was a letdown. It turned messy quickly and was going all over the place when the filmmakers were trying to tie everything together. Not too mention also highly improbable. Notwithstanding, if you can overlook that, then you'll be in for a real treat as usual from Martin Scorsese. This is without a doubt his best film so far this decade, and could quite possibly be right there under "Goodfellas". It's fairly ironic that the title is "The Departed", because I was so intrigued that I didn't want to leave.
9.0~Exceptionally enjoyable, hard to resist and leaves you a little extra boosted after its finish jeffreylubeck@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink Similar to drinking a cup of coffee from dark, rich and well roasted beans after having a large travel mug's worth earlier in the day from the gas station; The Departed is exceptionally enjoyable, hard to resist and leaves you a little extra boosted after its finish. The Departed is not for the faint of heart or provocateurs of political and social correctness. However, The Departed is full of everything Martin Scorsese  conflict, intensity, male testosterone, chemistry between male and female, the blurred lines between good and bad and legal and illegal. Oh, and did I mentioned gun shots to the head. The Departed is Martin Scorsese at his best. The basis for The Departed comes from the film "Infernal Affairs" (out of Hong Kong) and screen writer William Monahan does a more than credible job extending the storyline and characters. The Departed is a story and study in the comparison of deception and honesty, crime and law, family lineage and no background, and protection and exposure. The Departed is full of popular leading actors playing leading and supporting roles that have depth and importance to the film. It is a credit to Scorsese, the actors and the script that The Departed can blend the styles of being almost over-the-top with stretches of seriousness and high intensity yet not lose continuity or the audience. Another measure of the quality of The Departed is that it runs at 1:51 minutes but plays much more like 90.
1.0~Crap princessweety Sign in Permalink I was surprised by the 8.5 points received by this film. 6 of us went to watch this film and none of us liked it. Considering my other 5 friends have watched the original Hong Kong version, this one is sadly not up to standard. The acting part is excellent, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. I could almost feel his struggle sipping through the silver screen. I haven't watched the Hong Kong version yet and I felt asleep in the middle of the film. This is profoundly related to the weak and insensible sound effect, plateau of the plot (the Hollywood version is subtly different than the Hong Kong one), as well as the abuse of indecent language. All that is enough to spoil the whole image. Last but not least this is the worst cinematography and editing I have ever experience in watching a mega-budgeted film. Cuts from scene to scene are rough and disturbing. From another perspective, the $10 I paid is worthwhile for the good sleep in a cinema's padded chair.
10.0~Scorsese is Back!!!!!!! eckhouse24 Sign in Permalink The Departed **** out of **** Over the past 5 years, it seemed as though Martin Scorsese was spending too much time trying to win himself an Oscar for best director that the films he was making, though good, were not typical Scorsese films. Gangs of New York and the Aviator were both good films though it seemed as though I wasn't watching a Scorsese film. After viewing The Departed, all I can say is that Scorsese is back. This film almost seems to be a screw you to the Academy. He did his best to conform to Academy style to win his award and when all was done, Scorsese was left standing statue less. Now, Scorsese returns to a genre that has made him one of the best directors in the business. The Departed is a crime drama that is bloody and vulgar just the way Scorsese has made films in the past. The Departed has an all-star cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg. Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a villainous crime boss who under the eye of the Boston Police and FBI. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a police cadet hired to go secretly undercover to be an informant Sheen and Wahlberg. It is later learned that not only does the authorities have an informant in Costello's crew, but Costello has an informant in the State Police. All the cast members give an outstanding performance. It is hard to say who had the best performance because they were all great. Nicholson, who has been doing a lot of comedies lately, reminds us just how great of a villain he can be. DiCaprio reminds us once again that he is a better actor then Titanic would suggest.Damon once again shows us why he is one of the better actors today. And though both Wahlberg and Baldwin both have small parts, they come across as great performances. The film runs in at about 2 1/2 hours but it certainly doesn't feel like it. There are no slow moments which is good for a long film. Scorsese has a brilliant talent for mixing a great soundtrack with a great film. Look at Goodfellas and Casino. Both of their soundtracks help push the films along. The violence is in your face as it should be with a story like this. In doing this film, Scorsese may bring himself a best director award at the Oscars without trying as hard as he did in the past. Many feel he was robbed back in 1990 for Goodfellas and it would only be fitting that he gets an award for this film being this film is his most violent since Goodfellas. Lets just hope that Kevin Costner isn't working on Dances With Wolves II.
10.0~No such thing as a small role for a good actor carolethecatlover Sign in Permalink This is a really, really good story. I urge women who really don't like violent movies, but whose guys do, to go for this one. The story is outstanding with more twists and turns than a cut snake. The actors are all excellent. Even the small roles are attention grabbing. Mark Walberg, that guy just gets better with every film he makes. This is a mature role, and he plays it to the hilt. Matt Damon, too nice, too cute, and never looking older than 22, finally ages a bit, and almost plays a nasty, the twist being that he got the role within a role because he is a nice guy, too complicated. Leo DeC gets a role worthy of his talents, Let's hope it teaches him to stamp on his agents' toes when they offer him romantic leads. The only woman is unknown and totally real. The whole thing is just mesmerizing for what? 2, nearly 3 hours. Scorsese on top of his form. Da guy is a genius or what? See the Chinese version. Lau and what's his name are exact Chinese counterparts for Leo and Matt. Carole
8.0~Top-Notch Gangster Film - The Departed arthur_tafero Sign in Permalink Martin Scorcese is a Hollywood legend. He knows New York City. He knows Boston, and he knows gangsters. The script is outrageously good. The photography is outstanding. Everything in the movie was impeccable except the casting. And no, I am not going to say Pacino should have had Nicholson's role. Jack was just fine. I just think that the two roles of the leading men should have been switched. Damon is a tougher guy than Dicaprio. And Wahlberg is tougher than both of them; but he was cast perfectly. Dicaprio in a fight with Wahlberg? I don't think so. Dicaprio as a tough guy? Sorry, I'm not buying. Didnt buy him in Gangs in New York as a tough guy, either. Just like I never bought Mongomery Clift as a tough guy in From Here to Eternity or in The Young Lions. Seeing Dicaprio win a fight with anyone in a film gives me the same feeling as when I saw Clift win a fight with John Wayne in a Western. It just didnt convince my senses. Other than the switch in the lead roles, the film is almost perfect. (except for the love scenes with Dicaprio, which pretty much fall into the same category as the fight scenes. Please. Choosing Dicaprio over Damon. LOL. It was like watching Lily Tomlin in a love scene with John Travolta. Great film, though.
7.0~top ten stupidest endings sbdjones Sign in Permalink The movie in and of itself was good ... until the last 5-10 minutes. It looked like the writers realized the movie was running long and wrapped things up without putting too much energy into how this would look to the viewer. When Will comes out of the elevator with Sullivan and gets shot, they lost me. Where did the other informant come from?? I know he was a buddy of Sullivan but there had been no indication up to that point that he was anything but a third-tier character so why give him such a pivotal task? It didn't make any sense! I would have thought the girlfriend would have been killed (and I'm convinced the baby was Will's) because she knew the secret. By the way, Jack Nicholson looks as creepy in this film as he does in most of his films so the talk about him winning an Oscar is about as well-deserved as Denzel Washington for "Training Day" or Reese Witherspoon for "Walk the Line". All in all, it's a rental.
9.0~Wicked Pissah DCS2608 Sign in Permalink This movie single handedly reminded me why I watch movies. It isn't just entertaining but it has a great plot and is realistic(especially for native Bostonians). This movie is just like James "Whitey Bulger" and the mess that the Massachusetts State Police underwent to figure out the truth of the underworld. The acting is amazing by mainly Leonardo, Nicholson and Mark Whalberg. The character development of Leonardo Dicaprio's character was heart wrenching. I could go on and on for hours about this movie cause I've already seen it 3 times( and I want to see it tomorrow). I would say that The Departed is one of the best "Guy movies" ever. Now go see this amazing film and experience Scorcese and his masterful mind at work. Peace out Derek
6.0~10 SERIOUS PLOT HOLES - #52 of all time? Not quite ----> spoilers greensportaz Sign in Permalink I liked so much of it, but had some serious problems, including (Spoilers ahead ---->) #1) Introducing the 'other rat' at the end was a little ridiculous. And why would he become a 2X cop killer to save Matt Damon? Did he think Matt Damon would rat him out? Matt Damon didn't even know he existed. Did he somehow still feel loyalty to the 'gang' (which seems ridiculous after he even said that Nicholson had ratted them out) Why wouldn't he have just continued to be a cop or quietly slip away? I know it's a movie, but don't introduce a character that we don't know and expect us to understand his motives. #2) Di Caprio with the shrink seemed so forced. I have a couple of psychologist/psychiatrist friends and rule #1 is you don't sleep with your patients. You will never work again. She even mentioned how much she liked her job. Obviously she liked random trysts with Di Caprio more. #3) Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson's 'final shootout' was terrible. Such a staged cinematic moment and then Damon shouts something like, "I've got him!" and then the hoards of police happen to notice where the main guy they were after is... That whole scene was just so sloppy and thrown together. #4) The baby ... Was the baby Di Caprios or Damons? Are we supposed to care? Why even introduce this? Seemed like a story line that they started and then never finished or simply edited out a major scene. #5) Nicholson was pretty sure that Di Caprio was the rat, but decided to still work with him despite his suspicions. I mean, he was the new guy ... Then all of these tips started coming in. And Di Caprio was a former police agent (which Nicholson knew!) Come on ... So stupid. And the guy dying right before he was able to tell everyone else in the gang that Di Caprio was a rat was terrible. That gang obviously was the biggest bunch of morons if they weren't 100% sure that they should at least stop working with Di Caprio (if you're not positive then wait to kill him ... but come on ... ) #6) Di Caprio scored a 1400 on his SAT's (so obviously he was pretty smart.) He sure let Sheen and Wahlberg play him like a fool. I mean if they weren't going to let him be a cop and that's what he wanted to do, I'm sure there would be plenty of avenues for him to pursue in order to become a cop (other than having to commit a crime, get put in prison, etc...) This just seemed so stupid. 1400 on his SAT's on the Boston Police Force ... Pretty sure he could have found work :) #7) Leo checking Martin Sheens pulse after watching him violently fall to his death was classic :) Come on Leo, we were all pretty sure that he was dead :) #8) These gang members seemed awfully prone to killing cops (How many cops a year are actually killed in the US by gun fire? It isn't that many) <--- However, it is a movie, so we can let this one go... But it was a little bit exaggerated in a movie that was supposed to be realistic. It isn't like in Goodfellas the gangsters just kill cops (if they kill any cops at all?) They kill each other! #9) Matt Damon accidentally kills that Asian guy ... There are clearly surveillance cameras around. No other cop thinks to look at those to see if they can see who it was that was walking out? I mean Damon looked directly at the camera! Certainly they could have seen that he was there. Violent murders in Boston (even if they are Chinese restaurant employees) still get investigated... I promise. #10) No backlash from the agents within the Chinese government for them being ripped off of a million dollars? Ouch. I mean I'm not an expert on the Chinese mafia, but something tells me that a million dollars and being set up would bring some sort of black lash ... Guess Nicholson is more powerful than the group who is buying nuclear missile trackers. Those Boston mob bosses are evidently the most powerful people on the planet. I'm sure there are more... But 10 is a good number ! Any thoughts?
1.0~Just as the nay sayers said sansay Sign in Permalink This movie sucked big time. I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing, specially when coming from the cops. It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time. But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter, there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride. Other viewers have described them very well, so I thank them for saving me the time. I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director. Well no more I guess. Just another big commercial production which just doesn't fly... Too many heavy weights and too much pandering to the lowest common denominators, this recipe usually favored by Hollywood only succeeded in giving me an indigestion... buuurrrp!!!
1.0~Inferior remake dudleynomore Sign in Permalink Marty, Marty, Marty, what has become of you? People are saying this is going to win him Best Director? Oh, dear. Here's a spoiler-free list of some of the horribly clichéd or absurd things you can expect from this remake of Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS. This movie is all about psychological complexity. Which is why they have Matt Damon insulting a bunch of firemen near the beginning: "You're a bunch of homos!" he shouts. Leo's character is a down-on-his-luck kid with no family support network. It's so complex, you can't tell who the filmmakers want you to feel sympathy for. Remember how Braveheart ended by implying that Mel Gibson may have fathered a child who would later be raised by the estranged wife of one of the bad guys? That happens. At the bleakly dramatic climax, Mark Whalburg shows up wearing a hairnet. It looks ludicrous. Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb crops up on the soundtrack - but at perhaps the most intimate, sincere moment in the movie, so that the lyrics wind up being completely out-of-context. At one point Martin Sheen's character, in fear of his life, has to bluff his way into an elevator past some thugs, which he does by pretending to be an innocent passer-by. In the original the scene was set in an apartment block where people might be coming and going all day, so this very nearly works. Here, the scene is in an abandoned building, and his actions make no sense. At all. A criminal mole in the police force decides to marry a psychiatrist who specializes in treating the police. Matt Damon has just personally shot someone. While he's standing there, he takes a call from the guy's girlfriend. "He's been shot" Matt tells her. Oooookay. You know the guy Matt shoots, who he was there specifically to shoot? Matt waits for the guy to shoot first before doing anything. Like in a bad Western. Leo, the undercover cop, feeds Martin Sheen information by text messaging him whilst there are highly tense, alert criminals standing all around him. Don't worry, he leans behind a pillar so that no one notices. What a pity the original film didn't have a cool way of doing this that would have made more sense. You get the idea. One thing I would never criticize is the acting, which is just fine across the board, unsurprisingly considering the expensive cast. Jack and Ray are always fun, especially together. The cinematography is boring but the dialogue is entertaining; it's just that the story is mangled and it takes a ridiculous amount of time for anything to happen. It's as if 'Marty' couldn't decide who he wanted the film to be about  Jack's character, the plot, Catholicism, or Boston itself  so he just put everything in and we end up waiting an extra hour for the same things to happen. I've avoided mentioning the absurd, hamfistedly 'manipulative' final shot, or something else about what happens to Leo, because I don't want to spoil the ending. Watch the original instead, it's better in every way and 50 minutes shorter.
5.0~Nowhere near the resonance of his earlier work ghbscreen Sign in Permalink I find it amazing that people actually give this piece credibility. I am a massive Scorcese fan, his earlier films were classics, but this is vacuous and dull, and haven't we all seen this kind of thing so many times before? Am I really expected to be shocked by the corruption of police? Goodfellas was a landmark piece with pace and involvement and memorable characters, this doesn't come near. I'm afraid to say that it seems M.S. has lost his way. This is repetitive easy fare. Looks like he directed this in his sleep. No surprises, no depth of character anywhere and Jack Nicholson doing what he always does. Of course it was well shot with good pace, but with this cast you expect something better. An irritating story, an avalanche of swear words that are debased by their familiarity, and characters you don't care about.
10.0~A Great Film MVBarra1 Sign in Permalink This is the best film i have seen in God only knows how long. It was amazing. Every performance in this film is flawless. Mark Whalberg is amazing, i didn't know he was that good. Jack Nicholson is the top of his game. Yes he is always amazing but in this film i think he is extra wonderful.The scene where he is talking about smelling a rat is stunning. I could go on and on but as i said there is not a bad performance in this movie. Now let us talk about the genius that is Martin Scorsese. Now i am a little biased on the judging of directing because i think Scorsese is brilliant but, if you don't already agree with me, see this film and i am sure you will. The film is stunning. This has to be Scorsese's year at the Oscars or something is up. The writing of the film is brilliant. You must see it to believe it. You will not be able to predict a move in the movie, especially the ending. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great piece of art.
8.0~Great, but brutally exhausting to watch bobbobwhite Sign in Permalink With his films, Scorcese usually tests our guts, stamina and tolerance for pain. With The Departed he even exceeds his previous unbroken records in all of these areas. This is the most powerful film I have seen in ages, but is hard to get to the end without feeling emotionally wrung out from watching his graphic depiction of human venal excess. The extreme violence, profanity, evil, treachery and power addiction wore me out by the end but also made me remember that various forms of these abominable human behaviors do exist in real life and are not exclusive to the criminal world but occur in regular society and the business world as well. The film story has been outlined by others, so it is my interest here to discuss the philosophy behind making it. Was it made just for profit, or did it have other agendas? It is MHO that with Scorsese, any possible harm to our children and adult sensibilities from watching his films always comes in last compared to the quality of the story told, no matter how tough the subject, from Mean Streets to Taxi Driver and Goodfellas to here. All were degraded and mean societal bottom feeder stories, but were dramatized versions of real life that some people live on some level every day. All of his films show the grittiest and harshest aspects of the tortuous underbelly of our modern "civilization" that cause cruel things to happen in some people's lives and not just to the lowest underclass. Most of us don't know that and Scorsese knows we don't know that so he does his best to show it to us in a way that forever shocks and assaults us as much as Tarantino, Kubrick, or Peckinpah ever did, and maybe more so. And, to do so is very profitable for him as we eat it up, violent wild animals that we are. And, I am very sure that his degrading depictions of our progressively more violent "culture" don't help us improve socially as it is becoming more and more commonplace to see violent degradation everywhere and not just in films(but especially IN films), and Scorsese is only too willing to dramatically show us the reprehensible behavior in our culture that some of us commit on each other for personal gain without thought for the consequences to all mankind in the end. Maybe Scorsese is doing his part to force some form of social change by rubbing our noses in human behavioral filth. As a counterpoint though, how many of us think the violence such as that shown in Scorsese's films is worse than or not as bad for our society as the severe and life-ruining emotional and financial damage to millions of people's retirement as done by Enron, WorldCom, etc.? Hmmmmm. Finally, I have to admit that I am drawn to his films like a moth to a flame and I can't say that I like that about me, but it is true that Scorsese's work holds an uncomfortable and almost addictive attraction for me and many others. Maybe it's like smoking, drinking or drugs done to excess...all of us know these are bad for us, but some of us just can't help using them even though we know all too well the brutal consequences. We just continue to say, "Someday I'm going to stop." Sure we will.
5.0~Wow, was that disappointing calloused_viewer Sign in Permalink First off, when I heard the Rolling Stones song that was also played in Goodfellas playing in The Departed, I knew we were not going to be seeing a film with too much of its own merit. It makes it weak enough in the first place that it is based on a Hong Kong film. Here's my other complaints with the film: - Why is William taking painkillers? So, he drinks cranberry juice (like a woman on her period? I'm a woman, and I've never heard of that. Perhaps it is something they do in backwoods Boston?). Oh, and he drinks cranberry juice, not alcohol, so we are to believe that he would be OK then with popping Oxycontin or sleep meds? Hmmm... Oh, but then later, we see him guzzling from a bottle of wine. Uh, when did that start? Please, if you're going to make a point about a character's character, be consistent. Why does the shrink go to coffee with William? Even Kelly McGillis' character in Top Gun had a REASON for having dinner with Tom Cruise's character: she wanted to hear about the Mig. So, we are to believe the shrink goes to coffee with William, because, uh, because he's Irish and impervious to psychoanalysis, so she wants to be the first shrink to crack an Irishman? - And how did William find out where she lives? He just shows up there, comments on her photo, then they go at it? - What was up with Sullivan's reaction to the shrink's photo anyway? I never figured that out. Besides the fact that when she was a child, it is doubtful that she would have been wearing a helmet when riding a bike. The photo was a little anachronistic frankly. Finally, why didn't the shrink open the letter William gave her? And why did Dingham kill Sullivan (nice booties, Marky Mark!) like that? Wouldn't it have been better to take him down, defame him, strip him of everything, and put him in prison where policemen are not treated no nicely? As the shrink said, death is easy, but life is hard. But this movie didn't follow its own wisdom anyway as Costello said that it was always the women that bring the crooks down, and the shrink had nothing to do with the takedown. I could go on with a few other pet peeves I had (did anyone else think that Jack was slipping into his Joker character there for a few scenes there? And what an inconsistent Boston accent he had!). But it just suffices to say, it is a dry season indeed when an eyedropper of a film creates a tidal wave of awards. "Evuh dance wit' thuh devil in thuh pale moonlight?" - Joker with Boston accent
6.0~Slick and entertaining but no masterpiece cwarne_uk Sign in Permalink "Infernal Affairs" was a fun to watch but totally implausible thriller. It's no surprise that Martin Scorsese's remake is the same. The running time passes smoothly and it never jars in the way that so many Scorsese films do. After you've watched it though the questions start to pile up. The story is basically totally unbelievable and would work much better with a camper approach - John Woo achieved this with "Face/Off", a much more entertaining film, mostly due to inspired casting of Travolta and Cage, two actors who can make the best of ridiculousness. Here instead we get DiCaprio seemingly taking it all very seriously and Matt Damon being as dull as he is as Jason Bourne. On the plus side Scorsese remains a technical wizard, a wizardry though seemingly divorced from any insight or guiding intelligence, to the point that he seems to fail to notice the pulp nature of the material here.
1.0~Terriblle. Scocese should have hung up his gloves after Raging Bull alexdeleonfilm Sign in Permalink Wed. October 17, 2006, At the very first Rome film festival. Wirld Premiere of Martin Scicese's "The Departed" Ahoy Tom -- Yessiree -- Life is pretty sweet here in Rome and I'm glad you asked about Scorcese and whether this is his great comeback after a string of turkeys. Well, the simple answer is: NO --this is not the great comeback for Scorcese -- in fact it's a regression even further back into obvious crass commercialism than was "Aviator", which was pretty damn regressive, not to mention a pile of horse manure. To start with, both Nicholson AND Dicaprio were Seriously miscast -- The best role in the whole film is Mark Wahlberg --(fast becoming my favorite Hollywood actor) -- who should get a Purple Heart for having to give his all in the company of these phoney stars who walk away with all the credit --as if there was anything creditable to speak of -- while he actually keeps this monstrosity afloat whenever he's on. The interview following the press screening was FAR more interesting than the film itself, which I found hard to actually sit out and squirm through. For one thing, too much rapid artsy intercutting between the parallel stories of how Dicaprio and Damon infiltrate the police department and The Mob, respectively. The whole shebang was far too intricate for a Boston based gangsta Story and shoulda "stayed in bed", which is to say, in Hong Kong, where it started out -- and where it belongs. An exercise in glossy bullshit all around --(nobody can accuse Scorcese of not making Good- Looking, high-GLOSS films -- even if there's no 'there' there otherwise...) and also -- according to Scorcese in the following Press Con, an exercise in "experimentation". Well, maybe that was the problem -- It's so Experimental that it falls apart in every other scene without ever getting it together anywhere in between. The only thing that makes it more or less tolerable are the very good supporting roles by Alec Baldwin (always good), Wahlberg (always superb), and Martin Sheen (always interesting, especially now with white hair), but there is one key supporting role that is pathetically bad --the police psychiatrist, played by an unknown (and unappealing) actress by the name of Vera Farmiga. For Christ Sake -- Whoopy Goldberg would have done a much better job! This gal must be a friend of the family -- in fact the whole film feels to me like an expensive home movie made by Scorcese for and with his family and friends. The bottom Line? P. U. -- "The Departed" is plain putrid. Glad you asked. By the way the Italian press and public both lapped it but then, they were filtering it through Italian subtitles -- which made it gain things that weren't there -- or shall we say, were "FOUND IN TRANSLATION -- Coppola that with the simple fact that neither Scorcese nor Dicaprio can possibly do Any Wrong here in Italy -- even if they ate spaghetti with chopsticks -- and you've got another smash hit here for Marty boy. Given the obvious star power of the main cast and the advance (paid-off?) hype to the effect that Marty is "back in stride doing his gangster stuff", I would be hesitant to predict that this awful picture will go under in America, but somebody watching the parade just hasta come out and say it --when the king ain't wearing a single goddamn stitch! As for the main roles, it's maybe not so much that Jack Nicholson was miscast as an Irish Maffia don, but rather that he's gotten to be such a gigantic Ham that all he ever does anymore is imitate himself as the Devil in "The Witches of Salem", or play an old creep on constant viagra overdose. To my mind, he's had an interesting career, but it's time for him to stay in bed --for good! Nevertheless, because of some sort of star-inertia principle (a moving Hollywood Box Office Force tends to keep moving in a straight line as long as money can be drained out of it), his face and name still sell tickets at the B.O. Viggo Mortensen would have been more credible in the role. As for Leonardo -- well, to see the way he beats the crap out of all kinds of heavy thugs in this pic, with the greatest of ease, you'd hafta think he was the baddest ass who ever lived. A bare-knuckled Billy The Kid, when actually we all know he's a frail, sensitive, loving chap who wouldn't hurt a fly -- be cause he doesn't have the strength to! This all has about the same credibility level as a tubercular looking Montgomery Clift knocking John Wayne for a loop in "Red River". Matt Damon, the third big name in the cast, is acceptable since he's not called on to do anything but what he always does best -- a grown up hoodlum with a working-class Boston accent who wishes he could have made it to Harvard. Hate to disappoint you, pal, but let me know what you think when you get to see it -- and just remember: Never trust a film critic! --
1.0~Movies script is made up of continual cursing. bob1998 Sign in Permalink Why does Hollywood continue to believe that people in this day and time need to hear cursing in movies that goes way out of line. The entire script was centered around who could use the F word the most in one sentence. I believe that the writer must believe that in order to be a "real" man that you have to curse. The truth is that a person who has to curse to try and prove himself lacks the character and integrity to be a "real" man. Don't try and say that the characters in the movie are talking like cops in the real world do. I am a police officer and have been for over 35 years and have never heard anyone use the f word like it was used in this movie. The Massachusetts State Police hopefully are in a uproar over the way they are portrayed in this movie. It makes them look like a bunch of uneducated dunces that can only prove themselves to each other by cursing. Stay away from this movie.
8.0~Scorsese gangster movie with a "twist" utalkintome42 Sign in Permalink Great movie which unbelievably gets worse from about half way through all the way to it's unsatisfactory conclusion. It's so close to being a classic but a series of bumbling mistakes contribute to it's downfall. Flawless acting, very good but not perfect direction and okay editing are here to be seen when all should be of the same standard coming from these people. The romantic triangle is preposterous when it could have been acceptable as a professional relationship and a separate romantic one and it never really serves the story any purpose but the tying up of the story is where it's classic status is strangled. The individuals outcomes are fine but the manner in which they end there are nowhere near the way they should have been. If Mexican stand offs weren't so overused.....However, recommended viewing none the less as it is captivating even as the story heads downhill, perhaps a compliment very few movies in history can boast. The possibility of Oscars will not be the main reason you will want to watch this again but I suspect this will get better and worse with repeated viewings.
2.0~This movie is the NY Yankees of 2006 hareltm Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese plays the role of George Steinbrener, putting out a new movie and sparing no expense in the hopes that the sheer line-up of names will keep us glued to our seats. Nicholson, Damon, DiCaprio, Sheen, Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin for heavens sake. All together amount to nothing more than a silly farce. Ridiculous dialogue and senseless violence which was poorly placed and showed. No character had any depth to speak of and poor Jack Nicholson as Mob boss? I don't think so. Jack was and always will be a solo act. His tirades are embarrassing to watch as they are forced and unnatural. What's the matter? Was DeNiro unavailable? Or maybe he just read the script and said - Pass.. The end is expected and senseless. Everybody dies, good bad, whatever. It makes so much sense how everybody in the movie communicates with cell phones and text messages. You want to tell me that the police cant figure that out? Has technology regressed so much that mob boss cell phones are not tapped? I'm sure that the good folks at Sprint would help if asked nicely. The funny part is that in one scene, the police is very proud of the cellphone surveillance they have, as Matt Damon's Cajones shrivel up. He talks to his mob friend once a day, from the office no less, texts him freely. What the hell is this? Where is the sophistication? Where is the Drama? Matt Damons fiancée sleeps with Dicaprio but nothing is made of it? How stupid. Who scripted this thing? Mark Wahlberg should have that guy shot because it made him look like an idiot more than anyone else in the movie. So, why a score of 2 instead of 1 you ask? Vera Farmiga. I can sit around for hours just watching her.
1.0~Bad acting, non-existent character development, confusing plot. dioditto Sign in Permalink First of all, I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen. I usually like Scorsese's movie, but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness. My first problem with The Departed is the casting. They got a bunch of baby-face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window. It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers - None of them look like cops - more like boy scouts. Secondly, the acting, is just wooden. There is no subtlety in the acting, and they try to cover that up by over-acting, and constant swearing. (Perhaps it is to make them look more "mature" for their part.) Now, about the plot, it is pretty thin, and confusing at times, lacks clarity or resolve. The several scenes made me cringe, particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio, it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN!! Now, about Matt Damon's acting in this movie, it is pretty god damn bad. In fact, what acting!!?? Matt Damon just doesn't emote at all!! He is as souless and as wooden as a robot. It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist! Leonardo's acting is more of his usual self, pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him - but in this movie, he seems particularly out of place. The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi-dimensional. Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self. Totally uninspiring acting. Same goes with Martin Sheen's super stiff acting. Anthony Anderson is totally mis-casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief (and yet there is nothing comic about it) The character development and inter-character dynamics are almost non-existent between the two rivaling characters (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon) it is as if they are in two separate movies. The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as "mafia" - loud mouth constantly swearing goons - it is both extremely cliché and uninteresting. The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction, it lacks focus, and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting.
10.0~scorsese's winner tanelteder Sign in Permalink The Departed offers you one of the best stories of mafia. Certainly the best combination of mob and police in the same movie. There are many good mafia films but this one sticks out because of its great usage of police. The value of this movie does not shrink to the fact that the film is mostly a remake to the Hongkong movie. The value is based how this one has been done. I gotta tell you, it's pretty damn high. And the reason behind that is Martin Scorsese. He absolutely nails this film. He, like Francis Ford Coppola, has a special eye for a mob films. And quite simply, this is his finest product. Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy) is one the best actors around. He is always so good. Never seen him underperformed. He gives a great shot here too. Jack Nicholson (Frank) is always reliable. Matt Damon (Colin) was good. But Mark Wahlberg (Dignam) was most impressive. Quite a performance from him. Very confident. In overall, it's just a first-class cast. The Departed is perfect film for a movie night. It's intense, has plenty of action, great story and great performances. Plus there are two huge bonuses. First one - the movie comes about Boston which is a great city. Second one - the movie has an awesome soundtrack which many films do not have. It has everything a winner should have.
10.0~Awesome! jdkraus Sign in Permalink Okay, I'm not a huge Scorsese fan and entered the theater having possible thoughts that this film was another cop and criminals film. It is a cop and criminals film, but done in a very rare feat of movie-making that blew me away! The film is based off of a previous film made in China that explores both sides of the law through the eyes of two men. both of them are moles who are in deep, seeking out information for the other. Billy Costigan (Leo Dicaprio) plays a hot-headed cop who hasn't graduated the academy yet. he is assigned to go undercover as a henchmen for a ruthless gangster named Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello has a mole inside the police department, Det. Sullivan (Matton Damon) who is ambitious and who worked his way quickly through the department to get a high position in the police force. As the story progresses, both sides of the law learn they're being watched and leads to a very violent and shocking conclusion. The acting was top-notched and believable. I'm not much of a Leo fan, but he was flat out excellent and deserves some recognition in the Oscars. Nicholson was pretty much himself with his charm, wicked humor, and psychotic facial expressions. i don't need to mention the rest of the cast, for they were all equally as great, despite the fact that Alec Baldwin stole the show a bit. the story was in-depth and ad a lot of character development, as well as twist and turns and occasional plot holes that were meant to be. The film-making was excellent, especially with the use of old rock'n'roll music such as Pinkfloud and the Rolling stones, the editing was tastefully done, as well as the cinematography, and the pace of the film flew by, feeling like a ninety minute movie versus a two and a half hour film! Despite all of this, I have to say that this film is not for everyone. especially for those who are squeamish to blood, for there is plenty of graphic blood spray, which never really bothers me, but made me gasp and say "Oh my GoD!" in a few scenes, and there was boat load of swearing that was as bad, if not worse than Bad Boys II. nonetheless, I loved this film, and I think it is the best film of the year, and as well as Scorsese's best film. It was awesome. It had offbeat, and sick humor, action, acting, story, fast-paced, and above all shock value. there is no doubt that this film should get some Oscars! **** out of **** If you are a Scorsese film (which I now am because of this film), and can handle a great deal of violence and swearing, it's for you!
1.0~Disappointing q-00234 Sign in Permalink It had so many stars and famous director, yet it was boring and annoying with too many F words. Plus, Matt Damon tried too hard to act his character, but he still failed to interpret such a complicated and paradoxical character(or only paradoxical in the original version, for in The Departed I did not find much paradox and struggling which should exist). I guess people should let Damon continue to play roles who need to be saved. That'd be much better.
6.0~A Film that was So Close and Yet so Far from Perfection. tcweyers35 Sign in Permalink The only reason I gave this movie a 6 is because of three people. The first two are Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin. They are entertaining, fun, and terrific. Their acting in this film is worth half the price of admission. The other half comes from Leonardo DiCaprio. I truly believe that he is the greatest actor of the last two decades. Morgan Freeman and Russell Crowe give him a run, but he takes the award. He is perfect in this movie. I have to spoil it here by saying that the moment he is eliminated from the film, it is over. The whole thing goes downhill. Scorsese is a great director, and he is great for two hours and fifteen minutes of this film. It is solely the ending that ruins this movie. It is almost as if he quit directing and just said F it and shoot everybody in the head...boom, over, role credits. There are so many things left unanswered in this film. I remember looking over at my brother at the two hour mark and saying, "Wow, this is fantastic." And at the end of the film I looked at him and said, "This is going to upset me the rest of the night." This had all the makings of being the best film I have ever seen, and the ending seriously ruined it. I don't blame Scorsese completely, I truly believe this is the direct relation to horrible screen writing. I could go on forever about how this ending ruined a great movie, but I will focus on the positives. The main positive is Leonardo. I can't stress enough that he is the real deal and deserves a statue soon. He won't get it for this, but I believe he will at some point. Also, the female lead in this..Vera Farmiga...is beautiful and fun to watch, but her character was filled with holes. She is unexplored and yet she is suppose to be important. She is left with an unopened envelope from DiCaprio's character and a baby that we don't know who the father is. Not to mention, she is week at her profession for all the education credits she seems to have. Like I said, I don't understand how such a great movie can have so many holes and a horrible ending. I am not an expert and this is just my opinion, but I hope the DVD releases an alternate ending that explains some things. I would spend the money on the Director's Cut just to find out. We can all hope.
10.0~Another Martin Scorsese Masterpiece! robbywix Sign in Permalink This isn't just another action film... This isn't just another mob movie..... This isn't just another magnificent cast.. This isn't just another 2 and 1/2 hour movie... This isn't just another Oscar stealer... This isn't just another Leonardo movie.... This isn't just another insane Nicholson part... This isn't just another heart-pounding thriller.... This isn't just another movie to not see with mommy... This is all of these things packaged together into a slice of movie history... Nicholson gets crazier and more powerful as time goes by, and in this movie he sure doesn't disappoint. Mark Wahlberg is truly a BAMF. Leonardo is, without a doubt, a gift from God to all movie fans out there. Matt Damon has grown and molded into a more complete actor and has the rising skills to be one of the elite in the future. The world is a sick and twisted place and no one understands that better than Martin Scorsese....
10.0~Simply put: Incredible epwishy02 Sign in Permalink All that needs to be said about this movie is that it tops scarface, good fellas, boon-dock saints, and blow. movies that I thought were once not again attainable because of the way writers write now days. Normally movies now days are all special effects or just acting with a descent script. This movie's special effects are right where they need to be and NOTHING looks fake or over the top, the acting is nothing short of perfect, the directing WILL win for best directing, the writing is actually really good writing, and the movie; probably at the top with the best movies ever made. One thing that I really like about this movie is that I was never bored. From the first second of the movie i was interested and wanted to see more. One thing that I didn't like, was that it ended. I was hoping that it was going to be longer than the 2.5 hours it already is.
8.0~Good, but very violent and bloody... and long av-35 Sign in Permalink Amazing cast. The acting was great. I thought the movie was too long. Almost 3 hours... ( well that includes previews, so not quite that long) I don't usually go to see "gangster, mafia type" movies, because of the violence, but the reviews were so good, and I like movies with lots of twists. Heavy swearing and tons of bloody stuff with some real gore. I loved Leonardo DiCaprio in this, he was excellent. The "girlfriend" situation could of been so much more, and I was disappointed the way that turned out. Can't say much else without giving things away, and I don't want to to do that. I will say, it wasn't the ending the I guessed.
5.0~Bloated competence - stick to the original hornestar Sign in Permalink Idiots often say this: "Oh, yes, it's very good for Hollywood I suppose, but not a patch on the Uruguayan original." Well smack me in the face and call me an idiot, 'cos the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou) is aeons better than the Scorsese-directed, all-star Hollywood remake. The original was 100 minutes long and so taught you could probably play it like banjo strings. Several of the scenes were filmed with such artistry that they set a new standard in beautifully realised intensity. The plotting was tight, the acting pitch-perfect, and you really felt for the protagonists. It was, in short, the best cops and robbers thriller anyone had seen in years. So of course it had to be remade. Enter Scorsese, Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Sheen, Baldwin et al. What results is bloated competence. The set-pieces from Infernal Affairs remain, but are slacker and less well-handled. People in the cinema were laughing where they should have been clutching their heart to keep it in their chest. The precision camera-work gives way to run-of-the-mill shots. Consider the sloppy execution of the rooftop fall. The film is considerably longer without any real cause (bar, perhaps, Nicholson's hammy imperative to overplay any role he takes on). Witness the affair storyline, which is an unnecessary sop to the need for a more prominent female role, or the FBI addition, which is completely superfluous. The end result is simply a lot weaker than the tightly-budgeted, tightly-edited, subtler original. The only improvement  and I shudder to say this  is Alec Baldwin's role as the wise-cracking police captain, which made me chuckle on many occasions. Get the original out instead. Please. You won't regret it.
3.0~Depart before this movie starts. Galagonya Sign in Permalink Jack Nicholson is a real good villain, period. As for the story - it starts off as extremely intriguing, a brick here, a brick there, great acting, and still, in the end, which is blatant and potty, you feel there has been much ado about nothing. Everybody shooting everybody for various reasons is a possible finish-off, no doubt. But then why take the efforts to build up a fantastic background in the style of the best Mafia movies so far and then end in a shooting scene which is not original, not exciting, not interesting, not comprehensible, and does not follow logically from the plot. I think there could have been a lot more to this story but they have either ran out of time or money or patience or their common sense. It is regrettable, since the build-up of the characters is so extraordinarily good and it all goes down the drain at the end of the day.
1.0~Not as good as original. jimmyhatts Sign in Permalink Although this version has it's strong points. It isn't as complicated and an interesting story as Infernal Affairs. This movie did very little to match it's predecessor. On Infernal Affairs you learn about the character's past and more of how they are one small part in a much bigger picture. In The Departed, it's mostly one step in the story to the next, characters mostly remained static, which resulted in a much less enjoyful experience. Notable performances by Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo Dicaprio. Go see this movie, but be sure to check out Infernal Affairs. You'll notice a lot that was left out.
1.0~The Departed--and not a minute too soon. bruce.evans Sign in Permalink This is a terrible movie. It's two and a half hours of obscenities instead of script, violence instead of acting and Jack Nicholson playing who else but Jack Nicholson. I'm sure a lot of people will say all this was necessary to give the grittiness to the movie. It isn't; think of the great gangster movies of the thirties, forties and fifties. Bogart and the lot never said any more than, "darn" and most violence was implied rather than cataloged. It's no wonder society is running out of control when this type of sick movie wins an Oscar. Bruce
4.0~Not as bad or as good as advertised papafain Sign in Permalink I have not seen Infernal Affairs, so can make no comparisons. The Departed is far from Scorsese's best work. The actors are uniformly good, including the minor characters. Ultimately, I could really see no point to the movie. It is much too long, padded by scenes which are unnecessary to the story-line and are just distracting. I was attracted to the plot. A cop undercover in the mob is old news and a cop who is on the take is also, but both in the same story is good stuff. Unfortunately, there is no character who is sufficiently in focus. The scene where Costigan is trailing Sullivan does not show anyone else dressed the way they are and so when Sullivan kills the wrong guy (dressed in ball cap and hooded sweat) it is not only a cliché but no surprise. The only criticism I have of the acting is the constant and annoying way the actors' accents vary, frequently within the same scene. I have never been in Boston (but really like Dennis Lehane's books) but do fancy high-rise apartments really have rats running across the balconies? Saying this movie is great because it won the Oscar is not meaningful: in my opinion this is not the best movie of 2006, or any other year.
5.0~Not even Nicholson saves this one. Jerique Sign in Permalink The storyline is quite confusing on paper, but when you watch you can catch on quickly. Basically Costigan (DiCaprio) is not cut out to be a cop so SIU decide to put him as undercover and follow around Costello (Nicholson). Costello's right hand man, Sullivan (Damon), is in SIU as well. Costello finds out that he's got a rat in his outfit (DiCaprio) and Costigan finds out that SIU has a rat too (Damon). Vera Farmiga plays the shrink that is dating Damon's character but having an affair with DiCaprio's. The acting - surprisingly good for the most part. They all try to play Boston accents but fail. I think DiCaprio is trying Irish accent but once again, DiCaprio forgets he sucks at accents. The first two hours of the movie, they build up the confrontation and reveal of the rats. Thirty minutes left and we are about to finally witness Damon and DiCaprio meeting. Oops, never mind! DiCaprio runs. Damon figures out Nicholson is an FBI Informant and kills him! Don't worry the body count continues. In fact, nearly everyone dies. This guy kills that guy, that guy kills the other guy and then the one last guy you haven't seen for thirty minutes kills the remaining guy. The last thirty minutes made me question: "why did I watch this?" and "what was the point of this movie?". You don't write 10 characters and kill every single one of them off at the end. Anyone who said, "yeah, looks good" doubt yourself now. Don't get hooked in by Nicholson's status. There is no comedy - none. The accents get very annoying early on and it tries to be a cop movie but it doesn't really feel like one. Not to mention F bombs average every sentence and it's more than annoying, its unbearable. Don't rent this, rent something else. I think you'll want your 150 minutes back if you watch this. Luckily, I got the DVD from my uncle so I didn't pay a cent to see this film. Pass on it.
1.0~much to violent tormen Sign in Permalink Hi there. If you like to see exploding heads go and see this movie. I went to this movie because I like the actors and wanted to see a good thriller. Yes I got a thriller, but with so much focus on bullets fired and their targets hit, that I could not enjoy it. I find such violence in movies completely unnecessary. If you want to see real violence you can watch the news or travel to Uganda. But in cinema I want to be entertained and not to be tortured by watching the execution of I don't know how many people. And the suspense of a good thriller does not need open violence.
6.0~Good, but not as good as original. BenjaminPalmer Sign in Permalink Simple. Infernal Affairs(the film that this was adapted from) does a better job executing the story in 90 minutes then this does in 150. The screenwriters/adapters(which i believe Paul haggis might be involved) felt that inserting the word "f-u-c-k" about 750 times provided realism. In fact all it did was make the dialog more ridiculous. Infernal affairs stuck to its through-lines, whereas in this film the through-lines are more like short outbursts that are supposed to make you go "ohhhhh i got it now". Do not get me wrong, Jack, Leo, and Mark have exquisite performances. But Andy Lau's performance in Infernal Affairs blows Matt Damon's out of the water. The adaptation to Boston is good, the performances are good, the direction is good, but it is not great. And that is what one must look at when rating film.
3.0~Sudden Excess Syndrome FD-a Sign in Permalink This movie is about cell phones, and how some of them, the reely reely cute little ones, keep working when they have blood splashed on them. It is getting near the end-of-career where Scorsese may only have a very few remaining chances to direct or write a film that tells a meaningful and believable story. This was a religious story, a Hole-ee plot with plenty of Miracles. If I was to take this film seriously I would consider it a travelogue, a fair advisement to avoid getting near the core of iniquity and the canker of decay, Boston. BTW - Boston cops wear silly hats. Stop it. It's embarrassing. Will Indiana
7.0~Excellent fantasy mfsor Sign in Permalink Of course fantasy. You don't kill off that many state cops. If you did, the FBI would take over the whole state, or at least the whole state police operation. Even just the first one could get you that. DiCaprio was much better than Matt Damon, had a much greater range of emotion. He's clearly an actor with much greater depth. Jack Nicholson was his usual terrific scene, and in one of 'em, screwed up his face to talk about a rat and got half the audience laughing because Nicholson reinstated disbelief when he got too vintage Nicholsonian. And the text messaging all over the place? You got to be kidding. And that old standby was there: the video camera didn't work. Several other things that add up to fantasy, not a crime story.
10.0~A gripping and unique crime drama about the duality of undercover work kilroythenomad Sign in Permalink I got to see a sneak preview of it, and I must say: the BEST film of the year so far. Scorcese is at his best and truly deserves his anticipated first Oscar for this film. Also notable are the performances of Matt Damon (such a great "bad-guy;" he really must do stuff like this more often), Leo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson (as always), and Mark Wahlberg (best since Rockstar). However, some in the theater with me who had seen Infernal Affairs did say that Departed did not live up to the original. I have yet to see Affairs, but I honestly believe that Departed was pulled off well enough to really bring in some respectable awards in the upcoming season.
3.0~Right award, wrong movie! EdExtract Sign in Permalink No film buffs or Scorsese fans are going to take my word for it, but here goes a warning I need to get off my chest: THE DEPARTED is a wretched way to slowly waste 2.5 hours of your life. We get Marty's little auteur flourishes, all of which we've seen repeatedly since GOODFELLAS, sprinkled heavily over the blandest spaghetti bowl of a plot. The actors don't lack for talent, but here they seem to have been directed to give flashy soliloquies and never actually interact with each other. The film is like a whole series of audition readings, where each actor is reading his part alone on a stage. There can't be much chemistry if each chemical is kept in its own test tube! Jack reprises his Joker role, except here he was encouraged to ham it up a little more. That said, he's the only aspect of this train wreck that kept me from giving the film one star instead of three. (Sorry, Mr. Nicholson; it wasn't your fault.) Sure, sneer at me because Marty won the BD Oscar. I can only conclude that 2006 was a year weak enough to console him for being robbed when he made GOODFELLAS, a great film that he has been remaking over and over. But this version stinks, and its success at the Academy Awards just means we will get loads of copycats who think this is what they should be chasing. OK, now go ahead and waste your time watching it.
2.0~some good performances, but full of problems claudecat Sign in Permalink I know no one is going to read this, but this move irritated me so much that I have to blow off steam. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was completely disappointed by the inadequate screenplay, the distracting casting, and Scorsese's weak choices. The story is full of holes. A very few examples: a big deal is made about a letter which is then forgotten, and characters do things that don't make sense (would you warn a known murderer that you're on to him, and then agree to meet him in a deserted warehouse? Why not just go to his superior with all your evidence?). The character of Madolyn (why the bizarre spelling?) was completely frustrating. As usual for a big American film, there are dozens of featured male characters and only one woman (other than a few minor roles), so she has to serve as the love interest for both of the main actors. Yet nothing comes of this "love triangle", so why include it? Supposedly Madolyn was really happy with Colin, yet she has sex with Billy who, inexplicably, seems to know no other women. Rather than deepening my feelings about the characters, this situation just puzzled me, and made me think that Madolyn was a pretty bad psychologist. Actually, I got the impression Scorsese was hedging his bets with the Madolyn character--she adds so little to the plot that she could easily have been cut. There are some good performances in the movie, particularly Jack Nicholson's and Martin Sheen's, but I felt that Scorsese cast people he likes and not necessarily actors who were right for the roles. Obviously, Mark Wahlberg's performance has its fans, but he didn't convince me at all as a foul-mouthed tough guy, with his baby-face and floppy hair. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good acting job, but he's too physically slight to be really believable as a gang strongarm. Martin Sheen was the only one who managed to disappear into his part. (Though I didn't believe for a second that a no-nonsense guy like Queenan, as Sheen played him, would have stood for all that lip from Dignam.) There are some bits that really made me wonder about Scorsese's own beliefs. Both the gang characters and the police make sexist remarks, which they probably would in real life, but the women around them don't get any lines to respond, so the comments are left to stand. Scorsese seems to be on the side of Billy when he beats a guy senseless for saying that his drink is girly, as if that were the only appropriate response to such an insult. Possibly that's not what Scorsese meant at all--he may have just been trying to show how far Billy would go to play his assigned role--but what are we to make of the fact that an Asian man is accidentally killed in the course of the story, and then never mentioned again, as if the murder doesn't "count"? Racism? Or did Scorsese forget about that, the way he forgot about the letter? I've read a lot on IMDb about how much of the movie was lifted from "Infernal Affairs". I haven't seen that film, but I was appalled to see how Scorsese ripped off a famous scene in "The Third Man". (At the funeral.) He also apparently paid "homage" to Howard Hawks by stealing his use of "X's" from "Scarface". (I didn't notice that myself, but several people on IMDb have mentioned it.) I think someone needs to teach Scorsese the difference between affectionately referencing someone else's work, and just taking from it because you haven't thought of anything as good yourself. I'm really angry at him for making sure that now, whenever I see that powerful scene in "The Third Man", I'm going to think of a movie that I mainly disliked. And what was the deal with that ridiculous last shot of the rat? How could a supposedly great filmmaker give in to such an obvious, heavyhanded choice? I think Scorsese has it in him to make a better film.
8.0~Mega Cast worth the wait EricBosarge Sign in Permalink This movie rocks. The story and cast are really well done. Not rushing the plot was great. The length of the movie is necessary to get the job done and it is worth it. It has been to long since Martin Sheen has been on the big screen and he makes a nice re-intro with this movie. As alway, Damon, DiCaprio, and Wahlberg are so worth watching. Why has Damon not gotten his Oscar(for acting) yet? The man can go anywhere with a character and this is not let down. DiCaprio is in the same league. The man can go make a character all his own. This movie definitely worth a peek. The only reason I did not mention Nicholson is because well.............he is Jack and that says it all.
8.0~One of Scorcese' Finest Films!!!! the_pooge Sign in Permalink Wellwhat can I say about the latest film from Martin Scorsese? Is it a prestigious thriller/drama film up their with the likes of The Godfather, Goodfellas and Reservoir Dogs? Or is it a flop, a flimsy lifeless film which lacks the depth and perception that most crime/thriller films happily entail? From what I have seen from this film, The Departed is Definitely NOT the latter of the two. I could start with the acting, but I think I'll leave that till a bit later. The first feature of the film that struck me significantly was the setting of a modern day Boston. Scorcese has succeeded in depicting such an underrated city in its dark and sinister form. If there were another definition for the words 'realism' and 'effect', the backdrop of Boston in The Departed would certainly be featured. Each scene is strikingly detailed down to the point of even adding effect to a fly on the wall. The backdrop of the meeting place for Costello's (Nicholson) gang in addition to the Massachusetts State Police Headquarters fits in appropriately with the overall theme that the film is expressing to its viewers. In order to make a good film, fine actors must be featured in it. I have already selected at least three of the cast members who should vie to win, or at least be nominated for, an Oscar for next year. For Best Actor, Jack Nicholson's portrayal of powerful kingpin Frank Costello is nothing short of exceptional. Nicholson succumbs to his trademark smirk and charisma that is strongly evident in many films that he has had the honor of starring in. The Departed shows that Nicholson has not lost his talent with his old age. Costello, with all his power and influence over his gang in Inner Boston, is a pivotal character in the film, endeavoring to use his power to his advantage. My second choice for Best Supporting Actor would normally be very difficult to choose for this film. Both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio have certainly seized their chosen roles and have presented them in convincing awe. If I could only choose one, it would have to be DiCaprio's portrayal of undercover cop Frank Costigan. A live wire in the police who dropped out of the Academy, he is rectified of his prison sentence and wrongdoing and is recruited to go undercover to investigate and weasel out Costello and his henchman. Costigan himself is a confused and unstable man who's vast presence on screen involves compassion and resilience for his aura. Scorcese has really revived DiCaprio's career through his recent films and he is heading back up the food chain of the hostile and unwelcoming list of current great Hollywood actors. The third and final person who is worth a Nomination is Vera Farmiga who played Dr. Madolyn Madden, Sargent Colin Sullivan's (Damon) girlfriend and shrink who serves Costigan during his stint as an undercover cop. Farmiga strongly portrays the female lead in a style that portrays her unawareness of the situation that is being faced in the film. She is a pivotal character in the plot of the film and her presence on screen is somewhat invigorating. She deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at a minimum. With the utterly convincing plot and setting, the superb acting by such an ensemble cast, and the superb twist at the end, all describe the sheer excellence that The Departed contains. The only problem I had with the film was its length. At 151 minutes, you just wished at times that the film would come to its fantastic and long awaited end. This deserves to be Film of the Year and I'm being very generous in giving it a high rating.
10.0~This, ladies and gentlemen, is film-making. airros17 Sign in Permalink While one cannot forget the classics such as Goodfellas, and obviously not the Godfathers or the Untouchables, one also has to look forward into a new age of film-making. Scorsese does an excellent...no...brilliant job of combining to two; bringing the classic feel of the past and the powerful feel of the present together in this magnificent piece of work. This film is a pearl among swine, standing head and shoulders over mind-killers like School for Scoundrels or 40 Year Old Virgin. My hope for the theater was nearly gone forever before this film. The facts? Gorgeous thoughtful cinematography pieced together by flawless editing and topped off with a brilliantly placed soundtrack. The dialog is fluid and hilarious, the plot is a winding staircase (the ones where you don't know what is around the corner), the characters are large as well the actors playing them.... This, ladies and gentlemen, is film-making.
7.0~Thrilling Ride cougarfan-bridger Sign in Permalink In The Departed, Martin Scorsese makes his return to the mob underworld, and he does it with a thrilling intensity that overshadows his previous films. From the start, to the closing credits, The Departed is an incredibly exciting film, and there is rarely a slow moment. Unlike GoodFellas and Casino, the characters were written in a way that makes the viewer relate to them in a very personal way. Their trials and struggles make them very human, and I found myself very emotionally involved, hoping for the best for the major characters. Speaking of characters, give credit to the acting cast for filling the roles emotionally and intensely. DiCaprio and Damon were excellent in the lead roles, but Baldwin and Wahlberg were an absolute joy to watch as supporting characters. While the writing was intense, I sometimes felt that the plot had no central point, and it seemed to go on and on without resolve. It is sure to keep the audience guessing, but at times this was frustrating and I wanted to know more that wasn't being given to me. The finale, while intense to say the least, didn't fill all the holes created throughout the film, and is sure to leave many questions with viewers. I would go as far to say the acting is some of the best I've seen though, and if you're a classic Scorsese fan, this is definitely a movie well worth your time.
10.0~Haunting... namashi_1 Sign in Permalink A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a haunting film, so effective, that I still have a hang-over of it. Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood, back-stabbing and cruel intelligence. For those who haven't seen this box office smash yet, take time out from other non-sense, and watch this! This Masterstroke takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis "Frank" Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out. The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke! And this is a true and best remake possible! Scorsese has made so many remarkable films, that I've lost count by now. He's at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease. A True Legend! His biggest accomplishment was, that, He was finally respected by the Academy-Awards for his work here! Halleujah! Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is eye-catching. William Monahan's adapted screenplay is marvelous. In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance. The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi-starrier. Nicholson, as always, is flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, he lives his character from start to end. Matt Damon is amazing. Martin Sheen proves yet again he's a talent that we'll never forget. He's exceptional. Alec Baldwin is in command after a long. The veteran scores! Vera Farmiga is perfect. Ray Winstone does full justice to his part. Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well. 'The Departed' is a winner all the way! The film keeps you at grip from start to end, and will leave you thinking about it for a long, long time. It's amongst the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!
9.0~My favorite film of the year! Da_Playboi Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese's newest film, "The Departed," will be sure to take audiences on a thrill ride they won't soon forget. The film has a great ensemble cast that's headed by: Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan), Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), and Jack Nicholson (Frank Costello). "The Departed" is a character driven piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film follows an undercover cop, DiCaprio, as he attempts to infiltrate a deadly mob ring lead by Nicholson. Not to be out done by the police, Nicholson installs a rat of his own (Damon) to keep him abreast on police activity. The movie evolves into a cat and mouse tale like no other, with each side trying to determine who's the rat. For Scorsese fan they will be delighted to see that the man has not lost his touch. The films brilliant editing and camera work will make sure that your viewing experience will not be a dull one. Along with, the film comes with a great soundtrack, invocative of the streets of Boston. Great dialogue, directing, and performances make "The Departed" a must see film. Action, drama, comedy, this movie has it all. After seeing "The Departed" I cannot wait to see it again, and I encourage everyone to go see for themselves.
2.0~lots of killing .. hellokeith51 Sign in Permalink Oh how we are drawn to movies about people who do bad things. And no doubt those involved with this movie will receive countless awards for making it, as though they've given us something that made our day better. They use the F word about a thousand times(not that there's anything wrong with that). Ha! Albeit, the awards will be for such things as story continuity, structure, editing. Stuff like that. And great 'acting' too. While overlooking the subject matter. Makes no sense to me. Better someone hand out awards to the Iraqi terrorists for entertaining the world so well. The movie was indeed exciting & thrilling, and I couldn't stop watching the DVD rental once I started... was compelled to see if the 'good guys' survived. But it certainly didn't leave me feeling 'better'. Doesn't make me feel better to be reminded of how bad & despicable grown men can be. I won't be recommending it to my friends or family.
10.0~Yes, yes, Infernal Affairs... jerocrowe Sign in Permalink Yes, it is a remake of Infernal Affairs, and yes, it is much longer and not as tense. But even with the same plot (and many of the same scenes, done very similarly), The Departed explores the thematic underpinnings of its plot more strongly. What Scorsese does here is take Infernal Affairs and play it to his strengths, which is the characters. The plot drives Infernal Affairs forward, and the characters are very well developed and their identity crises understood. The difference between Infernal Affairs and The Departed, though, is that it dwells on the characters and their relationships much more. The movie could be cut down significantly, but Scorsese didn't make this movie to make a quick and easy remake of Infernal Affairs. Thematically, Scorsese has always made movies about men trying to find their role in their world. That theme is central in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas... Even his "No Direction Home" Bob Dylan doc. The plot of Infernal Affairs is the springboard to this theme. This is not a movie about two moles trying to outsmart each other; it is about several characters trying to come to terms with lives that are essentially lies. Of course, the cop and the crook are rats. But the mob boss is an FBI informant, the psychiatrist/girlfriend had sex with the cop and the crook (and who knows who's the father of her baby). The focus on these other characters (and others - the subject of lying comes up a number of times in the film) makes this one different from Infernal Affairs. The technical aspects are all excellent, as should be expected from Scorsese. The acting is great, though I can't tell if my discomfort from the Boston accents is because of the other actors being in other movies without them or because I grew up outside of Boston, around the real deal. However, again, this movie is given its own identity through the setting and the differences that Scorsese outlines compared to the movie it's based on. Infernal Affairs is a great HK thriller, straight and to the point. It's artful and tells the story better, but The Departed wants to work on more levels, and for the most part succeeds in drawing the attention away from the plot and the two cops on onto the myriad of characters, their similarities all on the surface.
10.0~Better than "Goodfellas" Scorsese's best film. creepyhoodedboy Sign in Permalink I realize saying Martin Scorsese's best film is a very bold statement, considering his film history, but i still believe it to be true. Although movies like "Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas" are classics, and very very well made films, "The Departed" was incredible. From the amazing cast, to the perfect soundtrack, awesome editing, this movie had it all. I feel as if people value movies sometimes only upon there value to the industry, thats why people say "It's no Goodfellas" i believe it is! It could be i grew up about an hour away from Boston haha, but it's tremendous none the less. I suggest this film to any Scorsese fan, or any one looking to see one of the greatest films this year,great action, great suspense, great drama, sprinkled with comedy the whole way through. Spend the $9 bucks, get popcorn, haha enjoy this to the fullest, you won't regret it
1.0~Stupid Ignorant Garbage babasarah Sign in Permalink I love the director for some of his former movies however this was one of the dumbest movies I have seen. In reality people that have to use such derogatory language to such an extent do so because they do not have the education and/or intelligence to express themselves properly. This movie did not have any redeeming characters that a person could empathize with. No one's death made me sad, not one character had any depth. The story was convoluted and ridiculous. The only reason I watched the whole thing through was because we were with friends and we both mistakenly thought the other couple were enjoying it. When it was over we looked at each other and shook our heads and felt cheated for having spent any money to view it. Dumb dumb dumb. After seeing it win the Oscars I can only concur with another person that commented, that Scorsese won the sympathy vote and everyone else is caught up in the wave. Sad that such wonderfully talented actors were subjected to such drivel.
1.0~Departed is example of what's wrong with movies pajeme1956-1 Sign in Permalink Bad, bad, bad. All that big named talent and they were terrible -- sleepwalking through a horrible script that was never ending in its repetitiveness. Poorly directed -- it was like a junior college student's idea for a movie. It needed to be 30 minutes shorter. Hasn't this movie been done before -- and done better? This is clearly a movie that was done by committee -- and not a committee of people who love movies. I still maintain we will never see Matt Damon in a love scene with a woman. Reason: he's not a good enough actor to play a heterosexual leading man. It would be too much of a stretch for him. I want my money back.
8.0~Fantastic movie.. brilliant Scorsese .. nataliabyers Sign in Permalink I can say that i saw very entertaining movie after a long time. Best film of the year so far i would say. Scorcese is just awesome, Also adorable are the performances of Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson. The sex scene were bad, also there are too many actors in the movie which demanding the face time which unnecessarily drags the movie. I feel like The departed is just a remake of Infernal Affair. The story is really good and the direction by Martin Scorsese, the film is deep and well layered. I didn't like the way movie ended, ending was really bad. However it's a brilliant movie for a movie night. It's full of action, great story, awesome direction and of-course the acting is top notch. One thing is i like is that the sound track is also good which other action movie don't have usually. It has everything which a good movie should have.
7.0~Not as good as Hong Kong blockbuster "Mou gaan dou" YouMiss Sign in Permalink I would not say too much on the performance of each characters because they did a good and honorable job. Especially Jack, he is back on the stage now, and I am watching him. But allow me to say that, this one is really not as good as the hong kong original drama "Mou gaan dou"! The director, to be praised that he himself had understood the theme that "Mou gaan dou" created and he really did researched a lot about that. But, if the 80% of the scene is a completely copy from the original, it won't be a success. Despite a lot from the social, cultural difference, the connection between people will also be a great issue taken consideration of the gap midst eastern and western country. For instance, when you translate a Chinese literature into English, you can not just refer to the meaning of each individual word; you ought to fully understand the whole meaning of the article as well as those underlying meanings that the author tend to being it to you. I am a Chinese by the way, and I can read most of the information that the director wants to express dramatically to us. On the other hand, I stay aboard for a long time I can also comprehend all the meanings inside this English movie. But, if you put them together, as me, I found that the director was trying to adhibit his understanding from the original film piece by piece in order to recreate some new western taste "commercial advertise". To be honest, if you considered this new cake as a stand alone, original , classical, thriller; it is fantastic. But, in my situation, I can only give it 7 out of 10 points. Just enjoy the show!
10.0~"...Do you lie?" Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink The Departed is the most entertaining kind of non-stop, intense crime thriller of the year, maybe in the past few years. Some critics have said that it's the best film that director Martin Scorsese has made since Goodfellas. I understand where the compliment comes from, though I slightly resent the subtle criticism in the charge as well, meaning that Scorsese hasn't made a film as great or powerful or entertaining in over fifteen years. I would even go far as saying this is Scorsese's best since, well, Scorsese's last film, or at least since Gangs of New York. Some may forget, or maybe just not really take in, how consistently strong Scorsese's career has been overall, how he keeps on taking chances and still keeping his style so instictually 'cinematic' (he is possibly the biggest "film-geek" ever), so distinctive, and even so fresh in the 21st century, that his is a career akin to the likes of Kurosawa (many masterpieces, and otherwise very good to excellent efforts). The difference though this time from some of his previous outings- and this is perhaps the correlation with Goodfellas besides the obvious of genre linking- is that it's pure, devilish fun, it goes by quickly but supremely satisfyingly over what doesn't really feel like 2 1/2 hours, and it's cast is uniformly good. Leonardo Di Caprio in particular is so impressive here- and this may be the first-viewing-buzz talking, it might be my favorite of all the performances I've seen him in up till now. Under Scorsese these past several years he's kind of grown up more and more from the oddly pubescent look to him even in his 20's. His performance as Costigan is often very ferocious and tough, but he also makes it a fully rounded character, one that he makes very much his own. He has a dark past, almost too dark to even be an informant for the Boston PD. His whole family is messed up, and there were even links to Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). So, what better way then to send Costigan into Costello's wing and see what comes out? Then the flip-side comes with Matt Damon's Colin, who infiltrates the police department in legitimate fashion. Damon's is the flip-side as well in performance quality to Di Caprio; while Di Caprio, even when lying through his teeth, is truthful to the bone and always believable, Damon is pitch perfect as a bold-faced liar, as he never flinches for a moment, even when caught like a deer in the headlights. And the performances end up making a sort of square, with Damon and Di Caprio in their own corners, the bulk of the excellent supporting players (Martin Sheen, Marky-Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga in a breakthrough role) on one, and Jack Nicholson all on his own. That was the first thing about hearing of the Departed that had me psyched, knowing that one of the great stars/actors of the past 40 years was teaming up with someone with a stature and track record like Scorsese's. With Nicholson in the role Frank Costello is at first already a character to feel is the 'man' in the room when he walks in and talks. But as far as performance goes, it's vintage Nicholson all the way, digging into it with the style, vigor, wit, charm, and all that and a bag of shark-grin chips that have made Nicholson so remarkable. His is such a dastardly character that it teeters on becoming self-parody, but both director and actor know how to reel the part in to being someone to fear, while also being someone who's a helluva lot of fun. It's worthy of an Oscar nomination, and not just because it's Nicholson in a movie. As for the director and his crew, they have assembled what could be by the bare essentials nothing more than a genre film with a premise that seems a little cooked-up. But, of course, it is a remake of a trilogy of Hong-Kong police pictures, so that may be why the premise and story feels not completely original, even as it's passing itself off as one. Yet that too didn't detract. If anything, I felt as if Scorsese was doing what very few filmmakers working today- particularly this year if you look at what's come out- don't do, which is to take material, and not just do a simple 'remake', but to do a re imaging, a refashioning, a full-on reinterpretation into the deeper aspects, in this case the morality and sense of loss among all of these characters. There's some religious bits put in, as it IS Scorsese after all, but this time there isn't something like in Mean Streets where it's always there in the background. Here the characters are on, like in Goodfellas, a version of hell, where things all do come to a head; the last thirty minutes had me laughing, cringing, and mouth-agape in equal measures. In other words, go see this film, if you think it might be up your alley, and you think you were burned by Scorsese ever since he left behind modern-time crime pictures ten years ago.
9.0~Martin Scorsese as we like it rbverhoef Sign in Permalink Leonardo DiCaprio shines in Martin Scorsese's new gangster movie 'The Departed'. Mat Dammon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen and especially Mark Wahlberg throw in their talents as well to make this one of the most entertaining films of the year. I would go as far to call this the most entertaining film Scorsese had made since the great 'Goodfellas', although his 'Casino'' came pretty close. This is simply what the man does best, lifting an average story up to greatness. This is not an attack to the original 'Infernal Affairs' on which this film is based on, which was great as well, but the Scorsese magic is seen here in all its glory. The plot circles around two infiltrating people. One of them is an undercover cop named Billy (DiCaprio) who joins the team of a gangster named Frank Costello (Nicholson). The other is one of Costello's man named Colin Sullivan (Damon) who joins the Boston police department. These two young men are trying to discover the identity of the other and at the same keep their own identity covered. Sheen, Baldwin and Wahlberg belong to the Boston police, all playing their part in this complex tale. I say complex, but Scorsese makes sure the audience knows who is who and why they act the way they do. I have said about enough about the plot, which is more fun if you do not know too much. For this film is probably best if 'Infernal Affairs' is not seen either. If you do not have too much problems with the bloodshed we have seen in earlier Scorsese films this is the film for you. Technically brilliant, uncompromising, and arguably the most entertaining film from 2006, from start to finish.
8.0~Violence on a Pedestal eddiez61 Sign in Permalink Gruesome. Its almost disgustingly violent, nearly revolting. Some call it gritty and real, others says it's blood soaked and sensationalistic. I think it's classic Scorcese - brutal yet elegant, visceral yet poignant. It's a grizzly ballet, a macho cinematic dance. The details of the story are well recorded in other commentaries so I'll limit my statement to my other impressions. DiCaprio is a very fine actor, with a remarkable face. His boyish looks are a high bar for him to maneuver in creating a believable tough guy, and he clears this hurdle easily, powerfully. Matt Damon is a natural as a Boston street smart cop. Mark Wahlberg likewise is a perfect fit as a hard nosed detective. Alec Baldwin is a sheer pleasure to watch, just about stealing all his scenes. And Papa Jack is in great form as an aging, haggard bad ass, past his prime but proudly protecting his turf, the King of the Streets. It gets very gory and grim, a lot of guns and blood, not much left to the imagination. Martin Scorcese uses violence like other directors use dance numbers or musical interludes, as accents and punctuations to expertly developed character studies. It's interesting that their viciousness somehow doesn't define them, but rather, these characters are merely colored and completed by their individual brands of brutality. Scorcese, it seems, has little doubt as to Man's innate inclination for violence, but he is just as shocked and awed by it as we are. He has explored this theme many times, inspiring a legion of imitators and fanatics, and once again breaks new ground with a mesmerizing, if not numbing, barrage of testosterone fueled mayhem and bravado. The love story is weak, like most of Scorcese's female roles usually are. That, I think, is what robs him of the Oscar nearly every time. Yeah, I give it eight bullets out of a full magazine of ten.
5.0~What's going on in Hollywood? binladenstrickesback Sign in Permalink Sad... It's so sad... This film, The Departed, has an 8'5. However, Infernal Affairs, the film that was the "inspiration" of this awful remake has just an 8'1... It's really sad finding one of the most amazing and relevant directors of all times, Mr. Scorsese, father of masterpieces like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Raging Bull or Casino, making the remake of an unknown Hong Kong trilogy. What happened? You see DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson and all the other stars and you have a masterpiece? That's not what I thought cinema was. I've seen both versions, in fact I have it on DVD. The Departed is a great movie, that's true. But it's nothing more. I can't understand why Martin changed so many things and he still thought it would be the same story but told in a different words. This is not about Italian Mafia!!! This is about Chinese mafia, and that's not the same!!! Please, everyone who enjoyed The Departed: Take a look on Infernal Affairs. Or ask Tarantino about what he thinks about this remake... The film is OK, but there's no color between The Departed and IA. Salud!
6.0~Should have been better LazySod Sign in Permalink Organized crime, organized crime fighting. Corrupt policemen and undercover agents. They seem to be connected at the hip and this film plays with that from the start to the very last minute of it, telling the tale of the actions of a FBI/police combination fighting to bring a hotshot criminal down. Apparently it is a remake of the Japanese film Mou gaan dou (2002). I have not seen that original but will be on the lookout for it now. The Departed is intense. A tad slow in the beginning and maybe a little too fast in the ending, but I guess keeping a very good balance in a 150 minute film can be a very daunting task. The most of it is rather interesting and builds a tension that runs somewhere until the last 15 minutes of the film - but - that is where it all fails. For me the last 15 minutes of film feel glued to the rest but not really connected to that rest and that more or less breaks the film in half, destroying its quality. All in all. A lot of good looking imagery, good sound track, nice story - until just before the end of it. Cut of 15 minutes and you've got a thrilling good film. 6 out of 10 dirty cops
7.0~Breathless But Bewildering LeonLouisRicci Sign in Permalink This has enough violence and gritty street stuff to be another intriguing descent into the world of crime and punishment for Scorsese and his blend of attractive brutality, but it is vastly overrated. It can be confusing and less than engaging as its myriad of mobsters and cops parade in and out of frame with varying results of believability. The acting and characterizations are all over the place with wide ranges of volume and machismo. One example is that the affairs of the heart here are never founded and come across as less than real. Take the scene in the restaurant. Is that for one minute real with its forced laughter? Or the bedroom/sex scene. It is a movie that seems full of itself rather than full. The complexities are so twisted and run by so fast that its hard to keep up with it all. It could be that the pacing is such to give it that dizzying feeling of being trapped like a rat in the bowels of the beast, but its breathless energy sucks the life out of the story and its just whiz-bang, bang, bang, bang. While not without its attractions of audacious anarchy, and it delivers so much that it is hard not to get involved in the goings-on. But the Director has made many better films and one cannot get the feeling that the adulation for this one is misplaced or in place of past disregards.
6.0~A good movie, but unimpressed. shenkhort Sign in Permalink The Departed is a movie that first-timers to the plot will enjoy most thoroughly. The idea of two sides both having a mole each is most thrilling and I am sure viewers will be most impressed, especially with the line-up of stars in the cast. However, I give this movie a 6 out of 10 as it is a direct copy of a Chinese movie, "Infernal Affairs" (2002). I am not talking about the general plot idea of the film, but rather the entire film sans the very last moment of the film is a direct copy down to Frank breaking the mole's cast to check for wires. Even the elevator scene at the end is almost a complete copy from the movie. I would have rated the movie a lot higher if it didn't copy so much from "Infernal Affairs". The cast-breaking; the bad guy not revealing that he has found out on his deathbed that the gangster is a mole; the elevator scene; the head cop falling from the roof. All of this happens exactly in "Infernal Affairs" (2002). In fact, "Infernal Affairs" was a lot more interesting in terms of how the moles went about communicating with their respective boss' and in this way was a lot more thrilling. "The Departed" (2006) just feels like a copycat, watered-down version of "Infernal Affairs".
9.0~A Must See for Scorsese Fans latraceb Sign in Permalink This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire 2.5 hours with the intense plot and outstanding cast of actors. As much as I expect stellar performances from Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, and others on this cast, I have to say that I did not expect the brilliant performance I saw from Matt Damon in The Departed. I was totally mesmerized by Matt's character from start to finish. He nailed this character to the very core. We didn't see enough of Mark Wahlberg but what we did see was great, of course. And I have to mention Martin Sheen. He had a significant role and did a great job! This movie was so intense that you wouldn't want to leave to take a bathroom break. The Departed is different from the other Mafia style movies from Scorsese but just as good. The Departed is definitely one of Martin Scorsese's best films to date.
3.0~Good but it's being over-rated RMS1949 Sign in Permalink Okay, yes, it's a good movie. Interesting script, loaded with good actors and nicely directed. But I read one reviewers remarks that said to forget "Goodfellows" and "Raging Bull" as this is Martin's finest work. To him I say 2 things (1) put down the pipe (2) step away from the keyboard. Goodfellows is still the definitive Mob movie ( The Godfather being the definitive Mafia film ) and there is no movie ever made that rivals the visual style that Raging Bull brought to the screen. To me The Departed is a movie about corruption. I never felt any sense of organized crime ,it was more like organized chaos. Characters are never developed or made memorable , thats all sacrificed to make more room for showing how intense the movie is suppose to be. Maybe because 2006 was such a lackluster year this will get more praise than its due. I enjoyed it for what it offered and will leave it at that. I think Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were fine but it was Leonardo DiCaprio that gave the best performance. Since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar for Best Director he will probably be given the lead to win it come next Spring. Even though I see nothing here that he hasn't done better in other films.. Once again, its good,,just not as good as it's being touted..
10.0~Departed changed for Colorado? pbpbroncucia Sign in Permalink A brilliant film. Unquestionably his best since Goodfellas. Great Acting and absolutely fantastic dialog. But I have a question. I read a great deal of buzz about the "strap-on" scene. Frank (Nicholson) is getting ready to have sex with two women. He grabs a handful of cocaine tosses it and says to one "don't move until you're numb." The frame wavers a bit and then we have a close up of Jack's face and suddenly a jump cut to DeCaprio on the street. The only seen of the strap on was in the Porn theater which was very unclear and didn't make a lot of sense. My companion and I both felt as though something was missing. He had not heard about the scene before seeing the film and he too felt the disparity. The Scene was discussed at length in the last issue of Rolling Stone interviewing Nicholson. My question is did everyone see the same scene I did or was it; (pardon the pun) longer?
8.0~Hope and Faith is restored in the medium nicolas-biscuit Sign in Permalink Way to go, Marty! (as if I know the man). Aftering seeing a glut of really cruddy films recently (Deja p.u.) I am so happy to have come across this one. Really makes one wonder why Bruckheimer and all this SFX people even go there anymore. Here is a story that runs and works because of character, not because some jackass can blow up a car or CGI some scene out of the ether. Wahlberg and Baldwin are amazing. And let's talk a bit about Ray Winstone -- he really is amazing. Next year, depending on material, could be his break out year. He's something to behold. Let's just hope he doesn't go the way of his fellow country man Gary Oldman (remember when he was astonishingly good?) Highly recommend this film....
6.0~Watch Infernal Affairs notcliched Sign in Permalink I was eager to see how the Americans would remake Infernal Affairs. Based on other American remakes of Asian films, however, my hopes were not high. Even so, I was hoping that I might be pleasantly surprised. I was wrong. Almost everything about The Departed was a direct copy of Infernal Affairs. The plot, which although more drawn out, was pretty much identical. They even stole bits from the original script. Now, this wouldn't be so bad if they'd acknowledged and paid respect to their source, but they had said that this was not a remake of Infernal Affairs, rather, they merely took inspiration from the Hong Kong thriller. Furthermore, none of Martin Scorcese, Jack Nicholson or William Monahan (the screenwriter) had even seen the original. Is it laziness or arrogance? Knowing Hollywood, it's probably both. The film, being a carbon copy of Infernal Affairs, adds pretty much nothing to the original film, but somehow manages to take away instead. The violence often moves to the forefront of the drama and subtracts from the character development. Furthermore, it appears that the ending to this is some kind of hybrid of the original and alternative ending to Infernal Affairs, which unfortunately, negates the whole point of the film. The stupid love triangle involving Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga is pointless and typical Hollywood nonsense that does not add to the tension like it was probably supposed to. Admittedly, the acting on the whole is good. Jack Nicholson is outstanding as the mob boss (a marked improvement on the original, in fact). Matt Damon shines as a mob mole placed inside the police department. His character has also been changed slightly (one of the very few differences between this and the original) and Damon does well to make it work. Leonardo DiCaprio is competent, which is more than can be said about his usual performances, but seems miscast and is outclassed by Tony Leung in Infernal Affairs. On its own, The Departed is not a bad film. Unfortunately, it was preceded by a much better version of the same story, upon which The Departed stubbornly refuses to acknowledge its dependence. All this leads me to summarise this film in three words: Watch Infernal Affairs.
6.0~An honest, concise critique ClearyDealy Sign in Permalink Although this movie is not that bad, it is however, too overrated. The movie spans more than 2 hours, a lot of which are used to re-iterate irrelevant minute details that don't contribute much to character development, plot, or the general theme. The movie is plain in trying to create a complex story which basically is not all that complex..2 simple parts that cocoon the overall story. watch this movie and judge for yourself, but don't follow the general wave that gives this movie excessive credit where it does not deserve it. Think about it from a third party perspective for a minute..Would this movie be as highly acclaimed and rated if it wasn't directed by Martin Scorcese and starred A-list celebs? imagine a normal cast, I'm pretty sure this movie would be in the same rankings as the lethal weapon series.. 5-7 but definitely not top 250.
3.0~" and they all died..." byerlyw Sign in Permalink Perhaps because this is based on a Hong Kong movie, it opened here before the US so we got to see it with about 12 others who paid to see the first showing. I thought the acting of the three main male characters was terrific and I'm sure one or two of them will get Oscar nom. Even Jack Nicholson didn't overdo it. The women's roles were more generic and unexceptional, but that's nothing new. I can see why this would have worked as a Hong Kong movie but I don't think a violent HK shoot em up translated so well to the guilty and remorseful Catholic working class Boston.
1.0~What was he thinking? rck1 Sign in Permalink The acting is good. A great cast: Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg. I especially liked Leonardo DiCaprio! The story is a little hard to follow. But what was Scorsese thinking? In a world filled with violence, terrorism, fears -- how can another movie like this, about gangsters, help? He already made Goodfellas. This is another Goodfellas. Why? I absolutely do not recommend this film, regardless of the high marks the critics are giving it. Go rent the Pirates of Penzance and see something of quality that's fun to watch!
7.0~"The Remake" is what is it. A great movie, however platothelapdog Sign in Permalink Other then the addition of an extra character to the movies script, (that played by Mark Walberg) this movie is in essence the very same plot and story as the movie it was taken from..... Infernal Affairs. That movie too won best picture of the year in it's respected country of China and starred local Chinese stars as well. Now don't let me sway you from this great movie. If you don't like foreign movies then you'll never watch the original and this is all you need to watch for a great thriller. But if you don't mind subtitles the better of the two comes from China. Check it out at : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/ "A story between a mole in the police department and an undercover cop. Their objectives are the same: to find out who is the mole, and who is the cop."
6.0~Oscar worth until... axeman_z Sign in Permalink ...Until that is it turned into a retarded Jerry Springer episode. I mean, through the entire move the plot was excellent, the acting superb, the movie just breath-takingly good until the last 20 minutes or so. Then, for no really apparent reason, it turned into a Loony Tons episode and like six people get killed. Now mind you, throughout the entire movie we only see one or two deaths, and it is a long movie, and several other deaths were implied. But in the end, it turns into a three ring circus with people just getting shot in the head for no apparent reason. I understand this movie was based on a book but come on, take a little creative liberty with it like most directors do with good source material. Now let me say some positive things about the movie. The cast was stellar, all involved parties gave one of their best or their best performances ever. And this next comment goes to all the haters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, I have been telling you all for years that their acting skills were awesome and this movie proves it. Shame on some of you for not liking some of their early works. In the end, this movie goes from excellent dark, sometimes funny thriller, to just plain silly. This is one movie I would recommend seeing at theaters only if you are a die hard fan of the director. and love horrible endings that last for nearly a half an hour. For anybody else thats more intelligent, wait for the DVD your friend buys then borrow it or rent it from Netflix and form your own opinion as you will be very upset after having sat through that entire great movie for such a crappy ending.
10.0~The Departed Should be win teniente91 Sign in Permalink The Departed, as get rated for the critics like the best picture of the year, and the academy as rated to Babel, like the best picture of the year, and i have to admit that i start to saying that The Departed was better and all that, and i isn't seen the movie, but i seen Babel a few of months ago and i'm, ready to said that i totally agree of my opinions before of seen the movie, and i gone to tell why. First the movie was EXCELLENT, i get f*cking surprised after of seen them, the direction was for much the best thing in all the movie, for much as excellent, a few of takes as so excellent make it, really Scorsese you are my hero once again you leave me f*cking surprised, and later the screenplay as... f*ck i don't have words to described i'm supporting to Children of Men on the category of Best Adapted Screenplay, but if win's The Departed, i don't mind, as excellent, third the performances... for god saying, more excellent picture can't be, Mark Whalberg make for much of as been rated the best performance of the year, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon, both make that performances that leave you shocked, and don't forget to the legend here... Jack Nicholson... of where pull actors like this, The Departed for much that it's the best picture of the year i'm sad that all of we know that Babel as wins the Oscar on the most important categories of the night (Picture, Director) and any of both awards as deserve the movie, you can said to me ''malinchista'' and i don't said that word in Spanish just for my English were terrible, is also cause all my friends and family as saying me that, i don't f*cking care, i support to the movie as have to win, and i don't be a ''malinchista'' i support to the Mexican directors who deserve the award (Cuaron, Del Toro). Oh god since i start here i don't make a comment like this
2.0~The most over rated movie of 2006 benkarkis Sign in Permalink Scorcese has lost it, between this movie and Gangs of New York and the George Harrison documentary. The movie is way too long, poorly edited, dialogue ugh, I just don't get the hype. Must be the violence. Nobody acts in this movie, it's Nicholoson, Sheen, Baldwin, and Damon being themselves. DiCaprio I give an A for effort. The female psychologist roles is the worst. I couldn't sit through this and I am from Boston. Unless you are a cell phone salesman. This reminds me of Crash all the mainstream media fell in loves with a "Scorcese Gangsta Film" how he can go wrong. The Oscars, the media, the brainwashing.
7.0~Very good until the end badknees59 Sign in Permalink It was great acting by everyone involved until the ending. The ending was too incoherent and left too many unanswered questions for my tastes. I felt let down after expecting so much. My biggest problem was why Billy, knowing he has only one person left on the PD who knows what he's doing and also knowing he can't trust anyone else because of the mole, doesn't find Wahlberg before turning himself in. What did the girl getting pregnant have to do with anything? Why wasn't Damon more upset knowing that the girl heard the CD? What about the letter? Did she give it to Wahlberg? Every other person in the movie was a mole in either the PD or the mob including the mob boss. And when Billy mentions to Damon that the only other person he's talked to has been a police psych and Damon got a strange look on his face I thought that was going to lead to some discovery. Nothing. Too many threads that went nowhere. Good grief. Just try to sort out the cell phones. The more I think about it the less I like it.
6.0~Too many cooks spoil the broth....kick them out of the editing room beattyg Sign in Permalink I was watching 'The Departed' and marvelled at how gorgeous movies can look, sound and be scripted today with imperfections. It doesn't matter why, but it does matter when one of my considered best directors may allow insiders/outsiders have a say or a bit of a fiddle in the editing room, which I think has happened in this instant. Life is compromise. I may be wrong. This is an immediate response after a nights sleep - DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Baldwin, Damon and O'Hara immediately fill the screen with ongoing possibilities. I'd like to think this is because Scorsese let them move. Maybe they do it themselves... Nicholson, Sheen and Winstone et al, all these actors have achieved in their own right, yet increasingly seem to be playing themselves without anyone saying,'excuse me...didn't you do this in your last five to ten movies.....?' Maybe its time directors/actors used their well-honed skills to move on? A braver push and shove! Jack must be mentioned because caricatures are as visible in cinema as they are on the canvas. He's having fun and there is a weary laugh right down to the rat on the railing at the end and I'm not sure if there was an intended tip of the hat to Scarface, but, its not worth a nod as its been done by Pacino excellently.It gets harder to surprise -i'll squash a fly and lick it off my hand or wave an exaggerated artificial penis (ahoy young man) in an underground theatre at my informer, stand in some squalid hole in the wall bar with blood-soaked butcher arms..........It got a bit silly. Jack or his director made it a bit embarrassing. No problem with intelligent violence & sex.......... but less is more.
10.0~These comments are all good. smokey620 Sign in Permalink This was an excellent film. It has a full cast of amazing actors an amazing director and who ever else was involved in this film definitely deserves something for it. This film is a work of art and will be a talked about movie for years to come. The only thing this film needed was a lower rating so other people can see it and agree with how much of a good movie it is. If it had a lower rating then they would have made more money because it was a very big talked about movie so people would recommend it and people would go and see it. So i am going to give this movie a 10 out of 10 because everyone did there job to the best of their abilities if not better and it really paid off. Congratulations to all who was involved in this film.
7.0~Some "Gaffes" are NOT Gaffes martylee13045burlsink342 Sign in Permalink There seem to be a few over zealous "reviewers" who got a BIT confused by this films DELIBERATE non-linear and labyrinthian narrative. The "confusion" over the address where Di Caprio and sheen "renedevous clandestinely"(144 being quoted over a phone as 114)IS DELIBERATE...and is revealed to be a major plot twist MOMENTS LATER IN THE FILM. Likewise, the "gaffe" of our seeing the childhood photo of Vera Farmigia being moved into Matt Damon's apartment only to see it moments later in the film back in HER apartment AS SHE begins to pack TO MOVE TO DAMON's PLACE IS DELIBERATE...and reveals that she has been involved with Damon and Di Caprio SIMULTANEOUSLY (the subtlety may have been an effort to give conviction to what could have been read as a corny "coincidence" (and was called such by many critics...). I suggest a reviewing on DVD...THERE ARE A FEW NITPICKING ANACHRONISMS...but have SOME respect for the director's narrative chops!
10.0~Perfect saintorr Sign in Permalink The perfect ensemble delivering believable dialogue in a marvellously photographed movie. What more can you ask for £6? I was a little nervous going to this film (I still haven't got over Gangs of New York, which IMHO was a shadow of the film it should have been). Could Marty serve up a spectacle that matched the hype? Would he be able to corral the all-star cast while still allowing enough artistic freedom? Would Jack chew every single scene to shreds? The answers to these questions is an unequivocal YES, YES, YES. I loved every minute of it and was wrong-footed more than once by the surprise plot twists. What could have been a very predictable good cop/bad cop movie was lifted to Oscar favourite status by sublime direction and a rich screenplay that will, I'm sure, become every bit as quotable as Goodfellas in the years to come. DiCaprio and Damon are fantastic as the hunters/hunted. DeCaprio has one brilliant scene in particular where the stress of living the undercover life is obvious in his nervous twitches but the Oscar will surely go to Jack Nicholson. He overplays his role to perfection and effortlessly dominates every scene. He plays a perverted psychotic killer who clearly enjoys his job but it's still our Jack and I couldn't help smiling as he revelled in his g(l)ory. Mark Wahlberg also deserves a special mention - haven't seen him do anything half as good as this before. Go and see this film and expect to be entertained.
10.0~Scorsese Departs from the Norm lazyboyholla Sign in Permalink Are you wondering what you should do with your Friday night? Well you have come to the right place to, this movie had it all from bloodshed to romance it told the story in a way that keeps you wanting more. This movie was an amazing, psychological thriller including nonstop action, and a love triangle, that would give most movies a run for their money. The Departed starts out with two Boston Police trainees, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), two very different men on opposite sides of the law. Colin Sullivan is best friends with South Boston's local mob boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), whom he has known since he was a child. However Bill Costigan, whose family has quite the criminal history, is suspected of being a dirty cop due to his family history. In actuality Colin Sullivan is the dirty cop. After Costigan is subjected to interrogation from his boss he finally gives in to the fact that he can never be a cop with his family being a bunch of criminals. His boss offers him the job of infiltrating Costello's gang and finding out the identity of the mole in the police force. At the same time Costigan has fallen in love with Sullivan's girlfriend, the police force's psychiatrist. This movie takes so many twists and turns but it is all worth seeing. But be cautioned this is not a movie to bring young children to, the movie is aptly rated, this movie contains gore, and foul language, therefore it is not for a younger audience. This star studded cast was sure to attract a few moviegoers, but who knew that it would be enough to give the director, Martin Scorsese his highest grossing movie to date. This movie also has a great soundtrack that is sure to attract the older audience, including tracks from the Rolling Stones, and Pink Floyd, but the soundtrack also includes newer tracks by the Dropkick Murphy's, which contributes to the Irish theme in the movie, because the Dropkick Murphy's are known for incorporating Irish undertones in their music. Overall this movie is quite amazing, it is the best movie I have seen in a very long time. This movie deserves a 10 stars out of 10 because of its originality and its amazing acting.
1.0~Scorsese's Worst? jax713 Sign in Permalink Yeah, Scorsese should have an Oscar or two on his fireplace mantle, but surely not for this. The testosterone-fueled screenplay is boringly predictable, the hollow dialog is just a bunch of rants strung together, and the plot is treated so superficially as to be an insult to our intelligence. The sub-plots are the inventions of a fool with no imagination. In total, the story is unadulterated drivel, not even worthy of B-movie status. Without the fantastic cast assembled for this film, and without Scorsese's masterful hand to erect a visually exciting film experience, The Departed would have ended up going straight to video. Maybe it should have anyway. In terms of film history, it's a dirty shame Scorsese got his statuette for this shallow piece of nonsense.
10.0~Excellent Film! ElmStreetsLastBrat Sign in Permalink 2006's The Departed is an excellent film. I'm not normally a fan of gangster films and really had no intention of seeing this film. But my mom was dying to see it and so I watched it with her. And I'm a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and seeing that Jack Nicholson was playing a mob boss I knew that it had to be a good film. And I was pleasantly surprised. It was worth the rental price at Blockbuster. Jack Nicholson plays mob boss Frank Costello, who's mole, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, is a cop who has just been promoted to a detective. But the police academy has no idea that he's Costello's mole. Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan, a recent graduate of the academy who has been hired to infiltrate the mob and bring Costello down. Mark Wahlberg is Dignam, a tough-talking cop who is working on the Costello case. His partner is Queenan, played by Martin Sheen. The plot gets a little complicated when all these characters cross paths in their attempts to catch Costello but it also is an exhilarating thrill to see who will find out who's the mole and who's the fake. This film kept me on the edge of my seat. There was so much tension that it was almost unbearable. The violence was a little graphic and anyone who doesn't like blood or doesn't like to see a lot of blood will feel a little uneasy watching this film. And anyone who doesn't like a lot of swearing and curse words will also feel uneasy. But The Departed wasn't just about blood and profanity. It gave you a look inside the mob and how ruthless and vile they can be. It showed you what can happen when secrets are revealed and when other people's trusts are broken. The most exciting scene for me was when Matt Damon found out that Leonardo DiCaprio was the one who was bringing down the mob and when Leo found out that Matt was the mole. Leo called Queenan's cell phone and Matt answered! That was such a tense moment and my whole family who was watching with me gasped. When I had rented this film the guy at Blockbuster told me that the ending was unbelievable. And boy was he right! **SPOILERS!!!** Matt Damon comes home and when he opens his door he stops and is in shock. Mark Wahlberg, the cop, is standing there and he raises his gun and shoots Matt Damon dead. Then the film is over. And in a couple of scenes before that Leo had slept with Matt's girlfriend. And Leo gave her an envelope that said "if something happens to me, open it". And then Leo is killed by one of Costello's men. We see her open the envelope but never know what it said. So after the film ended my family and I are all wondering what was said in the envelope and then it came to us. Of course Leo knew that Matt was Costello's mole. So in the envelope he told her about Matt's real identity and that she should let Mark Wahlberg know and do something about it. So that's why Mark Wahlberg killed Matt so he would no longer be a part of the mob and be a threat to anyone. And we thought that was clever. An interesting little plot twist! :) I thought all the actors were top notch. Jack Nicholson never disappoints. He was his usual badass self and you knew something bad was gonna happen whenever he was on screen. Matt Damon was basically his usual self that he is in all his films. But he was good. Martin Sheen was great and I was very shocked to see him die. Mark Wahlberg was his usual badass cursing self too, and even though he did get an Oscar nomination, I didn't see what was so special about his performance that earned him that recognition. The real recognition should've gone to Leonardo DiCaprio!! To me his performance was the best in this film. He was basically the only likable character and he was good and you felt bad for him when you saw all these horrible things that were happening to him. And I was really disappointed when he met his demise. That was totally uncalled for!! I didn't see why he had to die. There were no weak performances in this film and I think that's what made it so great. And Martin Scorsese's direction was top notch too. He deserved that Oscar. And I'm glad this film won Best Picture too. It is an excellent film and I'm glad I saw it. It's definitely one I'd like to own. This is film making at its best! Thank you for reading my review! :) :) :)
10.0~Impressive... fearfulofspiders Sign in Permalink Crime is my least favorite of all the genres. I tend to find myself not liking any of the characters because of the amount I despise crime in all its shapes. However, I l-o-v-e The Departed. This is a sophisticated and very involving story. From the screenplay to the music, the execution is outstanding, and Marting Scorsese deserves the Academy Award he got. The screenplay by Monahan is very good. The dialogue is harsh, crisp, and clever. The action is stylish, and the bloodshed is as well. The continuing deception on all sides can make the sturdiest brain ache, making it a film well worth watching a couple more times to understand it better. Leonardo DiCaprio is great in his role, as well as Jack Nicholson, and especially Mark Wahlberg (whom I cheered for at the Academy Awards). A great cast of people, such as, Martin Sheen, Matt Damon, and Ray Winstone. Each of these characters are interesting, complete, and have their own conclusion. Howard Shore has made a "toe-tapping" score for The Departed. The use of the guitar in the majority of the music makes it worth a buy -- probably one of the best scores of the year 2006. Overall, this is a pretty epic crime film. I was enthralled every minute, and hoping for the good guys to win. The ending couldn't have been better, for it was more than I wanted, and left me ultimately satisfied. See this film.
2.0~Mediocre, the original is FAR superior info-4857 Sign in Permalink Scorsese isn't what he used to be and as a Scorsese lover this pains me to say so. He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought 'hmmm. What did I used to do that made me great? I'll just copy that.' It's Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it. The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction. DeCaprio and Damon aren't great but neither are they bad, they just suffice. The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg, who finally ditches the breathless, confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself. Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age. Normally I'd say the same for Jack who's performance in 'As Good As It Gets', was groundbreaking but this time he's just playing The Joker in Batman he's too over the top for such a seriously acted movie. He was also made too nasty, just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility. The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start. Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren't there; The violence was comic book (especially the number of head shots at the end), the film-making is sub-standard. Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy.
6.0~Almost good valadas Sign in Permalink This could be a good film if it weren't for a few loose ends in the development of the story and a couple of strange coincidences made up to maintain the plot in line with the general structure of the script. This said what is left to remark: first of all the superb performance of Jack Nicholson, perhaps one of the best of his career, as Costello the Mafia gang chief. Then the good technical quality of the movie and the excellent acting of the other performers. One word too for the good form of all the violent scenes which are truly made and convincing. In conclusion, a movie that can have you agreeably occupied for about 3 hours without adding any special event to the history of cinema.
10.0~Scorsese Needs His Oscar ... and This is Worthy Barky44 Sign in Permalink "The Departed" -- what an awesome *expletive* movie! Yeah, it's another of those cop vs. bad guy vs. cop movies, but this is probably the best interpretation of that style of film-making that has come out in years, perhaps even decades. It's gritty, and vulgar, and violent, and yes, a bit overacted. But it's fraggin' entertaining, I tell you what! This film has so many great elements. First, and most importantly, it's a great movie to watch. It's very rare for a movie to be entertaining through-and-through, "The Departed" pulls it off. Most movies make me look at my watch several times, as if saying "um, are they getting near the end?" Not "The Departed"! Most of the actors play their characters slightly over-the-top. Matt Damon's vulgar turncoat cop is excruciatingly squeaky-clean. Alec Baldwin's vulgar police captain is excruciatingly by-the-book. Martin Sheen's vulgar police lieutenant is excruciatingly trusting, loyal, and competent. Mark Wahlberg's vulgar sergeant is excruciatingly tough, combative, and vulgar (yeah, I used "vulgar" twice, and for good reason). And Jack, what can one say about Jack? His portrayal as crime lord Frank Costello is both over-the-top and subtle, for he really sells the idea of a powerful crime boss realizing his empire is falling apart. Now normally one would see these exaggerated characters as a negative in films, but in this case it works brilliantly. The film's core is Leonardo DiCaprio's conflicted undercover cop, Billy Costigan. He plays this very straight, and does a great job. What we are seeing is the world through Costigan's eyes, a regular guy's view of the ridiculousness of office politics in crime and law enforcement. When you're an undercover cop, the straight-laced police hierarchy (Baldwin and Sheen) seems comic. When you've overcome a tough childhood, phony toughness (Wahlberg) seems ridiculous. When you've struggled to make it in life, those who've had it easy but act otherwise (Damon) appear pathetic. When you're an honest guy thrown into a world of crime, the paranoia and wrath (Nicholson) seems otherworldly. By having these supporting actors put that bit of "top spin" on their characters, it gives us the viewpoint of the main character. This movie (as also suggested) is quite vulgar. Expletives tossed out at every turn, the petty (and not so petty) bickering and demeaning that fills up this world. This movie is *highly* quotable (something not said about too many movies today). Some of the lines are hysterical! Of course, this is Martin Scorsese, so the film is quite violent. But these comical interchanges between bitter rivals keeps it light, you're not drowning in a sea of blood but are peppered with comedy amongst the carnage. The writing, of course, is really top-notch. This is a clear case where the writing makes the movie. The writers did a great job keeping the plot complex and surprising, yet intimate. The banter between characters is superb. The plot itself is not wholly original, so you may think "I've seen this before." I suggest you pay attention to how the pieces are put together: this is more of a character study than an action film, although there's plenty of the latter. And they did a beautiful job making an ending unlike most films of this genre. You do want to watch it all the way through. I don't know what the qualifications are for an Original Screenplay Oscar, if this fits the rules then these guys should surely be nominated. The soundtrack is also terrific. I don't know who's doing that Irish-ska-punk sound heard at various points, but I'd love get one of their CDs. I would love to see Martin Scorsese get his Oscar. I'm not entirely sure if the Academy will give it to him for "The Departed". Personally, I think it's a great movie, well-crafted, and Oscar-worthy, but I could see how the voters may be put off by the violence, vulgarity, and over-the-top acting by the various leads. However, if the rest of this season is like the season that has already passed, full of uninteresting crapola, "The Departed" should be a shoo-in for at least a nomination. 10 out of 10, a ranking I haven't used for many movies in 2006.

4.0~If this movie is better than Goodfellas, barely maxime-s-laperle Sign in Permalink Man, after seeing this three months ago, i thought to myself that the man is finishing what he came up to do in this world, and this is getting pretty pathetic, because the crap is hitting the fan pretty hard. First off, this could be the most shallow film, he has ever done. The only thing that could come up with a certain sense of depth, is the notion of identity. But the movie itself is a train wreck, it is horribly clichéd of every crime movie on the face of this earth since Scarface by H.Hawks; and it only seems that Scorsese cannot reinvent himself in the noir or the neo-noir genre. Goodfellas was one-thousand times as better than this film, in content and aesthetic. But in the mob genre, Casino is the ultimate leading contender. When you think about Scorsese, you normally think of three indisputable masterpieces : Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Gangs of New York. Man, The Color of Money was way, way better than The Departed. When I watched that movie, it only made me think of the other Clint Eastwood, film that borders the same cinematographic style, Mystic River. And for another turn of events, this Eastwood movie also involves the Boston Irish mob. In the other case, Mystic River, in Eastwood's direction and by the great acting of actors, such as S. Penn and T. Robbins; it makes it all worth while. It always seem that there is a hint a plagiarism, or Scorsese was just uninspired. The only thing that I can really suggest, is to watch all the movies he did in the past, because the man like Coppola, is just losing his touch. And like Coppola, Scorsese doesn't write his scripts anymore, for the shooting script. And the worst part, is that I love Martin Scorsese. I simply love everything that he does, he is an American Luchino Visconti.
4.0~Departed is Never close to being Good. stormrider65 Sign in Permalink Whoever says The Departed is Good, brilliant or Even Purfect is clueless about how a good movie should be. 10 points to prove Departed isn't close to being a 'good' movie. 1) The entire show was unbalanced when Jack Nicholsan allegedly changed his script, on top of the demand for a 'meatier' role. Scorsese was believed to have rewritten the script to suit him, and to make Jack agree in joining the cast. This led to awkward focus on him for the first half of the movie. Totally unncessary and time-wasting. 2) Poor choice of Leo's mentor. A better choice would be Robert DeNiro. Someone tough in appearance, but with an angel's heart. Sheen jus looked too too soft and powerless. 3)This remake took in a few points from 'Infernal II', where Tony Leung's (Leo) character's family history was explained in detail. Leung's dad, in the younger days, was much a baddie than the present Jack (traid gang leader). Thus Jack, when lunching with Leo, said, "your dad/ Uncle would kill me and my family if he saw me sitting here with you." However, what the film didn't do was to show the viewers HOW would Sheen guide Leo into meeting Jack. All the show did was to show Leo beat up a few guys & the next moment viola, Jack was lookin up for Leo, by a short intro from 'Mr. French'. All the intimate, heartfelt exchanges between Leo & his mentor was totally absent. 4) The show was BORING for the first hour, with lots of talking and talking, a couple of fights and 'fuck-you', and that's it. No wit-for-wit, game-for-game' kind of moves that have the 'Infernal Affairs' so famous and 'cutting edge'. It was Only in the last half an hour that the show, borrowed heavily from the original, featured a mental game/ fight between the two male leads. 5) Also, in 'Infernal Affairs II', the feud between Jack's and Sheen's characters was explained. That resulted in a long-time mutual understanding for each other. Here, Jack and Sheen were seen only exchanging superficial talks - "I will get you, Frank." "Get me if you can, Queen." Duh. My choice of Robert DeNiro fits perfectly into a scene: Frank sipping coffee with Queen (DeNiro) at an English café, both chatting casually about their lives and memories, but with an undercurrent running fiercely in the air. Both know exactly what each other thinks and wants, and laid down all their cards on the table, except for their own lead.It would be much enjoyable to see these two tough guys hitting hard on the other. 6) Wahlberg's Dignam wasn't, as someone said, non-existent in the original 'Infernal'. There was a character 'Inspector Cheung', played by Ng Ting Yip in the HK version. A powerful, shoot-from-the-hip kind of cop who stood by Leo's mentor. Dignam was created with some motive, BUT alas, what he did was idiotic: resigned but not contacting Leo? WTF was he thinking? 7) The fact that the show ended with all people dead, well except for Dignam clearly shows that there's no thread for any Part II extension. Just that simple. It's certainly NOT as someone commented, a brilliant move by Scorsese. Geez..some people just like topping Scorsese's head with tall hats and praises foolishly. 8) Someone actually 'revealed' that the scriptwriter deliberately did NOT watch the original Infernal while writing the Departed script, so as not to get too close with it. If this is true, he should be given two bloody knocks on his d!ck-head. Departed went so departed that the whole tension was absent for almost 2/3 of the show. 9) Another commentator said Damon's character Sullivan was empty and deviated from the Infernal's. He was spot-on on this; in Infernal, Andy Lau wanted to be a good guy, right from the beginning. He always had wanted to be Out of the triad and be a good cop, a good man. Thus he killed all who would threaten his position. In Departed, we see Sullivan killing for virtually nothing. Did he feel remorseful? Or guilty? Nooo...a bloody empty soul created by the 'brilliant' Scorsese. 10) The WORST of all: the classic scene of both leads pitting their wits against each other in the infamous two gangs' transaction. In Infernal, Leung (Leo) was using Morse Code (a brilliant move) via an antenna to contact his mentor, while on the other hand Andy (Damon) was to use comp to send out text messages to his boss for notification. There was an info leakage and Leung's mentor made a switch in radio frequency and called for a retreat, but to realise at the last sec that the transaction would be at a beach. Immediately the retreat was again cancelled with full force to head for the beach, whilst the triad boss would call for a disposal of Cocaine. All happened in a breath's time of few mins. This, in comparison to Departed, is two knots higher. Departed's scene of 'no camera' installed for the back-exit was laughable and idiotic.
8.0~Not His Best Film But Still Very Good aaabioy3 Sign in Permalink Although The Departed is very entertaining and his best film since 1995 CASINO, this is one of Scorsese's more detached films. His films for the most part tend to be very personal and character driven. He does character studies on his characters exploring their flaws and weakness. The Departed is one of his few films that are actually plot driven and for the most part he does a fantastic job at it. When you think of all great Scorsese films it is the character that reveals the plot. In terms of guilt and redemption all his film posses this element. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, Goodfellas all this films are character films, and we view life for the most part through the eyes of the protagonist. That besides the way that Scorsese stylize his films is more intriguing. The Departed is very entertaining and that is what film should be. This is commercial Scorsese at his best. Film was definitely geared toward the masses yet Scorsese has definitely left his usual stamp with his visuals. Film is visually stunning and that is partly due to his editor Thelma. Sound track is mediocre, I thought they used the song Gimme Shelter by the Stones too many times, where as when you think of Goodfellas and Casino, the same song was never used twice. Any way I saw it twice in the theatre and I am going to see it again.
10.0~Scorsese's best film????? for the Oscars yes, for me no but.... RainDogJr Sign in Permalink Is difficult to say what is the best film of Marty, in my opinion there are three films: Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Raging Bull, maybe Gangs of NY, Casino and The Departed also, but in my opinion the first three are the best. Well about The Departed: this film is one of my favorite films of the 2006, with a great performance by Dicaprio and by Jack Nicholson and of course a great history about mafia, corruption and cops. I have seen this film like three times and every time i found a lot of news things and i think that is why this film is a masterpiece but for me is not the best of Marty. And of course we have to give some credit to "Infernal Affairs" in which this film was based and that is also a great film. About that this film won the best picture Oscar: for me the prizes are not important, because the art of a movie can't be compared with others, and for me the Oscar or the golden palm or all the other prizes are not important because when a movie is excellent, it is excellent with or without prizes.... but is a shame that a lot of people don't think that because they only see The Departed ( or whatever film) because The Departed won an Oscar. That is a shame but is true that a lot of people only watch film because some others say that is a good film ( like the jury of the Oscars), but well thats my opinion.
10.0~Scorsese is king! adsey69 Sign in Permalink First off let me just say that im pretty biased with Martin Scorsese and crime movies in general, but this is one hell of a ride. Im not going to get into the plot because ill be here all night but ill just tell you why it is so awesome. This is the best cast I've seen at work since heat, with all the a list actors in this you would expect at least one of them to slip up but it just doesn't happen. Matt, Mark, Jack, are at the top of there game but i have to say Leo di caprio takes the cake. He takes you through his emotions like a hurricane and I've seen most of his films and this is his best work. Now to the directing Scorsese takes us back to his crime classics with so much style. From the opening sequence he hits us with one of his fav songs by the stones and then there is no let up with so many excellent scenes that will take this to an instant classic!. One of my favorites involves leo and jack faceing off for about 10 mins and it actually is up there with the restaurant scene in heat. So if you heard all the hype and read the reviews BELIEVE IT. Scorsese's best film since casino period. 10/10
1.0~Shame on Scorsese, watch Infernal Affairs instead. dodrade Sign in Permalink Before I saw the Departed I knew it was a remake of Infernal Affairs, so I expected the basic plot to be the same. What I did not expect was for Scorsese to shamelessly copy Infernal Affairs practically scene for scene, word for word in some places. All Scorsese does is change the title, the setting, the characters names, add 50 superfluous minutes, two unnecessary characters and a cop out ending. Scorsese is a great director and deserved an Oscar long ago, but for him to accept an academy award for this outrageous piece of plagiarism is a disgrace. The really sad thing is that so many people have watched and will watch this thinking its a good original thriller, unaware that they are watching a cheap imitation of a truly great Hong Kong film. So please do yourself a favour and watch Infernal Affairs first, only then will you realise what a sham the Departed really is.
8.0~thumbs up for the director, thumbs down for the writer of the adaptation zhenxiaoguang Sign in Permalink The goodness of the film and the director doesn't need me to emphasize any more. Just want to look down upon the writer of the adaptation screenplay. The movie is recently banned in China, which make me to watch the movie again. Because when the first time I saw it, I was pretty much enjoying the movie as an art, the Chinese government sequence didn't really bother me though, as a Chinese, I felt uncomfortable with it. When I watch it again last night, I was very angry about how they portraited the Chinese government though I can even tolerate the stupidity of the Chinese gangsters. I just don't understand why they took the excellence of the original Chinese story and set up some unnecessary plots to humiliate the Chinese government and Chinese in general. It is a shame and dishonorable. It is just not right.
1.0~Most confusing picture I've ever seen ednsyl Sign in Permalink The opening credits confused me and I remained confused until I saw, "The End", up there on the screen. There was more foul language used than an aircraft carrier of sailors all hitting their thumbs with hammers at the same time. Matt Damon and L. DeCaprio looked so much alike that most of the time I didn't know which mole I was looking at. And Nickolson, one of my favorite actors, should have watched "The Godfather" to learn the ways of a Don. He played it as a soldier, not as a boss. Best Picture Oscar? Now, really, a Razzie maybe. What happened to the lady shrink? She is the only one in the entire production that doesn't get killed. What was in the envelope she had? Who is the hero? Everyone was the villain. Alec Baldwin's lines were much clearer on his tape of the conversation with his daughter than his lines in this turkey. How many gallons of blood were used, a tanker truck perhaps. Just a rotten waste of time. Is there any way to retract the Oscar?
8.0~Dynamic, Brutal Thriller teh_mode Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese swaps the mean streets of New York for the green streets of Boston in this electro-charged double-double agent crime thriller. At his disposal are his most starry cast ever, among them Leonardo DiCaprio as the hapless cop Billy Costigan forced into the violent underbelly of Boston's crime family. The yin to his yang is Matt Damon who's character, Colin Sullivan, develops mob ties as a lad, then honours those loyalties by becoming a trooper in the state police, giving Costello influence on the inside. As the story unfolds, Costigan and Sullivan become aware of the nature of each other, and must dig each other out before the other one does, or before getting found out. Among the supporting players are Martin Sheen as the stern but caring police chief Queenan, and Mark Wahlberg, who steals every scene his in as a foul-mouthed, though as nails cop working along side Queenan and Costigan against Costello. Whilst the movie is based on the outstanding Hong Kong thriller "Infernal Affairs" The Departed is very much "un film de Martin Scorsese". Many of the basic plot strands in Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's film are present in The Departed, such as the famous silent 30 second phone call, but very seldom do you get any feeling of déjà vu. One such tweak is the role of the mob boss, a important but austere figure in the Hong Kong film, is transformed into a towering inferno in the form of Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Here he is the bulk of much of the film's power and emotion, guiding both our protagonists as they attempt to bring their factions down from the inside. Nicholson is almost unavoidably "Jack" these days. Even when he is playing the psychotic, misogynistic, blood loving Irish mob boss Frank Costello, Nicholson instils him with his evil screen presence, effortlessly charming the audience as well as repulsing them. At times his scenery munching threatens to imbalance the gritty tone of the movie, but just as the seemingly inevitable arching of those infamous eyebrows begins to tease us, we are kept ashore by our faithful director. Not even "Jack" can steal a Scorsese film. This is Martin Scorsese's first pure genre outing since his reworking of Cape Fear (1991). Whilst I wasn't a huge fan of that particular film, here he succeeds by not limiting himself by the material. Yes this is a genre movie, but that 1970s Scorsese potency perfumes itself throughout, through trademark snazzy editing, a barnstorming rock soundtrack and lots of gratuitous violence. The characters are multi-layered; Matt Damon's mafia ties are at one point complicated by his new found love life. Leonardo DiCaprio is honourable as a cop, but has enough violent tendencies, and drug dependence to throw his good guy image into a mist. The original film was all about entering a layer of hell of getting your real identity confused with your pretense. Whilst this film doesn't quite achieve the depth on top of the style that the original did, and nor does it compete with the heavyweight contenders of Scorsese's yesteryears, such as Mean Streets or Goodfellas, it is never-the-less one of the most electrifying movies I have seen this year. This is, in no small part, due to the wonderful cast, from the poster boys to the equally starry supporting players like Alec Baldwin as a crack police chief, and Ray Winstone who exuberates his nasty, gruff henchman persona with panache despite his Boston-Irish accent seemingly floating in and out of his native cockney at free will. This isn't quite vintage Scorsese, but with Scorsese being the genius he is, its still a dandy.
1.0~awful movie crystalburneau Sign in Permalink what can u say about the movie. thats good? it sucked all around the lady getting pregnant not knowing who the dad was the letter was never opened. the end had no point or meaning the movie had no beginning no end to it. it was all over the place wouldn't see it again if someone paid me too. the scene at end with everyone dieing had no point and having everyone scream what the beep. very bad acting from all cast the only one that brought the charter to life was jack Nicholson. rest were bad parts and bad acting. this movie shows you why Leo is not in any movies lately i give it 1 star i would give zero but not an option. please wait till it comes for rent to see it don't waste money on it. it a long never ending story with lines like that the movie could go on longer and better if the planed it right.
10.0~One of the best, maybe not his best bvzl-1 Sign in Permalink Both The Aviator and Gangs of New York left me with a bad taste into my mouth at the end, this movie is simply what I thought about the end. After that, superb direction with many scenes Marty left to the second unit and you can notice that. Really good actors,Di Caprio can face Big Jack Nicholson very well. Good surprise Vera Farmiga, really in her foot in the role. Simply fantastic the direction. The fights scenes and the Opera one, masterpieces inside the masterpiece. Really good all the actors and usual great editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. Ready to be beaten by usual Clint? Sounds always like a joke to me. This is the best living director, he plays the World Series all alone, how can he lose? IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIE YET DON'T READ WHAT FOLLOWS HERE. THIS IS NOT A SPOILER, BUT A LITTLE SCRIPT REVEALING. Since I'm European I noticed a little "americanization" in this script. You cannot like Matt Damon as you could like his counterpart in Infernal Affairs, but that's a little thing, they were all good. Every character is well defined, it doesn't leave space to imagination. You know what they are. A little change from the original one. The had more "heart" then in this movie. By the way, this is The Departed, not Infernal Affairs.
9.0~Far from departed for America's modern movie master NateW Sign in Permalink For over two decades, Martin Scorsese captured the essence of the modern mafia and street-wise tough guys so distinctly and vividly that the very idea of anyone else trying to so seemed infeasible. With Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino, Scorsese molded ugly, violent and unrepentant criminals into captivating and even likable characters that are impossible to forget. After going off the beaten path with past efforts Gangs of New York and The Aviator, the man most people (myseslf included) to be our greatest living filmmaker has returned to his roots with The Departed. Simply put, it's the best film of 2006, if not the last several years. From the first words, there's no mistake that Marty has crafted another masterpiece like only he can. Obscenely crackling dialogue, in-your-face blood and brutality and a soundtrack that hits all the right notes are only a few of the familiar fingerprints left in the reels by Mr. Scorsese. It's funny, it's startling, and it's spectacular. How good is it? This could very well be the work that finally gets Marty the Oscar gold that he should've gotten a few times by now. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see if that happens, but it takes much less time to see that The Departed is a masterpiece of film-making from a director who has made a living out of creating them.
3.0~what is this mess? paulvanwinkle Sign in Permalink I'd have seen this film regardless of the reviews. Scorcese has directed some of the most significant, dramatic and best-told stories of our time, and with Nicholson, Damon, DeCaprio, Baldwin, Sheen, Walberg and the rest, it at least had a solid chance to be a tour de force. It's a mess, though, dragged down to lousy by a screenplay written by the same misguided pen of that disaster-bore-embarrassment "Kingdom Of Heaven". Bad or no structure can't be saved by over-cranking the ragefest volume. It's hard to say why Marty needs to wallow in even deeper pools of perpetual manic violence and blood at this point in his career. Maybe he still just likes it. Maybe he's feeling like we need to take some people out. Maybe the only way he could punctuate and hold together this cluster was with regular, loud, brain blasting, because if it weren't for the continuous bang-bang-blast, in-your-face-insults and face-punch scenes the story would've resembled a garbage pile. An interesting plot line was strung together by an amateur, though fortunately you've got watchable actors, some wry funny lines and a few outrage scenes that pop. The screenplay's choppy, the edits and lighting choices are weird, and the script's incongruent in a bad way. It never builds a tempo. That's Scorcese's fault. It was a great shame to see great actors content with accepting performance mania in lieu of characters. So in spite of all the odd-crazy, there're also huge bald spots. Nobody in this film goes beyond one-dimensionally anger-crazed, with the possible exception of DeCaprio. Still, I couldn't understand how Leo didn't explode during this film; he goes from appearing over-stressed and over-drugged to rage-psycho. I felt possessed to snort Ajax watching his crazed eyes and jaw grinding for 2 hours. I give it a '3' -- there's enough good violence to feel punched up after a numbing week at work.
10.0~Scorcese Is Back Where He Belongs Luke902 Sign in Permalink Last night, I sat in a dark theater, thrilled to see the words, "Warner Bros. Pictures Presents" come onto the screen. I have been a Scorcese fan for as long as I can remember, but this was the first time I had ever witnessed one of his brilliant films on the big screen. For starters, let me say that this is the best film that I have seen this year, and I find it sad that it comes so late. There have been no films that have really blown me away this year, and it's already October. But it was worth the wait. I was blown away by the cast members' performances, especially those of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are fantastic in their roles as Oliver Queenan and Ellerby, respectively. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello the only way Jack Nicholson could play a villain, violent, vulgar and insane. And under Martin Scorcese's direction, he becomes the incarnation of evil. The plot is a basic cops-and-robbers tale that makes itself complex, gripping and amazing all at the same time. Frank Costello (Nicholson) is the one man you don't want to meet if you ever find yourself visiting Boston. He's flashy and dangerous, and keeps all together apparently, as he's never been caught for his illegal activity. And there's reason for that: He has a mole working as a police officer in the State Police (a "Statie" in Boston street slang). The young man who tips Costello off is Colin Sullivan (Damon), who was just a kid when he began working for Costello. Of course, there has to be a good cop. That's where Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) comes in. He has the task of going undercover as a member of Costello's crew. And so begins the intensity of "The Departed." I can not give away any of the plot because it is just too good. Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga also deliver solid performances. Martin Scorcese is back where he belongs directing gangster movies, and it shows: The film is packed with Scorcesean violence, heavy profanity and unbelievabely intense scenes. It's gripping, depressing and beautiful. It's the best film of 2006.
4.0~Overrated William_Britton Sign in Permalink What can I say? It's f..king overrated! And way, way too long... Tedium and confusion set in at times. Don't watch it "cold" as I just did on DVD. Without knowing exactly who was playing who; I certainly lost my way at times. Partly due to cramming so much plot, or what passes for plot, into so little time. Best Picture of the Year? How could it fail to win when up against such heavy-weights as Babel, Little Miss Sunshine, Letters from Iwo Jima and the Queen? And what glorious blood-shed and splatter! Remember the heavy "flack" against that in the Wild Bunch? But that was a great movie. Basically, "The Departed" a B remake of a B plus Chinese film.
1.0~Would not recommend this movie! curtyoo Sign in Permalink Surprisingly ( or maybe not so surprisingly), considering the caliber of the cast, this turned out to be a really "trashy" flick! Although the plot was interesting and the story line seemed to be well written, and, although it was a "star studded" cast, the real "killer" of this movie (unless you're into really vulgar language) was that the "F" word (along with several other vulgarities) must have been used about 500 times by "everyone", male and female alike, all throughout the movie! It made for a very uncomfortable evening, and ended up a big disappointment to say the least! It's baffling why Hollywood thinks it's necessary to include the basest, most vulgar language in their feeble attempts to entertain us when a movie without it would be much more entertaining and acceptable. I'll never go see another Scorcase(?) film.
10.0~Best movie I've seen in 20 years echozdog Sign in Permalink I caught this on DVD last night. The rest of the family was asleep while I sat in living room, slowly moving from chair to chair to get closer to the TV. This movie grabbed me and pulled me in hard. It had everything that I like in a movie. It had suspense, characters (that I care about and ones I hate), unpredictable, twists and a great ending. The movie basically is the story of two police officers coming out of the academy. One was sent there to be a spy for the mob (Damon), the other is recruited right away to be a mole in the mob for the cops DiCaprio). We watch as each reported to there boss's and tries to not get caught. Meanwhile a lot of people die around them (the departed). The suspense in this movie was so high I couldn't stand it. I sit here at work the next day and I'm amazed at how much I'm still thinking about it. The reason the suspense is great is two fold. One you feel like these characters (all of them) are in danger, real danger. Two you don't know what's going to happen next. All this makes for a great ride. I highly recommend this movie unless you don't like mob movies. This is very much a mob movie. 10/10 BTW DiCaprio got robbed for not getting an Oscar nomination. I really don't care for the guy, but he did a hell of a good job. Walberg deserved his nomination. Damon was good but played it a little too cold. Nicholson, Sheen and Baldwin were great stars willing to play their parts to the hilt as supporting actors. If Martin Scorsese had not gotten the Best Director then the Oscars would have lost ALL credibility. Good Day!
7.0~surely not this time! djdejongh Sign in Permalink we were under the impression that this would be Scorceses masterwork, reading the other comments, but after seeing the movie, we couldn't disagree more. It's as if we've seen it all done before and we regret to say, better, much better by far, by Scorcese and others as well. A lot of one-dimensional characters, one-dimensional violence and over the top language. 273 times the word 'fuck' seems a bit overdone. On the other hand, diCaprio portraying a multi-layered character, full of doubts, was an absolute joy to watch. This in contrast to the other leads, which gave a rather charicatural performance. As for as Oscar-night concerned, we would be very surprised to not see diCaprio at least get a nomination, but that's it! There must surely be better performances in the other categories, including film and director.
10.0~Absolutely Amazing paddyluke Sign in Permalink Going into this film i expected it to be really good but i came out thinking so much more. First of all Scorsese did a brilliant job of directing the film. The storyline was fantastic and was really gripping. All the four leading actors did an excellent job, Jack Nicholson obviously nailing the part rather predictably. But the real surprise amazing performance came from Leonardo Di Caprio. He gave the best performance in the film and made Matt Damon look left standing alone even though he gave a good performance. Mark Wahlberg gave a good performance but his was more comical than as dramatic as the others. But he suited the role perfectly i think. If this film doesn't win Best Picture and Director i don't know whats wrong with the world. I think Di Caprio will get a nomination for lead actor and i think Nicholson will get a supporting nomination. All in all the best film of 2006 undoubtedly.
5.0~Matt Damon gets hit in the face many times sbw123 Sign in Permalink This movie had an all-star cast that delivered. Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg delivered some great dead pan lines, Leo DeCaprio was great as a tortured soul, and Jack Nicholson was a fantastic bad guy. But this movie could have under gone some serious editing. Jack Nicholson had a girlfriend that served no purpose, heck, for that matter the love interest of Damon and DeCaprio didn't really serve a purpose either. DeCaprio's love scene served no purpose. There was symbolism with a church at the beginning and end that really wasn't tied into the movie as a whole, and Nicholson's character starts to go mad and we don't really know why, or it isn't show in a fluid manner. I know this movie is a remake - I've never seen the original so that doesn't matter to me. While over all, it was entertaining, the best thing about it was that Matt Damon was hit in the face numerous times. Bottom line, save your money and rent this on video instead of going to the theater.
4.0~Way too hyped - highly flawed jmaycock Sign in Permalink It has been a few weeks since I saw this and I must admit that I don't know what all the hype was about. Okay, DeCaprio gave a very good performance, as did some of the other actors. But and this is a big BUT. What the hell are the 2 main characters doing with the same woman??? What a silly coincidence to put into the movie. Her character was so poorly done that I couldn't even feel sorry for her as danger appeared on the horizon. Then worst of all the scene near the end when Leonardo is killed??? What is going on?? By some character we weren't even introduced to before. What a cheap shot. Practically everybody gets killed by the end in a stupid finish to the film.
1.0~The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen gw2212 Sign in Permalink This is by far the biggest waste of $6.00 I've ever seen. The cast looked amazing, but I don't know how this movie is as bad as it is. The plot was sketchy, the actors had no chemistry at all, and every second I was in the theatre, I was hoping the movie would end. If this movie was based on Whitey Buldger, I'm surprised Buldger's cohorts didn't die of boredom, as half of the movie was about nothing. There was far too much talking and far too little plot, action, or any other good quality a movie can have. Matt Damon and Leonardo DeCaprio look similar, and I couldn't tell who was who most of the time. I don't know what Martin Scorcese was thinking making such a terrible movie, if this does not ruin the careers of all of the actors in it, nothing will. I can't tell you how much I advise you not to waste your money.
3.0~Unfixable ? pratibha2004 Sign in Permalink The editing is off right from the start, in my opinion. We don't know who anybody is or how they got there, only that they're all supposed to be Irish and have a Boston accent. Thelma Schoonmaker can't fix that error in the script. There is no tempo to the film. DiCaprio is good, very good, but you keep wishing the film he were in was equal to his role. The music is literally unoriginal and pointless. Anyone who says this is Marty Scorsese's best film and adds that "welcome back" crap doesn't know what they're saying. He isn't back - he's in deep hibernation. I heard better dialog in M-Squad thirty years ago. Nothing gets personal. Pirates of the Caribbean is a better film. So, be prepared. This is a disappointment except for DiCaprio.
3.0~Yet another grossly inflated piece of directorial and actors' self-indulgence cribyn44 Sign in Permalink So very glad not to have spent money on this film in a cinema, but watched it only on TV. I do wish that some of today's directors and actors would immerse themselves in an intense examination of some of the Hollywood and British movies of the 1940s and 1950s to see how really to make films that are crisp and tight in direction, how the actors of those times were able to speak their lines in clear and understandable English, and that self-indulgent acts (actors) like Jack Nicholson simply were not given the time of day. As for this film, far too much of it was devoted to scene after scene of interminable length, simply so that the director and actors could show off their alleged "skills". That was, instead of the director getting hold of the central storyline - potentially, quite good - and his actors by the scruff of the neck and stating quite clearly: okay, guys, let's really get on with this and concentrate on the core essentials of the story in as tight a manner as possible. Instead, the whole film went on and on in a cumulative exercise of screaming tedium. And, I bet, that you wouldn't see for those old films the interminable list of continuity goofs that accompany the comments on this film on the IMDb entry!
10.0~Marty's back, in fine form. Wiseguy52585 Sign in Permalink After several years of toiling away in good (but not great) historical dramas and biopics, it's fantastic to see Scorcese return to his roots with this gritty, tough, tense gangster flick. And it's almost as if he never left. "The Departed" is a textbook example of how to craft a practically flawless thriller - these guys set the scene early on, and keep ratcheting the tension tighter and tighter, all the way till the end. Scorcese is at the top of his game - his sure-footed direction of his actors and beautifully operatic staging work wonders within the cops-and-mobsters world of the Boston underground. Marty's got good source material here as well. Monahan's script is easily a front-runner for the Oscars this year. His characters are complicated, conflicted, and utterly fascinating. "The Departed" has more twists than a Russian contortionist, and Monahan will keep you guessing, right up until the final minutes of the film. The cast is nothing short of brilliant as well - leads DiCaprio and Damon hit career-high notes in varied but intense performances, and the supporting cast of Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen all take to their characters with relish. And that's saying nothing of the sheer joy that the audience gets watching Jack Nicholson really, really let himself go. Which is saying something. Fast-paced, bloody, tough and demanding, "The Departed" will grab you by the throat and keep squeezing until the credits.
9.0~A few unanswered questions htuttle02-1 Sign in Permalink I may not go as far as to say THE DEPARTED was as good as GoodFellas,but it was damn good, with a strong cast and superb acting. It was rated R for its violence, drugs, and sexual content but quite frankly it seemed to me that the movie was highly edited for time's sake so I think we can likely expect a Director's Cut on DVD with more violence, and OBVIOUSLY a missing wild sex scene involving Jack Nicholson, some blow and 2 women! I would give it a 9, but that being said, I had a few questions regarding who Frank was working for - where the other rat on the police force was all along and how did he know to show up at the elevator scene at the end? And what was in the envelope Costigan gave the shrink - and was it that that ended up in the hands of Dignam who finally got his rat? Regardless, it was worth seeing and I can't wait for the DVD!
6.0~Did Anyone Else Notice the Actor Switch in the Final Scene? danettegomez Sign in Permalink I can't believe that such a great movie would end like that. After Matt Damon falls to the floor and the camera cuts to the rat and then back to the body, it's not him anymore. It is another actor with darker hair, darker eyebrows and wearing different clothes. I can't believe they couldn't get Damon back to film the final scene of what could be an Oscar-winning film....ridiculous!!! I wanted Scorcese to win until I saw that. For that screw up, he deserves to lose. It makes me very upset to think that the filmmakers actually believe that the viewing audience would be stupid enough not to notice/care about such an outright fake out.....Did anyone else notice??????
10.0~The Renaissance WriterDave Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director. It's hallowed ground for an auteur, and as such, every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art. With "The Departed" he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick "Infernal Affairs" showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss; Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring; Matt Damon as the crime ring's inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down; Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio; and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio. This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre. By now, Scorsese is to crime dramas what Hitchcock was to psychological thrillers. Comparatively, he's at the same point in his long career Hitchcock was when he gave us "Rear Window," "Psycho," and "Vertigo." Scorsese could've directed this blindfolded and it would've still been first rate. What's so thrilling about Scorsese as a filmmaker is that he's always directing full throttle with his eyes wide open. "The Departed" is so ridiculously good it left me with chills afterward. After a brief departure to big budget Oscar pushes with "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator," Scorsese returns to the familiar ground of his most revered projects like "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull," Goodfellas," and "Casino." All his hallmarks are here: fantastic use of music, brilliantly choreographed bouts of violence, heart-pounding editing, deep and meaningful camera shots and movement, religious iconography, an epic and detailed sense of place (in this case, Boston), and highly quotable dialogue that is dramatic and funny and full of pathos in all the right places. With its rising tension and cat-and-mouse theatrics, "The Departed" is easily the most viscerally thrilling studio film to come down the pike in many moons. Scorsese doesn't just treat us to his usual bag of tricks, he re-imagines them, and in exorcising perfectly balanced performances from an amazingly talented cast that in the hands of lesser director may have gone over-the-top, he delivers a modern day tragedy on par with greatest works of Shakespeare. For Scorsese, the big screen is his canvas, the camera his paint brush, and the blood splattered across the screen his awe-inspiring brush strokes. He's a veteran, he's a master, and "The Departed" is his Renaissance.
6.0~Great acting, good direction, very flawed storyline. ddaigle3 Sign in Permalink My main objection to the movie was the vast amount of flaws in the storyline, e.g., Damon was selected to this elite team and no one questioned how he could afford the apartment when he was raised by an elderly grandmother with no money...Dicaprio comes into the police when he knows that the only person there who can identify him as an undercover cop is gone, how stupid is that...Wahlberg quits and leaves Dicaprio without anybody to help him and shouldn't Wahlberg be at least a little suspicious that his boss was killed because he was being followed by Damon's crew, don't quit because you keep your friends close and your enemies even closer...why did Damon warn Nicholson about the second tail when he sent the message where the exchange was to take place...why did Dicaprio stay around when Sheen got killed, he was not the type to go into shock and he knew he was being chased by the killer crew...why did Sheen not protect himself against the killer crew...and finally the shrink she was allowed to live even tho she knew that Damon was guilty. There are others.
1.0~not a patch on INFERNAL AFFAIRS vailsy Sign in Permalink this movie is completely inferior to Infernal Affairs on just about every level possible IA anticipated an audience with a brain cell or two, and so explains during the title sequence what it takes this remake around 30 minutes or more to explain. repeat, during the *title sequence* we are given all of the information we need to know about the informant plants (which btw were realistically placed some considerable time in the past, rather than several months ago) and are then straight into the movie scorsese takes this fabulous material and then dumbs it down to spoon feed it to a western audience. all of the sharp and intelligent dialogue of the original is gone in favour of your usual Hollywood 4 word expletives. every other word in this film is an F word, and they are mostly totally unnecessary. all of the stylish camera work of the original is lost, for example the ultra cool roof top meets. and to top it the casting and performances are dry and bad nicholson gives us a performance which is no more than good old bottled vintage jack. here's jack doing an impression of a rat etc etc, yawn. di caprio is good as usual but still doesn't nail the performance mostly because he doesn't physically suit the part. he just doesn't look tough enough for the challenge (as presented in the departed) wahlberg on the other hand tough's it up to the Nth degree, and is just absolutely atrocious. this man is working in a high level intelligence department and he plays it like a street cop. it's a totally inappropriate display and really reveals his limitations as an actor matt damon is just too plain, he is just totally unmemorable in this movie for a director who used to be at the cutting edge of cinema, this is a fat and lazy remake of a lean and mean original movie/trilogy which i urge you strongly to see. time for scorsese to hit the gym and go back to basics for people unaware of the original i'm sure they'll be blown away by the incredibly intricate plot in scorsese's departed. unfortunately what they probably won't know is that this is a dumb rehash of Infernal Affairs
1.0~Not Recommended! gabbymoron Sign in Permalink I've had more thrilling poops than The Departed. Where to begin? Leonardo DiCraprio is NOT the sort of man he portrays here. Instead he borrows a page from the Gutzon Borglum handbook. What I'm trying to say here is, he's a poopy actor in this one. Nothing against him personally, though. I just felt like I was watching my Aunt Freda's home movies (pumpkin pie, not!). Also, what is the deal with Jack Nicholson? The man's in his 80s and this is what he's supposedly doing? Running around like a squid that just had its ink squeezed out? I miss him when he was the Penguin. He should have been replaced with Bull the bailiff from Night Court. Up your nose with a rubber hose! I actually love Marty Scorsese, but what was he thinking? We have a word for movies like this back home, but I can't repeat it here (starts with a "y" if you know what I mean). Hopefully he rebounds after this effort. As I sat through this one, I was really wishing that I was "departed"! Overall, I do not recommend The Departed.
8.0~Good Movie Killer Professional jergutzmen Sign in Permalink I like this type of show. look so good and really keep you wondering what is going to happen with the guys. i love the violent part of show. i love the ending that cop would kill bad guy. very cool. I would like to see more shows like this show. I think this is worth watching more then one time. Worth rent or download. Even though you know what would happen 2nd time would still be a good show to watch through again. I think movie lack sex though. lot of show with violence has sex, but this show no. I would say watch this show.
7.0~Daft Hayfax_Jo Sign in Permalink Y'know, I don't think I've actually watched much Scorcese before I watched this last night with the missus, but I can understand why people rate him so highly - in terms of putting together a tight piece of entertainment and getting convincing (albeit not necessarily realistic) performances out of his actors, he's indisputably one of the best, but I couldn't escape the impression that this film was utterly ridiculous. The good points are many; Jack is 200% fun to watch, it rattles along at a rate of knots and I was always intrigued to see what happened next (despite it dragging in a couple of scenes near the end)amongst others, but equally there were places where I thought, "Oh come on..."; I wouldn't know a Boston accent if I heard it, but despite that, even I could tell that a fair whack of them were mangled, especially Ray Winstone's (you're great to watch, Ray, but please, god, stick to Cockney). And I didn't really buy Vera Farmiga's character, but then I've lived a very sheltered life... I guess I was expecting something more hard hitting rather than this silly, but as I say, it was a lot of fun. I wanted to give it a 7.5, but I can't, so it gets a seven. Hayfax_Jo
8.0~Original. emrelanur Sign in Permalink The Departed has some good actors and even better acting. In my opinion, that was the movies soul strength considering it was at least 20 minutes too long and some scenes could have definitely been edited. Otherwise it's not your average blow everything up movie, but still very intense. And it doesn't go overboard with the dialogue. With the exception of some parts, it was evened out nicely. I won't give it away but the ending in particular stood out most for me because it wasn't happy or sad. It was just an ending. A very original movie by Scorsese. Intriguing and unpredictable. just when i thought Hollywood lost its 'mojo', along came 'The Departed'. 8/10.
9.0~An excellent spy movie hshavarini Sign in Permalink Taking place in South Boston, this is a tale of police officers and Irish gang members spying on one another. Infiltrated young undercover cop assigned to the Irish mafia mob gets to gain the trust of chief Frank Costello. On the other side, another young officer has infiltrated the police department as an informer working for Frank. Both of these cops become deeply involved with their own task and end up with a double life. Each running scared trying to uncover the identity of the other man before it is too late. This is a classic spy movie with great performance (all around) from some of the best in Hollywood. If you liked the "usual suspect", you will like this film as well. You will not know who is spying on who until the VERY end of the movie. With multiple endings, it leaves you thinking for days.
8.0~Bob Dillon sang, "You Gotta Serve Somebody" ... and so it goes. Marc_Israel_365 Sign in Permalink This gangster movie, dressed up as cops and robbers, is severely pumped by Boston bluntness where everyone is on the fast track to earning the film's title. An epic espionage battle ensues with "rats" abound. The native Bostonians set the tone, as Matt Damon is brilliant trying to stay ahead of the pack and Mark Wahlberg's chip on the shoulder routine doesn't let up while Nicholson swims in the self serving villain role somehow missing the obvious? The police psychiatrist played by Vera Farmiga adds the DiCaprio box office love tryst but obliterated a gripping suspension of disbelief (unprofessional relationship and distributing prescription drugs without being an MD?)Despite the insult to our intelligence, the All Star cast delivers while Scorsese over-delivers as per the norm for our American filmmaker.
1.0~I feel VERY strongly about this dougglug Sign in Permalink This film,is in the TOP 50 of all time movies. There has been so much talk about the 'original' (three movies) and MS's version. IMHO there is so much swearing and unnecessary use of the 'c' word for starters before I even begin to start on the story and screen play. For Pete's sake, I can't see any redeeming feature about this movie. All the actors have done SO MUCH BETTER in other roles and the the whole 'jam 3 stories into 1' does a disservice to real fiction. I haven't felt as irate as when I saw the outrageous 'assasin' AND then saw the plaudits fly in as if no one had ever seen the original Nikita. Departed is a mediocre big buck flick flop ... IMHO
9.0~Oscar Sweep remover12 Sign in Permalink An exciting, complicated plot that keeps you glued to your seat. Wonderful acting, especially Leonardo, Mark Wahlberg and Jack. Loved his mysterious girlfriend, Gwen, aka Kristen Dalton. Although, not a big part, but many stars played smaller roles and were outstanding. Scorcese should win the big one at last. Jack is not only an evil psychopath, but has a prankster, little boy quality as well. Leo shows every emotion there is, Alex Baldwin is hilarious as is Mark Wahlberg. A lot of violence, but aren't all Scorcese movies fairly violent? He knows the mob and how to show their personalities. A big film! Jack is a legend. He brings so much to everything he has ever done, and this film is no exception.
10.0~Just perfect in every single way. TOMNEL Sign in Permalink Stars: Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson. This is one of those rare movies that have your full attention from the beginning to the very end. Everything about this movie was just perfect. The performances were all excellent, with Dicaprio giving his most grown up and best performance. Matt Damon was great. And as always Jack Nicholson was crazy and great as the mob boss. The plot of the film is that the police in Boston are trying to take down crime boss Francis (Nicholson). There's a henchman of his that's a rat for the cops (DiCaprio) and there's a policeman that's a rat for the mob (Damon). In other reviews of this I've read how much everyone loved Matt Damon's performance, but I have to say, I actually thought Leonardo was even better. And Matt Damon was still excellent. Every single moment of this movie just screams at you, "BEST PICTURE!!!!", and I have to say it deserves it. This was truly a cinematic masterpiece!!! My rating: ****/****. 147 mins. rated R for Strong Violence, Language and Drug Use.
2.0~Poor Script, Confusing Directing and Gratuitous Violence hansadamson Sign in Permalink This movie suffers from the unfortunate Tarantino Syndrome that we have to live with among Hollywood movies nowadays. If you like to see brains blown out, this is your movie. You will probably forget that the plot makes no sense and that the directing does nothing but make it confusing. Yeah, of course you get to see many famous actors in one movie. I guess that's the only positive I can say about the film. Maybe it's not a positive thing considering the mess. After seeing the movie I thought maybe the movie was suffering from difficulties of being based on a book, but now I have read that it is really based on another movie. Hong Kong movie? Makes me curious if it could have been as bad as this. I won't take the risk though.
6.0~1 Dimensional Characters in a Slick Script envision1 Sign in Permalink I wanted to love it, I wanted to be captivated, I wanted to be taken for a ride of action, mystery, and suspense. And well It was like ordering your favorite meal only to bite into it and find it sorta tasted like it was supposed to. You keep chewing trying to love it but it's just a bit off. That's this film. It plays out like a slick mystery novel - everything revolves around the narrative and everything happens to conveniently fit perfectly in place. While this isn't bad necessarily it comes at the expense of the characters being more interesting. Even with the all star cast line up it doesn't do much to give anything more than a cardboard cut out for the characters. How this won an academy award is certainly a wonder. Either the competition that year was terrible, or the judges simply looked at the names in the credit roll and felt like in order to keep their jobs they had to vote for it. The movie opens up laboriously slow trying to give you a background and history of the main characters, but what it fails to do is make you feel connected to the characters - it comes off slow and trite. It's just too forced and almost feels like a soap opera for the first 15-2 minutes. The major low in the film is when Billy somehow is supposed to fall in love with Madolyn and vice versa. The movie makes about as much effort to sell you on it as a bad porno. IE: Therapist girl gives one session with Billy, kicks him out. And then somehow a few scenes later they're knocking boots. It was just so terribly unrealistic or believable, but then again most other things in this film are. Now film works by the viewers suspending but this film just fails to really engage the viewer with the characters which would then allow you to suspend belief. So many things in this film come off as trite. Overall a watchable film but despite it's all star line up it's a very forgettable film.
10.0~Not Surprisingly Awesome lilFeRryZzPimP Sign in Permalink Well, I have to admit, normally I don't watch Scorcese movies. I know they are good but most of the time they are not my style of movie. I normally watch movies like Saw and other horror movies but I decided to see this move because. 1. Martin Scorcese is the the director. 2. I saw all the other interesting movies in the theatres. I was NOT disappointed...This move has to be the best movie I have seen this year. The move starts off in the childhood of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), you see him in a supermarket and you see Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) going into the supermarket collecting his dues from the bookies. You see him later on meeting up with Frank right after graduating from The Police Academy. You see him again later on getting accepted into the top branch of the Police. You also see Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) failing to join that unit. Throughout the whole movie you see Colin receiving and making calls to Frank informing him of the latest things going on in the Police. Billy is set up as a rat in Frank's unit and is given a whole new personality. Colin now has a big dilemma as the Police go after Frank. It's a whole game of cops and robbers ending in a satisfying twist finish.
10.0~Best American movie in a long time tomrito Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese was already a great America artist but what he has done here transcends mere movie-making and restores my faith in the ability of people today to make a masterpiece. Every week I go to the theater hoping to see a film that will blow me away, and it was getting to the point where I was really thinking that will never happen again. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for a truly great American film. Everything is almost perfect, great story telling, great acting, and great musical score. It's very telling when a crime drama, lased with violence and corruption, still manages to have more humor then most of the comedies produced today. The characters are so well developed and intense, that every scene, every piece of dialogue is mesmerizing. All set to some of the best backdrops ever seen on film. Oh, and one last thing, anyone who thinks that Jack's portrayal is over the top, doesn't have a clue. I have been around people like that and the one thing that comes to mind is that truth is stranger then fiction. All of the characters were spot on and if they offend your sensibility, maybe you should stick to TV.
4.0~Nothing good andy-409 Sign in Permalink Great cast for a police story. That's all, good news end here. I can't see one single reason to go to see this movie. A police story must always be accurate and likely. This is not. I don't want to bother you with details (and if you are going to see it anyway, of course you don't want to know them before going), but believe me. It's not likely because of an endless series of incorrect details. Finally the end is an unannounced non-sense, it could make sense if it were a farce, but it's not, it would be a police story, simply a bad police story! Martin Scorsese is a great director. Anyway he has directed some bad movies. This is his worst!
10.0~This is how the movies should be made..!!! 851222 Sign in Permalink Greetings from Lithuania. I just couldn't stay away and don't write a comment on this true masterpiece. Yes you hear it right - A MASTERPIECE! Saw it on a big screen, and I was totally blown away. I can't remember the last time I was so blown away by a movie. Magnificent work from all cast!I also think this is one of the best casts ever put together.The editing of the film is top notch. The script by William Monahan is complex, and rich in characters. Stunning work from director Martin Scorsese. I love Martin Scorsese and in my own opinion, this is his best film. The Departed is without doubt the best picture of the year and never fails to entertain. The Departed really does give you all you want and then some. A must see!
10.0~A cat and mouse game done at it's finest. renogade Sign in Permalink An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston. Let me start off with saying that this is my favorite movie, no doubts about it. the movie starts out slow with it's LONG intro, but picks up and never breaks pace. I normally hate pace breaking in movies, so this is already a big + in my book. the story is interesting to watch as Dicaprio and Damon struggle with their identities while Jack Nicholsen has some fun as the bad guy. This movie has a great plot, cast, music score, length and almost all elements of movies possible such as: drama, comedy, action, crime, thrills and suspense and many more. The Departed is a great movie and should be recognized as one.I find nothing wrong with it. maybe the lack of female characters, but it ain't that bad.
9.0~Betrayal at its zenith. LTCRKeats Sign in Permalink The Departed is excellent entertainment from some of America's best actors and one of its best directors. Not a totally believable story line, but who cares? It was believable enough to entertain and not lose the audience. It allowed good actors to do excellent work. The basic story is the head of the Boston Mob (Nicholson)plants an informant in the Massachusetts State Police (Damon)and the State Police plant an informant in the mob (DiCaprio). Both sides figure out there is an inside informant and go looking. The chase and final chapter are great action and great drama. The final 5 minutes are not what you expect which adds to the fun and entertainment. If you have trouble with blood and bad language, this is not your movie. The language and blood are not inappropriate to the story, these are mobsters not school kids. Jack Nicholson is still Jack Nicholson. With the right part, he is still one of the best. Matt Damon is wonderful as the mole and does some of his best acting. His character has no conscience and that fits the part. DiCaprio is a more difficult and troubled character, but he carries it well. Wahlberg (a state trooper supervisor) is an unlikable jerk, but does redeem himself in the end. If you go to movies to be entertained and enjoy a mobster movie, don't miss this one.
10.0~Emotional, Intense, and all around Amazing. snowoption156 Sign in Permalink Late on Monday afternoon my friend had asked me if I would like to go see this movie. I had seen the previews and knew a little bit about the story and since the director was Martin Scorsese, I knew that my cage might be rattled a bit. I had no clue as to the roller coaster ride that would ensue. Right out of the gate the story catches you. (dont worry, no spoilers) Nicholson shines as you would expect as the dirtiest low down devil of a human being as any actor could hope to try for. DiCaprio and Damon have a synergy through total yin and yang. And to top it all off you have moles in the system. Where can the story bring you that hasn't already been done? That is for you to see. As the credits rolled, I stood up very slowly. My stomach hurt. I was pushed and pulled through emotions (the fun ones like fear, anger, anguish, etc.) that my head was a mess so my body reacted to it. When you can leave a theater and feel tension like that, the director correctly did his job. Scorsese nailed this one, and DiCaprio has done an even better job in character acting than in the Aviator. Oscars anyone?
9.0~Another masterpiece by the master of crime myrealnameisjon Sign in Permalink There is no question as to the level of genius that Martin Scorsese portrays in every piece of art that he creates. Anything the man touches turns to magic. Even with that said, it sets the bar far too low to measure a masterpiece we know as The Departed. I can honestly say that I am a fan of crime family, mastermind scam, and mafia movies. They seem to appeal to the darker side of me that has never and will never be unleashed. The Departed grabbed a hold of that darker side and did not let go until my darker side was whipped into criminal submission. My Irish-rooted soul was bound to the cast of characters in the lore of Mick cops and gangsters; and the sex, drugs, and brutal use of violence left films like Scarface simply wanting. I am not completely sure if I can say that The Departed is my favorite mafia movie, considering The Godfather is still out there, but it is up there on the chart. I only have two suggestions: 1. watch this movie as soon as possible. 2. make sure that your children are out of the house for the night.
7.0~Good, not great alfredsass Sign in Permalink I just couldn't get over to what seems to me to be a truck-sized hole in the story line. If Sullivan was on tape with Costello's lawyer as being in the cahoots, how could Sullivan possibly think he was walking away from what he did to Nicholson, and then Costigan after he had already shown up in the office and had been seen by the entire staff? Otherwise the film was all Scorcese, brings back memories of Casino and Goodfellas with the language. I've always thought Damon was a fine actor, the scenes were you could see the wheels turning in his head when trying to figure a way out were conveyed well. Nicholson as always was the scene stealer, and DiCaprio held his own with a Hollywood heavyweight. Still can't get over the plot hole though. :(
8.0~Not Scorsese's best, but it is one of his top 5 best. ZumBLuvR Sign in Permalink The Departed is in my opinion one Scorsese's top 5 films, with Taxi Driver and Goodfellas ranking 1 and 2 respectively. it was sad to find out so many great performances were snubbed by the AMPAS people, but still we have another great crime thriller from the man whom has brought crime and suspense to the big screen with great success. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers of our time and I know he has another Taxi Driver in him somewhere, but in the mean time this film will easily keep you smiling from ear to ear as it is filled with all of Martin's classic trademarks, and awesome performances from this top notch cast. Now as I said it is not his best as it doesn't have the intensity of his other films, but it comes damn close, and I am eager to see what ole martin has cooking next.
10.0~Outrageously good Fwoggie Sign in Permalink For me, 2006 has been a fairly mediocre year at the cinema. Too many films with excessive special effects that weren't essential to the plot of the film (aside from the fact that most of them had razor thin plots anyway). For me, Departed has blown all the other films I've seen this year clear out of the water. I've been reminded why all of the major actors in this are rated so highly. They've all turned in either medium or mega sized turds in their careers, but they should all rightly be proud of this. I'll spare you the synopsis of the film. IMDb's own synopsis plus other comments have done that for me. I'll go into the performances themselves. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in arguably his most gripping performance since Basketball diaries or Gangs of New York. A slushy lovable character he certainly isn't in this film; self assured and confident at the beginning, by the middle of it Billy Costigan is a total wreck - still on the right side of the law but losing his mind as he comes ever close to being uncovered and brutally, viciously killed. Nicholson's Irish accent is next to non existent, but you don't care. He's menacing beyond belief, a particular scene coming to mind between him and DiCaprio when he nonchalantly waves around a severed hand whilst having breakfast to make a point. DiCaprio's character is terrified. Damon has always been pretty damn good with everything he touches seemingly turning to silver if not gold, but he effortlessly plays a bent corrupt cop who is ultimately out of his depth. Colin Sullivan (his character) will stop at nothing to protect himself and you get increasingly incredulous at how low he'll stoop. Watch for the scene with him in his office on a walkie talkie as he tries to frame another member of the unit to save his own neck (I'm not saying who). It's chilling. Mark Whalberg provides some black comedy, useful for breaking up the tension and rebuilding it once more. He might (or might not) be bent, but ignore his character at your peril - he's more key to the plot than you realise. The dead pan double routine about sleeping with his bosses sister (played very well by Alec Baldwin - the boss who is out of touch with the brutal truth) who in turn asks how his mother is is great fun. Make no mistake, Scorsese makes a film with good potential in a fabulous film and will deservedly take much credit for it. It's pretty damn impressive right up until DiCaprio and Damon come face to face; the conclusion of the film will ram itself right in your face and leave you outraged, brutalised, exhilarated and stunned. It's the fastest 2 1/2 hr film I've ever seen and I am seriously contemplating going back to watch it again - something I've not wanted to do since I saw Sleepers - and wasn't that a long time ago... This is really as good as I (and everyone else) is making out. A definite must watch, it's bound to pick up a couple of Oscars next year..
10.0~This was... AWESOME deltajuliet Sign in Permalink Whoa. What an experience. Crisp direction heads this wonderfully written film, with tid bits of humor scattered throughout (and, fortunately, it helps make the movie, rather than subtract from it). Other moments are tense, exhausting, absorbing... Very well-written. Acting is also top-notch. I could see any one of many actors from The Departed being nominated for an Academy Award. DiCaprio and Nicholson are especially great here, giving some of the best performances of their careers. Gotta mention Wahlburg, too--he's a lot of fun to watch. Note that the film has quite a bit of profanity and a decent amount of violence. Still, I'd strongly encourage you to not let this deter you. The experience is completely and utterly worth it. SEE THIS FILM!
4.0~Raging bore ntrbo1749 Sign in Permalink I put off seeing this and only rented it post-Oscar. I thought the title referred to the undead or something and didn't like the ads. This is the order of my live comments to my husband while watching: 1. It looks nice, nice framing, setting. Very pretty. 2. Everyone looks so gritty and "real", did Leo sleep during production? 3. This "young Markie Mark" looks just like the real one - only to find out it is an younger Matt Damon. 4. Let me guess, she'll be having relations with them both of them soon. 5. Possible continuity error, could just be me mishearing go ahead and tell me I didn't "rewind" but raced to my indie store to give it back and not get charged an overdue fee), but during the elevator courtship (whilst they are cutely and simultaneously putting down the status value of their "sub-par" education) she is referred to as a "psychologist", though later he he tells me she is prescribing pills presumably as a doctor. 6. I ask a few minutes in. When is the "head to head" between the "two" protagonist to occur? Oh yes, about 10 minutes before the end I suppose. However, I think the cuter "one" of the "three" Mark Walberg will prevail. (Oh, and the better actor than the most of the cast to boot. This includes overrated Jack, who has always irked my Mom, and frankly though I'm no prude hearing him say he barely needs a certain feminine part anymore makes me queasy). Gratuitous. 7. Leo died? really? no surprise knew he would. 8. Knew she would be pregnant and called it- typical vulnerability element thing thrown in. Just thought there would be a violent/bloody miscarriage or something for icing. So for me this is first predictable and then formulaic. These things don't always annoy me, I can enjoy formula. But this movie was rather tedious and possibly too long for its genre, and I felt that whoever was in the cutting room (the woman who now has Oscar somewhere on her mantle)perhaps was too attached to some scenes to let go. I also think that this was likely a moneymaker formula as well- a crime drama, Martin Scorcese, and that stellar cast. I'm pretty sure it cost a lot to make movies these days and those doing financing don't want to risk much. I think the times they are and have changed since the 70's. Or, perhaps some directors have lost their youthful edge, fearlessness and integrity. The drive to have to get out here. Lastly, Though formula, Michael Mann would have done it much better and for some reason has peaved me off less... Thanks, "Raging" bore
1.0~Worst movie I've seen in a long time ddogsmith Sign in Permalink This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. If you like violence, profanity, lots of testosterone and bad acting (Jack Nicholson "out-Jacks" himself) then this is your movie. It is neither smart nor well-done. Scorcese should give it up, and go play golf. And why does he think Leonardo is so great? Didn't the debacle of Aviator show that these two just don't make that great of a team? This movie has two goals: glorify violence. And glorify violence. The fact that it is nominated as "Best Picture" is unsettling and tells you where this country is at this time -- at a very low cultural point. When I saw that Brad Pitt was one of the producers, my opinion of him as world do-goody dropped by two-thirds.
1.0~Self-indulgent, Overrated & Bloated everyones-a-critic Sign in Permalink Before starting I must confess to watching this film never having seen the original and without realizing there was one. After reading some of the comments here I will pick up internal affairs and watch it. Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot (though probably not all) of what makes this such a bad film. But I am happy to take the film stand alone on its own merits, of which there are few. For Scorsese to stoop to this debacle after masterpieces like Mean Streets and Goodfellas is shocking. The fact that this won so many awards is beyond me. Let's review the completely unbelievable plot points: - Gangster Nicholson allows former cop (who he knows is a former cop) DiCaprio become his right hand man seemingly moments after joining his gang. Nicholson discovers there is a mole in the organization. And can't work out that it's DiCaprio, his latest recruit. Ludicrous. This appears to be a gang of less than ten people. Give me a break. The whole film falls apart right there - if you can't believe the main premise then it's failed. But let's go on. DiCaprio is the only gangster not to give his ID number to his boss, but he is still above suspicion. Rotten Cop Damon gets away with blasting his boss Nicholson - and there is no investigation? Nobody ever subpoenas cell phone records (a very easy thing to do) Damon and DiCaprio just happen to be dating the same girl. Said girl is given incriminating tape of Damon by DiCaprio. Nothing is ever done with this tape though. Was this cut out to trim the film under three hours? Said girl agrees to go for a coffee with her patient DiCaprio. This doesn't happen in real life. Psychiatrists do not date their patients. Not even Frasier did that and that was supposed to be comedy. Police records are completely erasable by one person with no backup and no trace remaining. Nonsense. The final scenes at the building are ludicrous. Characters only briefly touched upon at the beginning of the film are suddenly players in the big game to the point where they will commit cop murders. I'm not sure I understood why it needed to be on the roof anyway. From what I understand this was in the original film but there was a reason for it. Poorly executed. Jack Nicholson is Boston Irish. Maybe he is of Irish descent in reality - but he sure can't play it well. Err, the State Police in central Boston? No - that's BPD's turf. They at least have to work with BPD. Gangsters throw a captain of the State Police off a building and there are no fingerprints or other evidence available later. And now for the pointless time wasters: Obviously Scorsese is big enough and powerful enough that he can dictate cuts (or lack thereof) to the studio at this point. Unfortunately this leads to a self indulgent two and a half hour (felt like four hours) film and convoluted story telling The whole plot with the girl psychiatrist. What is this for? It serves absolutely *no* purpose in the film other than to make it longer and less believable. Even her pregnancy is left hanging. I really get the feeling they filmed a lot more but had to quickly cut to get the length down. This is why studios have editors. Let them do their jobs and cut the drivel from films and make them entertaining. The whole setup in police academy. That's half an hour right there that should have been cut out of the film. The stupid porno/hooker stuff with Nicholson. Pointless, plot irrelevant and simply unnecessary. Goodfellas managed to be a great film without that. Although there was one light moment when Jack implied he can't raise the titanic any more. Art imitates life I guess. The OTT language. I'll believe it from gangsters but special investigators tend to be a bit more pro. The sex scene was just silly Now let's throw in some bad casting/bad directing decisions: - Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio play the leading roles, both cops with crew cuts. They are both good actors but something should have been done to differentiate between the two in terms of physical appearance. These guys look too much alike in the opening sequences - waaay to confusing. This is solved later when DiCaprio starts to look more ragged. Whatever happened to the FBI angle? Why bother with it if it is unused? Too many stars. They all demand face time which makes the film drag. It would have been better with some unknowns. The whole secret cell phone deal was used how many times? Repetition plagued this film all the way through. OK - so you get it. The film has a plot full of holes and drags on for hours. It promises so much and delivers so little, which is why it deserves so few marks from me. The one star, if I must give one, is for Alec Baldwin who is hilarious as one of the senior cops and steals every scene he is in. In a cast of stars that's a pretty neat trick.
9.0~I Hope Boston isn't Really Like This thewillt08 Sign in Permalink If there was ever a cast created by the hands of God himself it would have Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg. What's that you say, The Departed has a cast like that and to add to it it's directed by Martin Scorsese. Well, this is the definition of perfect. Scorsese tends to stick with mobster movies like Goodfellas but he makes them so well. The writing and acting drive this story and the Boston setting is the icing on the cake. Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a Boston mobster who uses Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, as a cop on the inside. Billy, played by DiCaprio, is an undercover cop sent by Sheen and Wahlberg to work for Costello and help bring him down. Rats on rats on rats. First off, the story is one of the best I have ever seen. The sneaking around and the lying and the deception on all ways possible in amazing to see on screen. Bill lies to Costello about his life to get on the inside and Sullivan is working to bring Costello down while secretly working for him. It's a little hard to wrap the brain around but that makes me fall in love with the movie more. Word gets around that there is a rat in the police unit and Costello thinks there is a rat in his crew. Bottom line, Sullivan has to find himself and Billy has to be careful. The writing behind this is incredible and a few twists and turns are around every corner. Living in Boston I know a few things or two about the language. The Departed may be a bit exaggerated but for the most part people do talk like that. The famous Boston accent can be that extreme but it's really extreme in this movie. Some of the actors are not from the Boston area and it shows as they try to force the accent. The cursing is also very extreme. One time I sat down and counted how many times they fay the F word and it was close to 400. Parents be aware, this is not a movie for the kids. Take notice of the R rating. Damon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson were the stars of this movie but Mark Wahlberg snuck in the backdoor and was amazing. The first scene with him is my favorite in the entire movie. He and Sheen are offering Billy the job and Wahlberg goes off. You can tell Wahlberg had a lot of fun with this role because he plays a scumbag, but he is great. His lines are clever and snarky and when he acts it is entertaining. He stole the show every time he was on screen. He was a jerk but his intentions were positive. A character like this was needed for this movie and again, perfect casting choice and the character was written beautifully. His one flaw is his lack of screen time. There is a big gap in the movie where he isn't there and not involved and I was left wanting more. No movie is flawless and I think the one weakness is Madolyn. She's the shrink for cops and criminals. She gets in a relationship with Damon but it's not really touched upon. They get together in the beginning but it's forgotten and overshadowed by everything else going on. She also works with Billy and they develop a relationship. A love triangle develops but it works for a little while but it becomes very two sided if you know what I mean. I don't really like her character as she is just as much of a snake as everybody else and at the end there is a huge plot hole with her. There is a big question that isn't fully answered and every time I watch the movie it drives me mad. Her character could have been so important but she turns out to be a loose end. I wish she could have been written better and given more screen time with Sullivan to make their relationship more believable. From top to bottom each and every single character worked. Besides the start the supporting cast was amazing. Alec Baldwin and Anthony Anderson are in this movie and they are big name guys taking a smaller role like this. They make the best of their material and they are both fantastic. As for the guys on Costello's crew, they are awesome two. Mr. French is a beast and Fitzy is a riot as well. They are characters you don't necessarily know by name but you know their faces and love what they do in the movie. The last thirty minutes or so were awesome. Everything unravels and there is one final twist at the end I didn't see coming. Characters get justice, some get screwed, and some get revenge. There are very few plot holes and the end is satisfying. Some characters have confrontations that are very intense. The ending made the movie and every time the credits role I smile and embrace the brilliance. Overall, The Departed is an amazing film and Scorsese delivers again. There is a lot of violence, swearing, and the movie is long but it is worth every second. DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his performance but we all know the academy hates him. It did win Best Picture and Best Director. Wahlberg also got nominated for best actor in a supporting role and he probably deserved it but it's not a shock he didn't win. What was good about this movie? Everything, there is no such thing as a perfect movie but in my opinion, this and Titanic are the two closest movies I can think of. WillyT Seal of Approval? Well, yes, obviously.
6.0~Infernal Affairs Please..! yuenwl38977 Sign in Permalink Stylish, Exciting, Thrilling, ORIGINAL..! Oh Sorry I'm talking about Infernal Affairs! So you already know now that I do not feel positive about this remake. This isn't the standard expected from the guy who we loved after Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino & GOOD FELLA's... All I will say is the film just attach's clustered elements of the original. The characters psychology is seriously weak compared to 'IA' but even if we do not compare the 2, The Departed just doesn't make much sense and is (I really am choosing my words carefully here) LAZY! Who, What, Where, When, Why? There is too much talking, too much unnecessary scenarios, too much confusion on the characters - the film dived straight into the characters and not revealing why Damon becomes a cop! Things just happen in this film. There is no sense of compassion towards DiCaprio unlike Tony Leungs portrayal. I really respect Andy Lau, he was very polite to rate this boring 2hr+ film 8 out of 10.. The only thing he did comment on was the character psychology.. Now I know why! *Sometimes you don't need to try so hard to be effective* As Infernal Affairs was effortlessly cool. Departed , even with Jack Nicholson is just Painfully Bad! Slow paced, not much happens, audiences do not feel too involved, Overall Poor Remake or a Classic!
7.0~Would give it 0 stars for this one reason joeydattomo Sign in Permalink Leo swore on his mothers grave that he wasn't a "fawking cawp" but he was lying because he was a cawp. Very sad!
9.0~leave your breath at home... passing Sign in Permalink ...cause u won't be needing it during "THE DEPARTED". well, maybe during intermission... "THE DEPARTED" is the name of the world's newest roller-coaster,it may not be the scariest but it surly is the fastest. u don't SEE "THE DEPARTED", u RUN with it. the movie is so fast, there's something going on all the time and u have to take turns with your friends at who blinks just so u won't miss anything... high expectations in movies are a curse cos most of the time u get disappointed. this is not the case... where to begin? i saw "infernal affairs" like 1 year ago, i liked it but... something was missing, i couldn't quite put my finger on it, now i know what it was...Scorsese, Martin Scorsese: those empty lines are not a mistake, i really am speechless... the man just keeps 'em coming like bullets from a tommy-gun... nothing to say, he just keeps setting higher standards for himself and just when u thought "crime movies" are a thing of the past he comes and delivers this beauty... the acting in the movie is truly fantastic. mark walberg is both hilarious and frightening as a fast-talking, tough and yet caring detective. the same goes for Alec Baldwin who plays a small but great part. martin sheen might get nominee for his great role also. as for the three "big guns"? well, Dicaprio keeps surprising me, he was fantastic. truly. Matt Damon was the only one that maybe, maybe was a bit less than great... he gets an "-a"... and jack? well, jack is jack... and the best for last: William Monahan, Siu Fai Mak & Felix Chong. for writing us a film the pantheon of cinema simply had to have... go. see it. now.
1.0~worst scorsese film ever tobiheroux Sign in Permalink i don't know where to start... everything is wrong about this movie... the screenplay is terrible (even more so if compared with other great gangster movies from scorsese, like casino or goodfellas) it is just a series of bad clichés... the acting is not any better... matt damon if simply terrible... you don't believe his character for one minute... leonardo is much better but they did not give him much to go on... its sad to say that but maybe it is time for scorsese to retire... you can only be at the top of your game for so long... if he did not recognized the poor quality of the script... i mean there is actually a shot of a rat at the end to illustrate i don't know what... maybe that the guy was a rat... i choose to believe everybody had understood that already... what awful use of imagery... anyway to sum it up... it is not even worth wasting your time watching this movie... even if you are a huge scorsese fan... because if you know anything about movies and you are not a blind follower of the guy you will realize that it is 2hrs of your time you will never get back... god this is just a terrible mainstream film
10.0~Leo is an actor to keep an eye on. His performances can only continue to be outstanding. A DiCaprio film will continue to be a film worth watching. kaseymarie07 Sign in Permalink Leonardo DiCaprio deserved Best Actor for his role in "The Departed". The fact he didn't win is a sin. He has grown into an excellent, topnotch actor. Marlon Brando, James Dean, Robert DiNiro, watch out. ("Blood Diamond" further substantiates this point.) Thru "The Departed",Martin Scorsese, finally. redeemed himself for that fiasco "The Gangs of New York". Not even Leo could save that disaster! As for Jack Nicholson, every role he plays is the same. The characters may be different but Jack plays them the same. For an actor with such a limited range, I don't see what all the fuss is about! Jack is overpaid and overrated. Leo was definitely the draw in The Departed.
1.0~THIS won an Oscar? Any Oscar? badtothebono Sign in Permalink I wasn't surprised when it won. The "oh, he/she has never won, so we've got to give it to he/she" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn't seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren't sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn't a rat, why didn't he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think? Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn't killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won't believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a "which one doesn't belong in this group" game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it! There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don't get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg's village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn't know how to tie his shoes? All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous.
10.0~Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling General_Turgidson Sign in Permalink Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear "Gimme Shelter" again, but "Comfortably Numb" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.
9.0~Scorsese Gets Back to Basics evanston_dad Sign in Permalink Critics and fans alike are hailing "The Departed" as a return to form for director Martin Scorsese, and though I don't exactly know what a return to form is for a director who's made such a list of diverse films, I understand the sentiment. "The Departed" is not as good as "Taxi Driver" or "Raging Bull," but it is as good, and maybe even better, than "GoodFellas." Like "Fellas," it's fast, brutal and wildly entertaining. But also like "Fellas," it comes off as fairly glib and lacking in the greater psychological or social meaning that made "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" such great films. It's nearly intolerably exciting at times; I came out of the theatre actually sweating. Scorsese gets terrific work out of his male ensemble (and lone female, Vera Farmiga), especially Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, who play moles on either side of the cops and robbers divide and end up hunting each other. Scorsese's point, that the line between those that break the law and those that enforce it is hopelessly blurred, is obvious and easy. But the film is so well acted and so technically accomplished that you feel that you're in the presence of greatness, even if the story itself is standard-issue pot boiler stuff. The ending is somewhat of a let down. It feels like the screenwriter got lazy, and instead of resolving matters in a creative fashion, decides that the best way to tie up loose ends is to kill off virtually the entire cast, with one blow-your-brains-out shot after another. But the overly tidy ending does not diminish the impact of this propulsive, addictively watchable and disturbing film. Grade: A
8.0~Why does Hollywood need to copy good foreign films? samme___ Sign in Permalink The departed is a top movie that will be remembered for decades. It contains everything that a good movie of this genre needs to contain. I have to admit that this was a very good, memorable and exciting movie. And the cast is amazing, especially the role that jack Nicholson is playing- which will probably lead to his fourth academy award for best male actor. But still of all its positive sides I don't like the idea that Hollywood movies kind of "steal" other foreign scripts/movies and turn them to American movies. I don't know if many of you know that the departed is kind of a rip off from the marvelous Hong Kong movie Infernal affairs. It came out year 2002 and in my opinion it's even better then departed an obvious 10/10!! I like it better because it's exciting all through the movie, one of the reasons is because it's 50 minutes shorter. Okay, now to my point. All due respect for the departed as a movie, as I said before I like it a lot. But the thing that bothers me is why Hollywood movies have to take other foreign scripts and turn them so that it will be more suitable for an American public. And because they also use well known actors, this will be a far greater success at the box offices all around the world then the Hong Kong movie. I think that they kind of take the credit from Infernal affairs, and it will be Departed that will be remembered throughout movie history. I think that's wrong thing to do, instead I think they should broadcast and market the Hong Kong movie in America and all around the world. They should try to do something about it, for e.g. came up with new ideas, new scripts, instead of just changing a bit of the content. By doing this Infernal affairs would get the credit they deserve abroad and we could also maybe have a totally different and new film instead of the Departed with the same actors and director. I don't know if many people agree with me, but that is my opinion. Please comment what I have been writing here, would be glad if you did!
3.0~Did this movie receive an Oscar? tobycomm Sign in Permalink I did not know this was an Internal Affairs remake. But Scorsese & Nicholson made me curious enough to watch it. I have to admit I didn't understand the story at all (Goodfellas HAD a life-like human story), except for the trivial fact that there were mutual rats in both police and mob force. Nicholson played well and energetic, I think, but the rest of the actors sort of too much engaged the f-word instead of making something out of their characters. I have seen all of the IMDb Top 250 movies (and some more) but my guts tell me this is not a good film. A good film is when you are so stunned afterwards that you watch until all the credits are finished. And then you don't get up easily from your cinema seat and you just go on pondering or being overwhelmed outside. Nothing of this happened to me with this movie. The amount of blood spilt should not outweigh the amount of philosophy as we can find in Pulp Fiction (or maybe in Kill Bill). Too many characters without any character.
10.0~Black humour and Head shots! Scorsese at his best.... Lady-Janey Sign in Permalink The Departed is the best movie I have seen in years. It's gripping, shocking and hilarious all in one movie. Like the best roller-coaster ride, one second you're laughing, the next you're 'Oh my God!' as something really shocking happens. Yes this movie is a remake of the classic Hong Kong 'Infernal Affairs.' I loved the original but somehow the movie seems to sit even better among the Boston Irish. The performances in this movie are all standout, the leads DiCaprio, Damon and Nicholson as well as the support Wahlberg, Baldwin, Sheen and Farmiga. It is their work which makes the Departed special and absolutely gripping. From the hilarious one liners thrown by Wahlberg's Dignam and Baldwin's Ellerby to the intense fear and vulnerability shown by DiCaprio's Costigan as he tries to survive in the world of Nicholson's colourful and terrifying Costello. Surely this movies deserves some acting nods at the Oscars? I would certainly recommend 'The Departed.' You do need to be prepared for Goodfellas type violence and language but if you can live with this then The Departed will be one of the best movies you have seen in a long time. 10/10
10.0~Don't f**k with Nicholson kevin-miller447 Sign in Permalink This is Scorsese's masterpiece. I love most of Martin's work but this is his gem. He won best director for this movie and this also won best picture. All well deserved. In my top ten list this is #3. A lot of people don't like this movie because they say the plot is too confusing. Frankly, I thought the same thing after first viewing it. After several watched, I know what was going on and who was who. The dialogue is sharply written and the performances are outlandishly entertaining. Everything about this movie is great and frankly, I don't find any flaws in it. People might think I'm being too generous and that I'm blinded by my love for Scorsese. No, I just know a damn good movie when I see one. This is a gangster drama that hits all the right notes and has a great soundtrack to go along with it. I also love how much they swear in the movie. It's hilarious and its used well too. A lot of times, swearing is abused and overused in movies. Now, I have heard people cuss this movie out for how much swearing there is but realize that people talk like this. Maybe not all the time, but they do. The cast is beyond superb and all of them do a great job. I love this movie, and hopefully someone who reads this, then watches it will uh, love it too. All thumbs up!
6.0~One-third as good as Donnie Brasco dr_foreman Sign in Permalink I guess film critics and movie buffs are going to give four stars to any old Scorcese-directed gangster movie, huh? Even ones that don't deserve four stars, like "The Departed." I must admit that it's not a bad film, by any means. The performances are mostly solid, the Boston setting is unique and interesting, and there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes. But, on the other hand, there are also plenty of scenes that feel either completely unbelievable, or totally flat, or a noxious combination of both. The plot, which gets needlessly convoluted at times, involves a mob "mole" in the police department and his counterpart, a police "rat" in the mafia. Apparently, it's based on a Chinese film called "Internal Affairs," but I've never seen that movie so I can't make any valid comparisons. Personally, I couldn't stop thinking about "Donnie Brasco," the similar Johnny Depp/Al Pacino movie about a rat in the mafia. That film contained genuine emotion, complex character relationships, realism... all qualities that are pretty much absent from "The Departed," which feels like an unrealistic Hollywood production all the way. The only apparent advantage that "The Departed" boasts is that it has a trendier director than "Donnie Brasco." But I think Scorcese pretty much drops the ball in this case and doesn't deserve to be automatically credited as a genius - just how cutesy and self-indulgent is the last shot of "The Departed," anyway? Some people complain about Jack Nicholson's performance, but it didn't really bother me. His scenery-chewing is a nice change of pace from watching DiCaprio and Damon act all earnest and depressed all the time. (Incidentally, I also thought Mark Wahlberg's foul-mouthed cop was very funny and entertaining.) The real weak link in the acting chain is Vera Farminga as the love interest. She's supposedly a psychiatrist, but she gets so emotional and confrontational with her patients that she completely fails to come across as a professional. She's also a bit insipid and doesn't really have chemistry with DiCaprio or Damon. My other major gripe with the film is that the editing is often choppy and strange. Scorcese doesn't linger long enough in most of the scenes - he simply dives into the middle of the action, and jumps out again as quickly as possible. This MTV-style editing doesn't really enable me to get immersed in a movie. And some of his choppy little scenes are downright bizarre and don't seem to fit in the movie (like the weird one where Nicholson goes to the opera.) I suppose that modern films are so bad that critics freak out when a remotely competent movie like "The Departed" shows up in theaters. It's a welcome relief from movies about CGI animals and superheroes, sure. But is it really a masterpiece? A top 100 movie on IMDb? Hardly.
1.0~Save your money adrossan Sign in Permalink Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line "I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...." failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer. DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.
10.0~Wow... oOautumnbreezeOo Sign in Permalink This movie was AWESOME! Matt Damon did good, Leonardo Dicaprio did great, Jack Nicholson did awesome, but being that he was barely even there, Mark Wahlberg did the BEST! This drama film almost turned into comedy every time he spoke. The film held an excellent story line leaving you waiting for more till the very, very end and yet leaves you wanting more. It's a who did, when, what? kind of movie that leaves the audience at the edge of their seats to puzzle piece ever thing together. I'd definitely keep this movie in my collection to watch again, and again. Leo is hot, so why wouldn't I? Can't get any better action this this. I'd put 3 thumbs up if I had an extra, but I guess till then, I'll give two thumbs up to the sky!
6.0~Scorcese is Michaelangelo divine_fire Sign in Permalink In my view, Martin Scorcese, like Michaelangelo, is a great artist and sculptor. His medium is film rather than stone, but he has a similar capacity to create memorable images. The Departed has proved thought-provoking and I greatly enjoyed the story elements dealing with the machinations, the double-crosses, etc. Scorcese's films, with their ferociously kinetic forwarding devices and no-explanations action sequences make violence incredibly seductive. For me, this is due to the chiaroscuro simplicity inherent in the characters that create it. There is no hand-wringing, no questioning. In Scorcese's filmed world, this is simply the way things are, the way things are done. This said, Scorcese's similarity to Michaelangelo extends to the fact that the man is brilliant at drawing male characters, but horribly deficient at rendering females. Michaelangelo's drawings and sculptures of women (when he did them at all) looked like men with breasts stapled onto their chests. The women in Scorcese's films aren't characters, they're plot devices and interruptions. He seems to use them to establish a quiet respite of a moment. The problem is that such respites are anathema to his style of film-making and so the women are relegated to the sidelines, except when they get trotted out to forward a specific plot device. By and large, the women are never as vital, as supercharged, as fascinating and charismatic as the men. Instead, they're usually passive leeches who are there to be sexual vessels, doormats or harpies. Like the Catholic Church and old school Police Departments, Scorcese's films are a clubhouse that says "NO GIRLZ ALLOWED". Most of the times I have come away from seeing a Scorcese film with equal measures of admiration, resentment and sadness. If only Martin Scorcese could make a movie where his female characters were as cool, as fascinating as the men. Alas, I don't ever see this happening and it is a true pity that an artist as great as Mr. Scorcese should have this regrettable, glaring lack.
9.0~Scorsese is on top once again with this fantastic crime thriller Neil_McCauley1 Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese rises to the peak of his directorial skills once again. His return to the world of crime equals his return to prominence. Leonardo DiCaprio brings his best performance of his career, Jack Nicholson gives a performance worthy of his colossal acting ability and notoriety, and Matt Damon adds even more depth to the story that kept me entertained, thrilled, and in suspense throughout. In particular, though, it was the "other" supporting actors that made this film great: Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin. Wahlberg's coarse and biting tongue was brilliantly on display whenever he was on screen as Dignam. His dialogue was some of the best of the film, and it is easily his best performance. Martin Sheen was very good as Queenan, who was emotionally connected to Costigan and tried his best to keep him from going off the edge. Meanwhile, there was Alec Baldwin, who provided the perfect amount of comic relief. Vera Farmiga was also good in support, but her role was not as outstanding as her male counterparts. The dialogue was crisp and unrelenting, the violence brutal and unremitting. The ending, despite some negative feedback, made me love the film even more. The ending was in fact my favorite part about this film. I was satisfied, shocked, and depressed all at once. The range of emotions this film provides is brilliant in it's own right. The credit should be given to Scorsese once more, as well as to DiCaprio and the rest of the cast. The editing was unapologetic, fast, and smart, and the culmination of the film left me wanting to see it again right away. Whether or not this film is a remake does not bear weight after viewing what exactly this film represents. The gritty city of Boston plays host to a magnificent film and certainly a possible Oscar contender. Mr. Scorsese, you have done it once more. 10/10
4.0~Hollywood flops it again richwong0610 Sign in Permalink OK this is not an original idea as we know it. It is a direct rip from the hit movie Infernal Affairs and almost certainly some parts are exactly copied over. I am very sorry to say that if you are to copy another film there isn't much to be demanded from the actors. I personally have never been a fan of re-makes if the director is not to add a new dimension to the original as it is the case of Departed. The only thing Martin seemed to add is a lot of senseless swearing and mind blowing graphical head-shots. This completely took the audience away from the core of the story, the essence of the plot. The ending is the most dire I have seen yet, it was simply distasteful. I would strongly recommend you to watch Infernal Affair 1&2, before set you eye on this Hollywood trash. Entertaining in terms of comedy values. watch this but do not expect a thrilling ride.
4.0~Pretty bad film, I'm sorry to say. scottmwade-1 Sign in Permalink Way too long and boring. Should have cut 60 minutes out and it would have been a lot better. I rented the DVD and almost shut it off a couple times 'cause it just kept dragging on and on. Nicholson is mostly great and Damon / De Caprio are good too, for the most part but this movie really lacks cohesion and just kind of sits there doing nothing for much too long. It starts out OK and the character development is pretty good but I'd say half way through it starts to tread water and doesn't really move forward until it picks up a bit going into the ending. Over all it's a nodder though. I almost fell a sleep a couple times.
3.0~I can't believe this dross won any Oscars at all Mike_Flattley Sign in Permalink A wonderful cast, an interesting story, reasonably good performances. If only Scorcese hadn't directed it, and whoever edited this over- extended, self-preoccupied and frequently irrelevant series of plot points should be shot. Plainly the stellar cast have congregated around Scorcese and it probably wouldn't have been made without him. Obviously, everyone involved were pretty pleased to be together on the project. That comes through and that's good. However, a whole heap of entirely unimportant, improvised tooling about by the ensemble desperately needs to be hacked out of the final reel, which Scorcese plainly couldn't bring himself to do. His affections for the cast have got in his way. There is a good film hidden in this bad film. Judicious cutting of VERY expendable material that does nothing for either character development or plot would deliver a terrific, tight-packed little thriller with enjoyable performances by most cast members. Agree Mark Wahlberg did a great job, and Di Caprio was very watchable. Matt Damon extended his range a little, but overall finds it hard to be anyone other than himself, in this film and most others. Fortunately he happens to be an interesting kind of guy.
10.0~Scorsese's Best Movie Sorry Goodfellas dan80074 Sign in Permalink Now although, I thought Goodfellas should have won best picture over Dances With Wolves (I'm not quite sure what drugs the academy takes to name that movie best picture over Goodfellas), this movie still takes the title as Scorsese's best movie in my opinion. I believe Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator were robbed of best picture (sorry Gangs of NY but The Pianist deserved the 2002 nod for the best film of the year). This would best Scorsese as the top director of movies that won best picture with 4 over William Wyler who directed three that took the title (Mrs. Miniver 1942, The Best Years of our Lives 1946, and Ben-Hur 1959). However movies like Ordinary People, Dances With Wolves and Million Dollar Baby stole Marty's fire. I believe he is easily in the top 3 of greatest director's of all time. Now for the movie. One word- MASTERPIECE. The acting is top notch. How Leo didn't get the best actor nod and Nicholson the best supporting actor along with Mark is a mystery to me. At least the British Film Awards gave them both the nod. Supporting cast along with Jack and Mark were great including Damon, Sheen, Winstone, Baldwin and all the others make this a true acting masterpiece. I'm glad this movie finally got Marty the best director win while Raging Bull should have easily got him the award (as should have Goodfellas and The Aviator and close competition with Gangs of NY but a loss to a worthy contender in Polanski). The movie had just about everything a movie could have- comedy, drama, suspense, everything. The screenplay was magnificent as well. Bravo Marty 10/10
7.0~Big names pay off josh_lambert1991 Sign in Permalink So many big names in this film and it's a treat to watch. This is a great film with some great twists and turns
4.0~Vastly Overrated. Worst "Good Film" of 2006 POSSIBLE SPOILERS gelman@attglobal.net Sign in Permalink Maratin Scorsese has been a fixture in Hollywood for decades and members of the Motion Picture Academy must have felt that they "owed" him this Oscar for being Martin Scorsese, certainly not for this film which has more phony elements in it than any movie in recent memory. True it has 3-1/2 high profile stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Plus it has more violence than can be found anywhere outside a war zone and enough blood to fill your average blood bank. Scorsese has plowed this field before -- in "Goodfellas," a vastly superior movie. Why didn't I like it? Because the plot is stuffed with unbelievable elements including a three way romance between Damon as a cop, DiCaprio as an undercover agent posing as a criminal and a police psychiatrist who is treating them both ???). As for Jack Nicholson, he is reprising previous roles as the Devil, this time in the person of a crime boss who is also -- get this -- an informant for the FBI. Damon is Nicholson's "mole" inside the police department and DiCaprio is the police department's mole inside Nicholson's organization. The question is who's going to find whom first and, eventually, after many (bloody) twists and turns, who gives a damn anyway? Scorsese has made more bad films than good ones but what the hell -- it's time to give him his Oscar. As for the principals, DiCaprio presents himself as a cool but tortured soul living a dangerous lie, Damon is Damon once again, and Nicholson is out there in front of the camera chewing the scenery as he is increasingly wont to do. Wahlberg does quite a decent job in a completely over-the-top role as an overseer in the under cover section of the police department. Martin Sheen distinguishes himself in this movie (as DiCaprio's ultimate boss) primarily because his character is almost believable and he's low key where everyone else is hamming it up big time. This movie is expensive trash and its success proves once again that you can't underestimate the taste of the American people (or of the Motion Picture Academy).
1.0~THE DEPARTED -- an INFERior Affair fundaquayman Sign in Permalink the original - INFERNAL AFFAIR is by no means a flawless film. By comparing to the remake it inspired, however,INFERNAL AFFAIRS seems much closer to perfection. If nothing else, I couldn't believe a Scorsese film would call for the audience to suspend their disbelief even more than what the average over-stylized & borderline-fantasy Hong Kong film would demand!!! There are gaps that THE DEPARTED manage to patch where INFERNAL AFFAIRS had fumbled: 1) watching the news report of Nicholson's goon as an undercover cop, and Nicholson responds "the cops would want us to believe that so we stop hunting for our mole". (this is where the HK version leaves audience confused as it is never explained; 2) the shrink actually is not a mannequin that shows the intelligence of an 8 yr old where her consultation with patients resembles an office receptionist taking calls -- flawed by not only the choice of actress, but also in the original script; & 3) why would Andy Lau's girlfriend get so disillusioned just BC she hears a tapped recording of a conversation between her boyfriend and a raspy-voice man about crime -- she doesn't even know he's working on this case, so why would this little thing lead her to believe her boyfriend is an undercover-crook? THE DEPARTED: done right: 1) as written above, Nicholson's comment on the police revealing who the snitch is helps lower unnecessary confusion that serves little purpose; 2) the psychiatrist has her own demons -- not a cyborg like Kelly Chen played it to be; 3) flashbacks to the children version of the leads were a good touch compared to INFERNAL AFFAIRS using actors in their 20's that confuses the audience BC they neither look like teenage versions of Andy Lau & Tony Leung, nor does it make sense for the difference in looks within even 10 years unless they've both had a FACE/OFF. THE DEPARTED - INFERIOR & RIDICULOUS: 1) is the psychiatrist a nymphomaniac? if so, why not explain that earlier that she could fall in lust with someone who just yells at her non-stop? At the clichéd least, let it be an act of charity out of pity! One "left-field" line of "so can we have a cup of coffee?" after the rapid-fire insults would turn her on? Who's the one with dementia here? Why can't she at least have one scene where a problem between her and Matt Damon surfaces, or maybe she has demons she can't control causing her to fall in lust with Leo? Were there scenes or dialog cut from what was shot because of duration control? 2) when Nicholson's goon suspects Leo to be the snitch, why doesn't he tell anyone else? In INFERNAL AFFAIRS this is justified because the goon is a good friend and aspires to be like Tony Leung. In THE DEPARTED, there is not the slightest sense of camaraderie between these two. 3) when the girlfriend listens to the CD, her motivation is fear of getting caught by Matt Damon about her affair. Knowing so little of what Matt Damon's cases, why would she be so disappointed at him? If any reaction is to come out of her, it would at best be her questioning "hey, are you taking up voice-acting? why didn't you tell me?" She wouldn't know what's going on just listening to 5 minutes of cryptic phone conversations... 4) Wahlberg, Wahlberg, WAHLBERG!!! I don't mind some of the lines given to him to make him the asshole of the year. I'll suspend my disbelief that much to accommodate his behavior. What I cannot accept is what happens after the boss' demise -- why would Nicholson and Damon suddenly feel the only remainder to their worries is Leo? When the film clearly states Wahlberg and Sheen are the only two who know the list of Undercovers, why does he suddenly leave the story as if he has no part in it? If I were the dumbest crook, Wahlberg is the first person I'd go for a shakedown to find out about the snitch. Instead, he is forgotten... and these are supposed to be the super-crooks we've been lead to believe throughout the film? MARTY... did you direct this picture? or you left 1/2 of it to the team of interns? I give points to the twist in the 3rd-act warehouse scene. It's a wise move to change-up so it wouldn't be completely predictable to those who've watched INFERNAL AFFAIRS. That said, what's with the ridiculous dialog? Leo: "xxx you, xxx you, xxx you, xxx the lot of ya!" Is there some syncopation here? are you trying to add a musical touch to this scene? I won't giveaway your "surprised ending". That's better left for everyone else to judge after they see it. I for one, think it was ridiculous and could only have resulted because some Studio Exec decides "but there's no redemption! The bad guy can't go free!" one more thing before I end this rant... it's about the scene with the Chinese gangs. Did you just grab a team of Chinese-looking men, tell them to translate on-the-spot their lines from English to what they think is Cantonese, and then just shot it right there-and-then without review? Do you realize they're speaking laughably bad pigeon Cantonese that doesn't exist -- intonation, and stresses at all the wrong places... when the gang head tells his henchman to check the bag, the audience expects him to say "You better check it good my man! or it's your ass!". What the guy says, however, can be translated into English as "now I assign you the duty (in third person form as if he's explaining about an order someone else had made), you better check IT THOROUGHLY!" Would you put the stress in "IT THOROUGHLY"? IT BAD, MARTY, IT BAD....
10.0~Perfection! Shnerplecurly13 Sign in Permalink I'm a huge Scorsese fan, so I was extremely excited to see the Departed. The movie was as good, if not better then what i expected. LIke people have said, it's Scorse's best film since Goodfellas, or Casino. He seems to be returning to what he loves best: Organized Crime. It's also the first movie that I've been surprised at in years. Mostly, movie plots are fairly easy to figure out, but this had me bouncing of the walls. It has a high body count, which is always fun, meaning, classic violent scenes, only Scorsese could make look poetic. The Entire cast is perfection. Leonardo DiCaprio was it his best, ever. He became Billy Costigan, to the point were you felt that what Billy was going through, were actual moments of Dicaprio's life. Matt Damon as always was good, though not as good as Leo. Jack Nicholson, well, what can you say about him? That he is amazing. Another perfect performance. Mark Wahlberg really surprised me, he was somewhat the comic relief of the movie, and stole the screen every time he appeared. Every inch of this movie was great, and i can't wait to see it again. Scorsese, your the best there ever was! Love, Simone
10.0~Best film of the year brodie_kashmir Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese's new crime drama "The Departed" cements the Irish mob's takeover of the crime entertainment monopoly from the Italian mafia. With Jack Nicholson at his best since 1992 and Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio giving the performances of their careers, it's hard to deny the sheer power exuded on screen by these three fine actors. Frank Costello (Nicholson) is Boston's top crime boss. The Special Investigations Unit of the Massachusetts State Police in Boston has been assigned to take him down. Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is sent deep undercover to gather all the information he can on Costello and his organization. The only people who know of his true identity are his two supervisors. Costello meanwhile has planted a mole, Colin Sullivan (Damon), inside the SIU to keep him one step ahead of the law. But being so entrenched in the lies and deception is beginning to take its toll on the two young men. This is Scorsese's best film since 1990's "Goodfellas". There's always been a brutality to his films, and in his nearly 40 year career as a director, it doesn't get any more violent than his saga of two undercover agents on the opposite sides of the law. What's even more intriguing about all the violence and bloodshed is that quite a bit of it isn't shown on camera. Costello walks out from the backroom of a bar drenched in blood, obviously having just done some serious dirty work. It keeps the air of mystery about Costello going around. You don't know what he did, but you know it was big, bad and dirty. Noted Russian author and playwright Anton Chekov once said that if they see a gun onstage in the first act, the audience will expect it to go off by the third. This emphasizes an attention to detail that Scorsese utilizes to make everything in his entire world, the one he created for his movie, to be expertly planned out. From the café Costigan fights the mafia in to the FBI guy sitting in on the SIU meeting. Everything means something. It makes for a much more engrossing, multi-layered film. I could go on and on about Jack Nicholson. But come on, it's Jack Nicholson. How do you think he did? The three people that really warrant the most praise are younger actors Damon, DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga, who plays the love interest of both Costigan and Sullivan. They steal the spotlight from consummate and seasoned veterans Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Pay particularly close attention to DiCaprio. He's fully shed that pin-up boyish look from the late 90's and has this brooding, angsty maturity as Costigan that brings his tortured character to life. One could argue that this just adds to the deterioration of American society. That it's a glorification of violence and crime. With criminals being seen as idols to be worshipped while cops should be seen as oppressors. But looking at the cadre of violent and crime worshipping movies that have come out in the past 20 years, this one would hardly register. It's the most entertaining film of the year, and one the best. It's definitely one to watch come awards season.
1.0~this film sucks parkqing Sign in Permalink Just call me over-sensitive, old-fashioned or what, but I am really not able to appreciate it. I never saw a movie filled with so many f words. I can't stand this. As a Chinese, I sure have watched HongKong version 'Infernal Affairs', which was, in my opinion, so-so. But The Departed is a failure out and out. HongKong movie has a great tradition of Gang Movie. Like western in American movie, Gang Movie is a major genre in HongKong movie. Most time, they are heroes, sometimes, they are villains. But they always get their due, they are human being, just like you and me. They are not the pervert, like the persona Jack Nicolson played. They are family-guys, they got hearts, hence it is hard for undercover cops to 'betray' them. I like old HongKong movies very much. when I said old, I mean ten years before, twenty years before. They were powerful,not full of idiot comedies, which is the case with HongKong movie nowadays. What was really great with Hongkong movies was how they depicted and expressed the appreciation and friendship between guys.It could inspire you like hell. In Infernal Affair , two undercover are not only rivals, but also,more importantly,they appreciate each other. They feel like they could be very good friends if they are not doomed for a fatal confrontation. All this are missing in The Departed. Awful. Don't waste your precious time. I didn't finish it actually.
2.0~who else was fooled? marallu82 Sign in Permalink If the academy was in doubt with Scorsese, now i'm afraid it's him who is in doubt with them. Come on you serious about this movie??. 72 on IMDb??? This really needed to be so complicated??, did the endless ending needed to be that bloody??, do we really need so many main characters to make a good film??, more than two hours long??, Can someone believe this??, why that scene in the graveyard copying the third man??, and the most important thing: what was this film about??, did you feel something??, can't you remember a memorable, touching, funny or innovative scene?? From now on i hate cell phones. PD. I loved goodfellas, casino, raging bull, taxi driver, but that wouldn't stop me.
5.0~Great names, but a great film....? supah79 Sign in Permalink The Departed starts of very promising, but along the way the film loses momentum and credibility. It's a great Hong Kong flick. Why? Because you know it's a comic book, it's not real life. Like the old film noirs from the 40's and 50's: you know you are not looking at real life, but at one dimensional cardboards. And thats great fun! But it's not a great Hollywood flick. Because it tries to add realism to a not so realistic story. The dialogue is very good, but the actions taken by it's characters (who are one dimensional) are a mysteries. If you present it real, you have to explain. If you present it as entertainment, you don't have too. That the main weakness of The Departed for me. Also, it's not a Scorcese picture. It's a bland film, that could have been made by almost any TV director. The actors are great and work with some fantastic dialogue, although Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg really can't act and should stay doing action films. The crew delivers top notch work, but for me: it still doesn't work. It feels to convulted and I have the feeling that (even though the film runs at 2 1/2 hours) most character motivation was left on the cutting room floor.
7.0~Pulls you in. rmax304823 Sign in Permalink "The Departed," a complicated story of two cops undercover on each side of the law, one of them in the pay of head Irish mafioso, Jack Nicholson, has Martin Scorsese's usual dash. It would be hard to mistake the film as having been made by some unimaginative dullard. The camera swoops grandly about, punctuated by the odd overhead shot, the actors perform at their peaks, intrigue informs every act, the violence occurs as necessary and isn't exulted over. Scorcese knows what he's doing. I'm not sure, though, that he's able to get inside this loosely organized bunch of non-Latin thugs, or inside the justice system of Boston. This is a kind of tense story that really belongs in Sidney Lumet territory -- marginalized spies with multiple identities, and lots of frustration. Neither of the spies (Leonardo DiCaprio, the good spy, and Matt Damon, the boyishly charming instrument of Nicholson) manages to show any guilt or ambivalence about their jobs, which leaves the film with a considerable psychological and ethical lacuna. Damon is full of zest and worried about nothing but keeping his gangster boss informed of everything the cops are up to. DeCaprio is a neural shambles but not because he feels queasy about being a spy among people he's come to know. He's just frazzled over the possibility of being outed and killed. Still, everything rolls along so quickly that we hardly miss it. And everything is aided magisterially by the quick-witted dialog. Alec Baldwin, head honcho at the State Troopers asks Damon what happened to a suspected murderer. Damon: "He got knifed in the hawspital." Baldwin: "Yeah, but what I want to know is cui bono? Who benefits?" Damon: "Cui gives a ****? It's all wrapped up with a bow on it." Baldwin blesses Damon, making the sign of the cross in the air, says, "I think you are on your way to becoming a cawp," and buries his face in a bowl of ice water. We have just witnessed about fifteen seconds of cinematic delight. Any weaknesses are not Scorsese's fault, though. Here he's working from a screenplay written by an Irish-American who's given him what amounts to an unusually mechanical plot, and the story itself is lifted from a Chinese source. So it's already gone through three step-up transducers and it's no surprise that it lacks the emotional grip of Scorsese's best work. It's still successful and it gets a lot of help from the cast. Nicholson is hilariously evil with his goatee and those of his improvisations that have been preserved. (When he shoots a babe in the back of the head, he looks down at her body quizzically and remarks, "She fell funny." And, "When there's a cop in my gang and I don't know who it is, I usually kill 'em all.") Matt Damon does a fine job too, and he has his Boston accent down pat. He's so business-like and full of zest as a sergeant in the State Police that he comes across as the kind of cop we all wish were on the job. I haven't seen that much of Leonardo DiCaprio's movies but of the performances I've seen, this is his best. He's rather rattier looking than in the past and he demonstrates a convincing loss of control. There's a woman, too, who physically links the good and the bad undercover cops, who do not know each other. Vera Farmiga isn't synapse-fusingly gorgeous. The bony structure of her face is askew. She looks like a dozen actresses who might be found laboring in the fields of afternoon romantic dramas or support in modest situation comedies, but there's something still that distinguishes her from so many other women who resemble Jennifer Aniston. She can really act. She's not given the best dialog and her character is a little confusingly written but, boy, she can make a simple movement of her hand into a statement. Also she's built. Imagine Cate Blanchett, more petite and slightly lopsided. Ken Wahlberg, as Sergeant Dignam, may give the best performance of all. I enjoyed it. Maybe not immensely, but enough to have found a good deal of pleasure in it.
3.0~Don't understand the hype lndkramer Sign in Permalink I know everybody is crazy about this movie. But just because everybody switches sides on each other doesn't make this a deep movie. How did Nicholson not know that DiCaprio's character was a cop? He acted so nervous and it was obvious. But you know what? I didn't know what anybody was supposed to be by the end of the movie either. Way too confusing. To me this movie was boring, complicated, and nothing amazing. Definitely doesn't live up to all the hype it gets. One thing I did like was Nicholson as a mob boss. I thought it was a cool role for him. Otherwise, I just didn't get this movie. If you're like me, it will leave you scratching your head.
6.0~Disappointing contact-447 Sign in Permalink As a big fan of both Martin Scorsese and the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs that The Departed is based on, I was looking forwards to this film. Sadly I've come away somewhat disappointed. Taking it on its own strengths, it's a decent thriller with a good premise, but it really needed another pass on the script to tighten it up and (sad to say) stronger direction. I love Goodfellas, Casino, Taxi Driver, even The Last Temptation Of Christ. The Departed can't match the narrative or visual flair of those films. The script is full of dead ends and wasted potential, and it doesn't help that the editing is choppy at best, downright sloppy at worst. It's almost as if (despite the two and a half hour running time) half the story and character development has been left on the cutting room floor. The FBI connection never really goes anywhere, the pregnancy comes out of nowhere and goes straight back there, the love triangle never gives the pay-off you expect at the end (such as the identity of the baby's father), Costello's wife is a waste of space who doesn't add anything to the story, the envelope Billy gives Colin's wife is never used for anything, the mainland Chinese gang with their corrupt official in tow seem to have wandered in from Infernal Affairs 3 and are totally irrelevant to the plot, and when they get arrested (off-screen) a couple of scenes later, the target of the bust on Costello's gang just switches from the stolen micro-processors (which vanish into McGuffin Land almost without comment) to a drugs shipment (which appears from much the same place). On the other hand, while Monahan and Scorsese find time for all these narrative cul de sacs, the characters and core storyline are poorly developed. Only Leonardo di Caprio's Billy is really fleshed out, and it's no coincidence that he comes out of the film with one of the strongest performances. The supporting cast in particular is woefully wasted, with actors of the calibre of Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg reduced to virtual cameos. Where the film really suffers though is in comparison to Infernal Affairs. For example - Matt Damon's Colin is one dimensional and uninteresting compared to the equivalent character that Andy Lau plays in IA. Martin Sheen's Queenan doesn't have the same close relationship with Billy that Anthony Wong has with Tony Leung in IA (or the screen time to develop it), making his death far less moving and Billy's extreme emotional reaction to it somewhat bizarre. Making Matt's girlfriend and Billy's shrink the same person was a good idea, but the relationship between Billy and the psychiatrist isn't given as much time to develop as it was in IA. The numerous scenes that The Departed lifts almost verbatim from IA (from Queenan's death and the elevator shoot-out to the encounter at the movie theatre and the smashing of the cast on Billy's arm) mostly come across as pale imitations, lacking the emotion, tension and visual flair that cinematographer Christopher Doyle and directors Alan Mak and Andrew Lau brought to IA. It doesn't help that some of these scenes have been lifted entirely out of context and inserted into a different place in the story. IA's intro is flashy and concise, getting you straight to the heart of the story in double quick time without leaving any room for confusion. By comparison, The Departed takes far too long to set up all the pieces at the start of the film and does it in a rather clunky manner, making the opening a little muddled and long-winded. The constant texting and mobile phone calls in The Departed lack the tension of Tony Leung's morse code messages in IA. And so on and so forth... It's no surprise to me that fans of IA found The Departed a bit of a let down by comparison. It does surprise me to see so many Scorsese fans here waving the flag for what is in my opinion one of his weaker movies. Is The Departed a bad movie? No. Is it a great movie? No. Is it one of Scorsese's best? Definitely not. Is it as good as Infernal Affairs? Not even close.
10.0~Perfect andiscrow1989 Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie and I hadn't even heard of it. When I walked out of the theater I couldn't shut up about it. I've seen well over 500 movies and this is about the 3rd best I have ever seen. The come backs in this movies were coming at you like crazy, I couldn't believe it. It took two of my friends and I to catch most of them. Even if you don't like thrillers or crime movies you will love this movie just for the humor. The entire movie you will be guessing, there are so many turns and twists in the plot you won't expect it to end how it does. If you have not seen this movie you need to go out and rent the DVD when it comes out.
10.0~at last a great adult drama, made for adults that asks you to think philhughes01 Sign in Permalink What a cast Damon, De Caprio, Baldwin, Nicholson, Winstone, Sheen, Wallberg - each of these heavyweights gives a top class performance. Leonardo above all finally breaks away from the the shackles of years of starring in flawed movies (I'm still haunted by the shambles of the The Beach, Titanic and Gangs of New York) to give his best performance to date by a country mile. I saw this movie on the opening night in Auckland and you could feel the tension in the packed movie theatre - the anticipation of what was going to happen next. OK, so the language is a bit choice and some of the violence is a bit full on but it feels at home in this kind of movie - certainly not inappropriate. As I heard a few people leaving at the end say " at last a great adult drama, made for adults that asks you to think as well". A hell of a movie and the best on the circuit at the moment - don't delay.
6.0~Shallow remake ninako124 Sign in Permalink Before I start the review, I have to mention, I watched Infernal Affairs before seeing The Departed. Despite my best intentions not to let this cloud my opinion of the latter film, I'm afraid that it did have some influence. As far as The Departed goes, I have to admit to being rather disappointed for several reasons. The first, and most disappointing aspect of the film, is the acting. Having seen Scorsese's previous works, I expected tight and controlled acting. The performances in this film are anything but. There is a lot of screaming and cursing and overall whining going on. But screaming and cursing do not equate to showing (acting) true anger, and whining has never equaled frustration, hurt or pain before. I don't know how many times I felt like laughing at seeing DiCaprio's or Damon's little whiny boy expressions - which they were, quite frankly, donning the entire length of the film. Wahlberg's constant use of profanity and idiotic lines was also rather morbidly hilarious; I simply couldn't take Dignam seriously. Overall, the acting was rather shallow and uninspired; I still can't understand what so many of the other reviewers found so praiseworthy. Secondly, the entire story falls rather flat for me. The film is overly long, many scenes are rather pointless. Conversely, the timeline is ridiculously short. I mean, what was the reason for spending an entire hour showing the training sequences, then suddenly skipping forward about 4-5 months, during which time DiCaprio has become part of the gang and Damon has been promoted multiple times? This simply does not feel realistic. Also, the film has more plot holes and illogical actions than Swiss cheese. The most glaring one being, why does DiCaprio go for a showdown all by his little lonesome with Damon? If he wants his identity so much, why doesn't he simply contact Dignam? Or send the police force the recordings? Why doesn't he make any of the more logical decisions? Lastly, I couldn't really see any reason for showing the dead bodies so long. I mean, I have nothing against violence in films, with films such as Oldboy and Reservoir Dogs being favorites, but I didn't feel that the long shots of Nicholson's, DiCaprio's and Damon's bodies after they were shot were necessary. Their characters never elicited enough sympathy to make the viewer feel sad about their deaths, thus these scenes felt simply forced. Overall, I have the feeling that the film would not have been half as praised, had not Scorsese been the director. But quite frankly, his days of churning out tight, masterfully crafted films seem to be over.
9.0~Typical Martin ScorseseGREAT! RhysHayes Sign in Permalink Let me get started, this film is great. Like every Scorsese film I've ever seen, I was excited before and after I saw it. Scorsese has made a plethora of films that dip from genre to genre but what I think we all remember him for is his crime films (Remember Goodfellas? That way so good!!!) and I have to say he has returned to this genre with one great film. Maybe the most surprising of the elements in this film is the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as under cover State Police officer Bill Costigan; a part that he plays very well Dare I call him a Badass. Yes I dare. He spends most of the film terrified that he will be caught and I have to say that I felt sorry for the character (though I was a little curious as to why they hired someone with such a nervous disposition to be an undercover cop). All the casting was spot on, with big names all round: Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Matt Damon (As a great Corrupt cop) and even Ray Winstone. Who is great but does have to work harder then the rest of the actors with the distinct Boston accent but that's not a criticism. Based on the brilliant Honk Kong film Infernal Affairs (or Mou gaan dou before someone calls me on it.) it lives up to it. Like the original it has a lot of things going for it. The film takes place in Boston; a city that seems to be have been neglected by the crime story community and with this film following very closely to the tale of Whitey Bulger you get the feeling of echoes of real life. Although the film does have its share of plot holes (i.e. Why would you let a guy who use to be a cop in to your criminal enterprise and when you found out there was a mole in said enterprise why wouldn't he be your first port of call?)The script is faithfully adapted. There's even a good action sequence in it. All in all, this great film is definitely worth the £6 ticket price and I recommend it to anyone. Plus the ending kicks ass!
5.0~Scorsese got his Oscar out of sentiment, not for this embarrassment takseng Sign in Permalink Very, very, very disappointing given the all-star cast. I love much of Nicholson's work, but in this he's not very believable as a crime boss. Nicholson can certainly do the man in charge, but not in this. Leonardo is fairly believable, although he seems to be working hard on looking sullen. Damon is okay, nothing special. Sheen is fairly good but Wahlberg is awful. Sheen has to pretend there's not a bad smell in the room when he's with Wahlberg. We are to believe that his Dignan is expressing real emotion, this is a real tough guy? This story relies on so many twists to carry itself, but the weakness of the characters and to some degree, the plot, is surprising. I didn't hate it, I just hated not seeing the performances I expect from these actors. It was okay as late night entertainment, but this thing won Oscars?
9.0~2006's Golden Goose. Better yet, Scorsese's Golden Goose shamtaker Sign in Permalink This has everything a movie lover could want. Great plot, brilliant storyline and acting that you could die for. This is the golden goose of Martin Scorsese and of 2006. This is what Infernal Affairs U.S is. Guns, Action and a nasty Jack Nicholson which movie buffs have been wanting since his brilliant performance many years ago in 'Batman' as The Joker. If you want a film that shocks, surprises you and leaves you hungry for more, 'The Departed' IS this film. The plot is pretty basic and understandable and the blurb tells you a lot. But you can follow through without becoming all confused (ala Matrix) and the story becomes more and more interesting. You start rooting for the good guys during this one even though the bad characters are really excellent. Especially Ray Winstone. He has a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio that just leaves you breathless (the scene in the bar for those who've seen it). This is Scorse's Golden Goose, all right. :)
9.0~Tragedy (spoiler) schwannomin Sign in Permalink What a cynical film. I don't believe (maybe I don't want to believe) the police are this corrupt. I don't believe that if you try to arrest the bad guy you get shot. Nor do I believe the only effective way to take down the corrupt is vigilante justice. I was becoming depressed and cynical about us (America) about half way through the movie. By the end, I was more disillusioned. The only way to take down the bad guy was to shoot him?! There was no hope to arrest and prosecute him? The guy who grows up on the wrong side of the tracks and tries to live the American dream (pick yourself up by the bootstraps) gets screwed throughout the movie by everyone who should be protecting him. He is thrust into a world where he's killing people (and it bothers him), he becomes increasingly addicted to prescription meds, the girl screws him over, and he get's unceremoniously shot for being the good guy. The guy who comes out of relative wealth and privilege gets the beautiful condo, the girl, the baby, and gets all this because he's corrupt. I'm no idealist about the "american dream," but this was just tragedy.
3.0~Finis coronat opus... du_h Sign in Permalink ...or in this case a finish crowns the film and it truly is a crummy one! I honestly cannot remember seeing such a miserable ending in a long time. As i have already said to my friends i would rather watch Oprah then this movie! And i emphasize here that i never watch heartbreaking lemonade movies... Dear Martin Scorsese what have you been thinking??? Dr. Madolyn Madden is completely shallow, or should i say mistaken character. Det. SSgt. Colin Sullivan isn't any better. Francis 'Frank' Costello: Not even Jack Nicholson can bring depth in such a poor script! Det. SSgt. Dignam...i would rather not comment this character How i see it Ofcr. William M. 'Billy' Costigan Jr. is the only good enough character... don't waste your time on this film, not to mention your money!
5.0~Tries too hard to be clever & fails miserably MiloMindbender Sign in Permalink I rented this because of all the rave reviews, though I must say that after Goodfellas, I don't expect much from Scorsese. While it is watchable & not awful, there are at least 100 films in my queue that would have been more worthwhile. Almost every scene in this movie plays out like a rehash from another movie, so I was surprised to see that this was supposed to be a remake of Infernal Affairs (which I thought was quite good). Nothing in this movie rings true (a psychologist that dispenses drugs to patients after they've asked for them, a chief of police who hires a rat to find out who the rat in the department is, a graduate of the police academy who works his way up to the top in less than a year....the implausibilities are endless). The dialog & plot are quite contrived, the acting is always over the top (everyone has to use expletives all the time). The movie just spends too much time trying to be clever and not enough time developing any believable characters or plot. It's a sad commentary on the poor taste of the masses that a film this bad can get such a high rating.
7.0~Over-rated luke-rex Sign in Permalink This is a good film but not brilliant. I was really looking forward to seeing it as I'm a fan of all of the actors in this film. However, I found the story to be at times a little corny and it lacked soul and depth. It felt as if so much was happening but we have seen this before in cinema. I didn't take anything new away from this film. There were some lovely moments but all being said, I left the cinema a little disappointed. The critics were raving - look at the full page ads in the New York Post and New York Times. The style of the film felt like a non stop video clip. I wasn't keen on the editing in this respect. It was a very different style to Scorcese's other works, brightly lit - it in some ways reminded me of Pulp Fiction - kind of surreal - but not a drama reality. Worth seeing but doesn't come close to Goodfellas. or Casino.
10.0~'The Departed' is what all those critics have been waiting for mildew01 Sign in Permalink When you read reviews of Martin Scorsese's films from the past sixteen years, you'll notice a sense of disappointment with the films, as the critics usually express a dissatisfaction with the main character - arguing that whatever film they're reviewing lacks in comparison to Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, etc. Frankly, I loved Cape Fear, Casino, Bringing out the Dead, Gangs of New York and the Aviator. They are all, in their own ways, unbelievable tour de forces that left me shaking by tail credits. I'm even coming around on Kundun. I usually hate the day a new Scorsese movie opens, because I'm flooded with reviews from critics who are chiding that they weren't graced with another Jake LaMotta. With this movie, they seemed to find the pill easier to swallow, and it's easy to see why. It's bloody, it has a cast full of a-listers, a plot that's been around so long every kink has been ironed out, and Jack Nicholson, who deserves a few more awards for his turn as Frank Costello. I haven't had this much fun watching him since As Good as it Gets - but this time, it's a bit of a guilty pleasure. He is funny, frightening and pathetic all at the same time, a character so large he practically jumps off the screen. But of course, when you watch a Scorsese film, you're watching actors who are willing to take amazing risks because they trust the man at the helm - everyone in this movie gives the performance of their life. So, I was happy yesterday to read the positive reviews in all the trades and papers. Finally, people are starting to ease up on the guy a little. Not every film is Raging Bull, and that suits me just fine. This movie has everything for a Scorsese fan - melancholic main characters, a hint of religious undertone, blood, rock and roll, Thelma Schoonmaker, Michael Ballhaus, and a third act that really gets the blood rate up. I loved it so much, I'll see it again tomorrow.
9.0~Another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films DonFishies Sign in Permalink By far, I think Martin Scorsese is my favourite film director. He has a solid film resume under his belt, and despite losing all five of his Best Director Oscar nominations, continues to pump out movies. When his movies are good, they are usually absolutely fantastic. When his movies are bad, even then they still have some form of redeeming quality saving it from full ostracizing. And while I was a bit apprehensive about him doing a remake of the Asian film Infernal Affairs, I have now realized that I was wrong. The Departed brings Scorsese back to his roots on the mean streets, and back to what he does best. The Departed (named after what people are commonly referred to after passing on) chronicles the stories of two Boston police officers, both involved in the continued case to apprehend infamous mobster, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). One is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a kid with a not-so-great family history who goes undercover within Costello's group soon after graduation. The other, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a member of Costello's group undercover within the police department, quickly moving up the ranks. Costigan and Sullivan do not know each other, but as the film heats up, both began seeking out the other. The film is just about phenomenal. I went in with high expectations, and came out totally and utterly impressed. I refused to watch Affairs on principle of being so hyped for this film, and to a point, I think this helped. I knew some basic outlines and ideas of what happened in the original version, but as they played out on screen here, they look just as astonishing as I could imagine. The film is downright intense during many sequences. The cinematography and editing is seamless and absolutely awestriking. There were a few obvious nodes to his older works, but for the most part, is generally what we have come to expect from Scorsese and his films. As well, the writing is sharp and extremely strong. You may find yourself laughing hysterically at a few of the things people say, but you will also sit in fear of these people. Everyone here is a bad, yet highly realistic person. So when one of these characters makes some great jokes, you will be conflicted as to the proper reaction to give. I had no problem with Gangs of New York or The Aviator, but you could tell that Scorsese was having a bit of trouble with the ambitious projects. Seeing him here, back in the same style of film as the likes of Goodfellas and Mean Streets, just brought a smile to my face after watching the entire film. You can tell the precise touches of a Scorsese film from miles away, and this film is no exception. He brings a fine art out of these dark streets like no one else can. And of course, he has the most perfect music selection of any Hollywood director currently alive and employed. He uses them to make his undeniably brilliant and memorable moments all that much better, and as per always, he succeeds. DiCaprio and Damon are excellent in their roles (albeit it took a little bit before I was very trusting of either of their accents). Their slow deterioration and the fear slowly creeping in on them is an absolutely pleasure to watch. While DiCaprio gets a lot more screen time and is fleshed out more, Damon is definitely the better actor, and had the better performance. These two are believable and frightening all at once. As the film keeps moving and you get more of a sense of who these guys really are, these feelings only continue to progress. Nicholson is in top form here. He chews up scenery left and right, and practically steals the carpet right out from the other two. While I saw shades of The Joker in his performance, this is still one of those essentially totally evil acting roles. You cannot help but be scared by this guy, and seeing such a masterful actor in such a great director's hands, is just too memorable of an idea to miss. The supporting cast, which includes Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Anthony Anderson and Vera Farmiga are all superb in their small roles. None of them can even hold a candle to the other three, but their valiant try cannot go unrewarded. Farmiga and Wahlberg are particular standouts, which didn't not surprise me at all granted his newer material. They are a strong ensemble, and they bring out the great movie watching style even more. If there were anything wrong with the film, it would be the pace of it all. Everyone is on the ball (even through blood-saturated death sequences), but the editing is not completely. At some points, particularly the first hour and the last thirty minutes, the film just whizzes right by. But in others, the film just slows right down. It makes the film feel totally uneven. Some exposition scenes just go a bit too long, and others are just straight and right to the point. I know that the film relies on all the exposition (and the graphic violence, which never lets up), but some of it just felt forced and a bit awkward. They make the film seem a whole lot longer than it really is. It is only a small quibble in an otherwise fantastic film, but still worthy of mention. On the whole, The Departed is one hell of a movie. Packed with strong performances and a great story, this is another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films. It obviously is not as good as some of those films, but it makes an astonishing contribution to the library. I can only hope it is recognized at Oscar time for how memorable a film it is. 9.5/10.
1.0~A real shame sassenachaline Sign in Permalink This film is so overrated. Martin Scorsese gave us a poor copy of the masterpiece "Infernal Affairs" and everybody applause. He received an Oscar for best motion picture for it. It's such a shame, it's revolting. I can understand that they wanted to reward Scorsese for his career but they rewarded a bad remake. 1- It's a lame plagiarism ! 2- DiCaprio is very good,as usual. Maybe HE is the only good reason to see it. But Tony Leung is unforgettable for this character. 3- It's rude for no good reason. 4- It's a 2h30 film. Scorsese did a confused remake that's almost 1 hour longer than the original. There's definitely something wrong here. I'm sure that the people who love this film, didn't see the original. Well, if you read this, go watch Infernal Affairs. You will see that's an amazing film. And you will understand why some people think Departed is awful.
7.0~average, don't deserve so many Oscars. tiancaipipi110 Sign in Permalink first of all, let me tell you guys "the departed" is a remake of a Hongkong movie "infernal affairs". I know most of the people don't know that, that's why I'm writing this. If you like "the departed", go watch "infernal affairs", then you will see the difference, you will know why "infernal affairs" is so much better in 1. characters 2.consistency in the storytelling 3. logically believable 4. decency(which is the Hollywood movie's weakness) second of all, the story is written by a Hongkong writer, it has Chinese DNA in it, no matter if you believe it or not. It is like Hollywood has Hollywood style and Hongkong movie has its own style too. So when you try to make a remake, rewrite the script, you will lose something essential, especially when you are trying to translate a Chinese spirit into a typical American one, it will be almost impossible. For example, I've seen "infernal affairs" 5 times, I cry every time when I see Queenan get threw out of the building. However, in "the departed", I just can't feel it. third, I didn't know "the departed" get 4 Oscars until the second time I try to see it. I mean, seriously??? Well, I have no idea why. But I do have to admit that Leonard is a little bit handsome in this movie loll. But except for him, the rest of the team just sucks..... Jack Nicholson is a really good actor, but shouldn't be chosen for his role. His character suffers a lot unstable situation when he was young, that's how he get to his place in the organization. But in TD, he is just someone abusing his power whatever it cost. Matt Damon is fine, but he is such a typical cocky American, doesn't have that ability to handle his character. Vera Farmiga's part, I would say, is the only part better than "infernal affairs", however, still can't get rid of the Hollywood stereotype..... what should I say, 6 out of 10 is the maximum I can give.
8.0~the movie is good, its worth your time and money, but.......... vic_tjiawi Sign in Permalink I haven't seen any good crime/drama movie for the last couple of month (except Miami vice). but i think this movie is really worth your time and money, i didn't expect that martin Scorsese make a good remake movie, because usually (not all) remakes are are done it turn out bad, but i was wrong, even though not 100% exactly the same from the original movie "Infernal Affair". the departed took all the infernal affair trilogy and make it into one movie well of course it's long, overall 21/2 hours. I only gave this movie 8 because i think there are couple things that are lacks, which is the role choice of each person, Except JAck Nicholson (wow he is just amazing) i think The antagonist character are way much better than the original "infernal Affair Trilogy", because Jack Nicholson looks just like a real mafia/gangster, Eric Tsang i think his face are just too stupid he doesn't have mafia/gangster face. as for the two main character, i think it will be much better if Leonardo and mat Damon switched position. the real mafia rat (andy lau), are more mature, more experience and has meaner face, i think Leonardo is the fittest choice for this character, as for police rat (Tony leung) he looks more younger and less experience type of person, so i think Matt Damon are more fit to be the good guys, and part of if because i think Matt Damon looks dumb too hahah. and the last but not the least, mark whalberg character, i don't think i could find his character in the "infernal affair trilogy", is he playing Leon Lai's Character in Infernal Affair 3 ???? i don't know, ill see it again later, but overall one more time, this movie is good worth your time and money, you guys should watch it.
8.0~Full review viewing_audience Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese's remake of the Hong Kong thriller INFERNAL AFFAIRS (2002) is a thrilling return to form, a psychological gangster film whose diabolically convoluted premise follows two men living double lives, their manufactured identities sustained by a web of lies that simultaneously keeps them alive and strangles their souls. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) grew up in the same tough South Boston neighborhood, each in the shadow of Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, only rarely lapsing into "Here's Johnny!" mannerisms). But while Costello took the orphaned Colin under his wing, schooling him in the ruthless, bottom-feeding code of the streets, Billy was sheltered from Costello's pervasive corrupting influence by his father, the one law-abiding member of a mobbed-up family. Both entered the Massachusetts State Police academy, and each enters an elite division of the force: Colin, the very image of a bright, incorruptible cop, joins the Special Investigations Unit, which is mandated to bring down Costello's empire by any means necessary. Colin ostensibly reports to Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), but is in fact Costello's inside man, keeping his mentor apprised of every move the police make. While still a cadet, Billy is tapped by avuncular Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and foulmouthed Southie Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to work in an ultra-secretive undercover division. Billy's chief qualification is his family's criminal history, particularly his late Uncle Jackie's close relationship with Costello; after Queenan and Dignam arrange his expulsion from the academy and a stint in jail, Billy is perfectly positioned to worm his way into Costello's organization and feed information to the police. The two moles soon become aware of each other's existence, but neither knows the other's identity or that they're connected by therapist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), who's dating Colin and counseling Billy as a condition of his parole. Hidden behind their masks and under ever-escalating pressure to root out the traitor within their respective organizations, Colin and Billy both begin to crumble. William Monahan's screenplay hews remarkably closely to Alan Mak and Felix Chong's convoluted original (though their names are buried in the end credits), but Scorsese makes it his own, from the vivid pop soundtrack to the seething paranoia and spasms of brutal violence. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Ray Winstone a standout as Mr. French, Costello's red right hand.
1.0~Nothing compared to the Hong Kong original! yctsan Sign in Permalink Trust me! Once you see the Hong Kong original, you would find out that Scorsese ruined this terrific play! The original title in Chinese was "Wu-chien-dao", which in Buhdism it means the bottom level of the hell. In this hell, people are doomed for eternity and suffer forever. And in the original, Costigan killed the other guy Costello sent into the force and the movie ends. Costigan has to bear the quilt and live on! This is what the script wants to show! Living but with the quilt is THE true hell after all! The new ending totally ruined the essence of the script underneath. What a waste!
7.0~Good film, but certainly NOT Scorsese's best... Thrashman88 Sign in Permalink THE DEPARTED is a long and intriguing film where opposite rival bands infiltrate each other to gain inside scoop info. The guys who do the "infiltration" are Matt Damon, doing the bad guy on the good side, and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa. The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info. The bad guy of the story (Jack Nocholson )doesn't appear to be all that mean and bad. In fact, you don't feel much for any of the characters, except maybe for DiCaprio's. This aside, the movie moves at a fair pace, although the beginning is a bit slow. By the time the movie's over you hardly notice what's going on. This is a finely crafted movie, big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film, but, in my humble opinion, don't think it deserved a best movie award. I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past: TAXI DRIVER, CASINO, GOOD FELLAS, RAGING BULL, etc. I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around. Having this said, THE DEPARTED isn't a bad movie by any terms! But it is certainly not Scorsese's best.
7.0~Depart This! paulojgraca Sign in Permalink Imagine this: You are a director that no-one have heard about and you make a cinema master-piece. The only problem is that there isn't very much people to see your movie. And then comes... Hollywood! Yeah! And they pick up your movie and made a God damn filthy remake and suddenly everyone is looking at it as a great movie, super-original and all that kind of stuff. Did the director of the original movie gets the merit for doing it? No, the merit goes to Mr. Scorcese. I'm a great fan of Martin Scorcese but in the latest times I haven't seen him making a good movie. Everyone of you that have seen the departed and liked it, please see Infernal Affairs! Your opinion will change. The departed it's just a bad copy/paste of the Asian master-piece movie. Hollywood: shitting on the little guys!
9.0~Amazing debjyoti1981 Sign in Permalink In simple words this movie is just what it takes one man to see beyond entertainment. Though my favorite actor has always been Tom Hanks, recently when I watched Leonardo's 'The Departed' & 'Blood Diamond', I can say one thing he (Leonardo Di Caprio) has really evolved as a great actor. His performance has evolved beyond doubt if one has already seen his other movies like 'Gangs of New York', 'Titanic', 'Romeo + Juliet'.'The Departed' has a good storyline and gives an everlasting impact on the viewers. It really has been successful to portray the risk involved for men working as under cover police. This movie has everything that viewers can ask for 'action' and tons of 'thrills'. I will not go into details on the main plot as it will ruin the excitement for those who have not yet seen.
7.0~Oscar Nominated and Winner? Another Shameful Joke of Hollywood claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to get evidences to arrest him. His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). The protégée of Costello, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello. Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other "rat". "The Departed" is a good movie, with a great cast, but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar. There are dozens of better movies, and even "Donnie Brasco" is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichés and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar. He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner, and he was afraid that it could be a joke. Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Os Infiltrados" ("The Infiltrated")
6.0~Scooby Doo Ending? 36p Sign in Permalink Did they laugh in your theater when everyone started getting shot in the head at the end... because they laughed in my theater... and I laughed too. I mean, it was shocking when Leonardo gets it, but then one right after the other. It felt like a Scooby-Doo ending where they just keep pulling off the masks. I thought the rat on the ledge was going to pull a gun and shoot the camera lens. That would've been worth the $9. I really don't get the hype for this film. Great cast, clever twists, some solid moments, but left me wanting more.
9.0~Give the man an Oscar already! ExpendableMan Sign in Permalink The Departed is another knock-out blow from director Martin Scorsese. A gritty, fast paced and highly impressive cops versus robbers fable that is reminiscent of his old classics and makes for a riveting cinema experience. With the awards ceremony season in full swing and the Oscars just around the corner, it'd be a real shame if he didn't walk away with at least one golden statue having been denied them so long, as it is a very impressive movie. At turns, it is both tense, violent, funny, dark and packed with so many terrific performances it is hard to pick a standout and should hopefully be remembered as one of the best films of 2006. Returning to gangland sees Scorsese tackling the underworld from a slightly different perspective. Set in the world of the Irish mafia, it differs from his Italian-American gangster pictures by showing us contrasting elements on both sides of the law in the shape of Leonardo Di Caprio's police mole within the gang and Matt Damon's gang mole within the police. As the police force led by Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin struggle to take down Jack Nicholson's kingpin, the two moles become aware of each other's existence and are soon caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse. All of which might sound familiar and to no surprise, for as has been widely publicised, The Departed is a Western riff on the classic Hong Kong series Infernal Affairs that told the same story. It might be a little unoriginal, but with a pro like Scorsese at the helm, it avoids the inevitable disaster that awaits most Hollywood remakes (stand up The Ring, The Wickerman, The Fog, The Omen blah blah blah) by the twin virtues of having its own identity and a terrific cast. For where the Hong Kong original was a slick thriller, this one is covered in dirt. The Boston underworld here comes across as a bleak and unwelcoming landscape with little of the criminal romance of Goodfellas to be found. The gangs do not lounge in jazz clubs or casinos here but dingy, whiskey soaked bars and quayside warehouses filled with rats. Urban decay is all too evident and when the violence comes, it hits you like a jackhammer. The gun shots sound incredibly loud and forceful and when they strike human flesh, heads are blown apart with stark realism and zero fanfare. Fist fights as well remain taut and ugly, Di Caprio breaking his own wrist in a brawl through punching too hard as his foe is rammed through a glass window. Violence here has pervaded even everyday life and when Jack Nicholson emerges from the back of a bar drenched in blood with no explanation, it is treated as just one of those things that needs no questions. As previously mentioned as well, the cast is on fire. Di Caprio has banished all memory of the floppy haired teenage heart throb and emerged as an unquestionable successor to De Niro's place as Scorsese's on screen muse. Faced with a life or death situation, he throbs with nervous, aggressive energy and his eyes have never seemed more dangerous, yet he is supposed to be the good guy. Jack let go Rose, Jack let go. Matt Damon meanwhile proves himself once again, his role as Detective Sullivan overflowing with moral dilemmas as the polar opposites of his situation come into conflict. They are not the only ones to be celebrated though as Jack Nicholson puts in one of the finest appearances of his long and glittering career. As mafia kingpin Frank Costello, he moves from one dirty situation to another, delivering racist barbs to Chinese gang members and having people murdered with a wicked grin etched on his face, displacing his venom with a malicious sense of humour. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver fine performances as reliable old hands but perhaps it is Mark Wahlberg who comes out strongest. His Captain Dignam is one of the most hard-assed police officers you're ever likely to see and he encapsulates him perfectly, as well as getting some of the film's best lines. With this and Four Brothers it could be argued he is trying to cap the market for overly macho, angry young men but it must be said, he is one of the most memorable things in the movie. However, if one thing stands in the way of this film and the Oscars it is the undeniable remake syndrome. For all its strong points, it is still a retelling of an existing story and the lack of total originality might be to Scorsese's disadvantage. Nonetheless, it puts paid once and for all to the argument that remakes are a waste of time and is a very worthy version of the Hong Kong original.
7.0~The Departed - very good, but don't get carried away. jeremy_campbell Sign in Permalink Highly entertaining as this film is, it should not be Oscar worthy. It only goes to show the relative paucity of good Hollywood films in the past year that it has managed to get five nominations. How a loyal remake of a fanciful gangster film can be up for Best Film and Best Director is beyond me. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it, and it could have carried on for another 30 minutes and still gripped me. Each actor was excellent, Wahlberg and big Jack stole the show. But it seems to have escaped everyone's notice that the plot is comic book stuff. Goodfellas this is not. That film was entirely believable (for a start, it's a true story), and its impact was consequently much deeper. This is fantasy cops and robbers stuff, and is typical of the -sometimes excellent, sometimes dire - Hong Kong cop genre. These films are almost always forgettable, the focus on immediate gratification. Adapting the story to a more western format took some skill, and should not be underestimated. The Bostonian flourishes and character development, particularly with Di Caprio's role, were commendable. But ultimately this is a television soap plot. It is great fun, and should not be missed. But to suggest it is Oscar worthy is too much. Scorsese may get the sympathy vote as Best Director, but anyone suggesting this is his 'masterpiece' should take a long second look at Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy and Raging Bull, which remains one of the best Hollywood films ever made, and a true masterpiece. The fact that Scorsese failed to get Academy Awards for all of these is remarkable, but don't let it fool you. The Departed is great entertainment, and for that we should be thankful. Raging Bull is something more than just entertainment, and that is what Scorsese should be remembered for, Oscar or not.
9.0~Best of the Year! mimi_0414 Sign in Permalink I must admit that I went into the viewing of the film expecting it to be only OK, something to view on a Saturday afternoon. I left the theater wanting to applaud. While the film isn't flawless, it has great acting, a well-written script and good direction. I was glued to my seat immediately. I was worried about Leonardo. Yes, he has a handful of good performances on his resume, but the bad choices outweigh the good ones. You never know if he will actually be able to nail the part. Within 5 minutes you knew he would nail this one. If he doesn't get Oscar and Golden Globe nominations something is wrong. This is one of his best performances. His intensity is honest to the character. This is his film. The rest of the cast is awesome. Jack is a little over the top, but the audience allows it. Matt is, well Matt. He knows how to play this character. Basically he offers nothing new from what he has given us in other roles. There is a hint of charisma in some earlier scenes, but for the most part he doing just enough to make the character believable. The supporting cast is great. The movie is well casted. I loved infusing actors who were actually from MA. The violence wasn't over the top. The story was excellent. These actors had a great script to work with and the direction makes this film a modern day classic. I am purchasing it as soon as it comes out on DVD.
3.0~Great plot line, but got ruined fast (maybe spoilers) poetess1558 Sign in Permalink I love complex movies, so I had high hopes for this one. I don't think I'm that much of a goody-two-shoes, but a movie where every other word is a curse is very hard for me to stomach. It's irritating, unnecessary, and it bogs down the plot. I really liked how the two moles had to live two lives, it was neat. But there was too much swearing, the main female character was a (insert whatever derogatory word you want here), and the ending was a bloodbath. I mean really, do we need to see that much gore? I don't think so. There's something to be said for realism, of course, but that only goes too far. I guess it wasn't my kind of movie after all.
9.0~Scorsese proves why he's America's best living filmmaker stonecoldmark Sign in Permalink Today I went to see a movie, I really didn't start hearing about until the past few weeks. While the internet has been the cause for much time away from my family, I never really seek out movie info, part of me still likes the surprise of seeing trailers at the theater, but I also have adopted a "I'll see it when I believe it" attitude when it comes to movies in the works. I have other things to do than bad mouth movies that have not even come out yet... with that being said.... I went to see the latest Martin Scorsese film "The Departed". First of all "Goodfellas" is easily the top 2 of my favorite films of ALL TIME (right up there with "Empire Strikes Back"). I have seen "Goodfellas" easily over 20 times in it's entirety. I am in the camp that believes that Martin was robbed of the Oscar in 1990, by Kevin Costner and his "Dances with Wolves". Don't get me wrong "Dances" was a good film, but I really think that for me it lacked the emotional journey and overall power that "Goodfellas" had. GF is film-making at it's best and honestly "The Departed" is like a breath of fresh air that's missing from so many big Hollywood films. Like many, I believe that Scorsese is arguably the best American director still alive today. Admitingly I was not a huge fan of the "Avaitor", and while "Gangs of New York" had it's flaws, it was still an enjoyable film. Of course films like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and Mean Streets stand on their own through the test of time. The film centers around Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who is an undercover cop working inside Frank Costello's (Nicholson) gang and Colin Sullivan (Damon) who plays a cop working as a spy for Costello and his crew, keeping the Boston police off his tail. What follows for the next 2 and a half hours is an intricate crime drama with richly developed characters and an often vulgar, blood soaked story that will have you fully enthralled for the duration of the film. I don't want to spend all this time discussing the plot, I don't want to be put in the position of spoilers and giving away the best parts of the film. I am here to say that this is easily the front runner for the best film of 2006. Scorsese returns to his mobster roots and does not miss a beat. For a Scorsese fan all his signatures are there, from a soundtrack that could not relate better to the images on screen, to the brutality of the violence... This is no cheesy WWE John Cena film, this is a raw, bloody "R" rated movie for all the right reasons. This combined with the Boston setting make this a choice film for this boring time of yawn inducing October releases. The cast is suburb, Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson are all equally amazing. Nicholson especially pitch perfect as Frank Costello, the aging crime lord that gets the sense there is a cop in his crew. Matt Damon is also amazing as the prick dirty cop working for Costello keeping him out of harms way. DiCaprio of course proves why he is worth every penny and this role really solidifies that he is the real deal. On a side note I find it funny that Ben Affleck gets tons of press, but has been in only one good movie ("Chasing Amy"), but friend Damon, has not only been getting quality roles, but roles that make money as well. While these are the key players, they take nothing away from an amazing supporting cast including Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg and Martin Sheen, all do an amazing job in bringing very complex, unforgettable characters to blistering life. Worth a second, and third viewing, just to watch the acting alone, but also to really immerse yourself in the complex world of cops and criminals. Highly recommended, and worth every penny. This holds up as a very good reason than great movies can still be made. It's just sad that there are not more movies that are of this quality.
10.0~Best Crime Drama of the Decade JetBanana Sign in Permalink I haven't been so blown away by a film in a long time and this immediately got put on my favorite movies list. I've seen comments left by other users who are fans of Infernal Affairs which is the film The Departed is based on. They bashed this movie saying it was "too americanized" or "the characters were ruined" but i feel differently. The original movie Infernal Affairs was good, but I can't say I liked it as much as The Departed. Many things highlight this movie such as a diverse group of characters and personalities, a VERY strong cast, excellent acting by all cast members, and a plot that took my breath away. The moment I walked out of the movie theater I said to myself "that one's gonna win Best Picture" and it did. Enjoy this milestone of a film and remember it for years to come.
9.0~Very good, but not classic. RevengeOfBobRoss Sign in Permalink The Departed was a movie that I had wanted to see for quite a long time due to the hype. I've heard it being described as better than Goodfellas. I've heard it being described as Scorcese's best. It is neither. Don't get me wrong, the film is good. But it's not without it's flaws. The film's strong suit is the characters and the dialog. You feel for the characters, and the banter between them is wonderful.The film does an excellent job of blurring the lines of cop and crook, but herein lies a problem. The lines are blurred so much that the film is unbelievably hard to follow, and the plot certainly has holes. There is a lot to catch, even in two hours and thirty-one minutes. And of course the shocking ending. The last 5 minutes of the movie confused the hell out of me, and I can't help but think that if they gave the movie more time and tweaked the plot and the ending, it could have been what people were hyping it to be. It's got great action, great dialog, great characters, and great acting. What it is lacking is continuity. Overall, it's good enough for an 8/10, but it is certainly not the best film of the year, IMO.
10.0~an awesome adaptation of the Hong Kong original dosh345 Sign in Permalink The best American crime movie i've seen in recent years only I've seen the original HongKong version 3 years ago. Just the same it was as powerful, as intense and as awesome as the original. The only difference was the setting Boston-Irish cops and mafia for The Departed, Hong Kong cops and triads for Inferanl Affairs. Leonardo DiCaprio played the role as intense as Tony Leung did in the original movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS. I love Jack Nicholson. The Costello role (originally played by Eric Tsang as Sam) will definitely add another feather to his cap. I recommend that you guys see the original first, INFERNAL AFFAIRS 1-3 then go see the THE DEPARTED. Both films will blow you away. Promise!
4.0~What's a spoiler? rboysdad Sign in Permalink Who is to blame for this film? Couldn't be starrier. Interesting story. But the script was shockingly shockingly bad, and the direction pitiful. Loved the death and destruction, but that's all there is here. Just a designer film gone bad. Oh lord, and now I see I've got to write at least ten lines for my comment to be accepted. Well, I've come this far, gone through the registration process and everything, so as to be able to add a comment. I should get a life I think. But it's sad, when all the right ingredients are brought together in one place and the result is a damp squib. Couldn't call this film a disaster, particularly if you see it on DVD, then you can keep pausing and going away and pottering about and then coming back...think that's my ten lines?
10.0~Proper Gangsta movie! mark-fullam Sign in Permalink For all you Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas lovers out there.. you MUST see this movie. its got everything - violence, blood, great 1 liners, great actors, good story.. the lot! I was hooked on this from the first moment I saw it... its a great movie. The Cranberry Juice Bar scene is a classic, along with a many others.. I thought Jack Nicholson deserves a nomination for his character... it was superb.. Technically, the camera work is excellent, some of the ways Scorsese has filmed are just pure genius. It really made you get into the film. The language is course, so if you don't like the "Cee U Next Tuesday", then don't go and watch it!. The soundtrack is also very good and matches the mood of the film very well. Overall this is the best film I have seen all year.. by far... I WILL be buying this 1 on DVD... 10 out of 10!
9.0~Best Movie Of The Year joaocruzferreira Sign in Permalink The real story in "The Departed" is in the dualities of DiCaprio and Damon's characters. Di Caprio is a cop with familial ties to crime who works as an undercover spy, whereas Damon is Colin Sullivan, ganglord Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) plant posing as a cop. Each frame of this crime drama crackles with the kind of visual energy that's trademark Scorsese. We thrill to every cut and camera movement here because, like all of Scorsese's movies, they try to push the boundaries of cinematic language. The cast is terrific, with the standouts clearly being Matt Damon and believe it or not, Mark Wahlberg. There were also outstanding performances by: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Vera Farmiga. Overall, it's a very fascinating look into the meaning of what it is to be a rat within a morass of a world in which everyone is a rat of different sorts. This movie confirms that Leonardo DiCaprio is Scorcese's new Deniro. Another excellent work by Scorcese! 9/10
5.0~I Couldn't Wait to Depart from the Violence ** edwagreen Sign in Permalink Martin Scorsese, the master of gang epics, is at it again. This time in "The Departed," he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem. The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson, who portrays a vicious criminal, is right on target. His antics are terrific. Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police. Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction. The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities. One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston, the other is a cop working for the mob boss. You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor. The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear. Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops. The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount. This film is certainly not for the squeamish.
10.0~This time, they gotta give Martin Scorsese an Oscar. lee_eisenberg Sign in Permalink The 79th Annual Academy Awards will run tomorrow night, and "The Departed" is one of the Best Picture nominees. All that I can say is that they have to award Martin Scorsese this time. "The Departed" hits you like I have almost never seen in a movie. It is an absolutely great movie in terms of the acting. First, we get narration from aging mafioso Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He's been pragmatic about many things throughout his life, but he's never given up his life of crime and being one of the nastiest people whom you could imagine. Then, there's Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), joining Boston's police force but secretly infiltrating the mafia. Next, there's Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), one of Costello's acolytes secretly infiltrating the police. Add psychologist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) to the mix, and you have a practically explosive situation. One thing that you should understand about this movie is that almost every character is a total creep and there are basically no good guys; Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) is particularly bad. With all these characters being so vile, it is no surprise that we see violence and brutality that movies almost never show. It's the sort of stuff that makes you feel like the characters are pounding your face in. Don't be surprised if you walk away from "The Departed" feeling very shaken up. And you'll probably never want to be a cop after watching this. Anyway, I say that even if they don't give the movie Best Picture, they gotta give Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar. His direction is top notch (as is almost every other aspect of the movie). I wholeheartedly recommend it. Also starring Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Kevin Corrigan.
10.0~An explosive crime-thriller! Could be the best movie of the year. starlit-sky Sign in Permalink Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) are two new Police Academy graduates who are trying to make it into the police department. However, Colin has been raised by the notorious Irish mafia crime-lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and is only there to infiltrate the police dept. He makes it through the interview and becomes an employee of the unit whereas Billy is denied the same opportunity. Instead, Billy is offered to take an assignment as an undercover cop to infiltrate the mafia. But this is a very special assignment and only two police officers, Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) know that Billy is actually a cop. So, we have two men each working secretly for the other side and no one, except their bosses, knows their true identities. Soon, each side realizes that there is a mole in their unit and tries to uncover his identity. That's when things start to get tricky. As each party tries to inform their boss about the possible future actions of the other side, it turns into a dangerous game. Colin warns his boss Costello ahead of time because he knows about the operations of the police department and Billy tries to inform Oliver and Dignam about what Costello is up to. This is truly an excellent film that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The plot is very well-written and, despite the many twists and turns, it feels completely natural. I feel the need to say a few things about Leonardo DiCaprio. I have always liked his acting but his performance in this movie is truly magical. He has matured as an actor and he completely steals the show in this one. He is explosive! All the other actors are actually performing very well. I am not a big fan of remakes and this is a remake of an originally a 2002 Hong Kong movie, "Mou gaan dou" (see the name Siu Fai Mak in the writing credits; he is the screenplay writer for the original movie). Having said that, I must admit that this movie really blew me away and I am not a kind of guy who is easily blown away. This could be the best movie of the year.
9.0~Martin Scorecese is finally liberated... Villemar Sign in Permalink There is not too much to say that hasn't been already said. Let me just add that with this movie, Scorcese has been liberated from the cultural obligation to make an EPIC movie. With this, he has been freed to just make a great MOVIE. There are no grand passion plays here. Just a damn good story. The ending was a little bit ruined for me because IMDb or Yahoo entertainment news or some other piece of fluff article spoiled it when they speculated on the possibility of making a sequel. Shame on them! Also, why does Scorcese have to include "Gimme Shelter" in all of his trailers and movies? I can just imagine him trying to include it in "Kundun" for crying out loud! Although with that one exception, the soundtrack was superb. This is Leo's best performance to date....clearly the most understated yet. It amazing to watch him get exponentially better and better with each and every role. All of Leo's past sins have been completely, 100% absolved at this point as far as I'm concerned. All in all, a superb and riveting movie.
5.0~Could have cut an hour out daniel-mkatz Sign in Permalink I have no Idea why this has been getting such great reviews. Granted, if Scorcese had carried on like he did in the first 40 minutes of the movie, this could have been brilliant, but I think he's getting slow in his old age. At about halfway through this movie you'll see what I mean. Suddenly there is too much going on at once and it turns into a stupid "everybody suspects everybody else" cop drama with ridiculous plot twists to boot. The last 20 mins are totally stupid and unnecessary, so I would walk out before they start. Other than that, it's not all bad. Leo and Jack Nickolson put in some stellar performances and the soundtrack is pretty good. Still, only a 5/10
10.0~the deratted pookey56 Sign in Permalink i would be lying if i said i understood this film the first time i saw it. and; i would be lying again if i said i understood it much better the second time around, although the message was clear from the beginning. i can only tell you this: 1)the score was familiar. Scorsese loves the stones. there were some great Irish tunes as well, and lots of the incomparable Patsy Cline, and the original music by Howard Shore was very good. 2) this was a dream ensemble cast. why Nicholson, Damon, and Di Caprio were overlooked is beyond me. Finally, some recognition for Mark Wahlberg, 3)the editing, particularly the sound editing, was phenomenal. kudos to the entire sound department. it reminded me of the work by the late great Akira Kurosawa, in RAN....well, maybe not quite THAT good, but good... 4) the production values were second to none. 5) the complexity of this screenplay, quite frankly, is brilliant. Very much like last year's CRASH, but in a much much different way, Scorsese shows us that good and bad intertwine like the precision of a spider's web. After a while, i couldn't tell who was good and who was bad. Nobody was good. And a mass murderer could appreciate opera and the ironies of life. This was the point in the film. and it was relentless. The satisfaction of the last scene, when the awol Dignam (Wahlberg)shows himself, was perfection. Even after having lauded this film for it's many areas of pure perfection, it doesn't mean that i particularly enjoyed it. But it was brilliant craft. This is finally Scorsese's year. Best Director is his, despite the very real argument that Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima was better directed. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs, i recommend you give it a watch. Scum on any surface tends to collect in one mass over time. But life thrives, even in a cesspool.
10.0~The Departed coolfortheone Sign in Permalink Yeah so everyone who knows anything about movies has heard the fuss being made over the new Martin Scorsese movie The Departed starring Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. Many critics are saying it is Scorsese's best directed movie since the 1990's classic Goodfellas, and it deserves to sweep the Oscars this year. I have had the pleasure of seeing it twice during its opening weekend and I strongly agree with the above praise. The Departed is an American re-telling of a Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs and it has a very complex plot but here is a general summary from IMDb. "In South Boston, the state police force is waging war on Irish-American organized crime. Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio giving some of his best work to date) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (the legendary Jack Nicholson). While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon, also at his finest) a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there's a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy-and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save himself. But is either willing to turn on the friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover?" Like I said above it is a very complex story, which is fitting because the two moles in each organization lead very complex lives. It is a thematically rich yet wildly entertaining movie about honor, duty, loyalty, and identity. It is not just an action/crime flick. The movie breezes by at a pace that feels like much less then its 2 hour and 30 minute running time. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best acting performance in the film and once again proves he is one of the finest actors of his generation. The terrific acting from the entire cast (also including Martin Sheen, Mark Whalberg, and Alec Baldwin), sharp screenplay written by William Monahan, and Martin Scorsese's brilliant direction make The Departed a masterpiece. Scorsese is one of the very best American directors of all time. With this film he is exploring the gritty mobster territory that got him recognized over 30 years ago with his breakout hit Mean Streets (1973), yet at the same time telling a fresh and interesting story to make The Departed unique from his other work (unlike 1995's Casino which is basically just a Goodfellas ripoff). I really think he will finally get a long overdue Oscar for best directing, an award he should have received multiple times in the past. The Departed will continue to be discussed in film circles for the next few months until Oscar night comes around, here is hoping it will dominate the ceremonies. It is one of the best films of the current decade as well as one of Scorsese's best films.
10.0~Excellent kymmr2 Sign in Permalink Wow. I just saw this movie today, and man was it great. This movie is definitely all it is hyped to be. The acting was superb from all four of the major characters, and the rest of the cast. The suspense of this movie will have you on your a** the entire way. The story starts out kinda slow, but it speeds up as the movie progresses, and never slows down, or becomes to quick for the audience. The ending is very shocking to me, but you will be cheering when the last gunshot is fired. I liked this movie so much, I think it may be nominated for an Oscar, all for acting, Directing, Screenplay, and best picture. One of the best pictures of the year. 10/10
