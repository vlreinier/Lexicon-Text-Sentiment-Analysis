5.0~Silly storyline michelvega Sign in Permalink Ho hum! The planet is dying. No more astronauts needed, farmers needed now, 'cause the crops are failing... What the heck will the farmers do in a dust bowl? It happened once and they went to L.A. So the astronaut turned farmer finds a secret NASA base next to his corn field. Turns out his daughter will grow up to be another Einstein. So, said astronaut-farmer goes out in outer space to save Mankind and fights with another astronaut on another world, and blah, blah, blah. Oh! And there's this black hole, really the star of the film, no pun intended, not to mention the many down to Earth holes in the plot. Very disappointing. On the plus side, the photography is nice. If you don't know anything about space, or about science, do go see it. It might blow your mind. If it gets people to care a bit more for the future, that's worth a passing grade in my opinion.
8.0~Great movie thranemeister Sign in Permalink Well, it was indeed a great movie. The plot twist was exactly as expected and very similar to Inception :) Mathew is acting alright and that girl; Jessica Chastain; she's hella fine - oh yeah, her acting's good too :P There's not much more to say about this movie; great special effects. The physics of the movie is a little intricate. If you know the least bit about relativity you're gonna have a good time. I'm pretty sure there's some pretty big holes and flaws in the movies theories of relativity. I enjoyed this movie, a lot. You will too!
3.0~I curse the father and the daughter go to hell with passion thebestevermail Sign in Permalink The father and the daughter are the most hated characters in the film. I cursed them go to hell and never return. i couldn't stop wishing the father and daughter to die, they are so hateable. dialogs are boring and cheesy, Matthew mcpconaughey, can you please spit out the candy in your mouth before you start talking? this film has so much potential to be a good epic, but it was ruined by these father and daughter cheesy drama play. i don't mind the flawed plot, i actually enjoyed the idea of multiple dimension, black hole , wormhole, i knew it is impossible to go through a black hole, but i like it. two alien planets are both cool to look at, over all i don't feel the massive visual production was made in this film. i didn't get to see the entire galaxy , no even a over looking solar system. i can feel it was film in the studios. in conclusion, this film will do much better without the father and daughter. ( to sad they are the main characters)
1.0~Awful Film TheTruthDoor Sign in Permalink The good reviews of Interstellar on IMDb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies. The current IMDb rating is 9.1......no way in hell is that an accurate rating. This movie is awful...period. How could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie? I really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it. The actor list reads like a "who's who" of movie stars. But I cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it. Trust me, don't waste 3-hours of your life on this film. You will regret it, just like I do.
10.0~Best Movie of all-time amirardavan Sign in Permalink No doubt! Best movie ever . Amazing storyline with awesome music . amazing work Nolan . Most realastic Sci-Fi .
6.0~Not such a big deal Lomedin Sign in Permalink We have to start by acknowledging that C. Nolan has been, for a while, Hollywood's golden boy and, as such, people will undoubtedly deify him; such is the dynamic of this strange and absurd system we live in. Thus, we can understand all the hype this movie receives, regardless of its authenticity. As, for me, from the beginning, after the "ghost" is mentioned, I saw clearly how that was going to develop; such obviousness scores quite a few negative points for the Nolan brothers' imagination, creativity and originality. Something disappointing, taking in consideration some of the previous works. There's definitely more predictability in this movie than in previous ones, or so was my impression. Particularly, I see a bit too many similarities in ideas, cinematography and even music, to 2001. Apart from that, all that sentimentalism could have been turn down a notch, and clearly the whole "love" concept. Still, there's much less of that than what you can find is the vast majority of productions nowadays (something that tells us how low the level of quality of movies and series is). Interesting how Matthew McConaughey was also involved in Contact, a movie that also touches one or two points present in Interstellar. Fortunately, the level of sentimentalism doesn't reach those of Contact and, even better, this movie doesn't dwell in god and such nonsense (something which killed Gravity for me). Although the special effects are no doubt very good, all the talk about IMAX and so on made me expect something much more impressive in that department. The story itself was, for me, a bit weak, and some points seemed to be connected with each others just "because", or by very fragile threads. For all the praise I've heard about Interstellar "science", I've seen a good few unexplained "scientific" events in the movie which just seem to be taken for granted, and I can't see the science behind them anywhere. The fact that this is a story -once again- about how to make humanity survive didn't help my opinion, since there's no real intelligent reason, apart from selfishness and survival instincts, to see our species perpetuated along with its destructive behaviour towards all other lifeforms and itself. That makes me connect to the "fake moon landing" scene, and how all these recent NASA movies might be part of some sort of propaganda machine to, once more, makes us look up to the stars instead of caring more for our planet and trying to stop and reverse all the misery we have been, for centuries, bringing upon it and all its inhabitants. Alas, not a bad movie to watch, but certainly not the shining jewel they want us to believe this is. As I said at the beginning, that's how the system (and thus, the masses), work.
4.0~Inconsistent story about human emotions - not interstellar travel Calus Sign in Permalink Interstellar is visually spectacular and carries an important message that we must look up from the dirt and reach for the stars if we are to survive. Unfortunately it takes the vast wonder of the universe and reduces it to some cheap action filled thrills which make little sense. Our "little" galaxy has an incredible span filled with an astonishing number of stars - anything from 100 to maybe 400 billion stars. We have the mysteries of the galactic core, the other spiral arms, nebulae and so much more - but this movie dismissed them all in favour of a fantastic journey to bizzaro worlds that defy all we know of physics in a galaxy far, far away. As soon as the crew land on the first world the over-the-top action starts where they make stupid mistakes, but then miraculously survive anyway in ways that make very little sense. Worse, the crew exploring these wonders care nothing for the amazing things they are privileged to see and experience. Speaking of the crew, be prepared for the usual Hollywood mix of moron and genius. These are as usual people able to casually solve complex scientific problems, but struggle with simple logic and deduction in making most of their decisions. The story of the blighted earth dying of starvation and regressing is poignant, but sadly full of inconsistencies. If only corn survived as portrayed, practically void of nutrients as it is, it would be game over. Good thing also that everyone seem to be behaving like model citizens as it looks like the military (and maybe also police?) has closed shop. So when the world collapses with mass starvation everyone just puts down their guns and gets along. Let us also assume that although the blight is something we cannot figure out and stop, but we would not take it with us into space and to other worlds...? Why then build our space habitats on the ground in the remote hope that we'll figure out a way to turn-off gravity?!? If we have the resources to send dozens of sophisticated, long-range space missions off on a hopeless cause - why is nobody building bases on the moon? Sending people - and not least robots(!) - to Mars and busy bringing back asteroids for building vast cylinder habitats IN ORBIT!!! Worst case scenario, if you can't bring the people up, then just grow the food in space and drop it down. I'm not even going to get into the whole future-past-paradox with multidimensional peep-rooms behind the bookshelf. In the end this movie is not about science fiction, space exploration, human survival or any of that. It is a story of love and loss designed to tug at your heartstrings and wow you with visuals sprinkled with some over the top disasters that they cannot possibly recover from... If your switch off all your critical thinking and watch this in the cinema with low-expectations you might be able to enjoy the ride.
1.0~Not Stellar, Not Even Close TheCinemaMan Sign in Permalink Take the nonsense of Inception, multiply by about 1000, add some soap opera moments and you get Interstellar. I don't have to check the spoiler box because there is nothing to spoil, or, rather, there is everything...to spoil. But there isn't time enough to call out the instances of bad dialog, poor acting, lousy hair jobs, words strung together that sound interesting but mean nothing, contradictions galore, real black holes (aka plot holes), one liners designed to emotionally hook the audience 'cause there ain't no substance, visuals to distract 'cause there ain't no substance, deus ex machinas as needed (and they are too frequently needed), etc. and so on, oh, did I mention bad evil mixing?. And for those of you whiners about "hate", no, this isn't about "hate"; it's about the lack of sound movie making. The only "sound" movie making principle followed is...you get a hap hap happy Hollywood ending. In sum, a Shakespearean epitaph is appropriate: full of sound and fury signifying nothing. P.S. I did enjoy the music but, my bad, could've gotten that for a lot less investment of time and money.
6.0~I wanted to like this film thefonz1 Sign in Permalink This movie really disappointed me. I liked Christopher Nolan's films and made sure I read very little about this before I went to see it. It is ultimately about a man who loves his children. You can tell he loves his children because he never stops going on about them. He runs the full gamut of emotions showing his love for his kids like a deranged single mother on Facebook constantly posting "Like if you love your children" Anyway he goes on a space mission and leaves his beloved children to save the world. Whilst in space he discovers a fat Matt Damon who has apparently run out of provisions, judging by the size of him I found that hard to believe. The film looked and sounded great but I couldn't get over the man constantly moaning and thought the ending was a bit obvious and ripped off 2001 and Contact. The best bit was when fat Matt Damon died.
8.0~I Have No More Nails Anymore. tyler-ruse Sign in Permalink This movie was amazing, truly amazing, some parts sad and others happy but mostly tense. The ending when she is older and they are on Saturn was pretty good, I would like it if it was before he left. But amazing, must see! It is also some times confusing but you'll maybe get it later. All I'm saying is that this movie is awesome and haters gonna hate. But why don't they try to make something better? Just saying. But the ending goes right back to inception again and makes it better in every way possible. There are some weird parts that make NO SENSE at all but are pretty cool. One of Nolan's masterpieces next to The Dark Night and Inception! Some deaths but mostly off screen and a robot, not like the one you made as a child, this robot is epic and has humor 70 percent.
2.0~I was disappointed kreptup Sign in Permalink From fictional nonsense to lacking in explanation as to main events taking place in the show - I would not recommend this movie. Without modern day astrophysics and scientific knowledge it was tough not to continuously mention how silly a movie this is, especially when it gets to the climax. If I were interested in fiction and or religious ideology and not having understanding of why events unfolded the way they did in this movie, I may not have scolded my TV set as much. :) Move a wormhole near Saturn? How would that work in reality? What were they thinking to add such silliness into the plot? My family was not impressed by the riddles.
2.0~Dull, over-long better read a good book or watch 2001: A Space Odyssey edubarca46-1 Sign in Permalink This is perhaps the worst space movie I've ever seen. Confusing, useless dialogue, over-long, slow, boring. The director tried to copy 2001 A Space Odyssey with no luck. Better watch this film or read a good book. The plot is easily understood by scientists like Carl Sagan or Stephen Hawkins but not for Joe Average, black holes, gravity effect etc. It shows interesting subjects but they could have been better written, making the movie much more attractive and interesting. What a waste of good acting and nice production design. One of the worst aspects of the movie is that actor McConaughey doesn't vocalize clearly and it is very difficult to understand his words. He must study with Henry Higgins (My Fair lady) so he can learn some phonetics!! But he is a very good actor, wasted on this film.
5.0~Nolan does an Armageddon vikascoder Sign in Permalink SPOILER FREE BEGINS ********* I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics. Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about "Gravity"s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an "Inception" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon. SPOILER FREE ENDS ******** Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the "Aliens" or "They" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work ("Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills ("oh we lost so many years"). And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell. And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it "Original"? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground. And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore. I don't think even the fanboys can save this one.
3.0~Interstellar light years from stellar garman-productions Sign in Permalink Interstellar is another example of the continued deterioration of Christopher Nolan and his writing partner and brother. This movie is really a jazzed up version of "Ghost" and "Back to the Future" in many ways and that is in a serious science fiction movie, of course, a bad thing. It is pretentious, preachy, and cliché ridden and has the Nolan mark of some nice visuals but dragged down by haphazard and illogical storytelling. Instead of being an exploration of the astrophysical possibilities of transcending the vastness of space, it starts out as a soap opera and ends in a ludicrous manner with the impossible survival of the main character passing through a black hole. Michael Caine essentially plays the same character as in the Batman movies and that is becoming tiring to me. Matthew M. sometimes mumbles his lines, maybe embarrassed by what he is supposed to say; but hey it's Christopher Nolan, right?! Anne Hathaway is not believable at all and miscast. The rest of the cast is acting as if in a SyFy original movie. No memorable characterizations or lines in a nearly three hour movie. And at 200 million dollars to produce and promote it just proves that if "big names" are associated with a project anything can get made. When watching this movie I kept hoping something would be adequately resolved but the ridiculous last 15 minutes on top of the poorly written first two hours demonstrate that Nolan should stop making movies to try and "dazzle" and make movies that actually have a good story and good characters. As an example of a bad story; in the beginning the audience is told that the world is in a drought but Matthew's character drives through a big green cornfield. Huh? And his truck has a flat tire and he never gets stuck in the field. That kind of illogical depiction continues throughout the movie. Overall, a non stellar work from a self important deteriorating director.
1.0~The best example of a really good advertisement movie in years helq-166-550286 Sign in Permalink This movie is not a 1 in reality, it's more a 5-6, but i need to make that stupid average rating go down. I couldn't understand why this movie has a 9.0 in IMDb. But now reading the comments here I finally get it, it's good advertisement, the best advertisement that I have seen in many years. This movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics (or normal physic) and you have seen enough movies in your life. Because there are way too many clichés and too many pseudo-physics, not fake physics like the Disney's films, pseudo-physics like 'ancient aliens' from "History" Channel. PS: Sorry for my English.
1.0~Save yourself mmiller-26803 Sign in Permalink I wish I could tap out a message in binary code to my past self to avoid this movie. While the acting wasn't awful and the premise could have been compelling, it bit off a whopping whale of a idea with the jaws of a pill bug. When you have three hours, an amazing cast, a whopping budget, and music composition and special effects to support the most incredible dream of a galactic adventure, please don't waste it on over-dramatic emotional tangents, obviously impossible feats of physics, and narrow-minded notions of the future. Have some respect for the institution of science and hire one adviser with any knowledge of quantum mechanics or astrophysics. The beautiful part of movies is that they have the power take us beyond the limits of what we currently know or can imagine; Christopher Nolan, do not take worn-out clichés and plot twists and plaster it onto the beautiful unknown of the universe. Please, if you have any appreciation for science or science fiction, don't do yourself the disservice and use the next three hours to watch something either meaningful or interesting.
7.0~A film I wish I loved c-36048 Sign in Permalink As someone who loves sci fi, esepcially philosophical sci-fi, I was looking forward to interstellar. And for the first half of the movie I was ready to call it a masterpiece. It was engaging and ejoyable on a surface level, but it also had great themes. I can't call the cinematography anything less than perfect, the score less than entrancing and the performances less then great. The writing is scientifically accurate and well defines the Murph family, but everyone else is given typical Nolan characteristics, in that there too serious to have a personality. But that didn't bother me too much. The whole concept of Cooper having to, in a way choose between his family and the whole universe is interesting and explores human natural and love. It's just a shame then that they can't follow this theme through. Then there is one particular scene. I believe it is after they enter the wave planet. Anne Hathaway talks about love, and how it is everything. This speech is my biggest problem with the movie. The film wants to suggest somehow that his love for his family is key to solving the crisis on Earth. This doesn't really make sense and is not deep. The whole love thing being important becomes very prevelant in the film, but I think it isn't deep at all. Love being important can be summarised in a sentence, but the importance of love can be analysed. It isn't. If you don't care about philosophical elements of the film that's fine but the film keeps bringing back to it. I can turn my brain off in a movie, but when you ask me to think and I think what you're saying is stupid, then you have made a mistake. The whole ice planet scene and Matt Damon being introduced is just unneccessary. Yeah, Damon is the opposite to McCaughnehey in terms of ideals, but we don't need a villain. We don't need a fight scene and a villain like him. He's supposed to be a villain that we think is crazy but we ultimately find him to be relatable, however he just comes across as selfish. Wouldn't it be better if say Hathaway was constantly budding heads with Cooper, and then made a rash decision to try to go back to Earth that cost the crew and led to the docking scene? Rather than forced villain that prevents us from thinking and sympathising with his motives we would be able to philosiphise the situation. The ending is what gets me the most. You've probably heard all the criticism. It being a huge Ex-Machina is not my problem (although it is definitely). I think the ending betrays what the movie was building up to. Instead of leading to an answer or something that gives us more clues or ideas, it leads us to a scene that is obviously meant to pointlessly 2001 style enter this new dimension and conclude that love controls and binds everything. How deep. The ending being an ex-machina doesn't bother me for it being a huge coincidence, but it really doesn't make sense to end like this. Although I don't like the time scene, it is a perfect way to end the movie. The audience anticipates an outcome that they think about. They think about the ending which the movie should do, but once we know everything, what do we think about? I think the scene should've ended by showing Cooper reaching out to Murph to tell her to tell him not to go on the mission, and she responds, changing time in a way that is very vague so we don't really get what happens. Human desires could be explored better, but I see them as only partially shown, in a way where I see essays written about them that I feel were evaluated after analysing every scene. If it is shown only a bit then we can't explore it, and as such it can't be as philosophical ad pure sci-fi as say the golden standard 2001. It is enjoyable, but that is all Interstellar will ever be to me. Good but not great.
1.0~Laughably bad are-652-967291 Sign in Permalink It starts out somewhat OK, and as a scifi movie, I can accept the idea with the wormhole, and exploring worlds in a distant galaxy. But the movie just degrades from there. When he manipulates time by entering a "gentle" black hole, the movie reaches a ridiculous low point. I don't claim to know details about space flight or ships, but watching the movie was frustrating as there are so many details that just feel wrong, and I was left with way too many "but why!?"s. It's just not believable, even in a scifi setting, in my opinion. The only reason I watched it to the end, was to see if the makers actually managed to finish it off with some dignity - which I feel the failed to do. The music and effects do sometimes drown out the dialogues (for dramatic or emotional effects, I think), so it would be helpful to have subtitles available.
4.0~Some unintended laughs bohdanvorejs Sign in Permalink I think creators bite more than they (or viewers) can swallow with this one. It does not work on emotional neither science fiction level. Same as in Inception where concept tried to be so complex that it becomes absurd. Matters like space time traveling must be approached extremely carefully if taken seriously, 'cause otherwise it can turn out grotesque as it had in this case. I think Nolan should stick with Batman type of movies (these I liked very much), fantastic hyperbole of these stories are better vehicle for his simplistic views on science or emotions, when he tries to be serious or realistic all he evokes are only some unintended laughs, but that's what happens when the theme of a movie is so ambitious as the save the mankind goal.
6.0~I'm a big Nolan fan... and I'm disappointed Alexander_BK Sign in Permalink Let me bring you this in overview. PRO: - Stunning visually, through and through - Good acting by the entire cast - Interesting concept - A strong second half - A somewhat satisfying ending - A few interesting twists - The main musical theme is amazing. CON: - It took too long for anything truly interesting to happen. It had a few good moments, but in general the whole first half of the movie was... a tiny bit boring. If it hadn't been a Nolan movie, I would probably have left in the break. I'm glad I didn't. But the first half makes me not want to see this movie again. - There are really too many plot holes. Or moments that are not well-explained enough for them to be plausible. Things like characters experiencing revelations based on... well, pretty much nothing. Especially near the end. Which doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the second half. But one has to overlook these things to enjoy the story. - Besides the main theme, most of the score seem misplaced. Too loud. Too bombastic. Or not adding to the emotions on screen. And I'm speaking as a huge Hans Zimmer fan here. All in all, I would recommend seeing it. Definitely. But with an expectation that it's not as special as we've come to expect from Nolan.
7.0~Good film but not that good alimfiliz Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a good movie, I admit. But the relativity part of the film is very fictional and metaphysical. The film is overrated and doesn't deserve 8.5 rating.
10.0~A Sci-Fi masterpiece that never leaves reality sambady Sign in Permalink A plot that grips you and keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the whole movie. A serious of intricate puzzles and events that introduces us to a world who only few are accustomed to. An array of stupendous visual effects that aim to dazzle and inspire you without ever having to leave reality. An outstanding performance by Matthew McConaughey that induces heartfelt emotion. "Interstellar" only comes once in a lifetime. Unless you can control the fourth dimension...
4.0~Visually Epic but Maudlin to the Extreme evolved777 Sign in Permalink Imagine a remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey but produced by Oprah and directed by Dr. Phil - featuring some the most unprofessional, sappy, cry baby astronauts ever put on film. That pretty much describes Interstellar. It will make true science fiction fans nostalgic for the cool precision of Stanley Kubrick. A great premise, fascinating science and some of the grandest shots of space travel ever committed to film go to waste, buried deep between two soggy galactic tampons. A frustrating experience, as so much greatness was just below the surface. Oh well. Still worth seeing, at least as a rental, for the aforementioned visual design. In that sense, the movie has a lot in common with Prometheus - another visual masterpiece of science fiction compromised by a bad screenplay and silly choices.
2.0~Bad movie made worse by IMDb over-rating! rrcharpe Sign in Permalink Unlike the majority of the viewers of this film commenting on IMDb I found it flat,unrealistic in the extreme and essentially another Hollywood dud. Many times the people who make these Sci-Fi films will literally flood the IMDb review section with positive reviews, causing the IMDb rating to go up and (they probably hope) causing more people to go see the movie. What disappointed me the most about this movie were the obvious scientific inaccuracies and distortions that made watching it more of a leap of faith rather than an exciting trip into mankind's future. As most people know (adults of course) is that there is no such thing as a "stable" wormhole. That premise was used ad infinitum by Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and just as lamely since there is "no such thing" as stability when discussing wormholes. Additionally, the ending made essentially no sense whatsoever. What else can I say except skip it unless you love gigantic bulging eyes crying all the time (Anne Hathaway) or checking out Matthew M's pecks. There was very little entertainment in the movie that's for sure. StocktonRob
10.0~My new all time favorite acydio Sign in Permalink Watch it, you won't regret it. Best movie I have ever seen with the best movie soundtrack. If you have the chance to watch it in a IMAX cinema: DO IT! You have to pay attention at the end that you don't loose yourself in the a little complicated physical slang. It is not just a "popcorn movie" where you can sit back and relax. You have to pay attention that you don't loose yourself. Pros: - Soundtrack - Story - Actors - Atmosphere Cons: Absolutely none! Watch it! You can thank me later and you won't regret it ;) Have a nice day and regards S K
6.0~Good story and production but one major flaw lonewulz Sign in Permalink Whoever the genius was that cast Matthew McConaughey as a super- intelligent astronaut, completely funked up what otherwise would have been a highly rated sci-fi drama. Sorry but brilliant scientific observations and explanations just don't sound credible coming from a typecast smooth talking lady's man sporting a redneck accent. It's awkward and I just couldn't get past it. Russell Crowe, George Clooney... anyone but Matthew McConaughey and this might have risen to the level of "great."
4.0~Watched until the End yowza-yowza Sign in Permalink With a great deal of effort I managed to watch this movie in its entirety. That was because the storyline was peculiar enough for me to say - I need to see how the film is going to (hopefully) tie-together. Thus that positive brought my rating up to a 4. On the negative-side: 1) this movie is 2.5 hr of tedious lack-of-action. 2) most dialogue is mumbled - sounding like a new foreign language, or low in volume. 3) Those dialogue issues thus made it near impossible to follow the complex plot "reveals". 4) The special effects were not 2014-quality. The spaceship shots reminded me of circa-1980's Battlestar Galactica. 5) Plot problem: the pilot (MM) is enlisted to fly the spaceship because he was a great pilot many years ago. The next thing you know he's at the controls of a very complex spaceship that he has never seen. I guess if the writer suggested that the pilot went thru months of training', would have just dulled this movie further. It would be like Rocky fighting Apollo Creed, without showing the side-of-beef being hit, and running the City Hall steps. Anyway this is not a great movie in any sense. A story that tries to play on the themes of : 1) Love overcomes all, and 2) a father's love for his family can overcome the physics of the universe, are just predictable emotional-appeals (of the writer/producer) - trying to salvage something at the box-office, from the audience being left with a "feel-good". A great story + being well executed + an emotional-appeal = an 8 to 10 rating. This movie is just a lifeless, jumbled bore.
8.0~Great Movie, but a little over-hyped andre-mazeron Sign in Permalink I guess the key to truly enjoy Interstellar is to think of it not as a sci fi movie but as a fantasy movie set in space. The cinematography is truly stunning, flawless. It breaks from some of the conventional shots and ideas you would expect on the space scenes and it does that with superb results. But it seems that the plot is not at the same level. Don't get fooled by the talk about wormholes and relativity, the science behind it is closer to a Doctor Who script than to 2001. Not that I have anything against Doctor Who, I love it, but they don't try to pass it as hard sci-fi. And sometimes it goes from bad science to downright impossible and cheesy, with some pages stolen from Space Cowboys or Armaggedon. And that is a shame, because this could have been one of the best movies ever, and the spiritual successor to 2001, but it does not have the courage to do so, opting for a more commercial and accessible script, with some memorable moments mixed with some dialogues I want to forget. It is a great movie and you should definitely see it, just avoid falling for those 10/10 reviews.
10.0~The GENIUS shocks the world by another unique innovation..!! Midosaad2010 Sign in Permalink (((WOW)))...!!! It's almost impossible to put in words, but we have to try and give everyone what he truly deserve. In my modest opinion, Interstellar is the best Sci-Fi in human history. Believe it or not. It's the simple and the complicated, It's the usual and the different, It's the mind and the heart, It's an emotional and psychological journey through the unknown which has its own stunning visuals. It's an original story and thought-provoking masterpiece. Every single time with him, you just got crazy about his ideas, astonished by his mind games and inspired when he talks to the heart. Back then, he was an ambitious young director. And with his capabilities made his own way straight through the world. Now, he is an icon and a legend of directing. He is Christopher Nolan... Really guys, what's wrong with this guy ?!! what's going on inside his head ?!! It's our job to honor the honorable. Please, Just keep the rating UP, why ? Because Chris. and Interstellar deserve it.
2.0~Talk about over-hyped Fedgirl Sign in Permalink My girlfriend and I decided to watch this movie at home as we missed it when it was doing the rounds in our local cinema. How glad we were, for at least it meant we were able to sip on our wine and chat in between - which we would have not been able to do had we watched in the cinema. And we did a LOT of chatting, mostly about the direness of the film itself. I can't believe so many reviewers thought this film to be amazing (but then we're all entitled to our opinions - and we all know how opinions differ to the extremes at times). However, I honestly couldn't connect with ANY of the characters in this film - particularly the leads. I really have no words...just found the whole film totally ridiculous - and don't even get me started on Hans Zimmer's background music!!! We needed subtitles for some scenes as the music was so overpowering we couldn't hear a word that was being said. I was even so bored at one point that I started to imitate Matthew McConaughey's irritating 'whistle' as he speaks. Enough said methinks.
10.0~One of the best forever budabenimmailim Sign in Permalink I wont write long about this movie... But i feel like i have to say some about it. 0- its one of the best piece of art created ever... 1- everything in this movie symbols... 2- black hole is not something in space.. its the symbol of your your unconscious mind... 3- so our hero is going into himself into his unconscious mind... journey is about it... 4- if you know about Mevlana (Rumi), Yunus Emre, Hayyam... you can get this movie much much better... all movie effected by Sufism... you should check mesnevi to get this... (a simple example Saturn is the 6th planet from sun... God created the world in 6 days... In Sufism Saturn is the symbol of being. in the movie the gate to other stars opens near Saturn... all movie full of Sufi symbols...) 5- it simply says; "Its only you in this whole universe... Only you... Nothing else... Understand it that all your destiny.. All your future... All your past... All your here and now is in your hands... There is no one else... no species.. no aliens... Only YOU" 6- even if you watch it... again and again watch it... Thnx...
1.0~A classic? Nope, more like a Heinz 57 varieties paulcf-510-910462 Sign in Permalink I had high expectations for this film by Chris Nolan. "Inception" was ground breaking, you could definitely say it had never been 'done before' or seen that before! The pre release hype was strong for Interstellar and I really enjoy SF movies, so pass the popcorn! SPOILERS: Firstly character wise...There is zero chemistry between Cooper and Dr. Brand! Yet in the end, we're being told/shown that there is/will be? Really? Then Dr. Mann, he was asleep for years and when they wake him, they don't verify his claims? And his mental status? Why was he sent on this mission in the first place? And he easily removes the communication device from Cooper's helmet, and so on. Really cheesy and poorly written. Then he escapes in the craft to get to the Endurance, hello? No security protocols? It is so unbelievable. Time flashbacks...Cooper can revisit time, so why not pick a time he can really affect? Maybe further back and even help to prevent the natural environmental breakdowns that Earth is experiencing in this story. Robots...black monoliths...hello where have I seen that before? Is this the shape that a space exploration robot would be designed as? This was so silly I couldn't stop laughing! Fuel: They have a limited supply! OMG! Ever hear of nuclear power like in a submarine, etc? Also I would expect them to have perfected nuclear fusion or such to provide unlimited (almost) power. But no, they use chemical rockets (technology from the 1940's). This was so poorly written. Let's not forget 'Waterworld' even, when they land on the water planet. Gee, maybe a survey/probe first would be in order? And then the other planet, looked a lot like the ice world in the 'Star Trek' movie a few years ago where Jim Kirk is exiled to and meets Spock. And the most bizarre of all? He gets coordinates of a TOP SECRET base and he's just the person they want to fly the spacecraft? And no one else could find this base? Did the workers there need food from local providers? Anyways, you get my point, it is so disjointed and when you watch it, it is a melange of many previous movies, hence Heinz 57 varieties. It carries bits of '2001 A Space Odyssey' (and its sequels also) which is a natural one to look to. Then 'Contact' and many more...truly picking experiences from a bevy of SF movies and mixing them. At least they didn't have thruster sounds in space! (no sound in space, remember 'Aliens'? No one will hear you scream!) Is this the best that Chris Nolan and Hollywood can come up with? No original screenwriter/story out there? My final measurement of a film is will I buy the Blu-ray disc when it comes out? Nope, not for this extremely long and drawn out film. I might buy it in the cheapo bin for $3.99 in a few years time and watch it just for the extras/deleted scenes and then put it on the shelf to gather dust. So just like in the movie, I was hoping for a worm hole to get to the end of this long drawn out tedium...but unfortunately for me, time was actually going to be moving much longer than normal time and I've lost 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. So terribly disjointed with decent actors trying to save it. Unless you are starving for a SF movie, avoid this like a bad worm hole and keep your feet planted on terra firma. Folks, this is a really terrible movie and I would avoid it and save your money for something else.
7.0~Highly Overrated BryGuySaysHi Sign in Permalink Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it. And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie.
3.0~Where do I even begin? zzzman69 Sign in Permalink Having just seen this with my fellow movie buff friend, I can only speculate as to how anyone would give this movie such rave reviews. Have the studios hired an army of sycophants or is North Korea hacking movie review sites as well? Perhaps I have been spoiled in the past when I have watched movies that are not only visually arresting but thought provoking and exhibiting some respect for the audience. This movie is lacking any such saving graces. It takes far too long to tell a story that doesn't begin to hold together and does not even succeed as eye candy, which is all that Hollywood is about in this modern age of trying to rescue meaningless tripe with copious amounts of computer generated fluff. So to those of you were dazzled by this drivel, please let me know when the next blockbuster is due. Meantime I will go back to I Love Lucy reruns.
3.0~A movie that defies the basic fundamentals that make up astronomy evanbro Sign in Permalink To start off this review, I would like to inform the reader that I do not claim to have a plethora of knowledge regarding the laws that govern astronomy, however I understand enough of the basic laws to understand that this movie fails to comply with a vast majority of them. Christopher Nolan's attempt at a making a movie labelled under Science Fiction is an insult to anyone who follows the genre extensively. While watching this movie I couldn't help but feel Nolan was taking advantage of the casual audience watching this movie who aren't perspicacious enough to catch the major factual errors that are littered throughout the movie. I won't spend the entirety of the review rambling on about all of the factual errors within the movie, for that would take hours. However, I will list my major frustrations with the film. 1) My first complaint has to be Nolan's lack of understanding regarding the basic laws of gravity. Any half-wit with a basic amount of knowledge about gravity would be able to see that Nolan erred in this field. You first see this when the doltish crew of astronomers travel through the wormhole and find themselves by the planet filled with water. When looking at Einstein's work we can see that when there is more gravity, time will move significantly slower... However Nolan to to completely disregard this fundamental theory. When mcconaughey and Catwoman descend into this planet with that other arrogant dbag whom I can't remember (that guy who was to dense to get into the ship and got swept away by the wave that miraculously appeared out of nowhere) Nolan's disregard for this theory becomes apparent. The astronauts state that every hour spent on this planet is 7 years on earth... WHAT! DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT? The when Catwoman steps onto this planet to retrieve a transmitter, the gravity appears to be exactly the same as that on Earth. WHAT!? This is an outrageous insult to anyone who enjoys the science fiction genre. However, this isn't the worse part. After they are finished with their expenditure on this planet after completely botching the whole mission, they return back to their ship. There they find their fellow astronaut who said they were down their for 20 something years... WHAT? Am I supposed to believe that the other astronaut sat up there for that amount of time playing with his balls? I can barely sit in my own house for 5 hours without contemplating some dark things. How that guy sat up there for 20 years doing nothing with his life is absolutely beyond me. 2) My second and last complaint that I will be discussing is what happens when cowboy mcconaughey takes a stroll into the Black Hole. A black hole gets its name for obvious reasons. A black hole's mass is large enough to pull suck in stars and whole galaxies. Not even sound or light can escape a black holes mass because of its large gravitational pull, hence the reason why they are invisible to the naked eye. The theory around black holes is that if you were to enter one, you would find yourself among many other different galaxies that were consumed by the black hole. Nolan's idea of what happens once you get sucked into a black hole is absolutely absurd. According to Nolan, you'll find yourself hiding behind your daughter's bookshelf, and these bookshelves go on indefinitely so you can communicate with your daughter all throughout time... WOW... Doesn't contradict any theories or laws whatsoever. Then when you are in Nolan's idea of a black hole, your robot will discover the formula of gravity. You can then take this formula governing gravity and send it to your daughter as and "ANOMALY". She can then use this formula regarding gravity to create a better and more sustainable future for the human race. Then mcconaughey is able to teleport miraculously into Saturn's orbit and get rescued while only minutes remain in his oxygen tank... WOW... SCIENCE... However with all of the flaws being stated, there are some positives, hence the reason I gave it a 3. The cinematography is phenomenal. The visuals can be breathtaking at moments and for that it gains two points. It gains an additional point for that entertaining scene where Matt Damon goes all Jason Bourne on mcconaughey and tries to hijack his space ship and gets blown to smithereens. I wouldn't have had an issue with this film if it was under the genre of fantasy, rather than Science-fiction. Science-fiction implies that the movie will try to follow that basic principles that govern astronomy, and this movie failed to do so.
1.0~Interbollo..s SvetoslavGrigorov Sign in Permalink Interstellar by Christopher Nollan Reviewed by Svetoslav Grigorov First, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job). Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a "serious" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it "scientific"??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her. The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens. P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know.
10.0~Masterpiece AlexPechlivanidis Sign in Permalink This gave me a lot of Kubrick vibes. The music is superb, the acting as well. It can be a little tough to understand for people who aren't familiar with quantum physics but it's not pretentious and purposefully complicated. I honestly couldn't find any major flaws to this movie. One of Nolan's best work.
10.0~Sci-Fi with a Big Heart 3xHCCH Sign in Permalink The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi). From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings. As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win. Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars. Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered. Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the "Breaking Dawn" films and "The Conjuring". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after "Zero Dark Thirty" and "Mama.". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up. In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story. From "Memento", then "The Prestige" to "Inception", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. "Interstellar" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10.
2.0~All that fuss for such a movie.... vdelens Sign in Permalink I was expecting really a good sci-fi movie as i am a big fan but after the first hour i had to battle to just not leave the theater..... The story is great, some scenes are really good but Matthew McConaughey is completely unable to express feelings and so all sentimental scenes are not working in my opinion.Ellen Burstyn has a small part but manage to express so much while McConaughey is completely shallow.... We are far from movies like 2001 even if some scenes are almost as good ...But a lot of inconsistencies and bad scenes (the wave, the guy waiting stupidly next to the spaceship doing nothing but waiting for the wave to take him, the ice world was from the beginning not a possible choice to replace earth that was so obvious).... the robot is nice but really not working at all.... A big big disappointment like putting scenes together and trying to make a movie out of it..... An ambitious movie for a poor result.
10.0~(Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions! muvi-fan-73 Sign in Permalink We have grown up in the age of sci-fi where films like Jurassic park and Godzilla (the previous one) gave us the idea of ongoing growth in Science. Myself being a great fan of such a genre, it added to my pleasure. Now when a decade or two has been passed, it is great to have a movie belonging to the same genre coming from world's greatest director Christopher Nolan. Christopher is famous for movies like Inception and The Dark Night trilogy as well. Interstellar picks up even in the areas where Inception and The Dark Night trilogy could not. The thriller in inception takes away the touch of reality, also visuals in my opinion were not up to mark (I mostly find it that way if they are built by special effects). On the other hand The Dark Night trilogy belonged to superhero genre, thus it stays away from comparison. I find no shame in admitting that it took me two times to watch the movie to understand it completely. Also this is my second review after deleting first one. Now all I can say it to be as (Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions. The story is built by interaction of various interstellar elements like dimensions, black hole, its horizon, relativity, gravity, space, time, worm hole, various worlds, emotions and love. The story is how 'they' from future, interact with present human (probably 'they' from past) to save humanity. Final verdict: A classic, as it would go down in history.
5.0~Very overrated taseron-1 Sign in Permalink I have lost interest in the rest of this movie after the scenes where I saw a farmer carrying equipment to hack drones, NASA putting a guy on duty who got issues with his family and crying like a drama queen while driving to work, and an astronaut explaining worm-hole-time-travel to another astronaut using a pen and paper while on the mission. The bad acting of the leading actor trying to sound 'cool' in every dialog was very annoying. This movie is way too dumb for a standard 'sci-fi'. The production is great though, but not enough to cover the overall dumbness.
4.0~Parts of it are excellent rlandmann Sign in Permalink "Interstellar" is a near-future quest story. Humanity is doomed by ecological collapse that's killing off food crops. A crew of astronauts explores planets on which our species can re-settle. I found it to be a film of interesting images, breathtaking visuals, and little consistency or sense. There were three things I loved about it. First, it's the most solid and moving portrayal of the effects of time dilation I think I've ever seen. I've known about the "Twin Paradox" since I first encountered it in a children's book about space travel, but seeing it depicted here had real emotional punch. The second thing I loved was the representation of time as a physical dimension at the movie's climax. I thought this sequence was very cleverly done, and did an excellent job of representing five-dimensional space in three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen! Beyond that, there's a lot of eye candy here. The spaceship interiors are gorgeous and feel suitably lived-in and real; and many of the exteriors of space are really beautiful to look at. Unfortunately, that's all I have to recommend in "Interstellar", a movie which can't seem to decide whether it wants to be "2001: A Space Odyssey" or not. On the one hand, the core story is that of a lone astronaut who traverses an artificial gateway located in the outer solar system to reach another dimension. Passing through the gateway, he is transformed to some other plane of being and can transmit messages of vital importance to friends and associates (OK, more shades of "2010: Odyssey Two" in this latter element). A substantial part of the film is taken up with the traveller's coming to terms with his extra-dimensional existence. He even has an AI to keep him company! (OK, shades of "2061: Odyssey Three" now".) However, "Interstellar" also includes more conventional narrative elements, including landings on and exploration of two planets before the encounter with the stargate, a fistfight with a crazy astronaut from a previous expedition, and a paper-thin love story. Actually, I think the "crazy astronaut" subplot could have been a stronger film all by itself, as could have the time dilation tragedy, (as could the stargate story had Kubrick not already told it forty years ago). For me, "Interstellar" tries too many things, commits deeply to none of them, and the result is a disjointed mess. Finally, given the obvious expense and care with which spacecraft are visually represented, it was a shame that their movements were so woefully unrealistic, especially in a film that seemed so eager to ape "2001" in so many ways. Kubrick instinctively understood the ballet-like grace and beauty of objects in the grip of "the cold equations" of motion in space. The equivalent sequences in "Interstellar" are nothing short of ludicrous. This wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but it was annoying and disappointing. I wanted to like this movie a whole lot more than I did, but to me it was merely "OK".
6.0~Great in the first half; less so in the second. proud_luddite Sign in Permalink In the near future, the planet Earth is disintegrating environmentally. A team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where Earth's remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive. The first half of the film is fascinating. It has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and over-population. There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either. The second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized. The movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more.
1.0~Long, drawn-out, relentlessly oppressive 3-hour movie lauraboo6 Sign in Permalink I found this movie to be overly long, full of itself, endlessly oppressive, virtually humorless, and overall not worth your time. That's my summary, but, in order to add IMDb's required 10 lines: On the plus side, it was well made, so it does draw you in. But the long scenes in space juxtaposed with the ugly scenes on earth were just too much for me to watch. I eventually sat with my eyes closed so as not to continue to be bombarded by those scenes (I didn't want to leave as I had gone with others), and, eventually covered my ears for the same reason. The scenes may be beautifully shot, but they are, in the end, very slow and boring. This film should have been half the length and have added twice as much lightness.
2.0~Woeful bateman_1116 Sign in Permalink Yet another hugely costly below average movie. Just three things I can remember about it. Self indulgent rubbish. Time may slow down approaching the speed of light. It definitely slows down watching this grandios turkey. There must be more original, exciting stories out there that could be made for a fraction of the cost. Can someone please make the book "Deathworld" by Harry Harrison into one please. Read it and you'll see. Perfect vehicle for "Arnie" and Cooper. Sad that the movie industry has more money to work with than the actual scientists working these problems out? From this movie they deduced more information though so that is the only redeeming thing I can think of to come from this rubbish.
5.0~Has anyone ever told you the definition of mediocrity? mamoru-sama Sign in Permalink I'll go ahead and write a first objective and actually useful paragraph, instead of just giving my opinion that nobody cares about: Is this a movie for me? 1. I didn't like Inception and got very confused by it. 2. I loved Inception and found it very edgy. 3. I didn't like Inception, I thought it was actually pretty shallow and boring and it failed to impress me. If you're in category 1, you will probably not like this movie, as this is the very same type of movie. If you're in category 2 , you watch one sci-fi movie ever 3 years or so, if your forehead wrinkles when someone utters a concept as basic in sci-fi as "asimov laws" (for instance), if you get easily impressed and proud when you understand a movie that category 1 doesn't, you will love Interstellar. If you're in category 3, you are more than familiar with sci-fi, whether it's movies, TV shows, literature or even video games. Avoid this movie, it will bore you out of your mind and you will get pretty annoyed by category 2 people acting like you're category 1 just because you didn't like a movie that felt challenging to them, and because they can't fathom the possibility that some people are way past this kind of movies and can't just be impressed by it. In other words, this movie was just like Inception, mediocre. And since people really have a hard time with this word, let me just explain what it means: Medi-ocre. The Latin root word medi means "middle". Bottomline this is an "average" movie for the "average" viewer. All the (current) 9.0 IMDb "average rating" does is reflecting that fact.
10.0~Interstellar is stellar like a roller-coaster. Best space/movie till date dipeshlshah Sign in Permalink Interstellar is stellar! You would feel exactly like a roller-coaster ride. It starts of slow but it needs that start to reach the summit like the ride. And after that... OMG.! No words.. Nolan has done it again and out-down himself. The movie is best way and easiest way to understand theory of relativity of time, black-hole and wormhole. Best space/movie till date. Great visualization. Those who are looking for best movie of 2014. It is the one..!
10.0~I have never heard an audience applaud before in this country marclev78 Sign in Permalink This is easily one of the best movies I've seen in my life (and I'm not that young anymore!) Truly epic, basically this century's 2001 crossed with Gone with the Wind. The first stand out thing is that it gets the physics right. The second that if you have a child you will struggle to hold back the tears at some of the themes running through the movie. The third that it manages to span generations while never loosing sight of the plot or the characters' development. The fourth that after watching it you feel like you've sat through a tour de force and need a break just to process it all. To say any more would ruin the plot, but wow ... Just wow!
3.0~Spectacular unbelievable nonsense ori_64 Sign in Permalink The film is spectacular and starts off really nice and promises to be very interesting. But once the spaceship leaves the ground, the movie deteriorates rapidly, and as it progresses it becomes so unbelievable and ludicrous, that I left the theater quite annoyed and very disappointed. I didn't like most of the characters. They are clichés, and none made me sympathetic to their cause or character. The robot is also extremely familiar and it's design is ludicrous, trying to be both advanced and ancient at the same time. I really likes other films by the Nolan brothers, but it seems they don't give their scripts as much attention as they used to. A disappointment.
5.0~Looks great, but.... ebyandsmartie-307-448527 Sign in Permalink Looks great, but is filled with sappy dialog, daft twists and silly science. Don't get me wrong, you should see this film for its look alone. Just don't fall into the trap of thinking this is somehow going to change your life. There are no proved wormholes in the real world. The whole plot is filed with this hole and that's what undermines it. This is the over-hyped sci-fi film with a twist ending that M. Night Shyamalan didn't direct. Maybe if he had, people would see it for what it is.
7.0~The Best Movie In The History of Movies? amexspam Sign in Permalink I'm not going to review the movie, but I will review the flawed/easily manipulated Rating system this site has become. As I write this, the movie supposedly has over 12000 independent movie-going-public votes - even though the general release of the movie in the U.S. is not until tomorrow and the international release is occurring now. And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison. Or the entire voting process is manipulated by filmmakers to produce artificially high ratings to dupe potential ticket buyers. Spoiler Alert: It's not the best movie ever made.
1.0~Worst movie of the decade rfunk82 Sign in Permalink The sound environment is amazing...and that's about it. This movie makes no sense, should be a kids movie, play the movie for your kids and they will go to sleep in 10 minutes. Almost 3 hours of boredom. If you have insomnia and you need to sleep, go watch this movie. I don't care who the director is, this movie is bad, worst of all the ending, when you waiting for something great to connect everything and... please I want my 3 hours of my life back. The only thing you can take from this movie is the sound, it made me fell like I was there, so this "movie" might be a great space simulator.
1.0~Complete rubbish with an utterly dire cop out of an ending Barry1978 Sign in Permalink 3 hours too long in my opinion and just don't see any valid reason why this film was even made. Waiting and waiting and waiting for the storyline to pick up but never did. This amazing twist at the end was in my opinion a complete cop out that just left me dumb founded to think the creators of this film could not even come up with a half decent ending. If your looking for a good nights sleep then this is the film for you. The storyline is poor with no real explanation as to why any of it is happening. Plan A this and plan B that and by the end of it it was all One big lie to get them into space in the first place. My question is why did they bother?
10.0~Left Speechless ejashishk Sign in Permalink Don't know what to say.... Be it working with a hapless brain or magic or superheroes or sleeplessness or bending reality or or or or....Where did he get the idea of frozen clouds, or waves the size of mountains or something as simple as Nitrogen can bring about the death of the planet. All the while he doesn't forget where it all started and brings you back giving an explanation about the "Gravity" anomaly in the girl's bedroom. Bet you'll forget all about it just sitting and watching the film.(I Did). How much time would it take for a person of average understanding to think like Nolan, if it weren't for his movies? Time and again we think we can see it all, know it all, guess it all, but you'll never know what's beyond the horizon. I think we are all just too small to be reviewing Nolan's work.
10.0~Honestly, one of the best, most genius films to date. trvevang Sign in Permalink Filled with amazing effects, beautiful music, great story and perfect acting, we get the movie Interstellar. Christopher Nolan has made what easily is the best movie of 2014. If it was possible, I would have given this film a 17/10. It is truly a special movie with a heart and emotions. A dystopian future f the world, where the only foos source for people, is corn. We need a new planet to survive and that's what the main mission in this movie is. I will never get over how fantastic the music made by Hans Zimmer for this movie is. He used an organ trough the score. "There's something very human about an organ. It has pipes and air blows through it, it needs to breathe, so there is something very human about it". 10/10 for this movie, definetly deserved. Watch it, you won't regret it.
6.0~Strange space travel story that has a silly ending but still an interesting Nolan film swilliky Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan takes on space travel in a scientific thriller. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a scientist and former pilot haunted by his past accidents. He lives with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and his grandfather Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that a ghost is in her room but Cooper tells her to use the scientific method. Crops are dying and people are assigned to their careers as resources are being consolidated. When Cooper finds a signal coming from Murph's room, Murph deciphers a binary code from the bookshelf. He follows the coordinates to a military base when he learns about a mission to space. The NASA scientist Brand (Anne Hathaway) takes Cooper to a meeting with her father (Michael Caine) and others including a robot. The mission hopes to search for a new habitable world and they invite Cooper to come along with his engineering and piloting skills. Despite a message from the bookshelf to stay, Cooper goes on the mission rocketing into space with Brand, Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi). Their search for habitable planets takes them through a black hole to a solar system with three potential planets. The biggest complication is gravity and relativity cause for a huge time jump that will change every hour into seven years back on Earth. The first planet is a water planet that has giant tidal waves heading towards their spaceship. Doyle is wiped out by the wave but Brand is saved by the robot. They are stuck on the planet for longer than they had hoped because the engines are waterlogged. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
10.0~If you liked it raise your hand, If you don't raise your standard bansi-awasthi Sign in Permalink Some people say nolan should not make movies like this. An average person can't understand it. Well, if you can't understand it raise your standard. It was a perfect movie with best acting by academy award winner Matthew McConaughey and also by Anne Hathaway. Very good music, very good screenplay and above all best example of directing by Christopher Nolan. The suspense, the thrill, was just awesome. Although to make up the story the first part of movie was boring at some points but rest was awesome. Nolan is one of the best filmmakers of our time. Movie also had pure emotional touch also it was comical at some places. The use of physics was remarkable. IT IS A MASTERPIECE.
10.0~A modern Sci-Fi masterpiece timo-hellmund Sign in Permalink Hands down. This is a masterpiece. I feel like Nolan achieved a modern 2001 - without being too much 2001, despite having some similarities. Saw it last night with a bunch of people in a German cinema on a big screen (non IMAX) and a very good sound system. This is a film made for the big screen and you really feel it, especially in the space sequences. This movie is visually astounding, with some visuals even being relevant for science, as they rendered the most scientific accurate black hole to date. The actors all did a fantastic job and you really feel they had a lot of fun acting in actual sets. Yes, the set design is brilliant. Especially the "real" spacecraft set. Christopher Nolan once again takes scientific theories, this time supported by the famous expert physicist Kip Thorne, explains them in his film's logic and plays with them in a creative way. We know this from Inception but this time his script includes more heart, more emotions. The plot is constantly thrilling and exciting, with some scenes taking my breath away. And of course there are typical Nolan twists one might not see coming before. The score by Hans Zimmer once again makes the great scenes even better. He just knows how to increase the tension of a scene with his sound. And when the cinema shakes and hums and pushes you in your seat, you know the sound design is perfect. This film really caught me personally. My heart was beating in the action sequences, I was blown away by the visuals, I unconsciously held my breath in the first scene in space, the climax really was rewarding and very creative. I enjoyed it a lot. I seriously don't understand why so many critics and audience had so many issues with it whereas many more international critics and communities say it is a masterpiece. The big gap between RT critics score and IMDb's worldwide audience score speaks for itself. For me, this is one of the best Sci-fi films of our time. 10/10
5.0~Relativity Self-Taught for the Popcorn crunching Crowd barev-85094 Sign in Permalink .Back to the Future, reloaded with a bigger budget INTERSTELLAR: viewed at Berlin Sony Ctr. Cinemaxx, FEB. 2015-- Cutting edge pseudoscience from Christopher Nolan. Nolan is noted for making wannabe sophisticated big budget big star films with big special effects that bedazzle the masses but don't hold up to serious scrutiny. interstellar is a perfect example. In this one Nolan plays around with advanced notions of theoretical physics and cosmology such as Einstein's Space-Time Relativity and wormholes leading into parallel universes. To lend authority to this exalted eye-over wool-pull he has consulted with noted Cal Tech physicist Kip Thorne, the go-to scientist for serious reflection on wormholes and possible other universes. What emerges is a pot-pourri of cutting edge wild ideas not too convincingly thrashed through the cosmic mix-master and coupled with a Back to the Future Midwest farm family back story that is mildly entertaining if you don't think about it too hard and just call it Science Fantasy, like Nolans other pictures. Last years Best Actor Oscar winner, Matthew McConnaughey, is back from his winning cowboy with Aids impersonation to star as a good ole country boy farmer who happens to do a little astronaughting on the side. He is engaged by a most unlikely Michael Caine ( think "Alfie") in the role of a super scientist leading an ultra-secret interstellar project designed to find a new inhabitable planet for the remains of mankind to escape to, because as we learned from the early scenes back on the farm, the Earth is in the final stages of environmental collapse.The reason Caine's project is so tiptop secret is that they don't want to set off a global panic on our dying planet. Well, to make a very long story short Mac goes off in search of an appropriate wormhole way out there in the greater interstellar beyond accompanied by a beautiful co scientist on board (Ann Hathaway) finds his wormhole, lives to tell about it, and miraculously returns to the original country homestead where he finds that due to Einsteinian relativistic time bending he is now younger than his grandchildren. (e =mc2!) In Part II maybe a few surviving earthlings will be shipped out to beyond the wormhole to carry on the propagation of our species on an exoplanet that is not dying. The details of how this is all worked out would require a report longer than the picture itself. But I must say that, at a commercial screening with a German audience, I was mildly amused and even found Mr. McConnaughey, whom I normally cannot stand, passably acceptable in a role that suits him. Old time actor John Lithgow was gramps in the rocking chair on the porch. Give it five stars out of ten for half-speed (Halfassed) PseudoScience
5.0~What a turkey! mikeheritage41 Sign in Permalink After reading the reviews I thought I was in for a magnificent treat when I saw this film. How wrong could I be. It was far too long and tedious, particularly in the first half hour or so. McConaughy mumbled his way through it. Why cannot dialogue be clear? Some of the effects were good but some clearly cheap. Extremely unimaginative robots, for instance. Or a shot with a camera fixed to one side of a cardboard looking space ship was repeated several times. There was no variety in the planetary landscapes. The visuals inside the ships were a poor recreation of bits in Alien or 2001 - much pinched from the latter and looking decidedly inferiorto a far superior movie despite it being 45 years older. Saturn looked like a cartoon drawing. The science was pseudo nonsense. Michel Caine was poor. He did not age the same as others. On planet with 80% gravity where actors were moving about as they do on earth then allows them to leap up and down hill with a tiny boost from a jet pack. Ridiculous! Dreadful ending. Nolan should stick to comic books.
10.0~Life Changing wayneinterprises Sign in Permalink This film was, as the title puts it, out of this world. As a teen of a mere 16 years I haven't been able to see all the films out there, but this film changed my life for good. From the minute the movie starts you could feel that this was something different. You get a feeling that is drastically different to that of other sci-fi movies or space films, like Gravity or the Transformers series. The whole atmosphere is more real and accurate than anything I've seen out there. Christopher Nolan is known for doing this- creating his films so, that you can believe that it could happen somewhere on Earth at this moment. Like The Dark Knight trilogy, Nolan brings this sense of realism across very effectively. Another feature that makes this film different to others is the way it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats the whole ride. From the opening scene to the final moments I sat in the cinema with my heartbeat up high. Not to mention the soundtrack- Hans Zimmer created a spine-tingling and goose-bump-causing score that possibly trumps anything he has ever composed. All in all, this is a breath-taking film that deserves to win Best Picture in 2015.
10.0~Interstellar - Truly Symphonic Creation by the Nolans nvfl123 Sign in Permalink A simply breathtaking film, Interstellar completely blew my expectations out of the water. The Nolan brothers took a huge risk in making a film about space travel, but they succeeded. The movie was one of the most visually stimulating movies I've ever watched. Be prepared to stare in awe. Hans Zimmer didn't disappoint with his original scores for the movie as well. Just wave after wave of amazing CGI and music throughout the film is enjoyable just by itself. But what I enjoyed most was the fact that the movie sticks to the main theme of human survival and curiosity. Everything that happens always links back to those themes. Not everyone will like the movie; some of the plot twists and more bizarre explanations the Nolan brothers came up with will leave some laughing, confused, mad, and/or skeptical. After all, it is a movie on the unknown. But, the Nolan brothers outdid themselves. You have to understand that there is so much in space physics and astronautics that humans cannot even fathom. You have to understand that what the Nolan brothers came up with could be true or not be true; there's no way to know because they came up the best interpretation for the movie based on incomplete data. TL;DR, one of the best movies made ever so go watch it. go in with an open mind and accept that humans do not know everything about space.
3.0~They forgot to take the robot out of the box doughelo Sign in Permalink Somewhere in Interstellar is a decent 90 minute movie padded to 3 hours. I thought it might feel long; what I didn't expect was the cheap, weepy emoting and Hallmark philosophizing. As for the padding, at least 40 minutes goes by before anyone mentions space, yet nothing of the ecological disaster is explained in any depth. No point is so trivial it can't be made ten times, no scene so long it can't be stretched beyond the breaking point. And oh, the sap – love is described as a kind of quantum effect that transcends time and space (as long as it's between parent and child). The supposed scientific accuracy was limited largely to the depiction of stellar lensing around the black hole and the silence of space. Howevvver Why do pickup trucks look exactly the same in the future? Why is the dust all over the trucks and house but not the crops? That was the most ridiculous robot I've ever seen (I love the comment that it was made of "spinning HVAC ducts"). How does this lurching refrigerator even get itself through a hatch? Its interface is a crude text screen worthy of a PCjr, yet it has a complete human personality (so much so that I had a hard time distinguishing its voice from the crew). Do you always launch your rockets from the middle of your office buildings? Remarkable how those glass partitions in view stood up to the blast. Apparently having no idea of what a wormhole is BEFORE being sent through one, Matthew is shown the rudimentary folded paper analogy. Wouldn't that have come up on the first day of class? How does a mile-high wave form out of foot-deep water? The planet orbits a black hole? Where's your light and heat coming from? Any problem with the intense X-rays usually found around these things? Guess not. On Matt Damon's planet, exactly why aren't the "frozen clouds" falling? At least Avatar posited superconducting rocks and intense magnetic fields to explain their floating mountains. When Matt takes Matthew out to show him the "surface", just how far do they walk? The rescue pilot flies at hundreds of miles an hour for at least a few minutes. When Cooper returns to our solar system, at least 60 years has elapsed since he received his daughter's video messages (since she is now in her 90s or more), so has Anne Hathaway been alone all that time on her planet? I don't recall any mention that she was going to be in a slow time region. By the way, time only slows down significantly in a very high gravitational field, which they showed no signs of being in. Besides all that and much more, the plot was disjointed, with inarticulate dialog and confusing placement of people. For example, during the entire scene of the boosted entry towards the black hole, I didn't know Cooper was in the shuttle, separated from Anne Hathaway in the station, until he looked across at her. It's not a completely terrible movie, there are some great visuals that are impressive in IMAX. But they're dragged down with the padding and cheap sentiment.
4.0~The final 30-40 minutes were thought-provoking and interesting - it's just a shame that the first 2 hours weren't jimbo-53-186511 Sign in Permalink Earth as we know it is dying and scientists at NASA believe that they may be able to locate an alternative planet for the Earth's population when a wormhole is discovered in space. NASA big wig Professor Brand (Michael Caine) asks Cooper (Matthew McConaughey)if he will lead this mission with a small team to assist him - this is due to Cooper being one of their best pilots when he used to work for them. Even though the mission may last for decades, Cooper makes the difficult decision to sacrifice seeing his family for several years in order to try to save humanity. The first obvious problem with this film is its rather generous running time of nearly 160 minutes. Now I don't generally have a problem with long films, but if the screenplay that you've written necessitates the need for a long run time then for goodness sake give us something to care about. For around 120 of the 160 minutes of this film I was almost completely bored - nothing much happens, the characters in the film are under developed and probably can't even really be classed as characters. The film is far too talky which isn't a problem if the dialogue is interesting, but it just isn't here. A robot comes along to assist the crew, but I'm assuming that the robot was also there for comedy value - it would have been nice if the robot's comedy value was utilised a little more just to try and break up some of the dreary dialogue. As well as being quite boring, there were other problematic aspects within the plot... 1) We're told that 'they' have put a wormhole up in space 48 years ago which could potentially take you through into another world or possibly another dimension. OK How do you just put a wormhole in space? Who were these people? I know that this is 'science fiction' and therefore it gives writers a bit more of a poetic licence than other genres, but if you're going to make something up at least explain what you're making up. 2) Was the whole aspect with Matt Damon really necessary? It reminded me of the stupid plot twist in Sunshine where we end up with a crazed lone survivor. It was pointless and added nothing to the story. The film was arguably too long as it was without this unnecessary element being added so by adding it and making an already long film into a film that's way too long really annoyed me. Despite the fact that the first 120 minutes were almost mind-numbingly boring, Interstellar does close strongly and the final 30 minutes or so do provide some interesting and rather thought-provoking revelations.
10.0~Of A Piece bix171 Sign in Permalink As was apparent from his previous film, "The Dark Knight Rises", Christopher Nolan has become the preeminent hack in Hollywood--and that's meant as a compliment. Nolan is a committed romantic: the only difference between him and, say, William Wyler, is that Nolan dresses up his love stories with astonishing visual effects and complex plots with a heavy emphasis on spiritualism. "Interstellar" is Nolan's most accomplished work yet, with a far more satisfying mise en scene than his previous non-Batman work, the tedious and frustrating "Inception", and he finds a more effective means to discuss what is fast becoming his major theme: time's effect on relationships, from the largest (all humanity) to the smallest (families) and his aw-shucks notion of transcendent love is sweet and satisfying. Though there are no real standouts, Nolan gets good performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and, in supporting roles, Casey Affleck and Nolan stalwart Michael Caine; they're good but where Nolan is going for tearjerking tenderness, the actors don't quite deliver. Still, Nolan's script (written along with his brother, Jonathan) is beautifully written and thought-provoking and the mammoth but necessary effects (an homage to Kubrick, sharply filmed by Hoyte Van Hoytema) are as outsized as Nolan needs them to be. Everything feels of a piece here and, as in "Inception", you have to pay close attention. But this time it all flows together exquisitely.
10.0~An incredible journey through space pedromso386 Sign in Permalink Another masterpiece by Nolan. This movie take us into a beautiful and exciting journey through space in order to save mankind from extinction. It's not just another movie in space and about space. It's something more. It has everything we like and want - excellent story, excellent cast and excellent directing. And most important it has a really good and unexpected end, which is kinda hard to find in these type of movies these days. Without a doubt one of the best of the year if not the best. Hope finally Nolan wins that statue
10.0~Excellent Movie frank-ancestor-hunter Sign in Permalink I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!
6.0~Never ever again sinus-229-14093 Sign in Permalink Sorry but who hyped this movie? Did they pay you for the reviews? Physically so much sh**. How the f**k can a space ship need more time to get to a position than a guy by feet? Or is able to escape from a planet with more gravity than the earth but on earth they need a rocket?? Even better was the situation of the waves which are big as a mountain but NO ONE saw them until they where next to them, are you kidding me? enough with the physic, what about the dialogs? the only funny stuff was the robot! If it wasn't hyped i would not write but i try to rate it rationally: so 6
6.0~very cliché, with low creativity toxmibazar Sign in Permalink I think that the film was an ordinary sci-fi movie not more. The emphasize on Social aspects of human and magical role of love seems just a repeated slogan. The reasoning was completely naive and it's was very cliché. Even the dram and tragedies of the film was childish. In term of story and content I didn't like it overall but there were some nice contradictions in the story esp in the beginning, the sentimental scenes between Matthew and his daughter and also there were some good surprise, however very cliché in sci-fi, at the end of story. I term of visual aspect, this is a good film. I didn't like the story part but this part was good. There were some shots which was crazy. If you like to see a good, well-written film, even sci-fi, and the story,fantasy and creativity is important to you this movie isn't satisfactory I think.
9.0~Solid movie robertzinglar Sign in Permalink Went to see the film Wednesday evening. Overall it was an enjoyable film from start to finish with the help of humor along the way. Excellent casting, descent visuals, and a good sound score. There were times I felt the music was overkill and would drown out certain scenes but overall well done. Story meshed real well too and threw in a few curve balls. I would have liked to see some better visuals from space. Especially when they arrived in the new solar system. Been cool to have seen unique planets of different colors orbiting each other for instance. Something unique to stamp the distance and uniqueness from our system. Trivial but it's those small things :)
9.0~An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown slayerjmk95 Sign in Permalink (This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style) There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit. Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film. Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece. This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.
1.0~Awful Beyond Imagining pwiener-592-552778 Sign in Permalink I was bored and love science fiction movies, so I saw half of "Interstellar" - way too much of it. Since I expected nothing, I wasn't disappointed: that's what I got. Few friends probably planned to see it, so there was no point in telling them not to. It has not a single redeeming feature, and shamelessly copies many films and TV series - 2001, not the least of them. I've seen better sci-fi on 50s or 70s television. It's 100% cliché-ridden from the git-go - the characters, the story, the actors (no acting is necessary!), the "cinematography" (almost non-existent) the music, the locations, the sets, even the editing. What an embarrassment, an insult. It's a film worthy of this year's midterm elections, as it cynically abandons all pretense and respect for imagination, experience, science, detail, creativity, or humor. It is written and plays to the lowest level of intelligence - the entire film does nothing but fulfill expectations set in the first few minutes. You might as well listen to the movie as a podcast. Matt McConnaughey has never been so stereotypically bad. I hope it destroys a few careers. It should.
1.0~Long & boring antigodster Sign in Permalink I'm not entirely sure where to start. It was a visually awesome movie, at the same time as having no tempo whatsoever. It felt like time was standing still, yes pun intended, for the majority of it. Had high hopes for this one, based on the cast and the director. Sorry to say its one of the most boring and tedious movies I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Nothing wrong with the visuals, effects and the performance by the cast. The idea behind it felt plausible as well. I can see that happening in the future. However, the length of it becomes a major problem since absolutely nothing happens for a very, very long time. I consider it a total waste of 3 hours.
7.0~A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it. shawneofthedead Sign in Permalink Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a "ghost" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved. That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters. Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole. But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film. Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect. For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.
2.0~I'm wondering how this got such a good rating... bheadher Sign in Permalink Interstellar has some good points, and some very bad points entertainment wise... First of all, the movie is extremely boring...which may tickle some people I suppose. Literally the first half of the movie is some sort of family affair for the stars, with shots of their flying a drone, and experiencing a huge dust storm at their big farm...only to have McGaunahey and his daughter go off searching for some ultra secret space base out in the boonies, where they find out there is a plan to go through a wormhole to somewhere else... Then we have a crazy robot that is a clone for the mystery obelisk in 2001. This robot never does anything much,except wiggle its segments and occasionally respond to voice... Then the trip into space, on a Saturn 5 rebuild, that links up to a spacecraft fixture in space, which promptly begins revolving to produce pseudo-gravity... A boring flight out to Saturn, through the wormy hole, and we arrive at somewhere else, supposedly a planet...land "in" the water, get thrashed by a tsunami, and here we are...still no solid plot at all... I remember watching the movie Contact, which was boring in it's own way, but this one is ten times worse...only one step above awful...
1.0~Really not that great richardwboase-355-857431 Sign in Permalink Basically, this film was a cross between 2001 a space odyssey and gravity. There wasn't that much to it. The one saving grace was Nolan's inspired depiction of a 5 dimensional space. Very neat. Shame about the flimsy plot, dodgy character development and poor script. Oh yes, and the clunky ridiculous robots were fun. All in all, a waste of money. Nolan should have made a much simpler film, something foreign and arty, to stick his cool 5 dimensional bookshelf into. The rest of the cash he spent on this would probably have done some good somewhere, but such is life. Silly spoiled directors and their silly spoiled foolish vanity trips. BORING
3.0~I must have watched another movie because this was average at best rauh-georg Sign in Permalink I had extremely high expectations about this movie based on ratings although I knew there seem to be two groups of raters: Those who rate it as if it's the best movie ever made, and those who didn't like it and think the high ratings are overrated. After seeing this movie I know I belong to the latter category. I expected an epic, exciting, well let's say "SciFi-themed" movie with depth. Definitely not an action flick, this was clear before I watched and action flicks are *normally* not even my thang anyway. But I was disappointed. I didn't felt anything "epic" about this movie, instead it dragged along, dragged along..and more so. While the plot, in theory, could be considered deep and philosophical there were too many clichés in the movie and parts which made the movie more like into a forced "tearjerker movie" for the Lifetime channel, rather than a serious movie which would open for philosophical questions and debates. Some parts were actually outrageously hideous, seemed forced and misplaced, like the part where in the middle of the movie the female scientist starts rambling off about the importance of love. (Don't get me wrong, this may well all philosophically and spiritually 'right', however selected scientists on a spaceship on a mission are hardly people who'd start with new-age "stoner talk" in the middle of the mission. I didn't buy this at all. I am not even speaking of countless of plot-holes in the movie, such as the escape for humanity allegedly needs a wormhole "to another galaxy". Why to another galaxy? Is our own galaxy with billions of stars not big enough for a potential other Earth? The movie after some time developed into a mere "human drama" flick with less than perfect special effects on occasion. I also found it rather boring, at times I rolled my eyes. One of the VERY FEW movies I could see me walking out of the theatre. Someone else mentioned the "fantastic sound track by Hans Zimmer". As so many who watch movies, I of course know Hans Zimmer sound tracks, some of them you simply can't forget, they're often simple but brilliant. But I found this movie's sound track very poor, if not outright awful. The fact that the awful soundtrack repeated and repeated (as is often the case with Hans Zimmer tracks :) just added to the monotony and boring-nens of the movie. Overall I was very disappointed. After the almost three hours I looked at the clock and felt I entirely wasted this time.
9.0~So Nolan benji779 Sign in Permalink Great Movie, a little difficult to understand, but I guess at the end, it made all perfect sense, of course only if you paid attention to the whole movie, because some people had claim, they've already lost it at the very first 30 minutes. I regret I didn't buy the 4d ticket, because I was really excited at the flying scenes, I hope they don't make a sequel, but another whole different history. I gave 9/10 not a 10, because some of the plots I already realized half through the movie, and it is a really long movie.. but I really loved it, 3 hours were totally necessary and worth it. What I didn't really like, was that you couldn't see more of the earth, like they explain some things about what happened before, but they didn't show how all was left, or how many people had survive (maybe they mention it) but you just can't see it or realize, how many people were living or surviving at that time. Resume: awesome movie, would totally watch it again, just to see if I missed something important to make my own conclusion about the movie.
5.0~I so much wanted to like it but... AidanManchester Sign in Permalink I'm really sorry. I so much wanted to like this film. So much has gone into it and the concept is good, but it just didn't work for me. I found this to be a compact and fanciful story stretched up to intergalactically implausible proportions. It didn't ring true, and it was full of Hollywood formulae, like clumsy cliffhangers. And why did we have to have a Western-style fight scene on an icy planet on the other side of a black hole? There were no punches thrown in 2001. People will say it was too long but it wouldn't be any better if it was shorter. It is also an unremittingly dark and depressing film except for certain aspects. The brilliant special effects, loud sound track and music served to mask the shortcomings. On the plus side it is thought-provoking about space and physics, the actors gave everything, especially the main character, he was brilliant - it didn't have George Clooney in it a big plus. The concept is excellent, and it dramatises aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity such as meeting your children who have grown older than you. I hope a lot of people like it, as I wouldn't want all that effort and commitment to go to waste, so just ignore my opinion! Go and watch it and make up your own mind!
3.0~Good actors, bad movie winopaul Sign in Permalink I loved Gravity, since it was an exploration of human drama. I loved the Star Trek remake since it JJ is pretty dang good, and it was all make-believe and whizzy. I hated this movie. There were respites. When Matthew McConaughey's said "I could fly around that neutron star." I burst out laughing, it was so preposterous, so absurd and so lame. I will admit, he sold the line. If he can pretend to be imaginary people and lie so effectively, it makes me worry about politicians and my friends. It really scares me that Nolan thinks this movie makes any sense. Has his brain turned to Yorkshire pudding? It was written as a series of dramatic expedients. Like Chris just had to have a dust-bowl, so there was a dust-bowl. And Chris just had to have a big ol' rocket launch. There had to be wormholes and time travel and sinking to the level of M. Night Shyamalan, a twist at the end. Another annoyance is Nolan's British elitism, that farmers are dumb peons that don't need to go to college. Note how Coop loves his troubled intellectual daughter and not the son that ends up feeding the planet. Even with these great actors, the situations were so preposterous it was impossible to feel anything but pity for the agents that got them into this mess. A near-future dystopia, where there are cars and trucks but not phones or letters or internet. No government, but no MS13, Hell's Angels and Mafioso raping your daughter. The occasional pervasive dust storm. But the crops grow OK. Until they don't. And somehow we know the planet is doomed, if only because some jerk says it is. There is a huge NASA installation a few hours drive away, but nobody knows about it. Coop sends co-ordinates so he knows it is there. Nolan might want to ask Kip the science guy about causality and determinism. No government, no gasoline, but we have NASA and suspended animation since Nolan needs that little plot trick. Its a drive-by script-- spray some more clichés at it until they call you a genius. And folks, you can't drive into a black hole. Its not black because its mysterious and can be used for incredibility stupid plot tricks. Its black because it rips everything into elementary particles and then perhaps super-strings. There is no daddy's little time-travel library of earthy delights inside a black hole. This could have been OK, it could have been Mad Max crossed with Groundhog Day. Instead, it is just mush, good to keep infants amused with pretty colors and motion, but complete nonsensical mush for adults. Matt Damon was lucky to get blown out into empty space in that little plot cliché. I felt more empathy for the creature in Aliens getting blown into space than I did for Matt. To recap the 7 places in the movie: Home life--BS situation, BS character interaction. Space central- BS situation, BS characters. Space ship, BS situation, BS characters. Planet one- BS situation. Planet two-- BS situation, BS character, BS interaction. Black hole-- BS everything, and I mean every single thing. Planet 3, BS trite. Home again-- BS situations, BS characters, BS interaction. Please studio heads and finance people stop indulging this madman with his infantile fantasies. Even Lord of the Rings was better than this. At this point I usually imagine how I would save the film. Its not re-shoots, every single scene and every single line is stupid, there is nothing here to save. OK, I have calmed down and I can no more give up on a crappy movie than on a baby drowning in a swimming pool. So, add the roving Mad Max gangs that rip him off and pillage and steal. Then they come for his daughter. The NASA installation is not some secret, its where they have been launching the Skynet robots to control us all, right before things collapsed. So Coop takes his little girl, and commandeers a spacecraft. We need the gal, and the black guy but not the other white guy-- what ever happened to him anyway--- Oh, he drowned in Waterworld. I assume he is some famous high-dollar actor, save the money for special effects. OK, now when I saw the cool black guy, I muttered "He's as good as dead" and sure enough, like all cool black guys in every science fiction movie, he died. So lets go against the grain and promise that no matter what, the cool black guy lives. Cut out Waterworld, we already lost the dufus white guy that drowned there. Cut out the black hole-- it is absurd, stupid and insults our intelligence. Cut out the third planet, this script is too complicated as it is. No, they fly to the Matt Damon planet and yeah, he can be a creep. OK, now we have the making of a third act. It revolves around who the women will pick to mate with. Daddy's little girl has grown up, and that science gal is pretty hot as well. I leave it to you to select the ending: 1) The black guy ends up with both of the gals, bless him, and maybe pimps them out (cliche alert). 2) Matt ends up with the daughter, and he beats her and is a drunk (hillbilly heaven). 3) Matthew ends up with his own daughter, since their relationship seemed unhealthy anyway. 4) There are three guys and two gals so pick the guy that ends up alone. 5) The two gals go carpet muncher and leave all the guys in the cold, human race dies. 6) Any two guys being gay leaves both gals for the other guy, unless #5). 7) The Strangelove prodigious breeding ending, where all the guys jump both girls over and over and over and over and over.... well, you get the idea.
3.0~boring, formulaic, annoying, uninspired dholliday-imdb Sign in Permalink I hovered for a while over 5/10, but then this isn't an average film...it's below-average. There's not much to recommend it other than McConaughey's decent performance. Here's a few things that's wrong with this picture: the daughter is, to put it bluntly, a stuck-up bitch to her Dad: surely the most undeserving daughter in the entire universe of a reunion with a long-lost father. At least that's how she was portrayed. the premise is pure shlock daftness: it's a silly idea dreamt up as any old excuse for the journey. And I say this as a hard sci-fi fan (or rather, hard sci-fi taught me that the premise in a story was important). the effects are cheap-looking, even wobbly at some points! How on Earth 99% of viewers applaud the effects is truly lost on me. It just looks like a budget TV version of Lost In Space. there's a lot of crying...a lot. Cheesy as hell. the black character dies (obviously not a spoiler). there's some formulaic conflict later in the film which is just dumb and predictable. Don't expect high-end existentialist conflict ala Hal-9000 vs Dave Bowman. the moments of 'tension' are anything but. They're just boring and overlong. The music doesn't fit (sounds like a hyper-ventilating hysterical version of the brilliantly-understated Jonny Greenwood Soundtrack from There Will Be Blood). the other planets' visuals were dull, grey and utterly uninspired. the resolution was more soap opera than science fiction...and the obligatory wormhole/psychedelic sequence was soul-crushingly down-to-Earth. I felt the urge to leave the cinema early at least 3 times. It's not a 1/10 or 2/10, for those are reserved for the absolute worst film I'd consider rating (something like Pacific Rim or Sphere). But 5/10 is genuinely too kind, considering all the things wrong with it. For some perspective: I largely agree with the high scores of all the other films in the IMDb Top 20, and Nolan's last two Batmans are worth a 7/10 (Inception's an 8). Interstellar is just one of those films where I don't for the life of me understand the praise. Recommended for emotional girls with daddy issues.
9.0~A Beautiful Love Letter Send by Nolan from Outer Space captainmike-michael Sign in Permalink Unlike his usual blockbuster style, Nolan has challenged both himself and the audiences a greater depth in this stunning space opera creatively. Slightly clinched and flawed in term of plot wise, this pure hard science fiction that stresses a lot on Quantum theories, space elements, astrophysics, time, gravity and the rushing, complex and slightly illogical third act might squeeze one's mind in this heavy 3 hours mission, but the worthy and meaningful dialogues, enormous expansion from the universe in Gravity, strong and connecting relationship between father and daughter have overall made the film entertaining, thrilling and thought-provoking. Hans Zimmer﻿ follows the director's effort in terms of scoring, which the musics sound more emotional, calm and creepy rather than the usual loud and powerful style; award-winning cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema did perfect job to present stunning, immersive and state-of-the-art visual effects of the space, wormholes, black hole and unknown planets beyond our galaxy. It might not be the most epic and perfect film, but this love letter from Nolan which is heavily inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, sending through the time and gravity somehow represents a rare film that begins and ends so beautifully and stellar.
10.0~Nolan Delivers Excellence Through Interstellar sabhya-smart Sign in Permalink The movie Interstellar is a roller coaster ride of emotions. It has everything- adventure, love, human relationships and mystery. The movie makes you wonder in a way that you never thought possible. The movie will leave you at the edge of your seat and at the end you will be staring at the credits sequence transfixed by the masterpiece that you just witnessed. After The Dark Knight and The Prestige, i didn't think that Nolan would be able to come with a better movie, but Interstellar proved me wrong. The acting, the screenplay and the execution are all top notch. Mathew McConaughey doesn't disappoint and scientific accuracy lends a sort of authenticity to the story. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE TODAY OR I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WOULD REGRET IT!!!
5.0~Quite Stupid rawrawb Sign in Permalink I cannot see how this film is so high in the IMDb top 250 list, there was so much wrong with this film, the first half drags on with out much depth added to the character we're watching, then when the science bit comes in and we're taken off to space its spoilt by a score that seems to be the very definition of OTT. Then the whole films blow everything its built up by (big Spoiler here) it all being a great big time travel paradox, and that is just so cheap so stupid, are we supposed to think 'love' made it happen, well bah humbug to that, love is many things but I seriously doubt it can make a mathematical equation thats show how to build wormholes or whatever appear out of thin air, because thats basically what the film says. I expected a more plausible conclusion to proceedings for the £10 Vue fleeced me. 5 stars mostly for the snarky robots.
4.0~The fine line between clever and dull and weird... simongreatrex Sign in Permalink Watched it with the Mrs and whilst we would enjoy many films in the top rated list - this one passed us by. Long, boring, weird, trying to be clever - all come to mind I'm afraid... It's a Marmite film - though I like Marmite and didn't like this :-)
1.0~Slow and boring kennethwright-336-642019 Sign in Permalink Lots of plot holes and very obvious. Story takes forever before it even gets up into space. Lots of yabber yabber and not enough space scenes. Pity. I really looked forward to this movie and was let down by poor script. The soundtrack to this movie is just noise. Pity they didn't use the soundtrack from the 4th trailer as that was fitting. The Hans Zimmer soundtrack they ended up using was rubbish. Save your money and skip this movie. Or the very least iMax movie is not justified. Spoiler alert. If the dad really wanted to stop himself from going at the end, just don't give the NASA base co ordinates.
9.0~Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative tavm Sign in Permalink Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.
1.0~Pathetic movie ever watched in my life salik87-8-672927 Sign in Permalink DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! This is the crappiest movie I have ever seen in my entire 27 years on this planet. Not worth 3 hours of watching, I repeat DO NOT GO, I took the time to write this review and signing up on IMDb to post my review so that other get saved from this. Total time waste, if you want to watch it, watch it at a torrent. If you are really interested to go Watch Hunger games and Hobbit is the next big thing
9.0~Gripping, Check; Great Performances, Check; Too long, Hell No! aangaako Sign in Permalink It's my 5th viewing and when did the 169 mins flew I don't know, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Yeah, the score was a repetitive but couldn't agree more with the fact that it was emotionally packed, Hans Zimmer knows what he's doing? Sometimes it feels like the melodrama between Cooper and his daughter ruining the impactful theme of the film but again it was for the emotional connection between those two individuals. Good:- Chris Nolan's Direction, The Nolan brother's tight screenplay, Hoytema's brilliant cinematography, Zimmer's powerful score, Gorgeous visual effects (I like it more than Gravity coz it didn't show us more, it shows less and the rest is left to us to imagine), Great Production Design, somewhat a loud sound effects (due to which some of the dialogue inaudible) but nonetheless it was pretty damn great and The cast's powerful performances specially Mackenzie Foy (as Young Murphy),is a one young talent I don't want to miss. Bad:- The only (and main) reason why the whole concept of the movie didn't suit because of the blight situation. Even with a voracious blight it would take million of years to reduce the Earth's oxygen from it's atmosphere. That's why I give it a 9/10, the only bad reason is also a big enough. So, overall I frickin loved it, hope to see this film again. Just wait for 20 years and it'll be a definite Sci-fi Classic, I mean it'll be a cult classic in those 20 years for sure. (well, it's still a classic though! ;-))
5.0~I so wanted to love this flawed space epic theopriestley Sign in Permalink I love science fiction. I love Chris Nolan films. I love creativity, genius, art, film making. I just didn't love this film. Firstly, the plot was obvious, the 'ghost' was incredibly transparent right from the moment it's mentioned for example. Michael Caine is, as always, perfectly cast but somehow feels completely overused now in a Nolan film and it showed here. I understand the need for gravitas and an A-lister but for Interstellar it has become a tired cliché. Matt Damon ? My God, it's full of (film)stars but the bonkers astronaut was done better with Sunshine. Matthew and Anne put in fine performances but the connection is lacking. And frankly, I really expected so much more than the contrived 'love and humanity' theme. When Anne waffles her way through her reasoning for a particular decision point in the film I had to do a mental 'double-take'. This film tries so hard to be a 2001: A Space Odyssey for the millennial generation and fails. Even the heavy organ soundtrack is too reminiscent of Kubrick. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be homage or a meant as a direct comparison. All it needed was a bunch of monkeys. The visuals: they're good, but they're not spectacular like everyone gushes. I think Gravity held more beauty and impact than this. The wormhole sequence, despite clinging to science and projecting an image of a 3 dimensional gateway as closely as possible was just flat. The best scenes ? You'll wish you saw more of TARS and CASE, the robots that look like 2001 monoliths miniaturised. They have the best lines. I've always paid to watch a Nolan film more than once at the cinema, in some cases 3 or 4 times because of the story, acting and visual impact. I have no inclination to do so for this film, and that has shocked me most of all.
5.0~Faith in the unpossible begob Sign in Permalink Ooo - what a disappointment. I expected something new, not this. I was looking for back story on the state of the climate, but it didn't come. Doubt set in when the exploration theme was raised, with the teacher denying the moon landing. Totally out of left-field, nothing to do with the story. Then the hero turns up at the NASA base - I know it's not random and that this thing loops back on itself, but it just felt odd rather than intriguing. Then the main theme is set up - love may be the ultimate survival adaptation. But they did nothing with it. Then we're through the wormhole, but the story shows almost total lack of curiosity about this new environment. No real attempt to present strange worlds. A big wave in ankle deep water - fair enough. A frozen planet - uuuh, Norway? At this point I was hungry for a bit of action. And we did get treachery - clearly flagged (no touchy my computer) - leading to a ... punch up. Exciting. The end is nice and safe, with double-optimism all around. But don't mention the fact we're already running out of cheap oil. Without that the best we can manage is inter-village hog barter with hand-crank shower units. Do I lack faith?
1.0~A Movie That Thinks It's More IMPORTANT Than It Is damonous Sign in Permalink If you thought Prometheus was ground-breaking, thoughtful, scientifically-plausible sci-fi, you will love this. This is another hollow, vapid "sci-fi" flick written by people who obviously don't love the category. They're so busy trying to explain everything, as if they're embarrassed by the very concepts they're presenting and don't want to be considered "out there" and still want to hang with the cool kids. There are so many incredibly & laughably stupid and boring moments and decisions in this movie, that it is very hard to resist the urge to describe them verbatim. Understand, this is also hard to accomplish when the whole movie is staggered, Jenga-like, on plot twists. I consider Memento, Insomnia, and The Prestige to be Nolan's best films. Inception was overwrought and over-hyped, but enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed The Dark Knight Rises, even though aware of serious plot holes and a borderline-excessive runtime. For me, Interstellar is the worst of Inception (thinks it's more clever and important than it really is) and the worst of Dark Knight Rises (excessive runtime and damaging plot holes), without the fun or grounding of either. From its overdone, overlong opening on Earth, those 40+ minutes make you wonder how a movie named "Interstellar" is ever going to get into space. McConaughey as Cooper is a former NASA astronaut, now just a farmer trying to sustain his crops, son and daughter in a near-future Earth wherein the planet is dying from a not-well-explained or illustrated depopulation and blight. It doesn't help anything that the actor has recently made those embarrassing Lincoln commercials and then to see him talking 'deeply' while driving a truck. Right from the outset, within mere minutes, the only thought that runs through one's mind is: Has Nolan forgotten how to edit his films? Seriously, the whole first quarter or third of the movie is just a very contrived setup for the space adventure that follows. As I stated, it's hard to be more-specific about the movie, and even certain characters and stars, without revealing key plot points. Cooper's daughter, Murphy, is a critical element of the story, as is the family home and (don't ask) the bookcase in her room. But, as much as the movie (or its makers) thinks that you're never going to figure out all of its secrets, they're actually quite obvious (if preposterous) just by knowing that everything is predicated on plot twists. There are some interesting moments when things move into space, and some scenes that resonate regarding the expansive loss of time (relative to that experienced on Earth) for the 4 travelers on a mission to find a new home. But, that connection those scenes make with the viewer are nearly instantly lost because they are nearly all intertwined with stupid writing decisions. Why only 4 travelers? How could they possibly have enough fuel to travel to so many places when earlier expeditions made 1-way trips to only 1 place? Why would the crew split-up unevenly? Why wouldn't Earth send 2 women and 2 men instead of 3 men and 1 woman, when there's a chance they won't be able to return? At least, in a worst-case scenario, if all survived, and they did find a sustainable planet that they couldn't return from, they'd be evenly-paired and (if 1 woman had medical issues) they'd have a better chance to sustain the species. You might think I'm nitpicking on this, but I assure you: this is something the movie itself gets you actively thinking about (species propagation) because of the "Plan B" option of the mission. (Yes, it is referred to as such in the movie.) Perhaps, most crushing to a real sci-fi fan, the film plays extremely loose with physics and depicts worlds which are made less-interesting than they first appear. With the ice world, in particular, there is a concept about its construction which is suggested...gets your imagination running beyond what you're seeing with the special effects, and then that cool vision is very shortly robbed from you. And that, perhaps, is this movie's worst crime: Robbery. It robs you of your time, which is excessive but would be forgivable if it didn't also rob you of your soul and your imagination. Unlike a masterpiece of cinema like 2001: A Space Odyssey, which opens your mind and lets you ponder what is happening, Interstellar never misses a chance to tell you EXACTLY what it wants you to believe. Even to the very most revealing parts of the end. And, that the movie dares to suggest an opportunity for a continuance of the story...I'm sorry, this film was only slightly more intelligent and entertaining than the dreadful Transformers: Age of Extinction. As preposterous as that may sound, Interstellar is clearly cut from the same 'blockbuster cloth', without as much mindless action. As imperfect as Oblivion and Elysium were, they were at least attempts at "thinking man's sci-fi". This is really just a very flimsy father/daughter love story wrapped over to hide a bunch of sci-fi nonsense that its own producers were self-consciously embarrassed of. ...And then there are the robots. --The most inexplicable, ridiculously-designed robots ever to grace sci-fi cinema. There is a moment, in a scene set in a shallow ocean, where we suddenly see the full capabilities of the robots, but it plays a bit like R2-D2 actually having booster jets in the Star Wars prequels, but never having or using them in the chronologically-later movies. If you do torture yourself by watching the Blu-ray, have an extra laugh by watching the making-of documentary on how they articulated these implausible robots using practical effects.
3.0~For those who think 2001 was an action piece. ben_thurber Sign in Permalink So who thought up the science-heavy dialog in this? Sure, for astronomy and science buffs, this would be a goldmine, but I seriously doubt anyone who is not familiar with the concepts would understand it at all. But it is an all-star cast, which goes to prove that you can have the greatest actors ever and still have a lousy script. Okay, so Earth is being destroyed and we have to move. I can gather that, and I can understand the wormhole idea. It's very familiar to me, but why park Humanity next to a black hole? And then we find out it's not a real black hole? Look, all I can say is that the movie is very long with a lot of dialog and no real connection to what is going on. I could think up a thousand better beginnings and several ways to make the script way more dynamic. Instead, as the astronauts travel through the wormhole to explore a possible new home, life goes on back on Earth as a daughter is faced with anger because her dad left them, A fraudulent equation is the one best hope for humanity, but there is an alternative to rebuild. And Matt Damon, aka Jason Bourne, is a pathetic character that is trying to get rescued a little too much. And, in another tie-in with 2001, Matthew McCoughany (sp) falls into a magical portal that helps humanity be saved. Only difference is that, in 2001, it was a black monolith. Here, it's a black hole. So if you're in the mood for a dialog-heavy science movie, go ahead and watch it. If you liked 2001 and Mission to Mars, this might be good for you. Otherwise, pass.
1.0~Extremely low score to bring balance to the over hype. davidsmith907 Sign in Permalink This film is dull and boring and well just forgettable. I imagine by the time I finish this review I will have forgotten most of the film. I will never see it twice. Even people that enjoyed it I would wager they don't rush for a second viewing. Probably most likely only sit through it a second time after 20 years forgetting they'd even seen it. Most talked about the visuals and the sounds. like all Nolan's movies it's big bass and looks good on the eye but unlike Inception this is overly indulgent complicated for the sake of it. The main story behind all the space talk is basically would you spend a life time with your family or give that up and save mankind's race? Answer screw mankind. In the film it's save mankind. As always Hollywood think's humans have a moral compass and we'd all give up our kids for the good of the race. We as humans would not. I would not and proud to say it. My kids come first before all of mankind. Anyone that thinks differently either doesn't have kids or is lying to themselves. And when a movie shows this , I straight away think this main character just left his family behind..what an ass. The film would have been a lot better if it just became what was the only interesting part of it. Rescuing astronauts on new planets. Those parts was the only time I thought cool new planet with stranded person on it this should be interesting. And we got 2 planets and 1 person (Matt Damon) What a pity. Damon was the only person that actually brought the film alive and then he was gone.Damn. Could go through all the space mumble jumble but really can't be bothered. It's duller than watching grass grow. I Like Nolan sometimes but sometimes he goes too far and loses his way(The Dark Knight Rises springs too mind). This film gets way too much credit from loyal fans of his, its up there with his worst movies he's made and I hope he knows it. It's the only way he'l return to making great ones if he see's his mistakes. So to sum up. Dull boring story/way overly complicated/characters no one cares about and by the end your left thinking damn I just lost all that time out of my life and there's no way to bend time to get it back.
10.0~Nolan's Sci-fi magic strikes again on the big screen madhav-notty Sign in Permalink "Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day." that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #INTERSTELLAR even though it was inspired from a poem. Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future. Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember "do not go gentle into that good movie". #INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever seen in this decade. Take a bow Chris Nolan and "orgoglioso DI es sere UN fan DI Christopher Nolan''
1.0~I never review movies but for this kind of crap I feel obligated to write my 2 cents alensukaj Sign in Permalink So, the big movie of the year...The big "thinker", even came up on 9Gag asking is this possible. I got excited. Oh boy,was I wrong... The movie is just terrible, they are just throwing that space terminology around like potatoes and people think: yea this is smart movie, very insightful and out of the box thinking and smart and Stephen Hawking theory-like way of describing something. The people that say-it is great and I got the movie- are just arrogant 323i4h5 trying to look intelligent. A lot of corners left for questioning and I hate the movie where I watch and ask out loud Why The duck did you do that or why the duck didn't you say that when it is obvious it needs more explaining. It all is based on us accepting some facts that they say in the movie only because they use few scientific concepts like neutron stars, spinning black holes, and time dilation. But the rest is just pure guessing and in a bad way. Looks like Nolan wanted to try and give it a shot and in 100 years if he got it right people will say-yea there was some guy Nolan the producer and he was talking about this in the 2015...but I doubt it... I gave review for only two movies on IMDb- this one and Batman Dark knight rises..both same crap or maybe I am just oblivious and dumb for all of the people giving 8.8 on IMDb...
10.0~where no man has gone before Nolan does inanisumeet Sign in Permalink firstly , i like murph as a girl because she looks normal & curious . a joy which only parents can get by watching a spark in their children's eyes . a black hole scientist became executive producer of this movie so scenes are reconciled as much as possible with facts . three dimensional black hole is hard to imagine . the hopeful planets shown are breathtaking . of course , love is central premise in this space journey . time dilation , multi dimensional situations have been explained in simple terms . Michael Caine's poem does not enthuse me . anne Hathaway looks beautiful . as children we were eager for one way trip in space but now we know dangers like loneliness and survival . similar ideas were introduced in a movie about one way journey to sun . the movie is a bit long and taxing on mind if you dive into details . it was not as publicised as batman trilogy . spaceships and multi stage separation of rocket is so real .
3.0~painful and stupid deschreiber Sign in Permalink First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating "music" for this film. As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying. I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out. In fact, I did get out of my seat and watched the last 10 minutes or so from the back of the auditorium near the exit door.
5.0~Hmmm, a bit unsure... HeathenHungr Sign in Permalink This movie is hard for me to do a review on, since the hype also caught me and I enjoyed the movie and the ideas/theories behind it when I watched it... But here a couple of weeks later, it seems overrated and to be frank a bit pious to me. There is just something about the movie that seems off to me, the acting, the ideas, the message... Hard for me to put my finger on, perhaps it feels (to me) just like another movie with this "New World Energy Message" plot that Hollywood and people like Echardt Tolle is making a lot of money on. To boil it down, it's not a bad movie - just don't start analyzing it :-)
1.0~This was really baaad dflan Sign in Permalink From the moment this movie started it fell flat. The characterization development was not there. The plot was barely there and all over the place throughout the story. I wanted to sleep after 30 to 45 minutes because the acting was horrible and from even our seasoned favorite actors. WTH was going on within this almost THREE hours of screen time. I think a hit of acid may have helped to enjoy this movie as well as to diffuse the loud overbearing noise called music in it. Then I begin thinking to myself, "hey, maybe they dropped some LSD or constantly hitting some bowls between takes while filming because it felt like I was in a serious haze of drugs due to everything so da*n flat. (this is suppose to be humor because I do not do drugs, but I was thinking I may need something to get through this one because it was painful really really painful) Poor execution in directing as well as thoughtfulness within the story trying to be told sorta like constipation.
9.0~What a way to bring science back to Science Fiction! edwinvanboekel Sign in Permalink What a great movie. What a wonderful story. For me there are not enough superlatives to put on this film. I was finally able to convince my wife not to go to an art-house movie but to this monster instead. She was not sorry. And however high my expectations were, I was not disappointed. Not at all. Finally a real SF-movie. No Trolls, no wizards, no fairy tales. Just plain science. Someone really thought about the levels of reality (Yes, of course. Gnomes do exist. In your mind!) For me as a fan of SCIENCE Fiction, it was a great experience. Afterwards I read the book by Kip Thorne, about the science behind it all. I know there is a documentary about it. I have to watch it. And fellow men, this is not all. The directors are planning on filming the Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov. I can't wait. There is no way they can spoil that! Live long and prosper.
10.0~Out of this world kosmasp Sign in Permalink A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time. Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...
10.0~The music alone deserves an Oscar spaceweezle Sign in Permalink I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd regard another SCI-FI movie higher than I do Aliens. Well that day has come. Despite the glaring flaws in the plot, it's still an amazing movie. The acting from the entire cast is so astonishingly consistent, but Mathew just knocked it right out of the park. Move over Pachino/Deniro, what Mathew accomplished here is beyond pretentious head wiggling and moving your eyes from side-to-side every 3 seconds, it's more than just persona, it's pure and flawless emotion. The music - An equally impressive masterpiece. It transcends the normal boundary of mere storytelling and fiction, it intoxicates you with this feeling that you are connected with the prowess and struggles of man-kinds greatest accomplishments. Intensely powerful, yet extremely divisive in illustrating the gravity of what is happening. So extremely rare that both the movie and the music live up to each other, especially at such a high standard. But this culmination is why I think Interstellar is the best Sci-fi movie ever made. It also ranks quite highly on my list of best movies ever made. Hans Zimmer and Mathew.M both deserve Oscars for this.
1.0~Confused and shaky in delivering the message kambizpa-156-647696 Sign in Permalink In the opening night, I walked out from the movie theater, totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance. Poorly developing plot, immature explanation of astrophysics, unbelievable and unrelated events and characters, especial effects leveled to a Disney comedy, and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression. Even Mathew McConaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter, older than himself. Mat Damon probably did his career's worst acting. The robot was another annoying part. What did Anne Hathaway and two other guys add to the story? Using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an inter-galaxy spaceship??? Finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole, in "another galaxy" seemed easier than finding an ATM machine in a US interstate highway. Why would a director hire a "Black-Hole-World-Expert" as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? Just reading the worm hole article in Wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge. Mr. Nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message: Awareness of climate changes, saving human species, teaching relativity theory to common movie goers, or the power of love. Each of them bold and superficial.
1.0~Absolute Tripe! jimford00 Sign in Permalink I'm really not justified in reviewing this film - it was instantly forgettable! What I do remember though is that the character 'Coop' mumbled in a near incomprehensible 'Deep South' accent, such that I could barely make out 50% of the dialogue, and had to put the subtitles on. The bizarre thing though is that he had his mouth open wider when he was _not_ talking ('trying to catch flies'), than when he was! The other thing is, if you're going to 'do' science, do it at least with a modicum of accuracy, otherwise stick to magic 'a la' Harry Potter!
1.0~Christian Review miletelp Sign in Permalink Spoiler Alert! I am taking time to do this review to inform the "Christian community" about the movie from our shared belief system. For anyone who is not a Christian, you may want to pass this review up and go to the next review. I begin by stating that I believe that God is real. My following statements will reflect that point of view, so do not get upset because you have been warned. "Interstellar" The movie begins slowly and very slowly, drags along, and maintains a "gloomy" and "dark" side, throughout the movie. It screams the writers' point of view, which is: "the hopelessness and futility of life" and "the save the planet" religious systems, and he/she merges the two religions because "people are evil". (because we destroy the planet not because we break Gods commands and evil is in our hearts) After our resources were drained by overpopulation and our excess (because Hollywood writers and actors have no excesses; LOL!), our last hope is "NASA". Yes folks, "NASA". Because the we (the human population) do not find it useful to waste our resources on educating people. Quote: we need more farmers not engineers" "NASA" secretly has a plan to save the planet. At first, you start to get everyone is talking about a higher power. Everyone speaks of a higher form of life that is guiding them and helping them. No one knows who or what that life form is. So, "NASA" who is aware of these mystery saviors (of the world) go forth secretly to save the human race. A long space journey through worlds drags this sad movie along, with twists and turns and every liberal democrat you in Hollywood showed up for a cameo. They must have been in this movie instead of voting on 4th. So, thinking about it; I may have been a bit too critical of this movie. The Lord can use evil to accomplish His divine purposes, as we know. Spoiler Alert! In the end, we are saved by ourselves. It was ourselves, from a multi-dimensional universe that reached out over time to save ourselves. We had evolved into higher life forms. Does any of this ring a bell? At the end of the movie, I felt I needed 2 things: first, was to write this review to stop anyone from blindly walking into another attempt to make "God in mans image" movie; on unsuspecting movie goers. Second: I now feel, I need to pray for God to forgive us, Americans. We have again insulted Him again in this movie. Elevating Man through evolutions will ultimately become like gods and go back in time to save ourselves. At least then, I would have saved $7 dollars and 2 hours of my life. I know that at least being saved I will live forever. I have the time to spare. I just would not have spent it in this movie. God Bless You!
1.0~The worst 3 hours of my life! eliasny Sign in Permalink What a huge pile of steaming poop! I could not believe that the movie critics gave this horrible movie a 9.2 rating. The movie is slow as hell. The characters are so badly developed that you never care for them. Good actors play characters that appear in the movie juts to be disposed off soon after. The special effects are pretty weak. You see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls. But, of course, they make lots of ugly faces. You should see the movie Stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects. The robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie. The plot is just so far fetched that I caught myself smiling at times. Who let the writer into the cutting room?! 3 Hours! Are you serious?! Only an unabashed Christopher Nolan fanboy would have the courage to claim to have found any redeeming quality on this "practical joke". $200,000,000.00 US Dollars. What a waist!
5.0~Another atrociously overrated brain fart from Nolan E-m-p-e-r-o-r Sign in Permalink This film is another film in a long line of films from Nolan, where all the substance is in the craft. Nolan is not Spielberg, although he tries at times hard to emulate him. Spielberg, whose main weakness is simplicity of human emotion and stubborn inability to explore the gray areas of the human condition, is both a great technician and has a strong grasp of film making essentials, such as pacing/character development/connecting with the audience/communicating his vision... Nolan generally lacks in all these skills. He's a great craftsman, but he has no idea what the hell his own film is about. There's no vision in this film. No perspective. No character development. No connection with the audience. The pacing is bordering on amateurish; he speeds up when he should be slowing down, and slows down when he should be increasing the pace or maintaining the pace. These film making nuances fly over Nolan's silly, endlessly pretentious head. He thinks putting in a ludicrous, nonsensical and blatantly pseudo-scientific twist at the end will save this schlock from mediocrity. It doesn't. I found myself sighing and rolling my eyes and shaking my head. This film, when all is said and done, is another missed opportunity to create something truly inspiring; epic even. This was not a film to give to a master craftsman. It's a shame Spielberg passed this on, because in more capable hands this could have been a masterpiece. Instead, it's just a technically proficient hollow shell of a movie that has already been forgotten by most. This will not become the classic that Nolan dreamed it would. 2001: A Space Odyssey this is not. Not even close.
1.0~Complete nonsense done with a lot of arrogance boydwalters Sign in Permalink This was a corker ... Mathew Maconnaghay painted a strange colour yellow for most of the film ... He also has a really badly put on accent ( god knows what its supposed to be ) ... Family Family Family Hollywood can only drivel on about Family ... The ONLY decent acting in this came from John Lithgow who mak=de an early exit ... The plot is chucked together from the usual suspects ... The director obviously watched 2001 too often ... The time anomaly at the end seems to be a K hole ... I mean !!! ... Get over it ... This is seriously mediocre time filler ... There is no intelligence going on here, just the usual Hollywood drivel ... Uninspired visuals ... And a serious lack of imagination ... I spent nearly 3 hours on this thing as I thought it may pay off in the end ... I was soooooo wrong Vapid and insulting
1.0~Even Worse than Tomorrowland! corplawyer-25-302102 Sign in Permalink Where do I begin? I don't want to simply repeat what others here have said. They are right. This is a large, stinking pile of horse manure. So, what can I add? First, Matt does the exact opposite of what comes from the Kevin Costner school of acting. With Kev, I don't know what he is thinking, since his range is from 4.97 to 5.03. As if Botox had been injected. Matt is not like that. But with him, he seems to be acting in a different movie. Half the time, when he is not mumbling, he is animatedly reacting to something other than what is before him on screen. Weird. Second, let's talk physics. No, not black holes. Not wormholes. Not relativity. None of that. Instead, let's go back to Sir Galileo Galilei. And inertia. Yes, The Law of Inertia. Do you know what inertia is? My 10 year old daughter does. She remembers from when she was 4 years old, and played with a ball. She would throw the ball, and it kept on going for a while. Eventually, it stopped because of rolling friction. Without friction, or some other vector, the ball keeps on going. Now, let's take space. In space, when something is moving, it tends to keep on moving. Yes, there's gravity, and that pulls, but let's ignore that for a moment. Now, let's go to the docking scene. Play back, in your mind if you will, the motion of the spacecraft as it tried to line up for docking. Did you see how quickly it went back and forth? That is RIDICULOUS. A bunch of tons do not suddenly go back and forth, as if someone was holding a model aircraft in his hand and trying to fit it in somewhere. It has INERTIA. If a force is applied to it opposite from the direction it is moving in, it will slow down, and then start to go in the other direction. It will not do so QUICKLY, BACK AND FORTH. Even 50 years ago, when man first started going into space, the average person understood this. Today, anyone who drives a car understand this. My daughter understands this when she tries to move something heavy. What idiot involved in making this movie did not?
10.0~artwork enrpat-1 Sign in Permalink This is a work of art. Despite its deep complexity, Interstellar is never difficult to understand. Besides, its absolute beauty is always present. This is not an action film, it doesn't include spaceships battles and does not confront good or bad, fortunately. It is, however, the most beautiful space exploration that I remember seeing, without discrediting other films. Because Interstellar never competes against any other film: stands alone by itself and take the most complex issues of quantum physics and flows during the movie like astronauts in space, with terrific performances, remembering that we are human beings attached to others, and first of all, we are explorers, we evolve and what we see is more wonderful than what we think we know. An absolute, magical and wonderful artwork. I recommended this movie a thousand times.
6.0~Could've been amazing shad_emin Sign in Permalink Up until the point where he went into the black hole, this film was amazing, especially the detail in the special effects and I the actors' performances were mostly awesome. However... 1. The fact that Coopwer didn't disintegrate at once when entering the black hole was bull-crap. Even if he had gotten help from "the others"; that scene was too long and too dramatic to be scientifically correct, but fine, it's Hollywood. 2. This point is the one that annoys me the most, but I do understand that some might find me picky; In the the Tesseract, Cooper suddenly suffers from MASSIVE MEMORY LOSS. He acts like it's the first time he sees his own past and here is also the only part were the acting is a tad bit iffy (perhaps cause Matthew himself found this part as total bullshit too). It was truly sad and got me agitated, cause I couldn't really appreciate the movie anymore after this point...even though "he came back to his senses" by providing the answer in binary codes to his daughter via the clock. 3. Boot-strap paradox. Sorry, not a fan of it and I don't believe it's possible, but it didn't bother me too much since it hasn't been proved to be impossible either. It should be said that I probably would've given this movie 9 or even a 10, but at least 3 stars got lost during that stupid Tesseract/Coopers goes mental scene. He KNOWS his own past and was in perfect mental and physical condition, so why he acts like it hasn't happen before (thereby just repeating his own past) doesn't make any sense to me. I can't say that point 1 and 3 are "impossible", but these scenes weren't in line with my scientific point of view. However, since I can't write them off; I wouldn't have reduced the movie's rating with more than a star. That beginning of the Tesseract scene, though. Gaaah! Shame-o.
2.0~Bloated, Self-Absorbed Nonsense chipswetnam Sign in Permalink All of the fanboys and girls must have also been in love with "The Emperor Has No Clothes" too. This story is thin, the characters are under developed, the emotional and logical shortcuts are ridiculous, Matt Damon is horribly cast and has become a caricature of himself, the set pieces are not inspiring, the music cues try to be bombastic enough to create emotion that simply doesn't exist and the science is a mess. When a self-important filmmaker reaches a level of success where no one will tell them "no" anymore, this is what comes of it. The scientific equation that sums up this film is as follows: Nolan + Interstellar = Lucas/Spielberg + Crystal Skull. A completely unremarkable and forgettable film. The Emperor truly has no clothes.
2.0~Long Boring and Just Awful john_hugo Sign in Permalink WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS There are so many things wrong with this film. People land on a water planet with an ocean 1 foot deep, and get hit by a 300 foot tidal wave. Huh? They need huge chemical booster rockets to escape Earths gravity, but launch effortlessly from a planet with greater gravity. The whole dying Earth thing makes no sense at all. If dust were destroying all the farms, I imagine, we would start building dust free greenhouses. None of the science makes sense in this film. It is a shame that there are so many people being paid to write fake reviews. The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating, is that I kinda liked the robot. Since I dished out so much money for the Blue Ray, I felt that I had to watch the whole thing. But I was praying for this crapfest of a film to end. Don't waste your time on it.
1.0~Pretentiously self-regarding, portentously self-indulgent Jonathan Dore Sign in Permalink Hard to believe that this script went through all the development it would have done to justify the $165 million spent on the project and still remain so bloated. The narrative has at least an hour's-worth of material (visits to not one but *two* dead-end planets) that could have been omitted with any of several simple plot devices so as to get us to the all-important "inside the black hole" denouement with no loss of drama but imposing considerably less on the audience's patience and good will. And even typing "inside the black hole" brings home the absurdity of that denouement: a super-evolved humanity using it to transmit back in time crucial information without which it would not have survived to super-evolve in the first place -- a paradox supposedly solved by their being able to manipulate time, but which is lazily used to imagine that this somehow frees time from causality. As if that weren't enough, Cooper makes the effort to spell out "Stay" to his past self already knowing that he's going to ignore his own advice, and presumably knowing that if he didn't ignore it, he wouldn't be there to transmit the civilization-saving data either. And why would he want himself to have stayed anyway? To save his daughter from being upset on that particular day? The absurd juxtaposition of narrative registers -- folksy intergenerational family drama on the one hand, high-concept time travel with high-stakes civilizational survival on the other -- is almost surreally ludicrous. "Weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable". And also utterly exhausting.
8.0~Very good movie AntoArdigo Sign in Permalink I really liked the idea and the plot full of unexpected points and developments. Especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. I don't give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant, like in other Nolan's movies.
3.0~Poor poor what happened NOLAN!!! chrisharty Sign in Permalink Once again Christopher Nolan try's to make his dreams come alive on screen again but I'm sorry it was best left in your head and should have stayed a dream. I can only imagine this film was written after a good nights sleep you climb out of bed have a quick think about the bizarre dream you had write it on a notepad and then turn it into a film. I loved the first two batmans but this film is worse than the dark knight rises , inception, man of steel all made by Nolan . to sum up the film it's nearly 3 hours long and overwritten i love sci fi but I'm afraid someone was trying to be too smart and make you think about the plot in detail but fails badly . Poor film big budget once again
10.0~Interstellar- a love story across space and time durgapmisra Sign in Permalink Interstellar Review(SPOILER ALERT): Christopher Nolan's latest endeavor reaches out into the farthest corners of space, quite unlike Inception where he plummeted the depths of the human mind. The premise is the oft quoted disaster scenario; only this time it appears to be much more realistic with food running out for earth's 6 billion inhabitants and mankind seemingly destined to suffocate as the oxygen content of the atmosphere starts to dwindle. However there is a distant hope for salvation- a wormhole has been placed in the vicinity of Saturn (cue 2001: A Space Odyssey) seemingly by some "higher beings" which may provide an escape route for mankind to reach out to potentially habitable worlds. Only if we can overcome Murphy's law (whatever can happen, will happen, including whatever bad can happen). Steps in Matthew McCounaughey (Cooper) to head an expedition of 4 travellers {Dr Amelia Brand(Hathaway-who leaves behind her ageing father, Professor Brand AKA Michael Caine), Romilly(Gyasi) and Doyle(Bentley)}, accompanied by 2 magnificent robots, TARS and CASE (although constructed in the spirit of HAL, these two AI are quite the extreme opposite of HAL in every sense). Cooper's sacrifice is leaving behind his two young children{Tom(child –Timothy Chalamet, adult-Casey Affleck) and Murph(child-Mackenzie Foy, adult-Jessica Chastain)}, not knowing if he will ever make it back to them again. Crossing the wormhole leads our explorers into a system orbiting a black hole (The Gargantuan), with three potentially habitable planets named after the brave explorers who made a near-definite one-way trip to these worlds. The movie is a fantastic sequence of interstellar adventures, but does not need any "Aliens" to spoil the show (does mankind really need an external influence to destroy it, when we are experts at self destruction?). Not wanting to spoil the rest of the movie, it suffices to say that the final act of the movie is a dizzying sequence combining human bravado, survival instincts and love into a heady mix that takes time and possibly repeated viewing to really absorb the meaning of. Suffice to say, the man who played the priest (read Man of Faith) in my erstwhile favourite science fiction movie, Contact, sees his career complete a nice circle by himself making a jump of faith, both metaphorically and literally, this time. Add to this the hauntingly beautiful music of Hans Zimmer, and a couple of "wow" moments, one of which leads to the demise of the antagonist (yes there is one), and you have the complete package. The last scenes are guaranteed to make your eyes swell up as a satisfying conclusion is reached to this grand tale. McCounaghey and Chastain play stellar roles, and this film is guaranteed for Oscar nomination in multiple categories, technical as well as acting. It also demonstrates the superiority of 2-D hand-held cameras over the current slew of 3-D digital shooting, and is possibly the last film to be shot on IMAX. As much as it might seem an action adventure fantasy, it is much more a parent-child love story than anything else, and may not appeal to all audiences, hence the fiercely divisive opinions amongst critics already. Over time, this shall be acknowledged as one of the masterpieces of 21st century filmmaking, much in the way 2001 attained its acclaim years after release.
5.0~Could have been better holloway-sarahjane Sign in Permalink Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The "Dust Bowl" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many "that wouldn't happen" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive.
6.0~Not a big fan of the underlying message hbh-77851 Sign in Permalink Love saved the universe. Love. I'm fine with the idea of love being a powerful emotion, but as a sci-fi, especially a quite serious one with well-respected scientist as it's scientific advisor, it is quite cringy to have personal love as core of human survival in a cruel universe.
5.0~A great subject idea damaged by the plot and saved by Zimmer mirko-prezioso Sign in Permalink Even the title Interstellar evokes greatness, and the movie express this greatness through terrific photography supported by great picture quality (go to IMAX 70mm) and definitely communicated by soundtrack. Nolan knows that when you have Hans Zimmer on board you have an insurance: with his music you can transform even your dog daily service in an epic movie. Moreover the movie has a wonderful editing which give a great pace to the story. 9/10 on everything up to now. But when it comes down to the plot we barely reach 6/10. I will never understand why those Hollywood mega-productions that can do everything and have all these great subjects cannot avoid to make trivial mistakes across the plot. While looking at the movie it is like realizing that some good person had great ideas starting from the subject following with great details like the dust, the robots, the hibernation beds, and then somebody comes and place here and there some very simple mistakes. Here some: First of all,the whole thing does not add up: the first time Cooper leave earth, who sent him the NASA coordinate?? NON SENSE. second, at the starting of the movie you know the ending because too much emphasis has been placed on the message 'STAY'. I understand it adds a lot of drama to the departure scene but really spoils the ending. From there on you are only curious on how he will communicate back, which became clearer while watching the rest of the movie. Third, I loved the transition between the departure from home with the truck and the rocket launch BUT wait a moment. Three stages Saturn V rocket to reach the Earth orbit (..OK they were using spares from Apollo mission..OK..) and in all the rest of the movie these guys land and launch from 3 different earth-like planets by using simply the small spacecraft??? C'mon. Fourth, OK, you are trapped and the only person who can save humanity by communicating through time and what is the first thing you send to your daughter? Of course binary coded coordinates of NASA installation!! Not your name, not her name, but coordinates of the NASA launch site, so that the younger-yourself can LEAVE!If only all that you want is for him to STAY which is what you will send immediately after. OK maybe he do not know that he, him self, will start the whole thing just by following those coordinates..:/ WTF!!why?? Guys, I can understand you need to send Cooper to NASA, but couldn't you find something else? Fifth. This is minor, but really annoys me that in 2014, in the Interstellar production, you, screenwriters team, need AGAIN to make someone to slide and fall and trap her leg to create AGAIN the run-for-it-but-I-cant scene, on a planet in which every minute is a year wasted in the search for humanity salvation and to bring back some unknown data!? C'MON! You guys, have the best technicians and movie artisans, can afford almost everything you like, then again, why you have to slide on the banana peel? I will never understand.
3.0~The lonely cow-boy saves the world once again. wazoox Sign in Permalink Yeah, that's about it. More using his balls than his brains, the lonely cow-boy finds his true mission, struggle and win against all enemies, even taming the black hole, saves the world and in the end leaves in the sunset to go back to the woman who's eagerly waiting for him. People dare comparing this to "2001"? Yeah, it's long, like 2001, and spacey. But where 2001 is all in allusion and mystery, this movie explains laboriously again and again what's happening, just in case. Most scenes are long. So long. The ships try docking and fail, again, and again, for long, long minutes. Stranded in inhospitable landscapes, they escape repeatedly each danger from the unknown (the huge wave, the slippery ice, the toxic atmosphere), so that even the most inattentive spectator gets it. The acting is good, and images beautiful, therefore it deserves 3.
9.0~70mm IMAX a MUST RobertHouse Sign in Permalink I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because while it is not perfect because nothing is, I at least thought it was perfect for the genre. I also would like to not that a vote of 9.5 is impossible for some reason and I think that is insane. People say all the time sci-fi is a hard genre and I disagree. The truth of the matter is space is a hard subject to make an interesting movie about. In this movie the only problem is if you have seen Gravity you at least got to look at a beautiful woman on the screen for quite some time. This movie (I have to be honest) Anne Hathaway does not look her best. Which makes sense because how can someone expect to look like a top model while spending so much time in space? Any who I had the pleasure in seeing this movie in 70mmm IMAX film and let me say I highly recommend it. I wish all theaters or at least all of the people wanting to see this film could see it in 70mm. I felt like it was the way the movie was intended on being viewed. Overall great movie for the fans of space. This movie is the dream of any kid that has ever dreamed of space. My second and last tip for those who have not seen the movie yet, is pay attention from the first minute to the last. You have to pay attention or you will miss something. Which we should all know by now since the Director is Christopher Nolan.
5.0~Nice scenario but boring film micfb-22278 Sign in Permalink It was so boring! It was 3 hours long and nothing was interesting....... Do not bother watching it. You will be disappointed!!!!!!!!! In the end it was kind of interesting,but to get to the end u had to get through 2 hours of really boring content..... The scenario though makes sense and was new. I liked the space theme,but the fact that it was so boring made me despise this movie in general.... In conclusion it is a pretty bad movie, boring ,uninteresting and I will NEVER watch it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In my opinion you shouldn't see it either. It is a waste of time. I hope you take this review seriously and not rage with it!
3.0~Out of this World and Inexplicable! rx2587 Sign in Permalink It's a long movie, almost 3 hours. And I didn't understand it. Here are some of the questions that left me baffled: What was happening on earth? We saw frequent dust storms, but we also saw verdant fields with corn crops. We also saw a lake near the farm, suggesting water was available. In the distance, you can even see a home on the shore near the water's edge. Still, something disastrous was happening so dire that the human population was going to perish. What was it? Why were farmers burning their crops? Why did the government publish new textbooks that taught we never landed on the moon? Murph got into a fight with her classmates because she refused to accept the textbook teaching. Really? Arguments about textbook content is a fighting matter among 10-year old children? Coop was able to hack into a drone aircraft's computer software using his laptop. And his 10-year old daughter was able to fly it and land it using her finger on the touch-pad? Really? Dr. Cooper had served as a pilot for NASA, but was now farming with his family. Yet, he did not know about the NASA center located near his farm. Moreover, NASA needed a qualified pilot and did not know Dr. Cooper was nearby on a farm. Really? Cooper and his daughter Murph drive to the coordinates they have mysteriously received. The road leads to a locked gate at a fenced off area. Dr. Cooper retrieves his bolt cutters to open an entry into the restricted area. Why? After confronted by security forces at the gate, why were they escorted inside the restricted area all the way into the center of the complex? The NASA launch, with Dr. Cooper at the controls, required booster rockets in order to break out of the gravitational field of the earth. But when his spacecraft lifted off of 2 other alien planets, and both had gravity somewhat similar to that on earth, no booster rockets were required nor used. How did that happen? The crew made the long voyage by sleeping in some kind of aquatic state. I realize this is a fantasy often used in sci-fi, but here's the rub. How do they come out of this state, months or years later, with no muscle atrophy? Miraculously, they are able to arise and walk about as they did before. While on the first planet in their mission, Cooper has homed in on the beacon signal emanating from Miller's spaceship. They land on shallow water. Everyone appears to walk on the water. When Cooper sees the threat of an advancing tidal wave, he orders everyone back inside the ship. Amelia Brand is too far away and can't return in time. TARS the robot must rescue her. Meanwhile, Doyle can reenter the ship, but inexplicably doesn't. He waits until TARS returns with Brand and ensures that they enter the ship first. The tidal wave then crashes onto the ship killing Doyle who had failed to timely get back inside. Why was Doyle such an idiot? While on the second planet in their mission, we learn that the explorer Mann is a psychopath. But what was his plan? What motivated him? Why try to kill everyone? TARS went first into the black hole followed separately by Cooper, and the camera stays on Cooper and his journey. His ship breaks apart under the forces inside the black hole and Cooper must finally eject from the ship. But Cooper himself, enclosed within his space suit, never breaks up, never gets crushed, and apparently, neither did TARS. How did that happen? Cooper finds himself on the other side of his daughter's room at the farmhouse. Actually, he is in the room but on the other side of her bookcase. And because of the time warp, he can see his daughter in the room and himself too. In other words, he can see the scene we saw at the beginning of the movie but from another dimension. He is now in 2 places at once. How did this happen at the bottom of the black hole? He communicates with his daughter by moving objects such as books from the shelf. She initially attributes it to a poltergeist, but recognizes an intelligence behind the telekinesis. Somehow, not fully explained, she decodes a message which appears to be in Morse code, to read "Stay." Incidentally, who still uses, much less has memorized, the Morse Code? Cooper then sends a message to himself in binary which appears in the dirt on the floor of the room. Again, it is never explained how Dr. Cooper is able to decode binary signals (ones and zeroes, ons and offs, whatever) into map coordinates. The coordinates identify the location of the NASA center. Aside from the mystery of how the communication was even deciphered, why did Cooper send conflicting messages -- one saying to stay, and the other directing where to find NASA? Later, when Murph has grown into an adult, Cooper sends her messages using the second hand on a wristwatch. These are in Morse code, and Murph is able to decode the messages and arrive at a mathematical solution that proves to be the salvation for humanity. Upon realizing the solution, she ecstatically litters the floor of the NASA Center, where she is now working, with her papers. What was the solution? Cooper is found floating in space near the planet Saturn. He is rescued just in time. We learn that he didn't have much oxygen left in his space suit. Well, duh! How did Cooper exit the black hole to arrive at this spot in space?
5.0~What the heck? karyparker1 Sign in Permalink What the heck? I was really enjoying this movie, and then about half way through I though I was watching the wrong movie. It went from normal NASA space movie to the space version of inception. Also Matthew's character uses the word "Merph" every single chance he gets. No wonder that girl didn't like her name, she was sick of her dad saying it 50 times a day! The movie had a overall unique idea that was just poorly executed and was just ended up being confusing. It had great cinematography, great acting, a beautiful soundtrack, and the plot was good until about the middle of the movie. I expected to like it more than I did.
3.0~Like the wind, blows right over my bald head ninjathedog Sign in Permalink **** Vague spoilers ***** 8.7 on IMDb at this point of time. I guess no one wants to admit that they didn't understand half of what was happening in the show so they call it EPIC! Which probably stands for Erroneous Physics In Cinema. For the record, I wouldn't know if the baffling babble talk they mentioned was accurate or not. More than half the time, I was bored to tears. You reach your WTF moment when he gets into that space behind the wall of his daughter's bookshelf, which fully explains the Poltergeist episodes in the house. Its a good thing he didn't appear in someone's toilet and had to watch endless eons of people taking a crap. Maybe I'm a bubble gum cinema goer, so be it, chew on. :)
3.0~a promising let down ctiiniraq Sign in Permalink Glad I waited to watch this on an already paid for subscription online. This movie showed so much promise and I found myself laughing at the frivolous attempts at pretending to understand physics. They could have used Science Fiction to the full extent of the unknown and blown the effects out of the water, but rather, they used half-witted science to try and make the concepts realistic. The other half of the movie I was laughing at the sad attempt to establish some sentimental relationship between characters. All too often relationships were summarized in a poor attempt at back fill. The beginning of the movie was confusing and near the end of the movie I found myself playing with my dog rather than even trying to watch. Don't get your hopes up.
4.0~The most overrated movie on IMDb right now, a complete letdown summerloud Sign in Permalink If you saw "sunshine" and thought "wow, good thing they had scientist advisers, this stuff is so plausible", you will like "interstellar". If you saw "armaggeddon" and thought "what an awesome movie, i just wished they would have dragged the scene where he says goodbye to his daughter out even more", you will like "interstellar". If you saw "inception" and thought "this movie would be so much better in SPACE!", you will like "interstellar". And if you liked "2001" or any other intelligent/geeky sci-fi movie, you will hate "interstellar". Like some of Nolan's earlier works, it's long for the sake of length only. Its plot is up there with "armaggeddon" in pure stupidity and forced US-cowboy-patriot-macho-ism, its special effects are underwhelming, its plot twists are obvious, its setting makes no sense, its characters are flat and forgettable, and its constant citations of "2001" just serve to make you remember how much better Kubrick did all of this with a tiny fraction of the money almost 50 years back. Disappointing.
1.0~My "understanding" of the story (contains multiple spoilers) tjoff Sign in Permalink 1. Cooper is driving around with his kids to catch a drone. This has nothing to do with the story, but apparently someone thought the movie was not long enough 2. We find out the earth is dying and that humanity has no hope. 3. Cooper sends himself a dust message, telling himself to go on a trip so that he can enter the black hole he is already in. 4. Cooper and his daughter Murph drives to the coordinates from the dust message. They find what looks like a military base. Instead of trying to knock or shout "Anyone home?" they try to break in and are immediately captured. 5. NASA is happy they captured Cooper since he is the best pilot for an upcoming space mission. Cooper is asked to fly through a wormhole near Saturn to find a planet to colonize. 12 pilots has been sent before and 3 of them has marked planets as possible targets for future mankind. NASA is working on a formula to manipulate gravity so they can send their whole base into space and save humanity, but the equation is not complete yet. 6. Cooper sends himself another message, via Murph, from the black hole. This time it says "Stay" but Cooper ignores the warning from himself. If he had bothered to stay and find out some more maybe he could at least have told himself to go straight into the black hole and skip the fuss with the other planets, making the movie shorter but it seems they really wanted to have a long and boring movie 7. Cooper goes into space with a small number of other astronauts and a robot that looks like a few metal boxes glued together. Murph is on earth, angry that Cooper went away. 8. Cooper flies through the wormhole and comes to the solar system with the planets they hope to be able to inhabit. The solar system has a huge black hole, Gargantua, and we find out the astronauts already have knowledge about this and somehow still thinks this solar system seems promising. 9. Cooper with crew decides to land on a planet with water, where times goes approximately 61000 times slower than on earth. For time to move this much faster gravity must be insane or the speed of the planet close to the speed of light, but maybe the planet somehow managed to find a balance between the two, even though it is hard to understand how... Instead of trying to observe the planet from space or send the robot to the surface they decide to land and get into some trouble caused by a huge tidal wave, making several years pass in Earth time. The planet is not inhabitable. 10. They fly to the next planet, or it turns out it is not really a planet, it is only frozen clouds. The astronaut that marked this planet as inhabitable (Dr Mann) only did so to attract another space ship since his own has crashed. Dr Mann tries to murder Cooper by headbutting him outdoors. They are both wearing astronaut helmets but only Cooper's break from the headbutt for some reason... Cooper is saved by the crew. 11. Dr Mann tries to steal the ship to escape home, but he messes up and dies in an explosion. 12. Cooper and Amelia are now the only astronauts alive. They have very little fuel and Cooper sends off Amelia to the third planet while he himself heads towards the black hole in his space suit together with the robot. 13. Cooper survives the perilous journey and comes to a library inside the black hole. He ends up behind the bookshelves in his daughter's room. This is how he has been communicating with himself & Murphy. We are told that the wormhole and the library in the black hole are not put there by aliens, but by humanity in the future. 14. Cooper communicates with Murph and Murph figures out the equation. Mankind goes off into space and Cooper is somehow rescued from the black hole and gets to meet his now more than 80 years old daughter again. Mankind must have been able to do all of this without the aid of Cooper though since they had created the wormhole and the structure inside the black hole. His trip to the black hole seems a quite unnecessary, but he has himself to blame since he ignored his own warning 15. Murph takes off into space again to go to Amelia on the third planet. Even though the space station he is already on is heading there. He could have spent the time with his daughter instead since he had not seen her for a very very long time... The story is so stupid a that a monkey could write something more plausible during his 15 minutes coffee break. I have left out lots of strange and pointless stuff that goes on in the movie to make my review shorter. Don't believe the hype, this is a terrible movie.
2.0~Do not waste your time and money. ya-krivetko Sign in Permalink This is by far the most disappointing movie I saw in many years. It is even more disappointing, because I had rather high expectations after seeing the 9.2 rate at IMDb. 9.2!!! Really? The movie is way too long, it is very slow and mostly rather boring. The plot is stupid to say the least with a lot of scientifically sounding lines which make no sense. And the visual effects are ... not really impressive. Why on Earth had Matt Damon taken that stupid and nonsensical role? And this comes from the director who made Inception and Memento ... what a waist of resources. Save your time and money - watch something else.
10.0~Best recent space sci-fi movie. Memorable imdbcom-36145 Sign in Permalink The pace, the history, the characters, the music and the photography are perfectly matched to tell you a great adventure. You will feel it like you are involved in. I wont make spoilers but there is a moment when something "magical" happens that you don't see nowadays that made me feel like watching 2001 A Space Odyssey (which is a good thing)
10.0~Masterpiece vandricg Sign in Permalink If there was ever a movie that impressed me this much it would be Kubricks "2001. Space odyssey" and Scotts "Blade Runner"... This one tops both... Those who respect both of above mentioned films and directors will know what I'm talking about Everything is in it's place here: the direction, the storytelling, the musical score, the acting, the seriousness and grandness of it all, even the little humor breaks are quality beyond doubt Emotive drama dialogs and sequences are so well placed and paced, not feeling pathetic but on the contrary so much thought provoking... Nolan has made his lifetime masterpiece
4.0~A film that tries to pass itself off as being far more intelligent than it actually is. (Spoilers abound!) kunderthunt Sign in Permalink The film should have been called, "Yet Another Over-hyped Nolan Film Where The Main Character Sulks For Three Hours While Nolan Takes Said Three Hours To Deliver A Stupid, Entirely Ridiculous And Clichéd Message That Could Have Been Summed Up In Three Minutes. Also, Science Stuff Happens And Some Of It Is Cool But The "Plot" Is So Pointlessly Convoluted In Order To Make The Film Appear Way More Intelligent Than It Actually Is That It Was Difficult To Appreciate Said Science Stuff." (Ergo, the title should be as pointlessly long as the movie is.) Alright, look, there *was* some neat-o science stuff in it. The CGI was cool. Some of the concepts were cool, despite the film more or less being a retelling of Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged", the Carl Sagan inspired "Contact" and Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" all smushed into one. Also, there are robots. Frankly, I cared far more about the robots than I did about the characters. That's about where my enjoyment of the film ended, though. I *wanted* to enjoy this film. I really did. I LOVE films about space and space travel! And the actual space stuff in and of itself, I did enjoy, even if much of it was wildly unbelievable and no doubt inaccurate as hell. Matthew McC and Anne Hathaway deliver a pretty solid performance, which I commend them for, considering how little character development and depth they actually had to work with. I'm still trying to work out what the point of Matt Damon's character was beyond being a token baddie plot device. I wanted to feel for Matthew McC's character, and I suppose I did to a point. But I was also so bewildered by how things were unfolding and the utter disjointed and jarring pacing of the film and the pointlessly stupid decisions that the apparently super smart characters made that I just wasn't able to care about the characters all that much. Amongst all that, I kept waiting for the entire point of the film to be acknowledged. After investing three hours of my time to this film, I hoped the point and moral of the story was going to be worth my time. It wasn't. When it finally got to the (frankly absurd and cheesy as hell) point three hours later, I was thinking, "Uhhhhh, you basically said this at the beginning of the film, and Anne Hathaway's character also said the same, like, two hours ago, why did I sit through three hours of this when the entire point and moral compass of the film was made at the beginning of the film?" (Also, the concept of love superceding all time, space and gravity? For cryin' out loud, give me a goddamn break.) And then the last ten minutes turned into a full-on Lifetime channel fluff fest that was purposely intended to yank on the audience's heartstrings and make them think those three hours they spent watching the film was worth it, which it clearly was for a lot of people, and that's cool. But what bugs the hell out of me is the way this film - like all of Nolan's films - attempted to make itself appear far more intellectual and smart than it actually was. I, personally, felt like my intelligence was being insulted. Four out of ten stars. The four stars are for the nifty CGI stuff, some cool space imagery, the effort Matthew McC and Anne Hathaway made to turn boring and flat characters into something reasonably engaging, and the robots. That's the last Christopher Nolan film I'm ever watching.
10.0~A true masterpiece brucebanis Sign in Permalink In the history of Hollywood you can see a few movies in which there is a true combination of art, science and honesty... and Interstellar without any doubts is one of them. Hans Zimmer's stunning tracks at the background are actually a boost in every scene of this movie where you sometimes find yourself completely drawn in the ocean of Nolan's creativity. There's been so much effort put into the scientific aspect of the movie where you can't find any empty space in the story to question about and yet it's a great story to be entertained by even you are not interested in this field of science. You will be amazed how well this movie is built by just creating every scene in a proper direction, superior matched music and well acting.
10.0~An epic from a movie genius. bunny-657-23292 Sign in Permalink Interstellar- An inter galactic space travel to other galaxies through worm holes by other dimension of time using gravitational physics mixed up with time warping and relativity concepts. yeah yeah.... by now you can understand the depth of the movie which Nolan wanted to show the world in his latest offering. I went to the film with maximum expectations and it exceeded in every aspect. The plot is quite simple. but the way of execution is complex. The film starts off on a smooth note and the excitement increases as the movie goes. I liked every bit of the movie. Matthew McConaughey is awesome throughout the film as his expression in some particular scenes leave u in an awe. Marvellous job by him to carry the film. All the lead cast played exceptionally well. People are asking me whether it is of Gravity range??? I simply asked them back why do u want to compare this with that?? I seriously don't like to compare two movies even if they are of the same genre. I don't want to play a spoilsport here so I'm not revealing or jotting any plot lines here. The screenplay, as usually by JONATHAN NOLAN, is very gripping and he surely does a remarkable job with the script too. Another big gem for the film is its BGM. What can i say about Hans Zimmer which u already don't know? The BGM gelled so well with the movie that u almost think the BGM is a representation of on screen presentation. Some scenes got much elevated by the impeccable work of Hans. His use of instruments and strings require a special mention. Especially during the final 5-10 minutes of the movie, the BGM is so good that it almost left me speechless and haunted me the rest of the day. A huge respect to Zimmer. Coming to my movie God CHRISTOPHER NOLAN....... There was a time when i thought what if a directer directs only Gentlemen Class movies and not the silly stuff to hang around the industry. Then i came to know about Nolan and his works. At first i was thrilled by his taking and got attached to his movies so much i cant think of not expecting a better output from him in his next.... He is a master in movie making and a true gentlemen movie maker. The reason i used the word Gentlemen Moviemaker is that his works needs to be understood but not only watched for time-pass. Every dialog in his movie has a meaning and every frame in the movie has to do something with the plot. In Interstellar, he once again showed us why he is such a remarkable movie maker and a splendid director by delivering the most spectacular experience of a space travel. The depth of the plot is so well handled. Every frame counts and every dialog has a reason. He never even wastes a single second of the film with unwanted stuff. As always, the story is to the point and goes on increasing the intensity exponentially. If i say more about the plot, i may spoil the experience for some who didn't watch it yet. So all i can say is that this movie is masterclass in every aspect. Finally, dedicating his own dialog from The Dark Knight to him, i would like to say..... He is a silent guardian of movie making..... A watchful protector of the script...... A DARK KNIGHT of the industry....... I salute him with all of me and expect many more top notch directional ventures from him. P.S.: I pity IMDb accepts only 10 stars(It may be my exaggeration, but this is what i feel). Like
5.0~Mathew and the Amazing Multi-Dimensional Bookshelf Targe Sign in Permalink I looked forward to this space epic, and we planned for the IMAX experience to get the full vista of ooh aaah eye popping visuals this movie was promising. What did we get instead? Mathew Mcconnehay crying a lot. A multi-dimensional bookshelf (!?!) An evil Matt Daemon who pops out of nowhere and just as quickly blows himself up The LUDICROUS notion that NASA would even entertain the idea of relocating Earth to a planet system dangerously close to a black hole. The IMPOSSIBLE achievement of navigating the event horizon of a black hole, because, "This one is a SOFT black hole...." WTF???? This movie is remarkably similar to 2001, in that: - It is WAY TOO LONG and in serious need of editing. - It involves special things happening near the outer gaseous giant planets. 2001 was Jupiter, this movie, it's Saturn. - It involves the lead protagonist going into a surreal other dimension that possibly involves aliens, with crazy visuals that feel more like a drug trip than a real experience (for an excellent job on a far more realistic looking experience, that would be the end of Contact when she navigates the alien trans-galactic wormhole transit system) - It promises outstanding space visuals, and then gives us precious few, spending most of the time on dusty earth watching people cry. - It has an ominous robot who you are not quite sure of until the end. The robot however is RIDICULOUS, looking like a BLOK character and completely impractical. Perhaps they could have used a suped-up version of the new NASA robot, which is very cool? Very disappointed with this flick, and with the writing for Mathew's character, who could have been much better. What the heck Matt Daemon was doing there, I have no idea.
3.0~Awful! Cheresolorzano Sign in Permalink I hated this movie, it was literally one of the most boring, long, tedious, exasperating movies I have seen. I wanted to leave, but my husband wanted to finish watching it. I was confused watching this movie, trying to figure out what was going on. First of all, the characters talk about all the things that are gone, I.e the Marines, scientists, food. It is never explained why these things are no longer available. The whole scene at the parent conference was ridiculous, saying that this teacher believes that we never went to the moon or into space, it was a hoax, what?! Especially considering the main character was a former test pilot for NASA. This is a small town, you would think they would know this. There are so many problems with the plot, I can't mention them all. They ( Cooper and his daughter) found this secret NASA facility ,who knows where, yet they welcome him with open arms and offer him a job as the pilot. .???? If he was so great and he used to work there, why didn't they call him?RRRRRRrrrrr, I was very frustrated during this movie, time was dragging! If you like to see close ups of Matthew McConaughey crying, you might like this film.
3.0~A movie for the Minecraft generation vracer-166-903853 Sign in Permalink I knew nothing about Interstellar other than the basic premise, and the name of a film's director is of little interest to me i.e. I know who the good directors are, but their name on the credits doesn't set my expectations at any level. I just want a good plot, good acting, and something to take away and think about when the credits roll. I got none of that with this sorry excuse for a sci-fi film. From corn fields to a worm hole? with nothing much in between? Really? Anyway, I thought CASE and TARS were straight out of Minecraft... and so was the whole premise of Interstellar. A nothing sort of movie that leaves the viewer with nothing of substance. Motorcycle, meet shark! Actually, just take the shark from the tank and slap Christopher Nolan across the face with it. The 9 and 10 star reviews here truly mystify me...
9.0~The Epitome of Sci-Fi and a Masterpiece of the Film Industry DoctorEvil1337 Sign in Permalink Before I begin my review, I'd like to say that while I admire Nolan's talent, do I believe his excellence is somewhat over-hyped. Inception, while good in its own right, was extremely overrated and had some flaws. The Dark Knight Rises, being his worst movie, seriously dragged down the Dark Knight trilogy. Coming into this movie, however, I came in expecting a good experience. I had heard all the reviews, good and bad, and came in clean. I came out utterly blown away, and mesmerized by what should be considered Nolan's best work. Now to start: I've seen some good sci-fi out there, whether 2001 or Star Trek, and I had enjoyed them for very different reasons. Interstellar takes the best of both and molds them into a truly beautiful movie. It starts off in what seems to be a second Dust Bowl, where crops are slowly dying and folks are barely scrapping a living. Cooper, a pilot and engineer who had never gotten the chance to go to space, is now living a shadow of his life as a farmer, taking care of his kids in a world where food is scarce and governments have all but collapsed due to global starvation. The setting alone brought me in, and kept me throughout the entirety of the movie. I won't reveal anything after this point, but I will say the movie truly delivers in all aspects, aesthetically and emotionally. Nolan, who is known for being a "cold" and distant director, creates a movie that would make a lot of people cry at the end. One of the biggest hypes for this movie was that it was to be the most scientifically accurate sci fi out there. And for being a movie, it sure didn't disappoint. Though it does exaggerate some instances of time dilation and gravity somewhat, it can be forgiven since the realistic counterparts might not have been as dramatic as Nolan wanted it to be. The design of the ship, the endurance, resembles what NASA expects their Mars vessel to appear like, and becomes an Ark for which the travelers explore the universe. Soundwise, it was overall good. Hans Zimmer delivers his finest piece yet in some truly haunting yet glorious music that captures the feeling of the movie. And though I enjoyed how the music blasted out the dialogue, the parts where it didn't is what needed work. This is arguably the movie's only flaw, as some lines were garbled and were hard to make out. Regardless, the dialogue flaws were overshadowed. Hopefully the close captions on blu-ray will fix these issues. The true star of the movie, though, is not the science, it's the storytelling and plot. Rarely has sci-fi ever given me as many chills as Interstellar has, but boy does it do that and more. There are scenes where you will be on the edge of your seat, totally immersed in an intense and vibrating moment. Plotwise, it's arguably the most human story I've ever encountered, one about family and parental love that Spielberg could only aspire to. The actors and characters complement this well, as Matthew McConaughey once again wows the crowd alongside both is his daughter Murphy Cooper played by Mackenzie Foy and her adult counterpart portrayed by Jessica Chastain. Another pleasant surprise is another actor whom delivers his finest performance yet and steals the show for the 20 minutes he is on. Though it may not win Oscars for acting since Hollywood generally doesn't like sci fi, all four of these actors are worthy. Overall: This movie surpassed my expectations and more, cracking my list for the top 5 movies ever made. Is it perfect? No, but then really is any movie perfect? What I don't get is all the hate that's been generated across the Internet, and makes me think a lot of people need to watch this movie again. If you didn't like it, that's you right, but I for one thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Nolan is an excellent director, and before this his best movie was the Dark Knight. Now he has this movie, which is the crowning jewel of his directing career. Another great part is the fact that this movie inspires me to do more, and contradicts all the dark and gloomy sci fi that's we've seen recently. Instead of focusing on the faults of humanity, it focuses on the best of us, and that's what solidifies this movie's wonder. Go watch this movie folks, watch with an open mind. Be aware that you will not catch everything the first time, and that's OK. Because great movies provide reason to watch it again, and finding new things about a movie you didn't know is just as awesome. Final score: 10/10; right up there with the best of them
4.0~Overly Long With Little Real Purpose Or Meaning sddavis63 Sign in Permalink It's almost as if those who made this movie wanted to use two and a half hours of less than stellar movie making (if you'll pardon the pun) just so that the viewer could tough it out to the end and see a ridiculously sentimental ending. Really, by the time the end finally came, I found myself wondering what the point of the whole thing was. Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer in the midwest United States struggling along with his family to survive in some future world in which humanity is facing extinction. The atmosphere is changing so that there's less and less oxygen, and it's becoming harder and harder to grow crops. In this part of the world at least everyone seems to survive on a diet of corn, corn and more corn while being constantly threatened by horrible dust storms. I'm assuming this is meant to portray an environmental catastrophe. Eventually, Cooper and his daughter Murph (played as a young girl by Mackenzie Foy, who did well in the part) become aware that they're receiving some strange signal and they head out to investigate - an investigation that eventually leads to Cooper leaving Murph and the rest of his family behind to explore space in the hopes of finding a new home for humanity. I get it. I just didn't get excited by it. And I struggled from the start (well, once Cooper was picked for the mission anyway) with the question of why Cooper wasn't simply recruited for the mission from the beginning. He's clearly the best pilot around - which Professor Brand (Michael Caine) states openly - and he was immediately put in command of the mission, which made me wonder why they were just going to leave him playing farmer if he was really that good! That bugged me all the way through. But what bugged me more was that there was no consistency to this. There didn't seem to be any real direction to it; it didn't seem to be leading anywhere. I thought the storyline involving Mann (Matt Damon) was extraneous and just added time to the movie without adding much in the way of substance. There are a few places where it seemed as if the movie was trying to pay tribute in some way to "2001": particularly around the character of the robot TARS, and even some of the special effects/cinematography, but as I said it just didn't seem to be leading anywhere, and I wasn't entirely certain if this mission had accomplished much of anything. The entire movie seemed to be little more than a vehicle getting us to the sentimental ending. Murph had been angry that her father had left her behind, but she remembered that he promised he'd see her again, but because of differences in the way time would pass for the two of them (see: the theory of general relativity) she might be the same age as him by the time that happened. As it turned out, Murph was an old lady by the time Cooper returned to earth, and we get the sight of Cooper visiting his daughter in the hospital on her deathbed. Sentimental, yes, but I'm not sure it made the long wait to get there worthwhile. (4/10)
10.0~A movie to watch before you die LenaS15 Sign in Permalink WOW...i just finished watching this movies.WOW. The Nolans they don't disappoint do they. A lot of people told me to watch this movie, but i said i wasn't into Sci-fi much, but WOW, this is one unique sci-fi movie. Its one of the best movies i ever watched in my entire life and this is a movie we would have in our list, of ''movies to watch before we die. There is approx 2000 reviews for this movie here in IMDb and i understand why. Truly this movie touched my soul, stimulated my mind. The movie is 2h and 50min and i kept thinking i don't want this movie to end. Every minute i thought noooo i don't want this movie to end. Truly every single thing about this movie was amazing. A EPIC MOVIE. A PIECE OF ART. Again regardless whatever category of movies you are into, THIS movie has to be seen. Truly a incredible movie that will take you on a journey you never been to.
9.0~A Masterpiece on screen! vincent-levesque Sign in Permalink Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is obviously one of my favourite film ever. I confess; every time I hear about a new Nolan's film, I'm scared. I truly am, because every single film he has made were simply incredible. I'm afraid the next one will be, how can I say, worst? Of course not! He surprised me, as he surely does since the release of Doodlebug, Nolan's short film. What I love the most about Nolan is the fact that his films are totally originals. Tell me if I'm wrong, but have you ever had the feeling of: Why haven't I thought about this idea before..? Damn Nolan, you're too smart! When I watched Interstellar, I had this feeling. The same I had for Memento, Inception, The Prestige, and almost every frame of his pieces. Interstellar is a total experience. We can think about the Visual Effects (oscar' winning), or about Sound editing, mixing and of course, the Original Score of Dr. Zimmer! The movie begins with an non-understanding situation, which already makes me a fan of it. We have to think about every single frame of the film. If not, you get lost. The only thing that made me disappointed is the end, because they explained too much. For a few second, I thought I was a child. That embarrassed me, because I think Nolan underestimated the fans. Some people hates this movie, because of its lack of information, but I don't think so! Interstellar is a passion, a taste. If you don't feel it, like it, you'll never understand the information that Nolan is trying to give to the audience. It's a film about the end of an Ere, and the possibility to build a new one. When you watch this movie, you have to absorb what it gives to us, instead of expecting it. As a matter of fact, it still a great great great movie, and that's why I bought it like a month ago, because adding this movie to my collection is a total honour. My theory: - We can predict the end of a film, but we cannot be sure of how they are going to present it! Special thanks to Nolan and Zimmer Vincent Lévesque
6.0~What a massive disappointment Balthazar-5 Sign in Permalink Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep. The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight. The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.
10.0~This isn't just a movie. It's a masterpiece.. kasun-mck Sign in Permalink Brilliant work Mr.Nolan. It's amazing from the start to the end. I couldn't take my eyes out. The cast has done their best for their characters. The main actor (though he's new to my movie world) does an amazing job in all the angles of his act. And supporting characters were the same. The story line is scientific, but not boring as other such scientific (Sci-fi) movies. It's all a thrilling, fantastic movie with curiosity top to bottom. I must say, this is the BEST movie that I have watched after a long long time (I mean, from the Jurassic Park times) I'm still in that 5-dimensional world you made. Brilliant job! Perfect to be more specific. Hats off!
10.0~A Masterpiece that I don't want to spoil for you! dave-perry25 Sign in Permalink I sort of missed this when it first came out, but it slowly seemed to become one of these films that I just needed to check out. And I am so glad that I did. Only knowing, "it's a space film with something about wormholes" was actually something that really helped create a truly exciting experience watching this film. The places it goes are unexpected, ambitious and utterly jaw dropping. I don't want to spoil any minute details about this film for you, as every single one of these details is beautifully executed. Nolan has created a film that sets itself apart from anything I've seen in recent times, or ever for that matter. Long story short, if you haven't seen this film, watch it. It is nothing short of absolute perfection; in the story, the acting, the cinematography, the sound design and the special effects. Interstellar is truly something special.
4.0~Hollywood "Blockbuster"; Star Wars meets E.T. - trying to be "deep" -flick Kimal9000 Sign in Permalink Not impressed. Mediocre acting, mainly from the three protagonists on the ship, and the tear jerking: "love is a natural force pervading the universe"-crap, not to mention the wise-ass cowboy dialogue and the robot looking like a modern multi-function fridge and obviously meant to be a cross between C3PO and HAL9000, blew this movie for me. OK, trying to be serious; The story and idea IS a great one! Alas aimed at the masses, and thus poorly executed. The result is shallow, and it rushes things to the point of you feeling you must have slept through important plot scenes. I simply did not find the acting and dialogue believable. I mostly get the feeling that they are trying too hard! They REALLY want to make a great SciFi in the big league, but end up with an emo-version of 'Independence day'. Having seen, and been amazed by, masterpieces like '2001 A Space Oddysey', 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner', I must honestly say that the score of over 8 by a million voters here is way to high! (Lots of youngsters there I think) This is simply an entertaining action movie with a "message". Not a GREAT science fiction movie that will stick with you like any of those mentioned above. I gave it a 4, although based on the action and effects alone, it could easily be a 6! But here, just as with 'Star Wars', there's to much childish crap going on that detracts.
10.0~This film makes me cry every time i watch it biagiocubi Sign in Permalink It's incredible how powerful a movie can be, and this in particular is a masterpiece. I love movie and i can say for sure that this is the best movie i've ever seen. The emotion it gives me every time i watch it are unbelievable, i just cry because i have no word to describe how beautiful it is. That happens probably because i love space movie, but the immense work done here is amazing, everything from the soundtrack, to the special effect, to the acting is PERFECT. Nolan simply did it, he created the perfect movie, at least form me, and i can only say thank you...
4.0~Ho Hum doom-ca Sign in Permalink This movie is everything I expected it not to be. It was dramatic, but not in a good way. Over dramatic. Far, far too predictable, too Hollywood and anything, and I mean anything but scientific. I'm just going to ask this once - Chris,have you ever actually read any Stephen Hawking? Because then maybe the story line could have taken a turn toward science instead of fairy tale, Hollywood pump up the revenue box office production. Maybe someone on your crew could have consulted with Hawking and came up with an alternate ending. One where people who enter black holes get broken up into their atomic parts such as happens to even light. Instead of some fantasy land Disney ride. Wow what garbage. The trailer in this movie made it look like an amazing adventure in deep space. And yes, don't get me wrong there is space, and a few time deadlines to add in some much needed suspense after one too many porch scenes with Grandpa drinking beer while tending the corn fields. However, what this movie lacked was a sense of logic. I mean really. Flat out. The blight that is taking down the humans seems to be completely overlooked in the movie. There really is no information on it except, our atmosphere has a lot of nitrogen in it which is feeding the blight. "huh?" The earth is written off in this movie because of blight? This earth has survived, earthquakes, giant meteorites, plagues, famines, flooding and we are done in by a blight? Fine, we can't feed people so we are headed for the stars, all covertly of course. And our hero just happens to stumble upon NASA. Which wants him to be the pilot, even though he's a reluctant farmer, who was a pilot - because as a pilot he's the best of the best with honors. The script felt like something I would read in an old spaghetti western Clint Eastwood movie. I feel like I threw money away on a cheap plot based on oversimplification of scientific notions and box office greed. And the end: omg it's "time," no, no it's "gravity," no it's time. Just stop. And our protagonist surviving a black hole. What? Because it's not a black hole? Human's built it? Future humans. Probably the one's from Futurama. OK I've seen enough roll credits. However, that said, if you want some good sound, yes the sound was good. Good visuals, nothing gravity didn't do better, and descent acting, almost like Armageddon, yah know, the Bruce Willis stuff. Then indeed this is your movie. Trust me, this is no Inception. If you go, enjoy, just don't go in with high expectations (9.1 on IMDb? really?)or you'll be let down. Oh and the 2001 monolith robots were the highlight of the movie for me. They were good for a couple of laughs. Have a good one.
7.0~How is this ranked 32nd best movie of all time? brettsanace Sign in Permalink As of 11 June 2018. It is a max 7/10 on a good day
2.0~A sad blockbuster attempt at cinema cheetcheetah Sign in Permalink You know those special movies that leave you with something more than you had before you watched them? They enrich you, teach you, show you. This isn't one of those. Interstellar is the pathetic result of a lot of bad ideas slamming together in Nolan's mind, falling out as broken disjointed garbled mush in the script. The script isn't the only problem with all of it's hammy hokum and lack of character. Even the heralded special effects are so cliché at this point that they hardly add anything to this abyssal cavity of broken ideas. Here is what happened. Nolan saw some discovery channel show, or perhaps PBS, about the cosmos. He said to himself, "I could make an adventure movie about that." Unfortunately for those of us who recognize good cinema from average and just slop, he couldn't. I watch zero budget movies with more thoughtfulness than this two hundred million dollar nightmare. Trade me all of the special effects in the world for one moment of realistic human emotion. As cynical as it sounds, after seeing the 9 of 10 rating for this garbage, I question whether or not humanity would even deserve to be saved from the cataclysm.
3.0~Mind Twisting rubbish fire-70032 Sign in Permalink The effects in the movie are good and the idea is good but OMG what a dragged out waste of nearly 3 hours. I implore you don't waste your time on this drivel. It only gets 3/10 for the effects. The stars in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for making a movie just for the cash. Horrible just Horrible. The movie has a poor start and you have to work out what is going on for yourself. Once you understand the premise of what they are trying to achieve then it does make some sense. They head off on a tangent that is hard to follow and there are many disjointed segways in the movie. the best way to watch this movie is on a system that you can rewind so that you can go back and try and figure out what is going on. Oh and it's one of those movies that people mumble in and the sounds effects are way louder than the talking, so you will be reaching for the remote allot.
5.0~2001 for Dummies vostf Sign in Permalink If Spielberg had wanted to remake 2001 that is the kind of stuff we could have expected. Kubrick was derided as being to coldly cerebral (by the hilarious Pauline Kael) so his opus with Arthur C. Clarke was a powerful - philosophical - ellipse about mankind. Interstellar is a dumbed down version where humans do get to express their feelings and AI have a humour parameter. I liked the futuristic vision of Earth, it was great to see something different, in between post-doomsday and pure phantasmagoria. Now the way to connect a brilliant pilot (simply the best) stuck in the dust to the plan to go interstellar was just a gigantic leap of faith for anyone invoking suspension of disbelief. Not that it stroke me violently as such during the show but you are waiting for the Man to fly to the stars and when you see how they managed to transition to this part you do feel this is cheap. Then Interstellar moves forth with lots of boring exposition about why, when, what if... that is all supposed to give us a scientific and credible background. This is simply not very good. Then we get to watch the movie we came for as they reach for the Stars Gate near Saturn (2001), simply called a worm-hole. Most of what follows suffers from the same sin of too much rational exposition in between irrational action by top skilled characters. In the end you are just a passive viewer not knowing if the whole movie added anything to the genre or just mixed pompous mankind stakes with routine Hollywood melodrama. With Solaris Tarkovski already had his own answer to the lack of human feeling in 2001, which Soderbergh remade. Anything less subtle about human feelings for an astronaut is trash. Nobody goes to watch a movie about The Future of Mankind and Serious Space Exploration while only expecting characters to be as emotionally unstable as in a soap opera.
3.0~Inter... STELLA! bobtheplanet Sign in Permalink I only give this movie 3 stars because, like many others, I believe it will balance out the mindlessly effusive reviews that IMDb seems to generate for highly-anticipated movies. I must say, however, that I would honestly give this movie about a 5 or 6 and no more. The main problem I see with it is typical of many modern movies - poor screen writing. Doesn't anyone read this stuff between the final draft and filming? At 2 hours and 45 minutes I did not think it was overlong. I wasn't bored so much as flummoxed. I actually believe there is a magical extra 15 minutes somewhere that might steer this titanic disaster away from the critical icebergs that may doom it. Down to particulars: Too Much Damn Corn! (In more ways than one) The future in this movie actually does not look too bad. There's plenty of beer, pickup trucks, and no okra (yay!). So what is the beef? There really is no convincing reason to leave Earth because of some piffle about environment degradation. The effort involved to create artificial environments in space would seem to me to be exponentially more time consuming and expensive than the same effort on good old terra firma. The whole ecosystem collapse story is unnecessary. Why have we gone into, and continue to go into, Outer Space even though wars, famine, and pestilence beset us continually? Nolan should have bit the bullet and gone for the real answer instead of making up a fairy tale - that is, our innate curiosity and desire for knowledge will drive us to the limits of the Universe and beyond. We don't need hokey dust storms and blights (Say, how did those spacelings solve the food blight problem in their massive cylinders - and why position them out by Saturn? Why didn't they just go underground instead of into space? ) And the seriousness of the situation on Earth just wasn't conveyed well except during the massive dust storm. Another odd thing never explained - no dogs, no cats, no chickens, pigs, or cows... not even a crow or a rat to be seen. Where are the animals? Where are the insects? Some of the 15 min. could have been used to clarify these points, but better yet... chuck the whole first hour. Too Much Damn Noise! Some people may like Hans Zimmer's work, but I don't see him as the next Jerry Goldsmith or Bernard Herrmann. It was like listening to Philip Glass at 110 db and certainly did not sound as spacey as Vangelis' work for Blade Runner. Especially annoying when it covered up important dialog in the dramatic moments, but that may be due to sound mixing. Overall, I rate him as flat and innocuous at best. And speaking of dialog, was MC channeling Marlon Brando for his role? Some of his dialog was barely comprehensible. For a movie heavy with exposition that is a bit unacceptable. Too Many Damn Holes! Speaking of exposition: how the hell did MC learn to fly those new-fangled space machines so fast (everyone else had simulator classes); How did they get all that junk into space to build their starship with no one on Earth noticing dozens of Saturn V rockets blasting into the sky? Why didn't MC just say "Murph" instead of "Stay", he already knew he would leave, because HE ALREADY KNEW HE WOULD LEAVE GRAVITY TRACES TO COMMUNICATE AND SOLVE THE EQUATION! When they surfed down the wave why didn't the ship crash into the surface of Miller since it was only covered with 12 inches of water most of the time? They never did get it straight about the 5-D beings - are they us, or something else? Why? Why? Why? Too many unanswered questions glossed over amid all the physics mumbo-jumbo in this convoluted mess. I'm sorry, it was a dud, nothing stellar about it.
10.0~Outstanding Mortalis0321 Sign in Permalink A grand spectacle . Everyone involved in the production should be proud of this .Very moving and rooted in humanity . They utilized Kip Thorne as a Technical science adviser and it shows - but you don't need to know about science since it is explained during the movie (and is accurate) - and frankly it's a human drama. Some artistic angles were used to tell a story- But it's a movie for Pete's sake .....Some of the drastic complaints I've read on this stream seem to be very angry people who wouldn't be happy if the government was giving away free money - and The G is ..... I thank everyone involved in the production ; it is the movie of our generation . Take someone you care about to see it .
6.0~Suspension of belief p-baenziger Sign in Permalink I don't know where all the 10 star reviews for this movie come from. This is not a 10 star movie, not even close. It's a sci-fy movie where suspension of disbelief fails utterly, from very early on, and then it just gets worse, and worse, and worse. The good: Good music No love story The bad: "Science" tortured and abused for a lot of plot twists Far too long Male crew other than the hero are just there to die for no reason
3.0~Pile of Sentimaental Crap grayscale117 Sign in Permalink Note - the last two lines sum it all up if you want to skip my blathering. Interstellar is nothing more than a sci-fi drama. If you crave sci-fi movies as I do, this film will leave you feeling unfulfilled and usurped. It is about nothing more than "the human element" set against a semi sci-fi backdrop that is obscenely absurd. Happy ending? Not really, and what makes it worse is that's predictable early on. Should you bother to watch this film? Yes, I watch them all, probably because curiosity gets the best of me, and who knows, you might like it. I have been disappointed, read enraged, by other films much more than this one, but it failed to impress me. Maybe if I had sat down to this one expecting to be disappointed it might have been better, but to be quite honest, the trailers make it out to be something totally different than what you get. Sad thing is, too much film marketing goes this same way these days.
4.0~An underwhelming experience for me MovieJunkie87 Sign in Permalink Overall, "Interstellar" was an underwhelming experience for me. The film spent too much time establishing characters and relationships that in the end just felt unconvincing and contrived. It was full of wooden dialogue. The parts in which the scientists dropped basic astrophysical knowledge in a Wikipedia-like diction were cringeworthy. The conclusions to which they jumped (aliens put the wormhole there to save the human race, love has to be the fifth dimension) rendered these characters completely unbelievable to me. The turn of events by which Cooper came to be the chosen pilot of the spacecraft, that was probably the most painfully impotent writing I have ever seen in a large budget movie. The film completely failed to show the space pioneers having any sense of awe in light of the incredible things they were witnessing. When Cooper was told about the existence of a wormhole near Saturn and the habitable planets on the other side, he took it like a boring lecture and the most obvious thing ever. This grotesquely ignorant attitude was visible throughout the whole movie. Characters only ever showed care and concern for their own families or abstract concepts like "the human race". I found this totally anthropocentric perspective not credible at all and highly unlikeable. However, when the spacecraft passed Saturn, it was beautiful to look at. The spheric wormhole was simply breathtaking. Although the scene was way too short, it was one of the best. The black hole and its center was also quite good. Visually, the film lacked imagination and scope in every other aspect. Most of the space scenes consisted of unexciting chamber shots inside the spacecraft. The beauty and wonder of the foreign planets wasn't explored at all. Besides a very cool tidal wave, the most exciting thing happening there was a stupid brawl between two astronauts on a rocky surface. There was also a risky docking maneuver in space that was thrilling, but depressing nonetheless. When a standard action beat such as a docking maneuver is the most exciting scene in a film about intergalactic space travel, you know the scriptwriter did something wrong. The scene where Cooper meets his daughter as an old woman was very touching and well executed. It reminded me of one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, "The Long Morrow". In my opinion, the film suffered from a weak screenplay and little imagination.
1.0~A very long piece of crap. Nolan's give us a break please !!! abisio Sign in Permalink If you ever saw Kubrick's 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie. If you did not;then rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap. "INTERSTELLAR" is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement. "INCEPTION" was the same thing (but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive. The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects. In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about "something" that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER*** McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations (and she does not succeed). In brief; do not commit the same error I made. Save your money for a better and more sincere money; this one is just a scam.
1.0~Please, please, please just save yourself 3 hours of your life SolNigerWithin333 Sign in Permalink This movie takes the cake alongside The Maxtrix (1999) as the most overrated movies of all time. Interstellar marks Christopher Nolans sense of self significance at an unhealthy level, where to begin about how bad this movie is?. Characters: Terrible, i did not feel any real emotion towards anyone but the little girl, was it Murph? catwoman completely ruined the whole experience for me personally; that whole scene about love being the 5th dimension had me reaching for a sick bag and oh lawdy i better not forget Mutt Da'man who is cleverly and subtly given the last name Mann, once again a complete turn off for the whole experience; mind you i really enjoy the Bourne movies. Micheal Caine is above adequate as always at playing the wise, sage role. The lead character was not impressive even slightly; cant really find anything to point at in terms of the acting, it was good. Sound: It seems we are all experienced and have numerous credentials when it comes to critiquing orchestral pieces judging from the countless reviews from people who say the score is a "masterpiece"; "time" from Inception was truly great but the loud and extravagant nature of it all is getting pretty tiresome and dull and i think Hans Zimmer is taking a bit of an ego trip as well. Who's absolutely retarded idea was it to have the background music louder than the dialogue in some scenes? The only thing that achieved was making my eardrums ache. The soundtrack is getting pretty diluted now and it all just seems like its their to boost the in reality shallowness of the movie, kinda like shouting in an argument. Plot and story: Completely and utterly stoopid yes "stoopid" to emphasise just how mind numbingly horrible it was, get this the story is advanced because the characters left a window open on the top floor which results in dust falling onto some magnetic filings which reveal the location of a secret NASA facility, if you seriously cant see how bad this is you really don't have a brain or just don't use it. For a race that can slingshot shuttles using planets gravitational fields and travel through wormholes the cryo- chambers look like bloody tiled baths, where is the sleek and futuristic design, Alien a movie made 35 years before Interstellar has better looking cryo-tubes who even overlooked this? and don't even get me started on how the cryo-tubes are essentially freezing time when one of the key messages in the movie is that you can't stop time or travel backwards -_-. Black holes the enigmatic and infinite object that alludes all the top scientist today and which completely renders our knowledge of the current universe seemingly pointless is just a library made out of strings which you pluck to interact with the 3rd dimension; i think the facepalm i did due to this idea has left a permanent mark on my face but wait what is that you say "light can't escape the pull of a black hole" oh no its fine im just gonna use my radio transmission technology to contact someone from outside a black hole, screw you Einstein! The robots, how could i overlook the robots, if that's how robots look in the future i will commit a horrible act upon myself, i bet you everything i own it was the same dude who designed the cryo- chambers. To those who compare this movie to Stanley Kubricks 2001 i am not even going to acknowledge your existence, this movie is a joke, a pretentious self indulgent movie which does nothing but throw heaps of concepts and confusing ideas to make the audience think they are daft and that the movie is of such a high intellectual level that they must praise it. I don't usually give 1/10 but I gave this movie a 1/10 to hopefully have even a minute impact on the overall score, its a loss for humanity that this movie is even in the top 250 on IMDb but if the extent of your movie going is to see the next transformers movie im pretty sure you'll find this movie quite intelligent and "awesome" and "the best movie eva".
9.0~Has Its' Flaws But Still Found it Pretty Awesome larrys3 Sign in Permalink At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion. I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally. Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next. Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role. I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked. All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride.
3.0~Should have used some of that budget to hire a screenwriter Goose-30 Sign in Permalink One of the biggest letdowns to come along in ages. Not even McConaughey can put an interesting spin on this half-baked, ham-fisted rubbish. It's an amateurish mess of clichés, clumsy exposition, pretentious nonsense, cheap manipulation, and predictable twists. I felt like walking out, but I kept thinking at least there might be some stunning visual effects coming up... nope. The space scenes are serviceable at best, the alien planets are either a blank expanse of water or a blank expanse of ice, apocalyptic Earth is just like normal Earth except with some dust blowing around... where exactly did that big budget go? If you dislike this film within the first twenty minutes, don't waste your time sticking around. It doesn't get any better.
1.0~It's a Chris Nolan film. All style, but no substance. RIK-22 Sign in Permalink As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers. I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold. Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects. On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous. The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down. On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense. If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?). Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on. They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information. Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughter And how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot. In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies.
10.0~Hands down most amazing film I have ever seen at the cinema 3_the_monkey Sign in Permalink I was blown away by this film, the sound, the music, the experience!! It was amazing but I couldn't recreate it at home, I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see this at the cinema, it was just amazing and spun me right out in such a good way!
1.0~An Interstellar Scale Mess tijane-637-40539 Sign in Permalink I'll start by saying this is not the worst film I have ever seen. It is the worst film I have ever seen given the resources and talents applied. I am astonished at the rave reviews being lavished on a film that is neither remarkable visually nor original from a plot and story telling point of view. In summary "Interstellar" is a poor remake of "The Grapes of Wrath" spliced onto an even worse remake of "2001 A Space Odyssey" rounded off with an ending that would've helped "Knowing" be a better film...if only it was an ending for that film...not this one. Though to be fair, on further contemplation the beginning has more in common with "Field of Dreams", what with the baseball and weird farmer character and all. Seriously, imagine a version of "2001" where HAL is crossed with JaJa Binks....yep...I kid you not. To add to the mess we are also provided with a James Bond like evil genius complete with his own secret base....only he's not meant to be evil...he just turns out that way. This strange concoction desperately tries to present itself as something original...but scene by scene we are continually presented with the badly rehashed ideas of others....combined with kind of "science" that makes "Star Wars" look like an academic treatise on the physics of space travel. Come to think of it "Interstellar" even tries for a few Jedi mind tricks here and there. But don't despair because the film is only 14 hours long and when you do get to the end your spirits will be lifted by the thought that humanities future will be gestated by Anne Hathaway...thereby guaranteeing an endless supply of annoying actresses...that can't act. As this review started....it's not the worst film ever made...but it rates as the biggest wasted opportunity in film history. Of the modern sci-fi films "Oblivion" is well ahead of this in virtually every respect....even with Tom Cruise in it!
1.0~Simply awful pattyp-725-58249 Sign in Permalink The most pointless pack of poo ever made. If you enjoy science fiction do not watch this dog under any circumstances. It was like a very long boring sappy, idiotic episode of the twilight zone. Gravity and time transmitted across dimensions, and lest we forget also love, FFS what kind of moron wrote this drivel. I guess that cosmically transmitted love is the reason there is no military in the future, even though resources are beyond scarce. And hmmmm what seems more difficult, using NASA's technology to transform a barely habitable planet circling a black hole, (with no sun FFS) or to transform, what was that other planet? Oh that's right Earth. I see no need to detail the rest of the stupidity of the "physics" in this movie. They should have simply made McMconaughey a wizard, it would have made more sense. But I must mention the magical space ship that can achieve escape velocity from a planet with 130% of Earth's gravity, ummm why didn't they use that rather than a massive 3 stage rocket to escape Earth?
9.0~Grade: A+ bschultz_the_pally Sign in Permalink Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas. The movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. "We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars," he says, "now we just look at the ground and see dirt." Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy. Despite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver. It's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship "Endurance". Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land. In addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real. When the plot does finally introduce a "villain" in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax. Interstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all. Nolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction. Grade: A+
3.0~Boring Pseudoscientific Nonsense jeremias-kangas Sign in Permalink Some moments were directed and acted well, but overall the story was just too stupid. I guess it is based on UFO Scientology religion, that could also explain the overuse of organ music. I can't understand why people rate this movie so highly. Just wanted to state other point of view here, I regret spending 3 hours of my life on this movie. I could have spent that time playing XCOM: enemy unknown or maybe Mass Effect. Those don't contain any more sensible theories about how space travel, worm holes and black holes would work, but they are good entertainment, unlike this movie. Well, not much else to say. Did I say that it contained lot of organ music? On some parts that grew some nice tension. After a while it was however irritating.
1.0~Makes "Lost in Space" look like a masterpiece. MoviesRT Sign in Permalink My goodness, where do we start? First of all, the many 10's this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3-yr-old. Nolan must know nothing about real science. He bandies "worm-holes" and "anomolies" around like he really knows what they are. Had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all. Just shows that putting big Hollywood stars in a movie doesn't guarantee a good product in the end. I won't go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned, but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60's show "Lost in Space." Will Robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie. The biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on, yet they didn't even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all. His kids are grown, but they still live in the same run down house and Michael Caine, who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back. And the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same. Still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested. Every time they tried to say something intelligent, the audience laughed. No one in the theater took this movie seriously at all. Sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science. Bottom line: This was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors. What a waste!!
8.0~Interstellar is 10 times beyond Inception but not that perfectly executed utkarshpant1994 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is one of those sci-fi that demands your attention throughout the film.If you are hoping for action like The dark Knight or Inception ,you would surely be disappointed. For me it is more like feeling the movie rather than just watching it.Matthew McCaughey nailed it this time. The only thing disappointing in this movie is the way they ended it.The plot has so many holes that you can't help but notice.Anne Hathaway's one dialogue ruin its ending.'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space'.Seriously? I mean if you want to take liberty in Black hole's quantum data scene you could have shown anything but scientific.Anyway, overall its a fantastic movie ,after all its a Nolan movie. So overall I have to say this is a must watch movie in fact one of the best movies of the decade.
8.0~Very nearly out-of-this-world TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work. At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism. The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long. There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10
4.0~Worm-Holes ? What About Plot Holes ? Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink One of my all time favourite novels is The Death Of Grass by the late John Christopher . Written in 1956 it tells off a virus that destroys the cereal crops of Asia , Africa and Europe plunging most of humanity in to famine . It was adapted by Cornel Wilde in a 1970 film called NO BLADE OF GRASS , a very bleak and hard hitting film but one that was also painfully disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying . That said the power of the premise is clear to see and one has high hopes it will be remade one day . Along comes Christopher Nolan a director so highly regarded that if he did a selfie on his I-phone then that clip would automatically find itself on the IMDb Top 250 film list and he takes the premise of The Death Of Grass as a plot device and manages to make a film far more unconvincing than Cornel Wilde's movie not t mention far more expensive As I said humanity is being starved in to extinction and live on a diet of corn . Being set in the American mid-West corn is obviously easy to come by but would this be true of other people living on other continents ? I'm not a farmer or a geologist but surely there's a good reason why some countries have a staple diet of wheat while other countries have a staple diet of rice ? Perhaps the countries that no longer can grow wheat now grow root vegetables as their staple diet ? I suppose you've got to join up the dots for yourself but it's rather annoying the way the rest of the world goes unmentioned almost as though the film makers have failed to think the scenario through properly . Especially later where mankind seems to be facing greater dangers from sand storms than famine Some other things the makers haven't thought through with the film In this near future world armies no longer exist ? A noble ideal perhaps but surely if a nation state exists so would an army if only to protect itself from other nation states ? It's official - everyone thinks the Moon landings were faked . I can see Nolan having a dig at creationism being taught in American schools but this ties in with another plot turn NASA still exists as a secretive organization ! Right so the government agency that sent men to the Moon and back exists as a real though somewhat underground organization and yet everyone thinks the Moon landings are faked ? Can't see the logic behind this . It also adds more confusion when ... NASA send the protagonists to a wormhole just off Jupiter . It's never revealed if these space journeys have US government approval but if not why would a government scrap standing armies and not totally shut down an agency that can send people to the ends of the solar system if you're going to teach conspiracy theories in school ? In reality it also be technically and monetary prohibitive for an agency to do this without government approval , Certainly internal logic and continuity is not the films strong point . It's also a film that's over long and contains an ending straight out of the more prentious episodes of SPACE 1999 This is a pity because it's more than competent on a technical level and I can see Nolan is trying to make an intelligent space epic that will try and grab the audiences attention and fire up their passion for real life science . Unfortunately he's left out the intelligence in crafting a drama and when this fails so does everything else
4.0~We Would Not Be Ones Going Thru The Wormhole. These People, Feh. bear1955 Sign in Permalink This was sort of well reviewed when it was released. It is quite a burden to be original, dramatic, forward-looking, grand, important, in any space drama and have it be very good entertainment, let alone "art" (a la 2001). The makers of the movie were surely all too very conscious of the "important" space sci-fi films, which came before. Handicapped and burdened from that. I was aware of "Interstellar", but since I do not go to many movies, or do pay-per-view, the showing on cable tonight 7-26-2017 is the first time I've seen any of it. I tuned it at the point Cooper was shown into the space lab. I knew nothing of the story at this point. What did grab me to view was knowing of some upcoming space mission and that things were not going well in people's lives and on earth. Could not tell what year this was supposed to be happening in. Or why about much of anything that mattered to the story. All I heard were the characters babbling on. I tuned out late in the movie at the disastrous docking attempt. It was getting too bleak and cynical for me. I had to read a synopsis while viewing and decided to tune out at that particular point, and save seeing the beginning for another showing. Filling in plot made me less eager to go on. At least it did not include zombies. Tech that the US should not have had the ability to produce and launch, anymore in the world this movie conjured, was a problem in my mind. Did some billionaire fund this? Looking at these people, the should have gone all the way and everything crash and burn, with a coda of cold dark (or what, how is world supposed to be ending in "Interstellar"? earth with a few relics as the pyramids remains standing. And a half buried black monolith sticking out of the dirt. That's it!
5.0~a bit too US-centric for my taste whitequeen71 Sign in Permalink the movie has its good points but I'd have spent a line or two to involve the rest of the world in this global matter. I kept having the feeling that saving the whole world was only up to NASA and USA, while the rest of the world was sitting in the dust waiting for good old America to save them. Then, if the Earth is trying to get rid of humans because of their improvident behavior, what about to stop growing mono-crops and using pesticides and herbicides? If corn is the only cereal left on Earth, eat something else, like wild grass, fruit, roots... but no, everything but don't ask me to drop out of the American way! I rather leave my family behind and face the unknown but don't ask me to give up on my porch-drinking and intensive farming.
6.0~Ending spoils it pmailman Sign in Permalink I recently watched "Interstellar" for a second time, initially having forgotten that I'd already seen it. My wife and did a lot of "gee this looks familiar". She remembered more of it than I did (odd, because my memories of movies is usually much better) and as we talked about it more and got to recalling the ending I said, "This is *that* movie? That was terrible!" I think I was so annoyed at the ending I'd blanked out having seen the movie at all. Second time through, I feel the same way about the ending. Terrible. "Deus ex machina". Ticked me off as much as the ending of "Arrival" did. And it's really a shame, because the rest of the movie was pretty well done. Nice world building, stunning visuals (if at times a bit too 2001- ish), pretty good acting, plot, pacing. I'd love to want to watch this again for all that. But I will never do that, I would not want to experience the ending again.
10.0~A Meaningful and Breathtaking Movie... jchen-07237 Sign in Permalink My math tutor, Mr. Lee, actually recommended this movie to me. He told me it was one of the highlights of his movie experiences. I laughed and told him I would watch it, due to his sake. And when I watched it, it was breathtaking. My eyes were glued to the television screen. I didn't even notice my dad walking away to grab a cup of coffee. I was completely trapped into the movie. This movie not only tells a breathtaking story of space and has beautiful photography, it tells about the bond between a father and his family. Cooper is such a strong man. It gets us thinking about what it would be like to have to leave our family and everything we love and care about behind to save all of humanity, only to find that it was all worthless and to hope for the better. It made me cry, seeing Cooper watch the videos of his son growing up, and seeing his daughter all grown up, Murph, for the first time. It was so meaningful. It's a simple and beautiful story. And as a daughter, I thought about what it would be like to not see my father for so many years, as he struggled to save the world. Please watch this movie. You'll be captured by everything it has to offer. This was one of the futuristic stories that actually made my hairs bristle. If we don't do our best to conserve our resources, many people would have to give up everything they need. Thank you for listening.
5.0~OK if you go with it Virtuoso801 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's Interstellar wants to be epic and profound, and as long as you don't look too deeply, or concern yourself with character development, it hits those notes. For those who can't help but see the hokey sentimentality that parallels 1000 other films, or compare how you might have cared about these characters more if they were better and more fully written, it's a mediocre drama with some lovely visuals and music. Midway through Interstellar, relativity/time travel supplies us with a scene where the main character has to watch 23 years of messages from his children, years that went by in mere hours for him. We watch as their hope of hearing from him slowly dies away, and he is powerless to tell them he hears them. McConaughey cries his eyes out, but the flaws of the movie mean the power the scene should have is lost on the viewer. Firstly, we haven't had time to settle in with these characters; see them as normal human beings we can connect to and care about. Second, the films momentum leads us elsewhere - character isn't Nolan's main concern, it's his epic vision that overrides all, and blurs past moments like these in favor of nice visuals with trance-inducing minimalist music. This is one of the core issues with the movie. The other is the unbelievable science. I'm not talking about black holes and 5th dimensional reality, which are handled as reasonably this kind of movie really could without boring the audience, so much as a NASA mission to save humanity which apparently was planned more leisurely than your last family vacation. Movies like Apollo 13 show us in comparison how technically and carefully a NASA endeavor is engaged in, and that's when everything goes wrong. This movie expects us to believe they sent McConaughey and a couple other people up there to essentially wing it. Talks about how 'maybe we can fly up here and then go there, I'll put it on manual and fly us around if you feel like it' go far too deep into disbelief, as if every permutation wouldn't have a strict plan and protocol attached to it. Not like the 'save humanity' mission is important or anything. It's amazing to think how much time and energy was spent on the visuals of the movie, which are indeed impressive, only to be created at the service of such cheap science fiction. In addition, the movie supplies us with a neat and interesting robot artificial intelligence to help our travelers, which demonstrates extremely high ability, but then leaves McConaughey and company to manually handle things that we would happily let even today's technology handle for us. As creative as the robot is, with it's all-purpose cubic body, it almost feels like a prop from another movie. One can almost imagine the makers of this movie extensively plundering real science and future-tech concepts for ideas, yet in the end they're just using it as window dressing. Lastly, it wouldn't be a Hollywood movie if science weren't eventually trumped by a Hallmark greeting card: 'It's not the science that will get us there, but love, which overpowers all.' That's not exactly where the movie goes, but close. More than anything, that is what tells us this is, behind the veneer, just frivolous entertainment after all. Christopher Nolan may be one of the most skilled directors working today is wrapping his entertainments in beautiful packages, but in the end the box is still fairly empty.
10.0~My mind is still boggled at the perfection of this film ssra1996 Sign in Permalink I watched Interstellar with my brother, who is as big of a science geek as I am, and I was absolutely blown away, to say the very least. Just thinking about it, my heart is pounding again. I'm a huge fan of epic movies that require you to actually use your brain, unlike the cliché action movies and sappy romances they pop out every other week. For some reason, society looks down on movies like Interstellar, and another favorite of mine, Cloud Atlas. They're movies that make you think. Movies you have to watch a second time to fully appreciate. And that makes a better movie than a mediocre, predictable action movie or what have you. Some reviews I've read are saying that the physics and scientific phenomena of Interstellar aren't realistic, or are just plain wrong. Such as the waves on Miller's planet, and the time anomalies. While, yes, it is true that some of the physics were not factual, its a science FICTION movie. Its not a space documentary. It was never meant to be realistic in that way. With that being said, Interstellar was a masterfully crafted film. From the beautiful, Oscar winning effects, to the Oscar worthy screen writing and direction, to the edge-of-your-seat score by the orchestral legend Hans Zimmer, and even the acting. Generally, Nolan's movies are more about effects, mind effs, and awesome soundtracks. While Interstellar had an abundance of these things, it also had phenomenal acting. Especially the message from home scene in which Cooper erupts into tears. It also had a few surprise actors. With Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Topher Grace, and John Lithgow. I still can't get over how awesome TARS and CASE are, either. My brother and I laughed out loud over how cool they are. Namely when CASE rescues Dr. Brand during the wave scene. The way he started spinning in what was almost like a cartwheel was just so fluid. In conclusion, I give Interstellar a 10/10. Easily one of my favorites.
3.0~Inaudible, unclear, unwatchable. voyou-703-655350 Sign in Permalink The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because... YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that. That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up. During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence. Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals.
3.0~A Film Feigning Importance Cinnyaste Sign in Permalink Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of "Interstellar" forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. "Interstellar" is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand "Inception." A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special. Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the "Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service" trope. Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin? Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in "Star Trek" you knew would never make it to the end credits.) An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera. Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed "Don't Astronauts on "The Twilight Zone" Pass Basic Psych Tests?" plot element. Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes. Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. "Black Hole" did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of "2001: A Space Odyssey." (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.) Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right. There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers. The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie! "Interstellar" veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one. Save very few elements to recommend it, "Interstellar" is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk.
10.0~Best movie I have ever experienced. kdcp999 Sign in Permalink Cinematography is amazing. The only thing that top's it was the acting. Engaged from start to finish. Played with my heart and head like it was as simple as pulling strings! The physics was sound! Educational, the story line brilliant! The idea of playing with time in this fashion is bran spanking new. Mixing the idea of the afterlife with relativity to time being another dimension which can simply be traversed as if were an extra dimension and linking all these together....FANTASTIC! I'm definitely buying the DVD! No sob stories! No boring and predictable Hollywood romance! Just straight up brilliant story telling. You don't watch something for 2 hours+ and think, "gosh, where did the time go", if the movie wasn't that awesome! Really cringe moment with Dr Man... but we see this is in real life all the time. The greats failing at the most pivotal of moments. You may be really smart... but this story is about how love and bravery and the shear will to fight for what is a deepest of core values of the human race - survival as a species.
10.0~Not the best film I've ever seen.. mp-111 Sign in Permalink .. since this isn't really a film, it's a psychedelic experience, a journey to parallel dimensions; we slip through the wormhole of imagination into the place where we always were, but forgot to be. Love, it's a lot of love, hope and whatever it takes to conquer despair and the looming end of humanity. Wow, tears and intensity, all the way through to the other side. I am compelled to write more, but what can I say, it's all in the film, go see it. Whatever you do, watch this film with those you love. It will stay with me for a long time to come, I believe. Now off to dream world and who knows where that will take me, is Brand waiting for me?
3.0~The Emperor's New Clothes Wrapper30 Sign in Permalink I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.
10.0~One of the most beautiful movie I ever saw Brunehaut Sign in Permalink I could write about it for years without managing to describe how I felt while watching Interstellar. I am a huge fan of Nolan, whom may be the best current director: I thought I had seen his best in Inception, which already blew my mind. And then Interstellar happened. Firstly, everything Nolan touches becomes gold. Not only visual gold, but emotional gold when this one is priceless. Beyond the beautiful pictures, the uttely beautiful soundtrack (breathtaking use of the organ), there is this incredibly beautiful story. Interstellar is not a film about stars, skies and space, but about humanity, both its weaknesses and strenghts. It simply talks about the human condition, always wonders in a discreet way why humanity does exist and why it should be preserved : it is a hymn to mankind, almost in a religious way. The 3 hours of film pass by without us noticing, until the ends credits. Then you suddenly awake, dry your tears (I cried for half of the movie) and remain silent for a while - as even as slighly talk could destroy this emotion, endless poetry that the movie left. This also gives us Hans Zimmer as his best. Interstellar would be nothing without this bewitching soundtrack. I saw very few movies like this one. It SHOULD have won the best film Oscar, as it is one of the greatest masterpieces of this century to me. Thank you, Nolan.
6.0~Hugely overestimated niccosanse Sign in Permalink Yes, it has an awesome photography. Yes, it is plenty of awesome actors. And yes, it has a pleasant way of using multidimensional physics. But, for Christ's sake, did they actually needed a 169 minutes long space movie for stating that "Love is a very powerful force!"? With all the hype and the claims of profoundness I've expected something that actually bore a thousand questions to my mind, kept me mentally awake for days, not a movie in which the most difficult concept to understand is 4-dimensional physics. Sadly this wasn't the case.
3.0~A classic ??? Really ???? dinalt10 Sign in Permalink And only gets a 3 because some of the visuals were stunning. I sometimes wonder if I've watched a different version of the film to others, especially films that are so highly rated. This one in particular really is nothing special. Foolishly I bought it on DVD and wish I hadn't................there are far better low budget films out there. So to start with the bad................and I'll leave this as an abridged list, as listing everything wrong with this film would take far too long. 1) The speech. May seem strange to mention 'speech' in a film, but Matthew McConaugheys character was barely understandable - mumbling his way through the script, I actually had to turn the subtitles on to understand it. 2) The script - a love story ?? Hardly. And you get a scientist like Hathaways character basing her views on love. 3) When they go to the planet near the black hole (why base humanitys future on a planet that close to destruction ?), they get stuck there for 23 years or so.............yet their mothership experiences time at a normal rate, with their colleague aging 23 years. And on that note, why didn't their colleague put himself in suspended animation after a year ???? Why wait up when they'd have revived him when they got back. 4) What was it with the black hole ??? His ship was being destroyed, yet he ejects in a flimsy space suit and survives. Many more problems with the script, but the main one is not caring about the characters at all. If a film is to be a love story, it needs a heart - this one lacks that completely, which makes the awfulness of the rest of the film too apparent. Avoid this film like the plague.
6.0~Overlong and no joy retrorosso Sign in Permalink Jessica Chastain was a bright spot, but I found no joy in this overlong, somewhat tedious movie. I had high hopes for this film, but found it predictable and pretentious. I wanted to love it; constantly distracted and wondering why there wasn't more innovation. And really,an oblong robot? How does that work on a spaceship? After the first planet, I longed to go to the other two. Please, let's go see them. Instead, we were sent to this ridiculous and supposedly 5th dimensional "reality" that had absolutely no purpose. The movie quickly ran out of inspiration, surprise and excitement. Yawn. Not fun.
5.0~A gargantuan piece of hokum CinePhile-istine Sign in Permalink I am huge Nolan fan, but I am sorry: Interstellar will probably go down as his worst movie (so far). While the movie's heart appears to be in the right place, it always keeps reaching for something more than it is. It has its moments, but those moments are too few, and even the FX looks a bit tacky - especially coming so soon after Gravity which had similar, but superior, FX. I lost it - and so will you - at the point where Anne Hathaway's character gives a long-winded speech about how "love transcends all dimensions of time and space." I wasn't expecting a movie from the maker of Inception to make a movie this corny.
4.0~A well shot film with an less than good storyline. gary-191-690501 Sign in Permalink I can openly say that I've never been a great lover of sci-fi, but I was influenced by the very high rating of this film and the attraction of the Trailers to give it a good and honest viewing. All this in the hope of enjoying a few hours of cinema and further opening up of another genre for the future. Overall, I was disappointed and for the last hour was wondering what I'd do with my time if I walked out. I didn't and am happy that I didn't, but it's touch and go. I've seen a few great films recently that I would rate 8 and over, but this I've rated at 4. The filming is excellent and the earthly scenes are very good, but the story is very weak and the near ending is not good at all. The latter looks like the way to re-introduce him to his family had no prior plan, so they threw a load of electronic background at it. The actors sweating profusely in their air conditioned suits looked ridiculous to me. Some shouting during conversations matched by the quietness of their fellow actors seemed to be completely unnatural. I can't recommend this film and wish I'd spent the time watching something else. Pays yer money and takes yer chance !
9.0~Good Film! Allow me to give you my opinion on this movie snipersam Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a complicated but brilliant journey of Cooper and his team as they travel through space to find a future for mankind in place of residence and survival. Now believe me, i'm a hard critic, and i haven't given out a perfect score as yet, and when reading other reviews i see a mixture of people who liked/loved it and people that found it garbage or disappointing. Upon reading these reviews i found a common trend with the reviewers that didn't like the film, that being that they believed that it was too long, didn't make sense and was boring. However, when viewing the film myself, i have to respectfully disagree with the reviewers who didn't like the film, and here is why. For people who didn't understand the film because it didn't make sense to them, that should make it a bad film, plus upon viewing the film, everything is pretty much explained if you pay attention, and most people watching this film most likely went into it with a negative attitude to not see what really occurred in the film. This is the main factor in why people didn't understand the film as they bring a negative attitude into watching the film and do not follow the story as they just want the film to finish. Of course there are flaws i found with the film, with it being a tad long yes and the fact that the film had the potential to masterpiece and to aim for the sky, but it really only landed in the stars. Nonetheless, the film is wonderful and i fully encourage people to watch it, with good emotional experiences for the characters which are well performed (most of the time) and a story which really sours into the night. Also for anyone who believes there a scientific inaccuracies in the film, please do remember this is in the future where technology and science would of come along way from our present time. This is a good film
1.0~Hated it Cairene Sign in Permalink Just as with other of Nolan's flicks, this is as pretentious and filled with nonsense. How can anyone believe that travelling through a black hole will be as simple as walking though a park? Even the visuals were't that great. Just look at some Hubble pics for Pete's sake! The story line was weak. Unbelievable. This movie made a mockery out of everything scientific. It is sci-fi at its worst. Did anyone notice how this movie was a hack of Twister? TARS collected the data? Like how the mini transmitter things were let go in a twister to transmit data? I find it really disturbing so many people think this movie is close to perfect. I was shifting in my seat anxiously waiting for the end. This piece of BS is not worth the time and money. Close to 3 hours of my life..i will never get that back. Thanks!
10.0~Better the 2nd time round! phillafrenais Sign in Permalink I've watched this film 4 times and one of the very few films that made applaud at the end. The film in its self is somewhat of a slow burner but weirdly it works. Top 5 films of all time
10.0~"In order for man to move forward, they must leave something behind." robhartjr Sign in Permalink -Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side. That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt. In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll.
1.0~Too long and linear kokan87 Sign in Permalink The movie would be descent if it wasn't 3 hours long! Found myself and my friend begging for the ending so we could walk out the theater as we were somewhere in the middle of the row. I love the concept but I think it's too linear - no major twists in the story that could come from nowhere, everything is so predictable and could be packed in a maximum of 100 minutes. Also, the soundtrack was killing me throughout the whole movie. Too sad and without energy, not moving enough. I think that the soundtrack was there to kill any thrill you could enjoy watching this film. The animations are 10/10 but overall I was glad when I finally got out the theater. So - 1/10 is my final verdict.
2.0~Great Sci-Fi for REALLY STUPID PEOPLE banana-83 Sign in Permalink The movie is visually stunning, at times making me feel like I was really traveling with them, millions of miles from Earth. But folks, there are so many problems with this poorly-told story I could write 5000 words explaining. There are 20+ scenes that do not not drive the story forward, and worse, totally contradict the notion that "Earth is dying." After traveling through a worm hole to another galaxy, McConaughey flies into a black hole, ejects from his craft and comes to a halt inside a giant square mirrored thing, but still has radio communication with his fellow astronaut outside it. From within this thing, he finds himself magically years in the past, behind his daughter's book case, looking at her as though through a one-way mirror. And he somehow has the power to bang on the back side of the book shelf, but not actually talk to her. STUPID! but he communicates to his daughter via morse code the secret to saving the planet and human kind, which apparently she does. He somehow is rescued floating in space, and is brought to a massive artificial planet/space station where he wakes up in a hospital bed. Thought still physically young, he is 120 Earth years old. He is told that the space station is Called "Cooper" which makes him think it's named after him, but he's told it's name after his daughter, who is still alive but very old. He is told that he can see her. Now. . .This means that Cooper is the the father of the savior of mankind. There is no fanfare for him at all. ZERO. He is lead to a hospital room room where his daughter is on her deathbed, surrounded by her kids and grand kids. WHICH MEANS THEY ARE HIS GRAND KIDS AND GREAT-GREAND KIDS, BUT THEY TOTALLY IGNORE HIM AND WALK OUT OF THE ROOM! HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT SAVED HUMAN KIND BUT HIS OWN GRAND CHILDREN AND GREAT-GRAND CHILDREN WALK OUT WITHOUT SAYING A WORD!! Really bad writing and directing.
8.0~Interstellar : More than a director, it is made by a DREAMER rsabnis1 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's comprehensive Weltanschauung ( conception of universe and human's analogy to it ) Interstellar is his most endearing, audacious and expertly scripted venture. A script which once was developed by Jonathan Nolan for Steven Spielberg finally ended in the helms of his brother Chris. A sheer ocular pleasure, when viewed on 75 mm screen, this movie based intergalactic space voyage smells of ambition, emotion and beauty. The viewer doesn't needs to suspend his incredulity inspite of the film being a piece of fiction, owing to the fact that it is one of Nolan's strongest narrative. An enthralling and distinct start to movie reminding us of social documentaries which pictures blight-induced earth as a dust bowl with last shades of humanity left, earth has become inhabitable over time with increasing crop failure and frequent dust storms. Amidst the scenario comes Cooper (McConaughey), a widowed engineer-turned- pilot-turned-farmer who is prompted by some ghostly forces ( who send coded messages) to visit NASA facility in the outskirts of his village. The facility led by Dr John Brand (Micheal Caine) reveals Cooper about a secret mission in search of a habitable planet beyond the solar system and he asks Cooper to pilot the space ark 'Endurance' with the team. Devastated at the thought of her father leaving her, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is filled with discontent and hatred for him. The film tracks Cooper's odyssey along with the NASA team and two robots CASE and TARS as they travel through the wormholes to discover a sustainable living environment while Dr Brand and grown- up Murph (Jessica Chastain) try and solve the inevitable problem of gravity. The direction is accurate and film balances well between different time zones as Cooper and his accomplices verge many light years ahead. Unavoidable comparisons with Gravity and 2001: a Space Odyssey, Interstellar thinks more about the future than focusing all its attention on the present and past. A graphically rich special effects packaged with a mammoth script which reflects a large time devoted to research and a great casting, Interstellar might be specious and flawed at places but it doesn't stop the movie from being a winner. 8 on 10 stars
1.0~Tepid, at best trans_mauro Sign in Permalink Oh my... Another "Science Fiction" film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life. Interstellar, is a boring slow, plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is. Cant't just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? Wouldn't it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole? If people want drama there are a huge number of other (much better) films. If I want to feel bad I will watch Schindler's list... If I want some good Science Fiction I will watch Aliens. Is it that hard for people to get it? This was supposed to be a science fiction adventure, for god's sake. Why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this over-bloated sentimentalism, this sacchariny mess? This is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead. They laud anything that is over complicated, with mindless twists, with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius. Interstellar is another extremely over rated film. It rivals Prometheus in stupidity! I'd rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it again...
3.0~This is no 2001 Space Odyssey! Its a bore fest! RedsAlive Sign in Permalink Lets get started on the good bits, visually this film is stunning, amazing special effects especially the space travel scenes and the planets being discovered. The science behind the film was also good, it dealt with relativity and concepts of time, space and gravity very well! And thats about the only good aspects there is! The acting, Chris Nolan stuck with a familiar cast, Hatheway & Caine from Dark Knight, John Lithgow then went with McConaughey to lead and Matt Damon, oh dear. I like all these actors! Lithgow was the only standout performer in this film, Im not sure McConaughey even knows what an astronaut is, he was so poor! Hatheway wasn't up to scratch either, the acting was poor overall. Don't even get me started on Matt Damon he was simply laughable how poor he was! Character development was poor & the McConaughey character down on his luck hero type is becoming very tiresome! The story, the concept of this film is brilliant, dying Earth lets save humanity, great lets get on with it then. At the end of the film I was still waiting for saving humanity to get started, so much potential and yet so very little story. Too many sub plots thrown together that never went anywhere, bad scripting and lines on a par with the Happening or the Core. This is is dreary bore fest, the guy next to me FELL ASLEEP, it was only 8pm! Some script was so poor that they have decided to play Zimmers music so loud over it that you cant hear the drivel that good actors are being asked to deliver. You could take 50 minutes of bad script out of this film and it would have been twice as good. The need for Matt Damon's character Dr "Boring" Mann in the film was just to make so long, IT doesn't add anything but time! Instead of a 2hr punchy mildly entertaining film, we get 3hrs of time wishing had fixed that leaky tap in the bathroom! Maybe they will come out with an directors cut, about 50 minutes of cuts would be nice, I may watch that!In the meantime Im going to treat myself to 2001 and enjoy a proper sci-fi film epic!!
4.0~Someone changed horses mid stream wlnicolow Sign in Permalink I finally got a chance to watch "Interstellar". It got off to a very slow start (38 mins) before it explained the reason behind the dust storms. I got a kick out of the interviews of the 1930's Dust Bowl survivors. Th interviews were from a very good special on TV awhile ago. I enjoyed parts of the flight into the black hole etc., then it became very "2001, A Space Oddessy"-ish. Interstellar and 2001 both left me with so many questions after watching them. I bought the 2001 book hoping for a better explanation of what was going on in the final scenes. None was found in the book and none was apparent in this movie either. It was like the screenwriters changed roles with film editors and special effects guys. It just didn't work.
10.0~NASA said this is the most realistic deep space travel movie. fuller_ryan-48883 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is one of those movies you can watch over and over and still get a new appreciation for the film. I love Nolan's films. He is arguably my favorite film writer and director. Even though this is a science fiction movie, it feels very real. Nolan has such a talent for making his films seem real. Deep space Exploration is just around the corner in real life, but Nolan gives us the most realistic look at it in this film. As always, Nolan does an amazing job at putting together a terrific cast, special effects and takes you on the most incredible adventure that is out of this world. Interstellar is one film you have to see, even if you are not a big science fiction fan. The ending is worth the watch.
10.0~Extraordinary p-m_music Sign in Permalink I watched this movie last week and honesty, after the ending credits, I couldn't talk like before. I couldn't think like I used to be. My head was exploding...It was the second time my head hurts like this (First time was Memento). You will not believe this movie's greatness and amazing work unless you know it's Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. What makes it even more amazing is all you see is really built and they're not green screen or anything. It's his specialty to make classic amazing movies. This one is the best movie of his entire works. You can feel every second... I will not say more...Just go and watch it...also don't forget to listen carefully as well. Sounds and musics are phenomenal. Go and watch it... Now...
1.0~Tired, clichéd, absurd brucewood99 Sign in Permalink Am I getting bored of watching films or are films getting worse? I made it through about 40 minutes of this one but it was all I could take. The script is ridiculous and I felt I could sense the actors' disbelief at the nonsense they had to say. Michael Caine looking McConnaghey seriously in the eye and saying "They called you here" "Who's they?" A mysterious but caring smile from Caine. Oh god, make it stop! Some minute gravitational changes in McConnaghey's daughter's room make a binary pattern that when converted into decimal (how does he know where the boundaries between digits are??) gives map coordinates to the location of where NASA are working on a ship to take McConnaghey to the aliens. And somehow the ALIENS figured out to create this signal to initiate this causal chain?? What are the chances that Mc would: NOTICE the gravitational field? think it was worth converting the numbers to binary (why would he??) think that these numbers are map references (he'd have to be mentally deranged for this possibility to occur to him) LOOK UP the map references DECIDE TO GO TO THE LOCATION THE MAP REFERENCES POINT TO Do you get my point? Are you kidding me? This movie stinks to high hell. It is yet another example of terrible, terrible screen writing for undiscriminating audiences that have been raised on a diet of pappy effects and vague 'ooh how amazing' nonsense a la Lost, instead of strong story-telling and characterisation. Oh well. Perhaps I'm just getting old.
9.0~Interstellar is Underrated. Leejunchenannie Sign in Permalink (Note: The spoiler is read as a movie trailer as it has snippets of the film that does not affect the main crisis in the film.) To start off, I would like to explain my rating of 9/10. I truly believe that no work of art, be it a literary, theatrical, visual or cinematic work of art whatsoever can be entirely perfect. Thus, as much as I really feel that this movie is the best I have seen in my entire life and deserves 10 stars, I have to hold true to the principle that no form of art can ever be 10/10 because there is always space for improvement. Just like no human being can ever be perfect. Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is really his most complex and most beautiful masterpiece to date. After filming all 3 parts of Batman he has transferred all his knowledge gained from past filming experiences into Interstellar and takes the art of filmmaking to a whole new level. Filming about outer space is especially challenging as Anne Hathaway said that there were no green screens involved in the filming, hence it is a movie that is worth your buck. Even though till date, the gross earnings for Interstellar are about $559 million (and still counting) which is a far cry from Inception with $825.5 million, Interstellar is very underrated as it deserves much more than Inception for this elaborate 2 hr 49 mins movie which is truly well researched, and thoroughly written with a lot of learning lessons to take home. Overall, Interstellar provided viewers with a healthy balance of scientific theories as well as artistic ideas. I truly applaud and respect Christopher Nolan for his keen eye for detail and for his relentless pursuit for perfection. From a scientific perspective, the script was well researched, with many accurate scientific terminologies and theories applied to craft the tense situations that arose in space between the spacecraft and complex machinations of the outer universe. The artistic perspective was, in my opinion, one of the best portrayals of human emotions and human nature that I had ever seen. For the record, this movie was not all about the grandiose task of rescuing the fate of humankind, and of all the scientific equations that need to be solved, the film is so much more than that. It shows us the true power of connections between humans, the many memories we have with our loved ones is powerful enough to overcome anything. It teaches, and exposes us to the endless power of love and it's possibilities. In the end, when Cooper enters the 5th dimensional world, he realizes that love was the key, it was more important than anything else in the world. Not even science was enough to solve Professor Brand's complex gravity equation. All along, he spent his life mercilessly sending hopeful astronauts into space, then cruelly left them stranded there, knowing that there was "something" that was needed to solve the equation but couldn't figure it out. The answer was fairly simple, and he didn't realize it because he did not feel love. It was Cooper whose overwhelmingly powerful mutual love between his daughter enabled him to crack the code and solve the mystery, saving humanity. He was also the only astronaut who had significant family commitments. I feel very compelled to mention evident foreshadowing in the movie, when Dr Brand (Anne Hathaway) said she preferred to go to Edmund's planet instead of Mann's because she felt drawn to it by a powerful force of love for him, (and so goes her long speech about love) Cooper dismissed the idea because he knew it was not going to be productive if they act based on emotions for they needed to consider that Mann's has more viable research material etc. Surprisingly, when Cooper went to Mann's he got himself nearly killed, showing how disastrous it is to not follow the call of love. Combined with the stunning visual effects of space, that were previously reported to be extremely accurate, if not, entirely accurate, it provided viewers with a good educational insight into outer space. For the first time, I actually felt I was watching something that was "real" and "truly existed", not some science fiction movie that consists of nonsensical characters and plots invented that didn't exist. Take "Aliens vs. Predator" or "Star Wars", did they make you feel kind of disappointed that those monsters didn't exist at all after a 2 hour long movie that got you so embroiled in the show? Well, this time, I was certainly not disappointed that black holes existed and there was really such a thing as a 5th dimensional world. There is one central theme that the movie was trying to express, that is " Love has the ability to transcend all boundaries, space and even time."This is a familiar phrase often heard among us and it is no surprise that Christopher Nolan was actually "spacing" his movie based on this. I hope that my review has been useful and that it has been enjoyable reading my innermost thoughts about the movie. Interstellar is certainly a movie that would ignite love in all of our souls.
8.0~Smart, interesting, engrossing TdSmth5 Sign in Permalink Cooper is a former NASA test pilot, now farmer. Something has happened to earth and all there is now is dust. Resources are scarce, and fields compete with humans for oxygen, so they'll have to be eliminated. He's got a daughter Murphy and a son Tom. Tom is smart but since he's a boy in a Hollywood movie he's destined to be a farmer and become the bad guy later. Murphy as a girl in a Hollywood movie is destined for greatness. When Cooper and Murphy happen to run into a NASA facility he's introduced to a plan to save humanity from famine. Sometime in the past, NASA sent several ships through a wormhole to find livable planets. They want him now to run a mission to find out which one of these missions was successful. He agrees, Murphy is angry and doesn't want him to leave and Tom, well, he's a boy, so the movie doesn't care about him. So off he goes with a team of 3 others and some robots. Their challenge is time. They can't waste any because as they are traveling through worm holes at high speeds, years are going by on earth and people are dying. They arrive at the first planet which is nothing but water. There, some girl astronaut who looks like Michael Jackson screws up and gets a teammate killed and wastes precious time. The waves on this planet are gigantic and they are in danger. They escape. Years have gone by on earth. They land on the second planet that is nothing buy ice. They wake up the astronaut there who promises them that there is livable space somewhere underneath. But he has a sinister agenda. Meanwhile we learn that the plan by NASA was somewhat doomed from the get-go, that no one thought this team would make it back to earth. That forces Cooper and the girl to try and solve things on their own. And he's got some help from earth. Murphy herself is now a NASA scientist. And since she was little she has had contact with a "ghost"--some force that tinkered with gravity to give her messages. She, with the ghost, and Cooper racing at the speed of light, will have to figure out a way to save themselves and earthlings. Interstellar had the worst preview of any movie in recent times. After seeing it several times, I had no intention of watching the movie. But to my surprise Interstellar is actually good. Very good. The visuals aren't that compelling though I must say. Sure, it has some neat scenes, but overall for a space movie, this doesn't take advantage of it. We are not treated to cool sights of nebulas and galaxies. It's a smart movie though that doesn't scare away from the physics, but jumps right into it--relativity, worm holes, speed of light, gravity, string theory, multiple dimensions all make an appearance and are handled well. The physics aren't completely accurate nor is the movie plot-hole free, but it's not as obvious or annoying as in other movies. Despite featuring McConaughey in the lead, it is an engrossing movie that gets you involved for the nearly 3 hours. If properly directed in a "normal" role, he can actually deliver. Still, 30-45 minutes could have been easily edited out. It makes you think as well, which is a rarity in Hollywood movies. It doesn't dumb things down. The mandatory scene of someone telling a scientist to "speak English" is thankfully absent, truly revolutionary! There are even some philosophically meaningful lines. While I don't appreciate the anti-male aspects, at least it does place a lot of emphasis on family, on parenting, which is sorely needed in Western developed countries that are basically going to go extinct because successful, high-functioning people can't figure out a way to make long-term meaningful relationships work. And that is the even more revolutionary theme of Interstellar. It goes against the Hollywood agenda to destroy the family and to advocate for no-strings-attached, no drama, transactional relationships. Instead it places importance on family in this life, and maybe beyond.
10.0~Just A Masterpiece niconalbu Sign in Permalink I can't say anything. This movie made me want to rise its score. The music and the story blend so well. I can't find any other movie that good. I know this is short but is only to rise its score. the rest is nonsense: Much did had call new drew that kept. Limits expect wonder law she. Now has you views woman noisy match money rooms. To up remark it eldest length oh passed. Off because yet mistake feeling has men. Consulted disposing to moonlight ye extremity. Engage piqued in on coming.
5.0~Mostly Slow, Confusing Jumble reneehackett99 Sign in Permalink I thought this movie would be great; the plot sounded fun and intriguing, but this movie falls far short of being fleshed out. Most of the movie was slow, with a lot of quiet dialogue on very complex concepts. It was also unclear how some characters fit in ... the female astronaut is in love with who back home? Have we been introduced to this guy? Do we care? Huge jumps in storyline were glossed over: daughter Murph invented the orbiting earthlike station which saved humanity? What? And the 2001: A Space Odyssey bent near the end is overwhelmingly derivative. Overall, it seems like there must be way too much of this screenplay that fell by the wayside somewhere.
5.0~Good start ruined by corn james_melody Sign in Permalink 2001: A Space Odyssey was done on a shoestring and makes more sense despite having virtually no dialogue in half the film. This film cost a fortune, talks and lot, and continues the 'schmaltz in space' theme along the lines of Gravity. The first half an hour sets out some interesting ideas and then proceeds to spend the next 2 hours trashing them by way of quasi scientific mumbo jumbo. And who said it was a good idea to have smart-arsed filing cabinets as robots? Don't get me wrong, there are worse ways to spend 2 and a half hours, but the premise that an alien civilization would create a wormhole in space (rather than curing crop blight) just to allow characters as wooden as this to traipse around is pretty shaky. Better films include: Solaris - Original 1972 version
10.0~I would rate 11/10 mysteryvoiceman Sign in Permalink I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have
4.0~Overrated Scott_Mercer Sign in Permalink I can't knock the look of the film and the excellence of the special effects, but the script was just too long and flabby. It was like 2001: A Space Odyssey as directed by M. Night Shymalan. This is a problem you sometimes get where the director and the writer are the same person. Nolan is just too in love with his own script and can't possibly bring himself to make the tough editing choices that need to be made. I could have cut almost a full hour from this film and made it much better. And somebody should have. And yet, among the long stretches of the film that drag and are boring, there are a few parts that feel ignored and rushed. The "ghost" subplot was just too predictable and hacky, something that Shymalan would have put into one of his movies, while patting himself on the back for his extreme cleverness. McConnaughey doesn't take too many chances here. While he brought welcome humanity to a cold movie, this is familiar territory for him. Anne Hathway was fine. Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine were excellent. I should also bring up the difficulties with the sound mix, causing important dialog to be difficult to understand. Hans Zimmer's omnipresent, throbbing, overdone score was like a party guest that would not leave long after he had become unwelcome. Overall, not terrible but really overrated.
4.0~Fair to middling movie christiank7 Sign in Permalink Some nice stuff and a lot of reasonably good acting and a some great GFX stuff. Storyline reasonable and definitely the type of movie I can recommend even if only so that you can form your own opinion. Scientifically it is seriously far fetched and much of it is beyond reasonable doubt. Morally it is a very thin plot. The premise is not the problem but the good versus evil is. The nature of these characters is somewhat childish and to an extent unbefitting the astronauts we have already experienced. This is Hollywood people and leaves as usual a lot to be desired. After the Gravity film it seems that these types of morally driven sci fi movies are a good bet to make money and win a few Oscars. Not for me though. Acting wise I can possible understand it but not on any of the other levels. I feel that there were far too few plot developments undertaken. The stupidity of the liberal brainwashed public for one. Anyway, you will have to do your own assessment. Watch it for free as I do not feel it is worth watching for money.
1.0~By So Far, The Worst Movie In 15 Years. Period. denis888 Sign in Permalink This is awful. Awful in every single sense - this length of three endless hours, this snotty sentimental atmosphere, these unbearably slow and hammy dialogs. Everything is poor and mediocre in this production. The tonality is set wrong and it is false all through. Then, the cast - Matthew McConaughey is teary, lame and languid. He is the weakest chain here and his efforts to be endearing or touchy do not touch or endear. Anne Hathaway? Probably, her worst part in years. Michael Caine? John Lithgow? Nope, lame at all costs. Avoid this poorly scripted, badly shot, lousily edited slowpoke of a torture. This is just a mere waste of time, and the idea is lost in utter drabness. Let's be honest - I did not understand the idea, the moral and the message. I was totally sucked and drained. And them, this horrendous loud music that deafens the dialog and simply deafens. Why? Why was that so loud and boring? In a word, bad. Bad, bad, bad thing. The worst in years, and I mean it.
10.0~A masterpiece, Nolan's best directing, and an experience rather than a film christhomaspanella Sign in Permalink "Interstellar" was and is a masterpiece. Rather than watching a film, the movie simply feels like an experience that not only requires thinking and thought process, yet also creates an experience of a variety of emotions. The film is perfectly crafted with an extremely talented cast, a deeply interesting plot and idea, a score of music that ties the whole film together with a perfect bow, and stunning and incredibly realistic visuals that make you seriously wonder if you are in the movie with McConaughey. Speaking of McConaughey, he and Hathaway simply shine, yet the rest of the cast does a phenomenal job, making the movie a powerful piece acting wise. I suggest this movie to anyone and everyone, and it is perhaps the best Nolan film out there.
1.0~I am just not sure what just happened to me? Luisgfs Sign in Permalink I waited overnight to comment I needed to digest it. It was so freaking long I just had to go to sleep to regain my sanity. 1st Q: Why was he so freaking orange? It's a dust bowl, no a tanning booth 2: Why was Matt Damon such a di*k 3. Was this sponsored by Monsanto? 4: So after spending what felt like an eternity together, are we to believe Anne Hathaway will just magically fall for this guy rushing to her side? I'm shocked at what fell like blind reviews. If you feel like you need to watch it go ahead but keep your expectations in check. Maybe DVR it so you can rewind the mumbled conversations of overly complicated science chatter. But you will feel a sense of assurance when yet another "save the world movie" ends with humans creating an American point of view world for all to live in. Forget Europe. Forget Asia. They can eat our dust.
10.0~Interstellar, A grand display worthy of your time chrisx18240 Sign in Permalink This is a film that demands your viewing; visually, emotionally, and mentally. Do not let that scare you, let it entice you and draw upon your wonder of the unknown and the curiosity of discovery. I suggest you see this film with someone, whether that be a friend, family, or significant other. Prepare for a few tears, a few laughs, and prepare to be baffled and mesmerized. This is a film that pushes many limits, and some might say the limits of its audience, but I see that as a positive. This film will remind you of 2001, The Tree of Life, Apollo 13, and Insomnia. For those looking for the link to Christopher Nolan's other work Insomnia is your best bet; this carries all of the same acting, writing, and directing marvels of that film. Dark knight fans may be shied away, and fans looking for the action of Inception may leave feeling cheated, but ignore them. This is a film for people. It is a personal and human film. It's most tender moments will cause views to draw on emotions and relationships in their own life. It reaches beyond the screen; asking some very personal, as well as philosophical questions. The film in the end may not have all the answers, or even explain itself completely, but is does not suffer from these aspects, but rises higher because of them. The movie is not perfect, but it is not supposed to be perfect. Just like the first maps drawn, or the first exploration into unknown waters, there will be missteps and wrong turns. I am keeping this short to avoid giving anything away. Go see this film with an open mind, and it will reward you in every way. It is a giant step forward in modern cinema, it is a film that will be discussed for years to come, and it is a film that has the power to affect the viewer, something not many films in today's market can boast. I cannot remember the last time a movie truly left me speechless. There have been films I have wanted to watch again right away, films I needed to process, or films that had me deep in thought. This film not only achieved all of the above, but truly and honestly left me speechless. The film will demand a great deal of the viewer, including the three hour runtime, but like any great adventure the reward at the end is greater than the sum of its parts.
5.0~I gave Nolan a chance, he disappointed me once again. JackMurrayLondon Sign in Permalink I felt like I could not miss this movie, especially since it is going to be part (a huge part) of the next Oscars night. I've never been a fan of Nolan's, from his Memento, to Inception: Interstellar could have been the movie that could just change my mind. Nope. It didn't happen. It's not easy to review this movie, it's like a big puzzle which screen-players turned it into a big mess. It alternates some visually strong scenes, to some absolutely cheap ones. The dialogues: 3/10 were brilliant, the rest were almost senseless and useless; the movie reaches some high emotive peaks, but again, I'm not fully convinced: they wanted to make audience cry, it tastes like a cheap trick. Matthew McCounaghey is fabulous, as always. The rest of the cast is under expectations. Michael Caine, C. Affleck, A. Hathaway, Jessica Chastain. Maybe it's not their fault: maybe it's just their characters, who are emptier than my pockets right now. I've a suggestion for all of yours dear readers: go watching Moon, avoid Interstellar. And if you really want to feel what's Interstellar like, add to your watch-list (together with Moon), "Click". Yes, you read it well.
1.0~i want my two hours of my life back, what kind of crap was this, so stupid wojtekc27 Sign in Permalink omg this movie was so stupid, like really, waist of time,i even pulled out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how stupid this movie was. The music at some parts was just so way over kill, too loud and too way dramatic. The whole story was crap and did not make any logical sense, so ur telling us that NASA did not know that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf, its like the person who wrote this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand who this movie is not making any seance. OK the only part i did like about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the main character, that was something interesting, and his trying to dock into the space station, it was nice story but still none nonsensical. bc with time, it just don't make any sense, so they 2 walk away from the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u can see they fly so far, no way they could of walk that distance, then at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane, the bad guy can walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways, it just did not make any sense to me this movie. its just way too stupid. sorry, but it was.i want my money back!
2.0~I'd say 'spoilers alert' but there's nothing that can spoil this film any further. But there: SPOILER dora_krajcarz Sign in Permalink This is the worst film I've seen since I can't even remember when. First of all, Anne Hathaway is enough to make any film make you question if the casting crew was on acid and makes Sandra Bullock look like a prodigy. At times you also question the evolution theory. OK, this was arguably ad hominem- Anne's speech about love, on the other hand, is taking things to the next level- it was like listening to a 12 yo Kardashian with a mental impairment trying to say something deep. The Galaxy, if anything (although probably equally as dumb) was visually impressive whereas this insult to your mind, vision and pocket was just plain WTF. Initially, I was glad to see that there would be no spectacular outer space battles which made me think that they would focus on the visual and/or scientific. But no. They so painfully failed at both that for the first time ever, even though I never leave the cinema, I just had to abandon the premises. I do understand that it's supposed to be sci-fi but that's the thing- sci-fi is a combination of science and fiction, not of bunch of misguiding cretinism and infinitely boring narrative. It's also amazing how someone can make a great film with Ben Affleck and someone fails to make one with Matthew McConaughey. Dylan Thomas is certainly turning in his grave. Oh, and so very convenient that nobody has aged while Matt Damon was out there- kind of defeats the storyline. Don't get me wrong, I am no stranger to bullshit films and on principle do not detest them, sometimes, even often enjoy them but this was potentially lethal. Save yourself the 17 quid, feed the poor, save the dolphins, stop Ebola, ANYTHING but don't waste it on this monstrosity.
7.0~Review after second watch, 4 years later pkpera Sign in Permalink High rated movie, expected with big hype in it's time, as it was (and is) usual with Christopher Nolan movies. Indeed, it is visual masterpiece, with stellar casting, but I did not see much from title - Interstellar travel was marginalized, actually all it was some half minute wormhole crawling. Scientific part was marginal too, but that was to expect. Instead it, we has some high emotional family drama, combined with heavy 'time dilatation', fifth dimension again, combined with gravity. All it with some goal, but will not go into it to not spoil it. Sad thing is that all it did not make much sense. There were spectacular shots, landscapes, but our heroes, at least scientist ones made mostly bad decisions. Exception was main character Cooper, just a pilot/engineer. Well, that's what people likes to see, I guess. Worst part was last 10 minutes. Rushed after about 2.5 hours not always fast paced happenings. The good: robot was cool. Now, I'm on very strong opinion that only right way is to take more care about our Planet and to keep it habitable, to make it better as is at moment - and that is possible - while interstellar travel is still wild fiction. Even travel to Mars is pretty much it, and just not option for transferring millions - even 5 is too much, really. Why so much movies about moving on places which are far worse than some desert or Antarctic ?
7.0~Good, but Overrated framptonhollis Sign in Permalink This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, "Interstellar" is above "Casablanca", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Psycho", "Apocalypse Now", and "CITIZEN KANE"! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than "Citizen Kane", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time! Is is better than "Citizen Kane"? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is "The Dark Knight", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. "Interstellar" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out. The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how "love conquers all" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences. Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!
10.0~Interstellar shows how the world will end and how human race try to find a new home chealysa Sign in Permalink Intersteller opens at an unspecified future date in America's farm belt. Although the film is careful not to identify a year, it's probably around 2050. The world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. With nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. Former NASA engineer and test pilot Cooper owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family: son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald. Drawn by almost supernatural means to a chain-link fence around a super-secret location, Cooper finds himself face-to-face with what remains of his former employer: an underground think- tank dedicated to saving the human race. Led by Professor Brand, NASA has developed two plans. The first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. The second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. There are problems with Plan A - namely, overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship - but Brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible. This is the movie that shows how the world will end due to human activity that caused and how the human tries to explore the galaxy to find a new home for humanity.
1.0~Pseudo Intellectual noahgunner Sign in Permalink interstellar was yet another over hyped hollywoodized movie. 10/10 visuals and an ost that sucks you in. But the rest was pseudo intellectual bullshit designed to seem deep if you're on drugs or unversed in the sciences of what it actually talks about. Those with knowledge in string theory, other dimensions or who have an intelligence even slightly above average who don't get trapped by Hollywood and consumerism would likely agree it sucks. I can in all Ernest rate that movie a 3/10 with only the last 20 minutes of that 3 hour movie being evenly slightly worth watching. it would get a 1/10 if the visuals weren't incredible and the acting decent. the supposed relationships between characters were awful, it was slow paced while simultaneously rushing the only 20 minutes that were slightly interesting despite being pseudo intellectual. And was all way to predictable minus the attempt to be deep in the last 20 minutes by trying to connect a 5th dimension to the story line and his daughters ghost in her room which was foreseeable the first second he saw her through the bookshelf weirdness. That was a waste of time. I want my 15$ back.
4.0~Can you imagine Star Wars, but everybody crying??? alfonsov86 Sign in Permalink Can you imagine Star Wars, but everybody crying? Han Solo crying. Luke Skywalker crying. Darth Vader crying. Every single person in the galaxy crying and crying.... This is interstellar. An amazing 90 minutes movie with an additional 80 minutes of crying people. Everybody crying. And crying again. And again. And once again. Everybody crying. I can't believe how such a great movie has been destroyed by crying characters. I can't believe. Also, I did not really like the soundtrack too much, because it is noisy and does not let you hear the actors speaking. Do you imagine Darth Vader with the words "Luke, I am your father" covered by a noisy music.... "Luke, I CHHHHHHHHHHHHANGGGGGG". What a pity.
10.0~Awesome slbolfing Sign in Permalink I've watched this movie too many times to count, and am still struck by the brilliance presented by everyone involved. The score is beyond perfect. Spoilers Alert: Despite, or perhaps because of, the one central plot hole the movie is riveting. Humanity is saved because of intervention from an advanced civilization. This civilization is actually humanity's far distant descendants. Humanity saved itself; the paradox is that the future humans would not exist, unless they did intercede!
2.0~Fell waaaay short of expectations hrvoje8 Sign in Permalink With such good reviews, I expected so much more of this movie. Failing to see the supposed brilliance, the only conclusion left to be drawn is over-hyped PR. Implausible and simply ridiculous at times, it's perfectly OK for a guy go on a quest for some "coordinates" only to find a top secret NASA base, who are launching a secret mission ASAP. The guy uses all the on-board instrumentation without months, even years in rigorous training because, yeah, he is a pilot. He doesn't need to do any medical exams, psychological evaluation and yet he is humanity's best hope for survival. And the library, don't get me started on that one. He is communicating with his daughter through "I'm hiding and floating behind a library cabinet, I'll just encode this data in Morse so we can twitch the second hand of her watch" crap. Seriously? I simply can't believe all the praise this is getting. It's hard to accept is as an "experience" with all the nonsense.
5.0~Over complicated and pretty boring! 5/10 leonblackwood Sign in Permalink Review: I honestly don't think that ordinary, everyday folk like me, are supposed to understand what the hell is going on in this movie because I certainly didn't. I got the main jest of the film but the Nasa jargon went way over my head. Its also really long and I struggled to keep my eyes open, especially when there floating around space talking about things I haven't got a clue about. The main concept of the movie is that a bunch of Nasa boffins want to save the humans species by making them live in space because they can't see a long existence for humans on earth. McConaughey plays the main pilot on the space mission and he leaves his 2 kids behind to try and save humanity. Sounds simple but there are so many other elements which just made the movie confusing. In true Inception style, Nolan went way overboard with the storyline and he could have easily taken out an hours worth of footage. The beginning and the end were interesting but the main space mission was quite boring, until Matt Damon pokes his head out of the woodwork. For a Nolan film, I thought that it looked pretty basic, especially with such a big budget, but you do end up sticking with the plot because you want to see if he gets home. The ending also didn't make much sense to me because I really don't know how Hathaway was able to build a house in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, after much anticipation, I was pretty disappointed with this film but I'm sure that many other film goers will disagree with me. Watchable but not that great! Round-Up: Although I didn't really find this movie that amazing, the performances were really good from the cast and they made there impossible mission seem realistic. The little girl, played by Mackenzie Foy, has had roles in the Twilight franchise and the Conjuring so at 10 years old, she has already made a name for herself. She was a great addition to the cast along with Michael Caine and John Lithgow who also played there characters well. Anyway, I know that the main character McConaughey was really close to his little girl but I found it a bit weird that he didn't ask any questions about his son or his little baby. I also thought that Nolan could have done a better job with the robots which also looked very basic and the spaceships didn't have any attention to detail. At the end of the day, it's no way in the same class as the Batman reboot, which Nolan done extremely well and with movies like Gravity and the underrated Moon in this genre, I honestly think that it could have been simplified and a lot shorter. Budget: $165million Worldwide Gross: $675million I recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/adventure movies about a crew of Nasa explorers, trying to save the humans race. 5/10
1.0~Most overrated movie in mankind's history! Bento_de_Espinosa Sign in Permalink This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great! First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to start. It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring. I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one. The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of. Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: "OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!" You'd probably smile and say: "Wonderful! OK, go now!", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe. And again a female "scientist" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays. This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews. Good night. And good luck.
10.0~A truly incredible sight for the eye to behold. Well done, Nolan. loganjhanselman Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a space epic that is a story about the strength of love. Christopher Nolan is famous for his cerebral stories and practical effect usage over CGI. Nolan is an expert when it comes to 3 things: 1.) Playing with our emotions. 2.) Casting his characters. 3.) Production values. I also might add that I didn't mind the runtime at all. Hans Zimmer did an amazing score, and it will be ever so iconic in the future. And lastly, I cried my eyes out. Well done, Nolan.
10.0~Epic boudolof Sign in Permalink The best movie so far in my life.Thank you Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for this diamond.I'm hoping to create something like that soon
4.0~I'm still recovering dansteiny Sign in Permalink My wife and I love Sci-fi and have been anticipating this movie for months! When we saw the 9.3 review (that's what it is now anyway) we were even more excited. So, off we went to the theater last night ready to be blown away. We almost left the movie, which would be a first. OK, the special effects are great, but the sniveling factor we couldn't stomach. I'm mean seriously, there was someone bawling on the screen nearly 50% of the movie. Many of the lines were so cheesy we look at each other like, "can you believe this?" If you like sad drama's, depressing story lines and crying astronauts give it a go. This falls under SciFi, but it really should fall under drama. Ugh, I'm trying to forget it.
5.0~Nolan taps into Zeitgeist benjaminburt Sign in Permalink Interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. It interests me. How can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? Is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws, or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboy-ism and bandwagon-ing? For starters, I would just like to say my opinion. I think the movie is fine. It's a little too drawn-out and has bizarre elements, and I think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film. Some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters, and for them, they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time. So, how did Nolan do it? Well, I believe he tapped into Zeitgeist, or the 'spirit of the times.' He made a perfect storm of a movie, using elements that, on their own are not very special, but combined, they reflect the values of this age. Let's break it down. First off: space. The works of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye have fired up new interest in space, and people loved the realistic take on the genre. Second: the message of love. Western Culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love, and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit. Layer on top of this the cinematography, direction, and style of Nolan, which fanboys have been eating up since Memento. And while I like almost all Nolan films, I think Interstellar is his worst, featuring Nolan-isms dialed up to 11, with philosophical stances on love, life, time, destiny, and humanity's position in the universe. Everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose, and there are reasons to like it. Just please, don't deny the fact that it's pretentious, overly long, and contrived. Recognize that but say that that didn't stop you from enjoying it.
5.0~nonsensical n-arvind1 Sign in Permalink I expected the world out of it, but in the end, it turned out to be utter nonsense. I am not an expert on black holes but I do believe the theory most physicists and astrophysicists propound. that, if you enter a black hole, you will die. or near the event horizon, you will be stretched or mutilated or ultra compressed. etc.etc. and those theories are based on the millions of observations of star stuff being destroyed at the mouth of black holes. but in the film, not only does the person survive, he goes into some dimension, where he is instructing his daughter from behind his books to tell him to not go. blah blah blah. that dimension being built by some advanced race.. blah bla. my only question is, why .. it sounds so BS. there is no point to build some advanced dimension. warning humans from the past to correct the future... the fact that the intelligent race exists must mean that everything went fine or was controlled in the past. the whole ending makes no SENSE AT all. people who are giving this film all 9 and 10-star reviews are just hypnotized to the extent that they have started believing that Nolan cant make bad films and their brains just reject the idea. I am a huge Nolan fan but did not see this coming from the master... :( p.s. film is at least 6 for me but the 1 is to balance the fake overall rating.
3.0~Utter disappointment leijona-15930 Sign in Permalink I just saw the 70 mm version of the film (I hadn't seen it before) and I had high hopes of it. After all, in many reviews it was compared to the Holy Grail of science fiction, Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey. But instead of cosmological Beethoven I saw a rather ordinary rock'n roll space movie. Sure, many scientific facts were correct and special effects ok, but the athmosphere of the movie collapsed to the normal cliches of Hollywood movies. The hero was a rough corn farmer turned into a space cowboy. The end was underlining and giving all the answers instead of rising any questions. Driving of the space ships seemed to be rather easy feat, and surely you got those chases with them with some explosions, too... Perhaps the worst thing in the movie was the complete failure of painting the space as a huge place where we are just tiny grains of sand. In Kubrick's Space Odyssey even the journey to Saturn was an extreme journey taking the whole movie to complete. In Interstellar humans are jumping to other galaxies in just minutes of movie time. In other solar systems the journey between planets is not even worth showing... What's the hurry? Instead of describing the feelings of crew in the middle of nothing there seems to be always a great hurry to the next scene of action... After a couple of hours I almost fell asleep. Only when our space cowboy entered the black hole did the movie turned into something of bit interesting, but just when it would have been a terrific spot to end the movie it just went on until the ridiculous end.
4.0~Watch story to see theopposingforce108 Sign in Permalink (Don't read with you didn't watch it already!) I'm giving Interstellar 4 stars because the detail in space is Horrible, no stars, etc. Originally from the Black Hole Thermodynamics and string theory, the black hole is the entrance into the void (in between each universe following string theory). But when cooper goes into the void or into the black hole, his now apparently into 5th dimension where he can Only see the history about his life but not anywhere else and relating to this, in "Men In Black 3", There is a alien named Griff than has 5th dimensional abilities and refers to all history, not only his. The Screen play is horrible and the theme is toooo dark. Something good about it is they made all the technology legit and cool. And inferring from Star Trek (1960's edition), the wormhole looks horrible, since it's too dark to see it, it doesn't even look like they went through it. And another part of the black hole, black holes don't occur often, and the black hole would have enough force to bring all that debris inside, and I'm referring that that black hole occurred from a super powerful supernova mixed with a nebula, the dark energy would also be sucked into the black hole instead of floating around it. Finally, the ending was horrible, the original plan was when Murphy is 30 something, cooper would come back. But after, when he escapes from the 5th dimension black hole, he is just outside of Saturn. Then he is apparently found in a space station where he should of died. The space station is like a museum and the walls flip up. Now you saw why I rated this 4 stars.
1.0~Pseudo science fiction cheapening scales of cosmos. sush_gup123 Sign in Permalink I went to watch this movie expecting it might be a decent sci-fi movie but it turned out to be yet another terrible crap. Here are the few reasons why I found it crap. 1. If a guy fell in a typhoon (a usual Earth disaster), it is most probable he will die, but Mr. Coop is made of some different material. The guy went inside a black hole (where matter collapse beyond nuclear and quark level) but he comes out in one piece with all his consciousness intact. This very presentation by Nolan just cheapened the depiction of a black hole. 2. So top notch team was sent out by NASA, yet they cry and whine about so small issues like "oh, I want to see my daughter back". Even at my company of 16 people we act more professionally. Seriously people buy whatever crap is fed to them in the name of Nolan.
3.0~Astronomy and physics good – Terrible storyline – full of the black holes! mnoble1-2 Sign in Permalink Science Fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction. Starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation – constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. Then, we are supposed to believe that a drone – one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power 'an entire farm.' After that, Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan (Screenplay) expect us to believe that a retired NASA pilot, who never left Earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft, is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. Okay, I'll admit this one is possible, but not likely. The first planet they decide to visit – the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation – the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour, (one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot – not detected by the spacecraft instruments, by the way) is a prime candidate for colonization. Then, when the next huge wave arrives, Christopher Nolan (Director) makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds (plenty of time to get in the spacecraft) watching the wave approach and is washed away. Why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! Nonsensical! The next thing the Nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a one-way mission suddenly goes crazy, becomes a coward, falsifies data, and turns into a murderer! Were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! Don't think so! Later, this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. I guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!
1.0~what the fu Just happened?!!?! solojere Sign in Permalink SO this movie wasn't that bad but it isn't as good as people make it out to be for sure. For one the movie is very slow at the start. And Matthew McConaughey's character is no good guy he kinda only cares about himself for about 95% of the movie. There are some good moments but the end just gets weird!! It goes 100% unrealistic with and then makes tries to McConaughey people try to defend the film by saying it is all realistic but for one I find it hard to believe that the planet is dying but we still have oil and gas for our cars. And even if it there is some real theory behind parts of the movie the last 30 mins ruin any credibility that had been setup. so all in all it's OK but nothing great and don't listen to the sheep!!
10.0~Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey tardieu-felix Sign in Permalink The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film. You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured. Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves "behind" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the "black hole beyond the horizon" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, "all it takes is a little push ! " *you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out. Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014
10.0~it is about love zlm-51062 Sign in Permalink No matter if you can understand this movie regarding science.the love between cooper and murph is the key.and the promise of a father

5.0~High hopes, low ropes. Why you be fussing? hymntymm Sign in Permalink What I first thought was that the actress who plays Murphy, still had the stain of being the stupid hybrid baby from Twilight. But it was really distracting how pretty she was. I couldn't help but think about her future in Hollywood and if she would end up damaged. Or end up ugly like Macaulay Culkin. I also wondered why Matthew McConaughey was so out of breath and all of the sudden wet and shiny. I really appreciated that they didn't' show McConaughey training to be an astronaut, because that would have been dumb. Thank you for giving what we wanted, but why did you have to stop there. The quiet jokes, David Gyasi's motion sickness. The quiet moments were nice. Felt like genuine story telling. Instead of the corny lines that were put in by the producer because he wanted some hooks. I liked the quality of the visuals. It felt like watching a movie. It felt like film. The space sequences were good. They felt quiet, like your ears needed to pop. I didn't understand the casting. It was like a popular kids party. It was like everyone was acting in their own movie. It certainly wasn't an ensemble cast. There was no chemistry or tension between any of the characters, despite the calibre of the cast. This may have been the fault of the Editor. Or the Director. Hans Zimmer's score, tried to insert its own personality and was something that asked to be noticed and noted. And was at times pretty comical. Umm, I wanted more science. I was more intrigued by the re-asking of the question of can we bend time. Than I was of will Cooper get back to Murphy and keep his promise. the two motivations don't have the same weight. F*ck Murphy. Whiny b*tch. Yeah her character was really selfish and until the end made it about her. Even at the end end, she as like, "Naw, I'm good." Even though my whole life was about finding you, it was all like, "Go, go, my kids are here, I don't need you here." F*ck Murphy. She was just distracting and then she died. Oh yeah and - What the f*ck, Matt f*cking Damon. Why is he here all of the sudden? How do you think the movie could have been saved? Less dialogue, more quiet moments. So like 2001? No -- no , just more thought into it. Well not more thought obviously they put a lot of thought into it and spent a lot of money. It needed more refinement, distilled down to more essential elements . Like it got caught up in being spectacular. F*ck Hollywood. 186 million dollars for a half ass attempt at some present day science fiction necessity for most of us. I've lost a lot of faith in what I once found my escape.
1.0~What a complete and utter waste of money Mork_the_Borg Sign in Permalink This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million.
2.0~Dull dull dull, but some incredible visuals nubrownsoul Sign in Permalink I like movies. I watch them a lot. I personally know 2 of the actors in this film, and also some people connected to the scoring. After all the hype I was geared up to watch it. I fell asleep once within the first hour and drifted in and out of consciousness throughout the film. It's too long, waaay to much dialogue - a completely bombastic storyline and Matthew just irritated me. I could give a much more well rounded review and get all academic - but its not worth it. I really can't sum up the words to say how much of a dull experience this was. There are some crazy visuals once they eventually get into space - but the dialogue and the actual audio mix is really lame. Watch it if you really have nothing else to do - or perhaps if you're a drug user it might work better under the influence. Since I don't take drugs - that's just a wild guess - it might - actually - make it even worse. One thing for sure - I wouldn't watch it again. Not for all the tea in China.
5.0~Not much more than a summer pop corn movie bwyg Sign in Permalink I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie, I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it "more immersive" apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old. And by the end of the movie, so were the endless references to 2001. Sheesh. A good amusement park ride, yes it is. But it's still considerably below the bar set by Gravity last year.
2.0~Reactionary ideology at $165 million a pop finbarotoole Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan tears the environment a new one. Thanks, Nolan. You could discuss this movie in terms of its irrationality, its flawed physics, its attempts at explaining time travel and worm-holes (in a movie packed with plot-holes), its pseudo-scientific explanation of the 'existence' of love in humans, its overuse of the already overused 'Don't go gently into that good night' a poem both politically suspect and over-familiar to the point of banality. You could discuss it in terms of its stereotypical absence of mum and the struggling hero dad, its general bag-of-spanners story-telling ability throw stuff in and rattle it about. The fact it's a whole load of old twaddle told in a way that's an insult to the intelligence. But what really pisses me off is its stance on our environment. Early on Matthew McConaughey, our hero, the protagonist whom we follow throughout the movie, says: Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. His intellectual mentor, Michael Caine, says: We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it. THIS this let's screw up the world and then move on attitude what is destroying the world around us as we sit here is condoned, confirmed, seen as inevitable, advocated as the way to go. Let's find another planet. Settle there. Screw it up too. Move on again. Reactionary, Republican, right-wing manifest destiny across the universe. Yeah. Good one, Nolan.
10.0~Don't let him leave, Murph! toutouguy Sign in Permalink Quite possibly one of the greatest pieces of film of the decade? Century? Breathtaking in summary.
6.0~Some interesting ideas, but overall unsatisfying cherold Sign in Permalink I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly. That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same. First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long. The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first). Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.) The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments. Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.) As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others.
1.0~Another insult to intelligence roystephen-81252 Sign in Permalink I love intelligent sci-fi movies. 2001: A Space Odyssey (the movie Interstellar clearly wants to emulate) was a real masterpiece that still remains unequalled to this day. I have nothing against slow, introspective SF either. I thoroughly enjoyed Tarkovsky's Solaris, for example. It's not that I dislike Nolan's work. Memento was a brilliant movie. I found The Prestige engaging, too. Inception veered a little close to Hollywood bombast and used some dumb clichés, but was still original and interesting. But this one is just plain bad. Worse, it masquerades itself as an intelligent film when it actually makes no sense at all. For me, that type of pretentiousness is the biggest cinematic sin of all. Hence the 'awful' rating. The build-up is extremely long and boring. Later, the first simple docking manoeuvre is presented as if it was the dramatic climax of the movie. The scenes stretches on and on, and the irritating, minimalistic music tells you you're supposed to bite your nail in excitement. I was bored to death instead. The same thing with the mini-climax that cross-cuts scenes on Earth and Dr Mann's planet (when Mann tries to kill Cooper). No matter how hard Nolan tries to suggest some kind of superhuman drama with the painfully long build-up, irritating music, and cross-cutting, apart form his tricks and the tired clichés, there's nothing there. It's still a long way to go until the end, which - not surprisingly, after so much artificial drama - falls completely flat. The big revelation? I knew as soon as Cooper and his daughter found the message 'from beyond' who the sender would turn out to be.
1.0~Waste of money... kkgokturk Sign in Permalink My honest rating would be 6 for that movie but I rated it 1 to balance the "emotional" ratings. Cast and the part with Matt Damon were good. The rest was a bad combination of Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bit Mr. Nobody in the wrap of a lot of useless drama... If you have a thinking mind which does not surrender to the dirty drama games of the commercial script writers then your brain cells will hurt like a b... after seeing that much nonsense. Unfortunately, that is the destiny of almost all movies playing with the time concept except the Back to the Future trilogy. What concerns me more than the quality of the movie itself is the number of blown-up ratings threatening the credibility of IMDb, which I always trust. Who are you people? Some fake rating generator AI? Thousands of people voting for 1$ per day? Last words: Don't go! They don't deserve your money because they did not put enough effort to create a meaningful story and I would accept any meaning in its own logic.
3.0~Ironically, for a film about five dimensions, this film falls flat Denoument Sign in Permalink The most important problem is the script. The story is one dimensional, characters are caricatures, and dialog is artificial. With such a shallow material, acting is average at best, apart from Matt Damon who delivers a quality performance. More often than not, we see the puppeteer, as certain scenes are poorly directed and only serve the purpose of moving the story forward. This film makes me wonder what Mr. Nolan thinks of his audience. His need to bang us on the head with loud music and simplistic dialog is not only insulting but painful. References to 2001: A Space Odyssey are overdone as well, so that anyone who has so much as heard about it, is bound to recognize it. He manages to patronize and pamper the audience so much that in the end one cannot really say what was sweeter in the theater, the film or the candy. As someone who admires Mr. Nolan's work and likes cinema, I found this failed SF by numbers profoundly disappointing.
2.0~protracted, nonsensical geir-h-ellingsen Sign in Permalink The good: The creative design of their robot +1 the visuals of the water-planet maybe the ice-planet as well +1 Things that made this film bad: All the scenes that did not add anything to the story, including the very slow start. The sabotaging behavior of Matt Damon, was just added to make drama. From the moment Matt attacked Matthew, I knew the movie was bad. That the crew members would believe Matt's description of the planet is unlikely. The planet was visibly frozen It will always be pointless to reach the center of a black hole, since it would mean certain death. They tried to describe it as a necessary sacrifice, but the thinking behind was just nonsense. I have no Idea what they tried to illustrate as happening in the black hole. There are no books to be found in a black hole. Timetravel backwards in time is impossible. The excessive use soundtrack music and unnecessary loud music. The plot overall was far from something that could have happened in reality.
10.0~'Interstellar' millert1409 Sign in Permalink 'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the "fi" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.
4.0~Nolan misfires with mumbo jumbo Targetrich Sign in Permalink I was ready to like this film, given his work on The Dark Knight, Memento and Inception. Of course, I was worried about the casting - McConaughey doesn't belong in an intelligent sci-fi, and Hathaway should only appear in movies doing a bad English accent in a lush period drama, but I was hoping for he best. SO we get McConaughey mumbling for literally the first hour, during the course of which almost nothing at all happens. It's so bad you have to turn the sound up. And then of course we meet Hathaway, who is to acting what Genghis Khan was to community relations. And then, implausibly, we see them sent up in a rocket to save the planet, which is followed by some nice visuals and ludicrous plotting before the end which is almost as bad as Bobby Ewing waking up in a shower. SO it was predictable, absurd, and poorly acted which leads to the question why are people falling over themselves to say how great it is? I suspect it's because McConaghey is the man of the moment, and Nolan considered a genius. Which people think mean they can do no wrong. Which is a disappointing conclusion to reach.
1.0~Gravity is still the best sci-Fic of all time waelkatkhuda Sign in Permalink first of all i'm happy that the film wasn't number one at the box office and that's for a simple reason it didn't deserve it. I went last Friday to see this film for two reasons : first i like Nolan's films specially Inspection, and second reason is because i thought i'm gonna see a film like or even better than Gravity, but it wasn't. as the matter of fact it was the worst film i have ever seen for years and that's for many reasons: 1- the graphic design was OK, but not like Gravity gravity was much real as if u were in the space with them 2-the story is very long unreasonable ( specially the end) and confusing because once u are in space and once u are in earth i really wanted to leave the theater but i because i paid the ticket i refused to go out. and i the end all i wanted is to( get my money back )
6.0~Ambitious but pretentious and plodding, Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic strains for greatness, poignancy and monumentality, but falls thuddingly short moviexclusive Sign in Permalink How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised. By imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time. Since his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space. Another hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years. Yet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel. Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that "we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper. Similarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them.
1.0~Nothing new, nothing original and below average acting hemril Sign in Permalink My real vote would be 3/10. But in light of the over inflated rating of this movie, I want my vote to counterweight this overrating. If you have been watching science fiction since the 1960's, this film will not present you with any new storyline. Over and over we have seen the doomsday scenario where one must find a new world for humanity. There is no contribution to science fiction in this movie. None. Zip. Nada. And the actors? I am an unconditional fan of Anne H. But here, she seems like she has no material to work with. She did the best she could. But no Oscar performance here. Matthew M., on the other hand, makes all efforts necessary to bore us to death. If I could travel through time and space, I would have skipped this movie and gone straight to the end titles. John L., whom I think is among the best actors of his generation, manages to stand his ground and comes out with his dignity of actor intact. However, a bad movie IS a bad movie and in science fiction this kind of mistake can unfortunately pass for acceptable. If you are a fan of the genre, don't bother. I saw a review on the BB saying this is the best movie ever made. My only suggestion to this poster is to start watching what was done before in SciFi.
6.0~Plodding phillip_harben Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has officially jumped the shark. I enjoyed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but I was waiting and waiting for something to happen in The Dark Knight Rises. Inception was okay, but overly long and Interstellar was eagerly anticipated, until I watched it. Interstellar has a strong emphasis on family - it's written through the script like writing in seaside rock. Nolan seems to have confused thoughtful with dull. As the venerable Doctor of Film, Mark Kermode often says: "it needed someone to go through the script with a chainsaw." Although this isn't strictly fair, as the script is (although both wordy and "worthy") not the issue here - it's the pace of the shots. Lots and lots of quiet time, with long takes of the actors doing nothing, but gazing into the middle distance, reflecting on their predicament in a thoughtful way. Not a bad movie, thought provoking and in one scene, heart-breaking, but could've lost 30 minutes without trying too hard. Not the revolutionary movie it's supposed to be.
5.0~Not sure what the fuss is about shequk Sign in Permalink Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that. Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this. Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same.
6.0~Silly fivesticks Sign in Permalink Surprisingly weak effort by Nolan, who typically always nails his movies. The premises and outcomes all seem too silly and it is quite simply too long. Matthew McConaughey is miscast and often plays it quite melodramatic, especially early. I read one professional critic who wrote that he was the perfect "stoner-cowboy" type to play the role. Really?! He's not the actor I'd choose to be the smartest engineer-pilot to save the human race with his brains. And (SPOILER) Matt Damon is a throwaway. Someone should have told him that was a sleeping pod, not an eating pod. Clearly, Nolan is fascinated with time-travel, but this is a weak effort compared to Inception and Memento. He's a good enough Director that it's still watchable, but it all feels so silly.
7.0~Entertaining nonsense, but no masterpiece Deathstryke Sign in Permalink "Interstellar" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuarón's audio-visual roller coaster, "Gravity", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle. For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE. Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch. We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole. Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience. Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it. Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value.
6.0~Beautifully crafted movie that tries to hard to be smart and looks stupid doing so Bohemian81 Sign in Permalink If the underlying logic is missing, the story overly simplistic and weak, then spending 160 million on production isn't going to make it a great movie. The potential is huge but the end result feels lacking. This may well could have been a real masterpiece with a bit more thoughtfulness and work. It has some interesting science wrapped around a meager plot. It may well have sky high ambitions, very good production value, actors and cgi but the underlying script is just very weak. It lacks even the most basic logic. How this can be considered as intelligent and philosophical is beyond me. The science is heavily dumbed-down and simplified, presumably to appeal to a wide audience. The overall script is extremely simplistic. The philosophical aspect shallow and empty. The whole is wrapped into a fantastic presentation but ultimately a hollow experience. Matt Damon gives his worst performance to date (blame the script). Anne Hathaway looks lost the entire time and completely out of place. Matthew Mcconaughey flies the spacecraft like hes doing arcade games, the only thing missing is the occasional 'yeahaaaa!' like a cowboy. I applaud the ambition but overall it's a mess. A mess with silver linings. BUT STILL WORTH THE WATCH.
5.0~My Personal Experience of Interstellar politehere Sign in Permalink Sometimes I wonder if swimming against the tide is the right thing to do, but with this movie I am not going to hesitate in giving it a low score despite all the raving 10/10 reviews. I'll just share my personal experience with you. First off, I didn't really like the characters and my biggest problem was with the lead character. I was hoping to see Tom Cruise, because I had gotten accustomed to seeing him in two of the best sci-fi movies, i.e. Oblivion and The Edge of Tomorrow. Simply put, the lead character didn't have the looks. The country side scenes the movie began with bored me to tears. It's not a good idea to start a movie with boring country life. Most sci-fi films go well with a New York City than with a country side setting. I couldn't really connect with or care about the main characters, much less with the much discussed "humanity" for that matter. Their performances were wooden at best. Also, Since English is a foreign language to me, I had an extremely hard time understanding what was being said. The characters were mumbling all the time and their voices were muffled by the ponderous music. The music score was terrible, unemotional and gave me a headache. I got the main dialogs though. I was literally dozing off throughout the movie. Three hours is simply not an appropriate length of time for a movie, because thanks to the technology, most people have a short attention span and quickly lose interest. What I found remarkable in Interstellar were the scenes that effectively captured the negligibility of mankind when compared to the entire universe or the seemingly endless surface of a planet. Scenes like showing a spaceship float in an endless ocean or them arguing with each other on the surface of a frozen planet were grand. In spite of this, while such scenes were jaw-dropping, they were soulless and uninteresting. Now I know making those scenes is technically difficult, but I've gotten so used to seeing more remarkable, complex and colorful special effects in Marvel superhero movies (Transformers, Iron Man, Spiderman, The Avengers, etc.) that the masterful special effects in Interstellar simply didn't deliver, and I'm saying this as an average sci-fi fan and not as a CGI expert. The plot rather kept my attention up until they said who had made the three-dimensional space, which was simply unbelievable and took the movie to the realm of nonsense. Had they said it was designed by the Ancient Roman Gods it would have been more believable than this lousy explanation. They should have stopped at "a higher being we cannot understand" or a simple "we do not know if it was even designed and was not simply a working of the natural laws of physics". Not to mention the ludicrous idea that the whole "intelligent design" to save the mankind revolves around a kid's bedroom. The movie had an emotional ending, which I liked and I think it was its strong side, but it failed to make me all emotional like Titanic. I'm fascinated by such things as wormholes, space-time, etc. and I tend to read a lot about such things and thus I expected much more from a movie that dealt with my favorite subject than just trying to explain to me what a wormhole does using a piece of paper, which instead of making me feel smart, made me feel dumb and insulted, because anyone who goes to see Interstellar should already be familiar with at least the "basics". What happened inside the wormhole could have been depicted in a far more imaginative way than just spiraling dust, which made it look like a cheap sci-fi flick. If the movie had a better editing and inessential parts were cut out I would've given it a higher score. If there's anything Interstellar excels at it's taking boredom to a whole new level. I give it 5/10.
1.0~Absurd neigenoirejz Sign in Permalink I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. Especially after having read so many positive reviews. The portrayal of physics and astronomy here is so pseudo-scientific and so preposterous that I found myself constantly sighing or scratching my head all throughout the movie. I don't have a degree in astronomy or any other science field for that matter but the scientific freedoms that this movie takes are so incredibly blatant and obvious that even I found myself bothered by them. Even for a sci-fi it's far too liberal in this regard. But that's not the only problem with this movie. The characters are paper-thin... and the way events unfold is often irrational or portrayed in a very contrived manner. For example, an Ex Nasa pilot stumbles upon a secret NASA base (which he found by interpreting strange dust formations into binary code which he then somehow immediately knew were map coordinates - makes so much sense, huh?) where he is immediately offered to pilot their only rocket which is to save mankind and is to launch the FOLLOWING day, because all their pilots are inexperienced and have only flown in simulators, whereas the protagonist has flown before, MANY YEARS back, and only BARELY leaving the atmosphere. But that's fine, they're sure he can manage an intergalactic journey, involving many years of travel, deep-space hibernation, traveling through a wormhole and finding a new world to save mankind. No need for any training or a medical check of course, surely he'll be just fine, he just needs to show up tomorrow for the launch. Incredibly, when our hero performs the greatest feat of space exploration ever - traveling through a wormhole, he and his crew-mates just play it cool, the feat is given no more significance than a casual stroll through a park. There are quite a few other examples too where the plot is painfully contrived and makes the whole movie difficult to take with even a bit of seriousness. Another thing that completely broke the immersion was the very unscientific language that was used all throughput the movie. A movie that was supposed to be about space exploration and science... You'd have to be mentally challenged to actually believe that this insultingly simplistic chit-chat resembles anything close to actual scientific language that high level NASA scientists, professors and engineers would use. This is nothing short of an insult to our intelligence... I'll end by saying I really fail to comprehend how people claim this to be the best sci-fi movie ever... It seems to me that we're stooping lower and lower in our expectations of what makes a film great. It's almost a standard now to expect a movie to be bad when reviews are surprisingly positive.
10.0~A lot to decode about the true meaning of this film, in the purest Kubrick tradition idobrinescu-1 Sign in Permalink Guys, I just came back from the absolute premiere of INTERSTELLAR in Bucharest. This is a film which was made to endure time, and TIME is the special treat of this movie. No hi-tech gadgets, no 3D effects, no crazy action. Just solid acting, revolutionary imaginary landscapes and pioneering theoretical physics ideas, under the clear guidance of Kip Thorne. Do not miss to see it ASAP and to buy Kip Thorne's companion book released at the same time (http://www.amazon.com/Science- Interstellar-Kip-Thorne/dp/0393351378/). Keep in mind that there is a lot to decode about the true meaning of this film, in the purest Kubrick tradition.
1.0~Science Violated sakrithart-3 Sign in Permalink I went to this movie based on all the good reviews I read. I thought it would be an intelligent scenario making use of some scientific theories like Relativity, Theory of Everything, Time dilation, Gravity Waves, Black Holes, Worm Hole etc. Was I let down beyond ridiculous ! So the world's population is on the brink of extinction due to climate change and some kind of fungus is destroying all the crops and lack of water turned everything into dust. And we get to meet this farmer (Matthew McConaughey) who used to be a very successful Astronaut / Pilot who crashed his aircraft so he decided to become a farmer to raise corn instead. Good choice because the world needs more farmers than NASA pilots. And he gets called in to Parents- Teachers meeting to discuss his children's future and the teacher says "We faked the moon landing to bankrupt the Russians" and the books will need to be updated to reflect this ! Good ammunition for all the loonies who still believe this crap ! They tell the father their children should study agriculture because the world needs more of them. Of course our sensible father wants his children to become scientists and wont tell his children what the teacher said. On the way home they encounter a drone and the father has in his truck all the gear (a laptop !) necessary to take control of the drone while plowing his truck in three feet high corn crop. This was only the beginning of the ridiculousness that followed. Somehow his daughter who is brilliant, is getting some messages with the arrangement of the books in the library. She says it's like a bar code of binary information. During a dust storm they see the dust arranged such a way to give a message to the father. This advanced civilization does not have any other means to communicate but has control of gravity!. So the father gets the message which are coordinates and drives his truck to the location which turns out to be NASA operating underground because Government does not want to spend money on NASA while the world is starving. Yet they have this huge rocket built by whatever funds they acquired waiting to be sent to a worm hole conveniently waiting around Saturn for them to go through...They already sent scientists across the universe to some other galaxy and getting back some messages but only limited success. So they need someone to pilot their rocket because they only had pilots with simulator experience. Of course our hero pilot who crashed his last mission is the perfect match for this job. His job is to figure out which planet is suitable for life and come back to tell the people of the world to pack up and move to another Galaxy ! Oh yeah they can also communicate via video messages across light years of space..(Thank you Nolan for solving the biggest problem we have:Ultimate Speed of Light) *Spoilers ahead* I wont go into all the inconsistencies like going through a black hole (and surviving intact !) ending up back on Earth years before (!) he left, in his daughter's room behind a library where he can push and arrange the books but can't talk to her. Apparently he is in another dimension built by some super advanced civilization (who are actually us !). The only way to communicate with her is through time by moving the dials of a watch and gives her the solution to Theory of Everything, reconciling Quantum Theory with General Relativity ! So the daughter yells Eureka and all the problems of humanity are solved. And, somehow he comes back to Earth crashing his craft and wakes up in the future, on a space station where all the people of Earth live now. But since the people of the Earth has aged more than him according to Einstein's Relativity, his daughter is now in death bed and tells him to go rescue Brand (Anne Hathaway) who is now in another galaxy waiting patiently... I still don't get why people give 10 stars to this movie. 2001:A Space Odyssey made in the 60's was light years beyond this movie in scenario and scientific and technological accurateness.
5.0~Interstellar is not Stellar platomd Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a movie that never gets off the ground. Based on a script that wanders from end to end attempts to comprehend its plot and themes are very difficult for the viewer. Heavily weighted with Academy Award winners including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Ellen Burstyn they are never able to surmount this poorly written script. From the beginning it was obvious many elements of Interstellar were lifted from other films. These included 2001 a Space Odyssey and Enemy Mine. Promising not to giveaway details Muppets in Space was more enjoyable. Interstellar starts in a backwater town and ends on a planet 2nd rate planet. With a running time of 2 hours and 49 minutes schedule yourself at least one break. Why? Because you will be staring at your watch constantly hoping the film would tear. I rated his movie 5 out of 10 which I believe was generous. Mark Davis MD
10.0~One of the best Sci-Fi movie at the moment obrazcoff Sign in Permalink Expect very much from the cast and director. And all expectations fulfilled. The film is almost 3 hours, but they are not feeling. Time flies by. No slack in the story-line. Everywhere where there might be desired drool, snot or lengthy disquisitions - all collected in a couple of phrases and capacious video sequences. Nor any stupid nonsense about the Bible and God. It's Sci-Fi, baby! After viewing the impression left is not even like the movie, and how soundly from the book that you read with pleasure. Lots of thoughts left to think. The film, like a good book revealed to you something new, along with the author allowed to dive into his world. World, so close to ours. Very suggest targeting the film for viewing. Even if you do not like everything in the movie, you will get acquainted with one of the best representatives of the genre on today date.
4.0~Life changing... to the downside CHedgWV Sign in Permalink This film was so far up its own arse that I started to smell it. Turns out sometime over the course of its 2h 49m runtime I had just s***myself.. .. It was Valentine 's Day 2016. In a fit of romanticism my girlfriend and I dragged the bedding and mattress into the living room, constructed a pillow fort, ordered a curry from the local Indian restaurant, and began to watch the film. The rest is rather hazy as the movie ground on in self indulgent earnest, fluttering from fairly interesting survival intergalactic space story to existential gravity communication time loop buggery. In what I assume was my bodies attempt to expel the drivel being poured into my sensory sense holes I s**** myself. All in all a good metaphor for Nolans attempt at Spielberg esque grandeur.
1.0~Pure Pain Yggort Sign in Permalink Save yourself from this abomination of cinema. This movie not only expects you to suspend disbelief, but to put on hold every brain cell function for its entirety. Somehow they have blended the slow southern hick style with a ridiculous space story and spread it painfully over the course of nearly 3 hours. I did not make through even half for fear of becoming violently depressed. The plot treats you like a moron. If every hour in that wormhole is 7 years back on earth then this movie felt like an eternity in hell. Matthew should stick to comedy. There is mountain of further problems with the acting and pace, but I've already wasted enough time watching this cinematic cyanide pill.
2.0~Pretentious mess with nice visuals jorged-1 Sign in Permalink I loved most of Nolan's films. Memento, The Dark Knight are among the best movies I've watched. Sadly I can't say the same about Insterstellar. I can't understand what happened with Nolan on this movie. The plot is a complete mess, filled with arbitrary nonsense they dare call science. It spends time explaining what a wormhole is and then it throws in some metaphysical bs about the fifth dimension which does not make any sense. This is not a sci-fi film it is a fantasy movie. The visuals are the only redeeming quality this movie has. But however great they are, they cannot save this mess of a movie. Weak, forced acting with dull dialogue makes this one of the weakest movies I've seen this year.
3.0~what a mess. kjpg Sign in Permalink I heard Nolan answer a question about authenticity of the scientific basis of the movie. He 'fessed to changing things up but then said — and I agree with him — that audiences are OK with IF the movie is consistent within itself. Unfortunately, Interstellar is far from consistent. How the black hole is treated in completely nonsensical. Light doesn't escape but he and his ship, nor the bot, are stretched out into spaghetti by the gravity. Said hole is at first a safe enough distance away from the ice planet to not be a factor, but is then close enough to 'capture' their ship in it's vortex. Why oh why did the super-evolved humans (huh?, in and of itself) put that wormhole way out in the 'burbs and then leave a riddle within a black hole on the other side of it if their intention was to save humanity. Couldn't they have been just a little bit more direct, if they can alter gravity on the micro, high resolution level. Come to think of it, if the point of the black hole was simply to house the library thing, why wasn't that simply out in plain view? Seems a lot more sensible than having to conjure up the circumstances whereby someone would think that ENTERING AND SURVIVING A BLACK HOLE WAS POSSIBLE, LET ALONE A GOOD IDEA?!? And wasn't that actually a worm-hole, since he was looking in on the room? why did the other one require an acid trip of a tunnel to get to the other side? Why oh why is their only A SINGLE PERSON (caine) on earth working on that gravity equation? Oh, and then McConaughy's daughter, after 40+ years, which makes two. No MRIs and they whip up that space-ship (presumably one of many) in a few years. And suddenly have all that high-tech medicine, despite the lack of tomography. And cryogenics? And why are they tooling around Saturn 100 years after getting mcconaughy's message, instead going through the worm-hole to salvation, or even sending anyone else to help out Lonesome Anne? Matt Damon and McConnaughy wander off ON FOOT on the glacier and yet it takes comparatively ages for the ship to JJET TO THEIR LOCATION. they must have been fit dudes to accomplish that distance on foot on that terrain. Infuriating. The best thing was the 'music', more accurately awesome, polyphonic blasts (I mean that in a good way). I know it made it hard to hear some of the dialog, but that wasn't such a bad thing.
3.0~If time travel were possible I would go back and not watch this film iamchrisallan Sign in Permalink I came out of the film thinking it wasn't bad but it just wasn't good either. After 24 hours of mulling it over it's dropped further in my estimation. Initially I just thought that if he had presented the same stuff in 1hr 49mins instead of 2hrs 49mins it would have been good but having had time to reflect, even that would not save it. I know that there is no sound in space but those moments of silence were really odd especially during explosions. It dulled all the excitement. The film was hugely lacking in suspense or tension. There are so many things wrong with the film and they are all topped off with the cheese-ball ending. Spoilers! Here are some of the irksome plot holes. Her dad is the "ghost" in the bookshelf who leaves her a message. The message that he doesn't leave is "It's me, your Dad" If our future selves can transport Cooper through time and space why not put him in the bedroom and not in the book case. Why leave a message in binary or morse, why not just write it in the dust with the gravity? Why did Cooper take notice of the co-ordinates but not the message that said "Stay"? Matt Damon was trying to describe how desperate he was to see fellow humans but no one gave a thought for the astronaut still on the main ship for 23 years. If you had secretly built a rocket that was mankind's last hope why would you ask a farmer, an ex-pilot to fly it at a few days notice? What the hell was Michael Caine rambling about in his death scene? What was he lying about and why the hell didn't our future selves communicate with him instead of a teenage girl? Blackboard mathematics? Really? Do mathematicians still write on blackboards? I suspect they have something slightly more sophisticated. I have seen the Big Bang Theory and even Sheldon Cooper uses a whiteboard and dry wipe pens. When Cooper disengages his craft and falls into the black hole so Brand can follow her heart it was so reminiscent of Bruce Willis staying behind in Armageddon that I wanted to barf. Not really a plot whole, just a reminder of more space hero cheese. The biggest goof of all for me was the ending. His aged daughter tells him to go after Brand. Now, hang on a minute, didn't he set Brand on her way to find her lover Edmund? Did I miss something? Did people find out that Edmund was a gonner? I don't think so. That means Cooper is potentially on his way to be the biggest gooseberry in history (or in the future) ever? Imagine that, Brand and her lover Edmund all set to be the new Adam and Eve when Cooper flies in all ready to procreate. I must have missed a key plot point. Had they fallen in love on the mission but there hadn't been time to cover it in 2hrs 49 mins? My final comment: I liked the robots.
3.0~Movie = Good ...... Music = Poor/Overpowering! stuo5353-692-129025 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed the basics of this movie although it does have lots of areas that you could pull to pieces, but in saying that I would probably have given it a 9/10 as it did keep me interested until the end..... HOWEVER>>>>>> What caused me to mark it down to a 6 was the awful music!!! to say that it was loud is not really accurate, it is OVERPOWERING! In some parts you struggle to hear the dialogue it was that bad. I find it very disappointing when a director resorts to using this type of cheap trick(the loudness) to crank up the tension, when honestly the action, the acting and the plot coupled with the excellent CGI would have been enough, for me it had the opposite effect, it actually caused me to lose interest as the movie went on because of the annoyance factor. I should have heeded the warning as this director used the same trick, to a lesser degree on Gravity, which I thought again used loud music/sound when it wasn't necessary. Sadly, I will not watch this movie again because of the sound, but if it is re-scored or even reissued without the music, then I will definitely watch it again. As with everything, you should make your own mind up and decide what you think.
1.0~One of the most ludicrous films ever made tom-seddon-14-855281 Sign in Permalink Truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made. Virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis. The film depends upon multiple concepts regarding space-time and space travel, most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story .... BUT ... each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief. The series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another, just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption. So what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be "resolved" by yet another, even more ludicrous outcome. This causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses. Note that the suspension of belief is, of course, fundamental to many films - in Star Trek for example, one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible - or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable, as in Inception - and that's AOK because the rest of the action is consistent. However, the number of presumptions you have swallow in Interstellar, that have no basis in science fiction or reality, strains credulity way past breaking point. One at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable. Notwithstanding these comments, the individual elements are each highly watchable and Nolan does his usual blinding (literally in couple of the shots) best. The environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking. However, watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas, concepts, half-theories, impossibilities, broken linkages and downright wrongness, that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale. The disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational, and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent "reality" .... but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy ... Possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds - where the original one-line film-pitch made to the money-boys gets played-out ... but it's probably too little, too late
1.0~there are many mistakes user-160-476578 Sign in Permalink i don't know why the planet staying near at the black hole would not be absorbed by the black hole. and i don't understand why the black hole can flash. i means though some energy can escape from the black hole. but the visible light does not have the enough energy i guest. there are other very obvious mistakes. Haha. it is said that the hero gets in the 5D space. let us make an example. in 1D world the ant would be blocked by a spot. however, when the ant get into the 2D world, the spot would not be the block anymore, which means the block in lower dimension would not be the block anymore in a higher dimension. thus, if the hero gets in the 4D world, i don't think he would be block in the black hole. and he gets in the 5D world~~~~ haha...
5.0~Just don't waste your money realfas Sign in Permalink How to say it...? Pretentious sci-fi movie turned into easy-tear film. No script coherence, no science coherence and not even fiction coherence. How can anyone rate 10 points this film? How many points do they rate Blade Runner? A thousand? And it lasts for almost 3 hours. Really? Do you need 3 hours to tell this cheesy story? I can't believe that the same people that wrote Memento could write this script. So, Don't waste your money, watch any other movie instead.
3.0~An overrated Hollywood film tatsii Sign in Permalink I had heard so many positive reviews from my friends and acquaintances, that I just had to go to see this film. Like many others, I enjoyed Nolan's previous movies. The new Batman trilogy was very much welcomed and Inception was enjoyable entertainment. Nolan has been one of the few directors in Hollywood who have some kind of own voice as a director. Such a shame that Interstellar flops completely (well - I mean artistically, maybe not commercially). There was no dynamics in the movie, the movie didn't "breath" at all. The audio-visual experience just made all senses numb. The volume of the audio track was too loud, it had too much stuff going on all the time (or at least for the last two hours). When you add that to the space visualizations, the dramatic moments, spaceships exploding... I know the conventions of a Hollywood flick, but for this movie it was too much, the movie was too hectic and the viewer didn't have enough time to think about the philosophical side of things or to examine the characters more deeply. Worst thing was that there were different kind of long tensions being built all the time. There were a lot of subjects dealing with what makes us human, what is important in life, what is our role in the universe and what is our relationship to other possible forms of life out there. The movie didn't really challenge me to think about anything revealing, though. Actually the movie felt like being quite pseudo philosophical, maybe because it didn't give time for the audience to think a lot during the movie. Maybe I could find something noteworthy under the surface next time (if there ever will be a next time). The big picture was kind of scattered. The plot went to new directions all the time, you couldn't grab any emotion or moment. Still, I feel that you could have made this movie much shorter. The almost three hour length didn't bring any extra value to the plot or atmosphere. Honestly, I still don't exactly know what happened in the end, what the conclusion in the movie was. I haven't seen too many science fiction -movies, but I know there are lot of great classics out there. Interstellar was nothing compared to 2001: Space Odyssey (from which it had loaned a bit), for instance. That's why it's unbelievable that Interstellar has such a high rating in IMDb.com (8,9 at this moment). Anyways, for me Interstellar didn't do much. The movie just kind of pointed out the bad state Hollywood cinema is in - artistically speaking, that is.
6.0~space time in an original package vincent-malisse Sign in Permalink Interstellar had some very interesting topics, for one that we're ruining our planet. It's probably the closest thing to reality in the entire movie, but it's worth taking at least that message. Interstellar reminded me of the grandeur shots of 2001: A Space Odyssey, music included. The power chords blew through the speakers in the cinema was quite deafening. But I can only say the cinematographically speaking, the movie is excellent. The only thing I miss here is some overview shot of the solar (or black hole) system they've entered, yet they make it up by at least letting you see a (limited) view of the planets they visit. Which brings me to the next topic, because if they would have spent less time on useless discussion, plot lines and just plane slow story development and more into the outline of the galaxy, the movie would probably by far better. Yes, the slow story is very, very annoying and I frequently had the feeling: "move along already!" The relativity of time was nicely put into view though I have question marks about some presentations of it. Eg. If I was a scientist I would visit the planet closest to the black hole as last. Since they lose years by the minute the consequences of something going wrong is far too high. The other two scientists could die, humanity could have been extinct, ... I also wander if the scientist on board of the Endurance would have kept his sanity during the long waiting time. Also they were pretty close to the remaining scientists and could have sent signals to keep contact. When they slingshot by the black hole Gargantua Cooper falls into the black hole and this is were I found the movie totally going off. Even if he would survive until he reached the event horizon from that point his body would literally be ripped apart. When he reaches the library I a had feeling of utter annoyance of how the story was developing. I must admit it was clever of the director on how they pass back and forth through time and how Cooper showed his daughter what to do, but the nagging annoying feeling didn't leave me and even came back when Cooper woke up on the space station that appears to be close to Saturn and which didn't make sense to me. Earth was seriously lacking resources so how were they able to create such a flourishing space station at that point in space and in less then 100 years (Cooper's daughter is about to die, so even if she reached a very old age, the time span between him leaving and the building of the space station is less than 10 decades.) An uplifting from other space movies must have been TARS and CASE. Not only have they got an original design, but I was silently expecting one of them to crash or behave erratically like in 2001: A Space Odyssey or Alien and that didn't happen. All in all Interstellar is not a bad movie, be it annoyingly slow at times.
3.0~Sunshine II - Less Than Stellar Cinevile Sign in Permalink Before I begin, let me remind you of a really good sci-fi movie from not so long ago, called Sunshine. The story is as follows: Humanity is on the brink of extinction because of natural causes. A team is sent into space on a dangerous mission that could save humanity. Once in space, tensions arise. A member of a previous expedition tries to sabotage the efforts and kill one or more crew members. Eventually the mission is successful and humanity is saved. Now onto Interstellar. Here is a quick summary: Humanity is on the brink of extinction because of natural causes. A team is sent into space on a dangerous mission that could save humanity. Once in space, tensions arise. A member of a previous expedition tries to sabotage the efforts and kill one or more crew members. Eventually the mission is successful and humanity is saved. I give it a three, because to convince anyone that this movie is anything other than a complete rip-off and repackage job requires great skill. Thank you Chris Nolan for teaching a whole new generation of endangered humans that some ways of getting rich are just plain cool. Like stealing. I expect, or rather hope, that I'm not the first to point this out. But there is simply no way I would survive reading hundreds of positive reviews. The gravity of it would crush me.
5.0~Not very stellar. OllieSuave-007 Sign in Permalink Matthew McConaughey stars as space traveler Cooper, who travels to space through a wormhole in an attempt to find a planet that will be fitting for humanity to survive, as it is predicted that Earth will be inhabitable due to disasters. This movie combines sci-fi adventures, fantasy elements and spiritual references, which make the plot pretty interesting. It also contains an all-star case including McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Topher Grace and Matt Damon. However, the slow plot momentum and lack of action rendered the movie pretty boring. I first watched this film on a plane ride and fell asleep on it. The visual effects were great, the acting was OK and the concept was pretty intriguing. However, the slow pacing really dragged the movie on. I may be the minority in the opinions, but I've seen more exciting sci-fi/adventures movies. Grade C-
1.0~Over-hyped to galactic proportions lexvbo Sign in Permalink Like most people i was completely blown away by this movie. Only not in a positive way. It has so many plot holes i lost count. It's almost like the script itself got distorted by the gravity of a black hole. At times it makes no sense whatsoever and it's just plain dull. I had to literally force myself to sit through this one. Indeed this is a thought-provoking experience like many people claim. I was left wondering during the entire movie how such a lousy script could be seen as acceptable. What i really don't get is that if you are making a "masterpiece", and have millions upon millions to spend, how hard can it actually be to hire someone to write a decent script. At the very least a cohesive one. This is typical Hollywood form over substance. People claiming how clever and deeply philosophical this movie is are talking out of their @ss. This has the depth of a piece of cardboard. Sure it has some nice CGI, interesting science, good actors and director but a turd is still a turd no matter how much money you spend on polishing it. (minor spoiler ahead) The theme: "Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space." Give me a break. That's so cheesy... If it's all about love then how come later in the movie Cooper is only focused on seeing his needy daughter again and completely forgets/ignores his own son. That is so wrong... (end spoiler) Even the stellar cast can't save this movie from being a complete mess. All the big names underperformed because of the ridiculous script. The best example is Anne Hathaway. She looks so lost and out of place it almost becomes comedy. The best performance by far is given by TARS (a robot!). The other actors mumble their lines even more robotic than him. The very least you could expect from a "masterpiece" is that it entertains. It fails even that. For me it was a 3 hour long excruciating, depressing and boring journey through space that in the end was completely pointless to begin with. The only thing i got from this experience was a sore bum...
10.0~One of the most tense and mesmerizing films ever made btamler Sign in Permalink I watched this movie a week ago as of this writing and purposefully have waited to write this review and not be biased. First of all the first thing that crossed my mind when I left the session was how much tense Interstellar was. It mesmerized me especially after the crew went to space and it never stopped until the film had ended. I was genuinely curious through the whole film of what was going to happen next. The action scenes were memorable. At times the silence, the pure silence, in some scenes was creepy and I felt that I was genuinely with the crew in the space. There have been a lot of criticism by people to this film because the answers that it gives are "simple" and "cheesy". When watching the trailers of Interstellar one of my greatest fears was that it was to dramatic in a negative way by some dialogues like "I'm coming back. When?". But after seeing the film I was satisfied with the answers that it gave me. In a way you have to be open minded to watch this after all the answers, although simple, are not conventional in anyway and this is, I think, the main reason why so much criticism. But I'm truly opened to accept that when we, as humans, don't know what happens at the first time we do something, the sentiment of fear dominates us. I truly recommend people to watch this movie called "Interstellar". For me it was a complete experience which I had not experienced before in the cinema. Maybe you will be troubled by some, or a lot, of the answers that the movie gives, but I think that the visuals on its own are a sufficient argument to see this. I recommend you to relax and not get worried trying to understand everything. It's difficult and maybe you'll get frustrated of how hard, at times, it gets. At the same time it is paradoxical how simple the end is. There are some things that people tend to agree both critics and lovers of Interstellar. For example, that the film is really ambitious. Personally I love when people try so much for something different and outside of the commonplace that we watch everyday and I liked very much those aspects of the films. There are some flaws of the film ? Probably, almost every film has it. Moreover, we, as humans, make a lot of mistakes most of the time. I also think that the aspect of error is being under-appreciated by some viewers. Even in the end you notice how hard and lost you are. But the brilliance, something that really captivated me, was the fact that for this complex problem a "simple" solution was given. How beautiful it is when you take a shortcut and resolve a problem in a way which ever be made before. Don't miss this. Love it or hate it, worth the time of watching in a big screen with the sound loud and tense. For me it was a true experience and I hope that you feel the same as me. Cheers.
6.0~Do not go gentle into that good night petra_ste Sign in Permalink When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction. The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all. The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar. Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems. See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf. Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter. At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act. When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here. 6,5/10
1.0~waste of time sumer1 Sign in Permalink In your lifetime you came across with flicks that you shouldn't have watched because they shouldn't have exist. you can look up awful movies about space and interstellar would be one of those titles with nothing to offer for a rational cinema viewer. it is flawed beyond belief. but you ignore it because it is a sci-fi film and allegedly doesn't need to correspond with scientific laws according to the popular opinion so you get a space ship escaping a blackhole, a physical phenomena where the light can't even escape but the characters shuttle out their way through one. so many flaws i would probably write about hours and hours long but the whole package is a empty shell of a film where it is worshipped by masses believing it is anything other than a bland, stupid, flashy flick.
3.0~Epic fail 101 keithbet Sign in Permalink Interstellar was not on my 'to watch list' as Nolan has impressed with just one title - Inception; which had a great cast and the flimsy plot was overshadowed by DiCaprios usually solid performance. Interstellar was a dismal failure. Yet again the Nolan bros try to 'Einstein' the plot with such annoying irregularities one eventually stops caring much and instead watch the CGI. Mat McC' and his Batman voice impersonation was annoying. Matt Damon and his brief appearance was out of place. The characters did not gel. Overly long and a ridiculously rushed ending, after an agonizing drip start to the film, that was far to intelligent for its own good. A +2 hour SNL skit by a pretentious director and scripted with a dose of equally pretentious sibling.
1.0~Highly overrated movie! tony-ucovic Sign in Permalink I'm just gonna say that I'm very disappointed. Went to cinema with high expectations after seeing 9.2 score here on IMDb and I after reading some of the reviews here as well. The realistic score would be somewhere around 7.0 and I am giving it 1 star just to bring current rating down as much as possible since the movie is highly overrated! Producers probably hired excellent PR team and those guys are doing a hell of a job to promote this movie! I'm big Sci-Fi genre fan but this movie has so many plot holes, underdeveloped characters, it's too long and for moments even boring. Visual effects? Poor comparing to Gravity or even Prometheus. Should you see this movie? If you are a big SCI-FI fun, I'd say yes, but set your expectations low and perhaps you find it worth seeing.
7.0~Good, but not great MJB784 Sign in Permalink Well, it did go on too long, but I enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. It dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. I also didn't think it had an ending. It kind of stopped.
1.0~Long laborious boring waste of time. dogonu-215-965738 Sign in Permalink This movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it. First off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days, with what I assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was. When a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a Ken Burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way. We have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and I say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be, unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of Morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe. The second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon, space and beyond. Anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked. The last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when Mathew Mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bed,only to chase him out of the room. Then there are the million questions that don't add up, there is no army any more, LOL like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had. Mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie, where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn, and where did NASA come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no US government to build all this crap? Its a known fact that the scientists at NASA built not a darn thing nor ever have, its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them. NASA does not so much as put one bolt in one hole. Micheal Cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning. Damn that Geritol is working good. This movies is flat and leaves you disgusted much like Contact. You will learn to swear after leaving if you don't know. It will only be loved by the geeks who love anything with a spaceship in it and don't care or understand content or plot, and by the hippie ECO nuts who want to use it to push the idea we have to ban oil and hummers. Do not waste your hard earned money on this loser.
3.0~Wow. Giallo1963 Sign in Permalink Just wow. Where do I start? Should I start with the tongue-in-cheek Scientific "accuracy" of this movie? Hans Zimmer's music and its often wrongly timed placement in the movie? The family melodrama? Or how about the fact it takes itself rather seriously or its lack of sense of humor? Let us first go through this: genre: science fiction, plot: save mankind, director: Christopher Nolan, writers: Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan, year of release: 2014, themes: humanity, pollution, despair, hope, love and extraterrestrial contact. Summary: Mankind is at the brink of extinction, therefor sends a team of astronauts to search and investigate whether Exoplanets are habitable or not. To show how tongue-in-cheek this movie is when it comes to Scientific accuracy, I am going to compare it to Dario Argento's "Phenomena". Like this movie, "Phenomena" used the science of its time to give its narrative thrust. There was for example the Patau Syndrome, used in "Phenomena" and then it used the theory from back then that insects can communicate through telepathy plus, giving the main character the ability to use telepathy to communicate with insects. Oh and the movie got a razor blade wielding chimpanzee. Also it uses insects to forward the plot since insects have been actually used in murder investigations and hey, the main character can communicate with insects! It is science and theory of its time. The Patau Syndrome can occur and it does occur, chimpanzees can use tools and it is scientifically proved chimpanzees kill too. Sounds unbelievable? Yes, it is very tongue-in-cheek. It requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. It is the same thing with "Interstellar". The extraterrestrials used their mystical powers to make sure Cooper gets to the Space station so he can go to outer Space? Plausible. Use the limited resources at hand to arrange an interstellar travel? Plausible. Travel through a Worm hole? Plausible. Enter a Black hole? Gah... More like impossible since the gravitational forces would likely shatter our hero to pieces. Enter a fourth dimension which aliens created to help us where past and future are happening at once? Now we've left any kind of logic! The Fourth dimension has been a subject of study for centuries but it is so far nothing but a concept and not an actual theory. Set a movie's plot with one or two plausible causes? Fine. But 4 or 5 plausible causes set right after another? Too much. Too much because it asks for a lot of suspension of disbelief and considering it is supposed to be scientifically accurate and believable it certainly does asks its audience to suspend a lot of disbelief. It is like watching a man tripping on his own legs and fall hard on the floor. How about the sentimentality of the Family melodrama? With its shallow characters it tries to be deep about its characters and the family's bond. "Love can save the whole Earth, even though we have polluted it to the point of no return, we shall use our Family love to get access to extraterrestrial technology and save Earth!" If that does not make you raise your brow and wrinkle your nose in disbelief, I don't know what does. Hans Zimmer's music cuts in between dialogues by the way, the director spends half the movie making the characters explain the movie to the audience and then Zimmer's music interrupts and makes the dialogues almost inaudible. Talking about a man tripping on his own feet again. Seriously, what is it with Christopher Nolan and his tendency to explain the obvious over and over again? Is he afraid the audience are too dumb to do some healthy mental reasoning? Oh, right. He himself admitted he is a pessimist. Seriously it is mind numbing. But the worst part is it takes itself rather seriously and have no self irony or sense of humor whatsoever. At least "Phenomena" itself knew it was a fantasy/horror, mixing elements of fairy tale with some strange tongue-in-cheek science, grisly murders and a sick sense of humor with a sense of self irony. Dario Argento also does not spend half his movies making the characters explain the movie to the audience. So I would say "Interstellar" is as scientifically accurate as "Phenomena" and Christopher Nolan is the opposite of Dario Argento. Which is ironic, since Nolan is a mainstream director cited as one of the greatest directors ever lived who is a pessimist. Argento, a controversial director who is often accused of being a misogynist who makes politically incorrect movies full of pessimism who in reality is an optimist since he believes his audience can do some reasoning to understand his movies. I choose Dario over Christopher, since Christopher in my opinion makes holier than thou movies and Dario makes movies with self irony. But I choose to be kind and give this movie 3 out of 10 instead of 1. Although I generally feel "Interstellar" is a hyped movie that is overrated.
6.0~A reach for the stars with lost potential The_Dude85 Sign in Permalink There is a lot I like about this movie. I love the overall themes of the end of mankind on this planet and trying to find a new "home". Everything you'd expect to work in a film of this budget does work: It looks awesome, the actors are good, the score is great etc. These things are what make this movie worthy of the prize to a ticket. While I give Nolan credit for taking on these huge themes, I don't think he quite delivers with this one. Of course with a movie like this there's gonna be plot holes and you could nitpick it to peaces and that can be enjoyable part of a movie too. The biggest problem with me was the human side of the story on the emotional elements. I do think Nolan did good job convincing us of how hight the stakes were on this mission. And I enjoyed the elements about the relevance of time and how years past in the earth while they've only experienced a couple of hours. The big human element of the story is the relationship with a father and a daughter and that just doesn't work well enough. It's almost laughable how long it takes for the daughter to forgive her dad for leaving her for the sake of mankind. Even though she works in the same facility that send her dad away in the first place. I guess it's dramatically better that she sends her first message to him when she's the same age he was when he left but it just doesn't make much sense. Also Brand's speech about love being an element that reaches over time and space is just laughable. You could do that with any other emotion and still have it make as much sense. I also found the emotional scenes to bee too manipulative. I just didn't feel for the characters as much as I should have. The scene with Cooper and old Murph was just stupid. They haven't seen in decades and have both experienced more than most people could imagine with huge emotional package. And they spend like two minutes talking to each other. And Coopers grand children and grand-grand children don't even talk to him even though he's supposed to be some kind of a legend. They just silently leave the room when he arrives. In general the movie was just overly chewed and explained. They should have left more stuff up to the interpretation of the viewer 2001's style. But I still don't regret seeing the film. It is quite an experience visually. And for that reason the stuff that doesn't work is such a shame.
7.0~Same in style and substance as Inception. twiggy120 Sign in Permalink In short; whatever your thoughts and feelings about Christopher Nolan's Inception will likely be the same for Interstellar. It relied on big ideas, very impressive CGI. A cast full of the best actors. A bit awkward in places and the plot had to be forced out of characters. Really, it was pleasant to watch a well made film. The story begins as the world is ending, blight is taking over the world's crops. Those that don't starve will later suffocate, as the film describes. The biggest selling point for me was the science behind the movie. Kip Thorne wrote the treatment to this film.He previously worked with Carl Sagan on Contact and is the Feynman professor of theoretical physicist at Caltech. If those names don't mean anything to you then know that that means the films is going to be featuring a lot of talk about General Relativity. Time dilation is going to be involved and as far as I am aware it hasn't been done very well in films before. It still hasn't, but it makes the awkward and forced plot fun to watch plot. I was sceptical about Matthew McConnaughey, he usually annoys me. He is accepting his maturity and has become a decent actor. I was very impressed with his work. The rest of the cast is full of talent but the weak script gave them no room for development, as is typical n a Nolan film. A few times they did get to go on a rant, they try to go deep and heavy, the meaning of love, survival, what time means. This never worked in he film. They are only human, maybe their musings were meant to be imperfect. When SCi-fi is at its best is when it debates these issues (hopefully in space). We only saw one side to each of them, a little monologue to stop the conversation and dramatically move on to the next scene. The CGI was beautiful, but all CGI reliant films end up looking out of date after a few years. The acting was perfect, but the script was weak. The science was exciting, but it was over exaggerated and had those awkward moments where one supposed expert has to oversimplify a concept while explaining to another supposed expert so the audience can understand what is going on. Best of all, there were no sounds in space!
6.0~Relativity slows down time in the movie till you get bored ! loyolite Sign in Permalink OK, I get it ! It's a Nolan movie so everyone hu-ha about it. Well actually no, I do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the message board. While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times. This movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama just doesn't ever stop. The movie is too long. Maybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90, it would have been great !
10.0~Combining ENTER THE VOID, THE LAST MIMSEY and .. GENESIS A_Different_Drummer Sign in Permalink Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood. With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours. This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content. How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears. The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title. This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda. I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on. BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going "super," or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.) The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool. Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours. Which is itself a strange contradiction. But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended. So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time. Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough. As I keep saying, a very strange movie. But a very powerful one *** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016**** Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I "got" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie.
1.0~Self indulgent twaddle cook-gareth Sign in Permalink I've actually tried to watch this twice, once in the cinema (I walked out, something I've never done before in a film) and once at home on video. Both times I failed to complete the mission. Please don't compare this stinking mess with Kubrick's epic "2001 - A Space Odyssey", it is not in the same league or even in the same universe! With horrible acting and mumbling by Mr. McConaughey, incomprehensible jargon and pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo overlaid with Zimmer's monstrously horrendous score I will not try watching it a third time.
10.0~No words alexanderbahchevanov1 Sign in Permalink As a sci-fi fan, who loves 2001 SO, Contact, Gravity and many other movies that deal with with the topics also covered in Interstellar, I have to say, I have no words to describe the movie. It just took me for one hell of a ride! The score provided by Hans Zimmer was an extraordinary piece of work. It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around. There is an interview with Christopher Nolan, in which he states that he wouldn't allow Hans Zimmer to know exactly what the movie's plot device is, he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between father and daughter. If this is the truth - WOW! it worked flawlessly! I won't go and describe what I saw on the big screen because this is something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for himself... I can only tell you that after I saw the credits, I attempted to get off my seat, it didn't worked. I tried again, pushing harder - it barely worked. Moments after I was at the theater's exit heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me, but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes. Then I realized that I have also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... I was still in the movie, I must definitely been, because only there the time behaved the way I was feeling while coming home...
3.0~What are you doing, Dave? Get back into the theatre, Dave. gonzoville Sign in Permalink Wow. After all the great ratings for this movie I actually expected this to be, you know, a good movie. How anyone who's seen "2001: A Space Odyssey" can give this four stars or more is absolutely beyond me. But the critics for some reason raved about this thing. The plot is that the Earth is running out of food and crops keep failing due to some kind of Nitrogen-loving blight. There are dust storms and things are looking bad. And then  somehow  a worm-hole in space opens up near Saturn by "them." Who ever "them" are. And, golly gee, there's habitable worlds on the other side of the wormhole. How convenient. So Michael Caine (who plays the chief NASA scientist) sends some spaceships through to check it out and the next step is to try to set up base to get the rest of the people through. Enter our hero, Matthew McConaughey. A former NASA pilot who now works on a farm. The first sign of trouble with this movie is the amount of attention spent on The Children. Children and Sci-Fi or action movies equals death. Sure enough, McConaughey spends what feels like a quarter of the movie whining about missing his kids and so on and so forth. It's Acting! And so they go through the wormhole and a bunch of stuff happens. I don't want to give the plot away, but see if some of this sounds familiar. The robots who help man the ship have warm, mellifluous voices. An astronaut travels through a tunnel of flashing lights. Said astronaut arrives in a strange room where he can see past and future. Oh  and the robots who help run the ship  they look like monoliths  articulated, walking monoliths. Then some of the technical stuff that goes on is just impossible to believe. The most bizarre is the thrilling docking scene when the mother ship is in an uncontrolled spin, and so the shuttle not only matches the spin, but then manages to dock with the hatch which runs down the central axis of the mother ship. But that's not the stupid part. The shuttle then uses it's engines to stop the spin of the much, much bigger mother ship to which it is connected by a long, slim docking boom. And none of the metal buckles or shears away. Some of the physics about how gravity can pass through worm holes and the time relativity shifts that occur simply by landing on a planet are a bit tough to swallow. The crap the film goes into about time travel is even harder to swallow. Note that "2001" also had similar elements, but Kubrick's genius was that he didn't try to explain what was going on. He let the viewer interpret it in whatever way it struck them. This movie insists on explaining everything – and it does so quite stupidly. Visually, this is a striking film. The scenes on the other planets are really well done. The dust- storm effects are also nicely done – it does really look like the documentary footage from The Dust Bowl. And the actual story is pretty decent  if only they did a good job telling it. And it's not like they didn't have time to tell the story. This film is almost three hours long. But they spend a lot of time on McConaughey emoting about not seeing his damn kids again – or giving soliloquies about the destiny of mankind (which sound an awful lot like those car commercials he just did). His accent and delivery work great when he's playing a lawyer  but it doesn't work for a dashing, daring space pilot. If your standards aren't too high, you don't want to actually think, and you want to see a good-looking sci-fi movie – and you have three stinking hours to kill – then you may as well see this movie. Otherwise don't waste your money. Wait for it to come to Netflix, and then wait for a night when you're having trouble getting to sleep to watch "Interstellar."
8.0~Keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better, and BETTER! frezeframe Sign in Permalink "Insomnia" is one of the top 200 films ever made. "Inception" is one of the top 100 films ever made. "Interstellar" is one of the top 25 films ever made. All of Nolan's films are great. But this is better. This is something else. Granted, Nolan's "The Dark Knight" is one of the top 10 comic book films ever made, but Interstellar takes Nolan's career to a level few have achieved. This film forever cements Christopher Nolan's place in cinema history as it will no doubt be one of the highest Academy Award nominated films in history (we shall see this upcoming March). I feel sorry for the film "Gravity." That film was so ground breaking in the Sci Fi/Space genre... but it only held the torch for less than a year. Interstellar blows Gravity away, like the '91 Bulls would have overpowered and embarrassed any class B college basketball team. Gravity is amateur hour compared to Interstellar- it's not even the same sport. Bold statements, I know but anyone reading this will eventually see the film, and you'll understand what I mean. Interstellar is truly a masterpiece for any generation and will be considered a pillar of achievement a century from now, much like Star Wars, Jaws, 2001 and Lord of the Rings are permanent pillars of cinema achievement. This is one of those films that changes the conversation. There has never been any movie like it, and there will never be another one like it- only imitators. Having said all that, do I really feel like Interstellar is a 10 out of 10? No, of course not. I'd say it's a 9.5. So for IMDb, that means 10. It's not the best film ever made, but it's in the same conversation as The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, E.T., T2, Avatar, 2001, etc. From this point forward, you can't have a conversation about ground breaking visual effects films, or ground breaking space dramas without mentioning Interstellar. It's that innovative. It's so innovative, in fact, that the slow start, cliché elements and improbable story set up have absolutely no effect on the film once it's over. That is rare my friends. That is a film worth seeing! Interstellar starts out slow and is overly sentimental as you'll read in a lot of reviews. You'll read that because it's true. Some of the dialog is off and the initial premise is not believable. Matthew McConaughey is one of our finest actors, but it's just not probable that an old NASA test pilot turned farmer would be seeked out by the now "secret" NASA who was looking for him but didn't know where to find him, and once he happens upon them by a supernatural premonition, they put him on a rocket ship a few days later with no exercise, conditioning, or up to date training. Oh and he only lives an hour drive away from NASA's secret facility. Usually a film with those kind of strikes in the first 20 minutes... you're heading for trouble. But Interstellar starts slow and keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better... until the entire audience's jaw is on the floor (To see what I mean, give a glance at the audience during the act 3 climax and you'll see something you don't see very often. Total immersion. And if you don't watch this in front of an audience on IMAX, you've missed the point.) By the time Act 2 begins, it's so powerful that none of Act 1 matters. Again, that is so rare. Only a master filmmaker can design a film in such a way. Act 3 is where cinema history is made. It wouldn't be proper to give any spoilers here, as this is a must see film. I will only say that Act 1 is good, but partially flawed... and Act 3 is so strong that it makes the plot holes of Act 1 totally irrelevant. That never happens. Don't miss Interstellar if you have a chance to see it on IMAX! But regardless of how you see it, or when; it's worth your time and money and you'll be hard pressed to find a better new movie, over the next few years- especially with the all time low quality of Hollywood blockbusters and special effects showcases. Few directors have a command of the craft of filmmaking like Christoper Nolan does. In fact, I don't think you could say there is anyone better than Christopher Nolan working right now. He may not have the body of work Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Fincher or Soderberg have... but in the sci fi genre, Nolan is currently the best filmmaker in the world. Or you could say he's second to only James Cameron. Interstellar is a gift to us all on the same level as Avatar. Enjoy!
1.0~That's not shinola you see thru that black hole, Grasshopper. sylvain-14 Sign in Permalink A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil. Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through. Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself. The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service). I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.) For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about "saving humanity" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have... But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar. The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, "It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears." Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness. The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so. In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started. Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of "who wants to be a millionaire?" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography. For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup. The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending. Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more.
1.0~the most over rated movie of all time iamthomasedison Sign in Permalink I love dramatic movies. I love Sci-Fi movies. I love most of Christopher Nolan's work. I was so excited to see interstellar after all the 10/10 reviews but after seeing it, I was thoroughly disappointed. My actual rating is probably 6/10, I rated 1/10 to balance the other ratings. !!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Here are my major problems with this movie: 1)Over dramatized effects throughout 2)Every character except for 3 of them was just a red-shirt with no characterization, just created to be killed off 3)The science aspect was stupid, especially in the second half 4)Did this highly developed 5D race have any way to save humans besides creating a room, that a guy would go to to tell himself to go there so that he could send binary through a watch to his daughter that is older than he is? 5)The ending was a thorough disappointment. Everything was happy dandy and the whole human race was saved just because of data from a black hole? They never explain why that data is even useful 6)Poorly designed and explained apocalypse. Earth didn't seem to be in much peril. 7)Okay, when Mann blew the airlock, couldn't the others just TELL him that it would blow up half the ship instead of saying "Don't do it, its not the right decision" 8)Really? The voice of corruption is called "Mann"? That was a stupid metaphor. 9)I don't think there was even enough water on Millers planet to make waves those big, seeing as it wasn't even knee deep. 10)Just wasn't what it was cracked up to be. The film was heavily lacking in character development and plot, the science aspect was unbelievable and stupid. Parts that I liked (No, it didn't ALL suck): 1)TARZ was pretty cool. He was unique compared to all other robots from sci-fi movies I've seen. 2)The highly dramatized parts would have been good in moderation, and there were some good special effects 3)I didn't fall asleep which is good I just can't believe so many people are raving over this movie. It's like they're too dumb to see past special effects and blaring music to see that the movie itself wasn't any good. People try to tell me the science in this movie could've made sense because it's not discovered yet. I think a planet with alien dinosaurs who speak English would have been more believable. It's worth seeing so you can realize how wrong everyone is, but don't expect too much.
1.0~Interstinker , A Space Odyssey paris_whitney_hilton_nyc Sign in Permalink This dreary , boring , depressing , and overly long sci-fi flick is about the dying Earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings . Unless you are Stephen Hawking or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or you possess a degree in quantum physics , thermodynamics , time warps , black holes and worm holes, you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with . To make matters worse, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best mumbler in Hollywood . I did not understand a single line that came out of his face !... Anyway, The Great Dust Bowl of the 1930's has returned to wreck havoc on the world, only this time it really means business . Matthew McConaughey , the world's greatest astronaut turned farmer , is chosen to be the Earth's savior . His interstellar space craft Endurance ,is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time . It is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions , collisions , and a gigantic tsunami wave 1,000 feet high . Anne Hathaway is the cryogenics expert . She looks a lot more convincing playing Catwoman than the Endurance's genius co astronaut . This movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an IQ of under 140 to comprehend . Interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours . I would recommend George Pal's 1951 sci-fi classic " When Worlds Collide " over this boring and lifeless piece of space junk . ... Not hot, PWH
10.0~Masterpiece. jjmulea2394 Sign in Permalink Let me take a moment to explain my connection to this incredible film. While getting my undergrad at Ohio State, I took a class dedicated in its entirety to Black Holes. This was in 2014, and the semester perfectly coincided with the release of this film. Although I've since gone on to enter the business world, this was my favorite class of my undergraduate tenure. I had the privilege to learn from a professor who was required to take a couple of weeks off to attend a summit in Chile, as he was one of the few people on the planet qualified to work on and analyze the Hubble telescope. We spent an entire week dissecting the metrics of the film's central black hole, Gargantuan; it's spin, mass, and charge. My textbook? Authored none other than Kip Thorne, who was also the Executive Producer of this film. Kip, as you'll see in the trivia section on IMDB, had the immense task to keep all aspects of this film within the grasp of our current theoretical realm. Although elements of this film fringe on the very edge of scientific theory, the overall scientific elements of it are sound, which is why I respected it so greatly. It is a perfect converging of Hollywood and Science. This film came at the perfect time for me, and capped my favorite educational course I have ever taken, albeit far from the professional path I would end up taking. Please dismiss the campy elements of the film, perhaps realizing they simply add "gravity" to the plot! One of my favorite movies of all time, if you have any interest in the deep recesses of space and the *truly* unknown (as humanity has no grasp of what surrounds the central plot of this film), I encourage you to watch, and rewatch, this cinematic adventure.
4.0~Not the epic it claims to be. Marc_parry Sign in Permalink It's a big film, a big achievement and by no means a bad film but I'm not quite sure what sort of film it is and that's where the problem lies for me. It has elements of all the things I like, at times it's a Hard (ish) Sci-Fi flick with a big budget, big production values and it's all weaved together with a heartfelt simple story of a relationship between a father and daughter, the problem is, in trying to be all of these things at once it manages to be none of them in a satisfactory manner. It's a strange three hours watching because it's a rather schizophrenic piece that constantly flirts with one style after another, never quite making a commitment to what it wants to be. I have have no qualm with films that break the traditional rules of structure or style if it works and I'm more than open to a big blockbuster prizing open peoples minds a bit (I loved the recent Horns that did exactly that with much success and a tiny budget to boot) but here it just didn't work for me because I felt every jerk of style and pace was simply used as padding to compensate for a lack of clear storytelling, it really felt like a bit of 'style of substance' imagery and/or dialogue was slotted in every time the audience started to struggle with the plot or got bored with the visuals. So what's the film about? (Don't worry you'll get no spoilers here) Essentially it pays homage to a lot of Sci-Fi gone by, most notably 2001 A Space Odyssey, big shoes to fill indeed! so is the partnership of Christopher Nolan and his brother as good as Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick?...err, no. It's quite simple, this isn't a film about spaceships or relativity, it's a story about a man's love for his daughter and his struggle to be a good dad. That's it, so why the need for all the space travel and science? Well I don't know to be honest, it dabbles with big questions about the meaning of life, the universe and everything but doesn't really touch them because the film isn't actually about the big picture, it's an intimate look at one family's relationships - so why then the constant nod towards showing the massive scope? I'm not sure, it certainly don't give any helpful perspective to the protagonist's plight. Visually this is no Gravity and most of the time the cinematography is well...dull, I saw it in IMAX and with hindsight there was no need because like I say the audience isn't being pushed outwards towards answering the big questions, it's being pulled in and constantly being asked to put the those big issues aside and look at things from a more delicate personal perspective of one man and how it affects his life. If you're expecting big beautiful futuristic images of technology and vistas of space then you'll be disappointed, it's a very low fi look (aside from the youngster pleasing Minecraft style robots which are admittedly rather cool) which may have been intentional to kind of dupe audiences into thinking it's a sincere, intelligent application of science but it's not. This isn't Hard Sci-Fi at all, in fact it's quite squishy and veritably slushy most of the time, Nolan happily puts his science text book down and picks up his copy of Mills and Boon whenever he feels the need to do so (a few moments have Titanic quality dialogue to them) so don't expect anything more believable than an episode of Doctor Who when it come to the science side of things, he just visually fills the screen with a lot of retro 70's looking dials and dirt, almost trying to make you think you're watching found footage of an old NASA launch which I can only assume is to make the more impressionable of the audience think they're seeing something very intelligent going on but sadly this isn't the case. There's no point in trying to make sense of anything and why should you, it's a Hollywood film after all and not a science lecture so just enjoy the (rather dull looking and slow) ride and don't ask questions! this would all be fine if I didn't constantly feel like Nolan was trying to dupe me into thinking that this was some form of profound masterpiece, why mis-sell the film? there's nothing wrong with a bit of 'by the numbers' schmaltz, I've no problem with that but why try to hide it? Hopefully you won't begin to put the jigsaw pieces together until after I did about what's actually happening but you'd have to be pretty slow not to cotton on until the obvious 'and now we explain it all quite vaguely' segment at the end that wouldn't be out of place in an episode of quantum leap. So what is this this film? It's not a big action flick, it's not a realistic piece of Hard Sci-Fi and it's too long and boring to be a relationship piece. It certainly has it's moments with plenty of time in the three hours to find them and it did actually bring me to tears a few times (The introduction of Matt Damon's cameo is just a momentary piece of exposition but it knocked me sideways) The performances are great throughout and the cinematography is well, adequate I guess, it was rather bland and pedestrian to my eye but maybe that's just me. As I say, I don't think it's a bad film at all, just not a memorable one, it's got no guts, no flair and when you take away the mammoth viewing time and ask yourself what the film was trying to say all you're left with is a nice little story about the power and meaning of love that's wrapped up and smothered by a rather silly and inept attempt at a highbrow Sci-Fi epic.
3.0~Good cinematography, very poor plot magesticllama Sign in Permalink Judging solely on cinematography, this movie is excellent. With shots ranging from side views of space craft to wide shots of alien landscape, this movie is well done through a filming perspective. But the plot is a completely different situation. (Please note this is more a list of my biggest complaints and not a complete summary, thus many of the arguments will be more rambling than cohesive due to lack of describing every signal plot point.) The first 30 minutes present the situation on Earth very well, and also presents the problem of relatively well about a hour in. But the largest problem in the beginning of the movie is the lack development of the brother. He seems almost bastardized than loved and can be seen as a large problem from the beginning of the movie. After the first hour the plot begins to break down. The characters have to decide which planet as to go to. Amelia begins the debate with reasonable facts and figures. Cooper then presents the idea that Mann was the strongest of the group and his data was promising. Amelia presents some flaws with the argument and then Cooper makes a personal attack by saying that she is in love with the man on the planet she wants to go to. Ultimately they choose to go to Mann's planet. This particular scene was poorly done because it showed two people, who were chosen for their level headiness and reasoning, resort to using the most irrational arguments that could be formulated to, arguably, make the most important decision of humanity. Dr. Mann is presented in the later half as a predictable antagonist who is presented as a weak coward, but some how was able to live isolated on a planet for many years without killing himself. Mann has little reason to betray his fellow astronauts other than to save himself, yet doesn't attempt to persuade the others to leave with him. After Mann is disposed off, Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) seems to have omnipotent ability to fly a ship by feel in space and be precisely accurate as to where he is going, and sends his fellow astronaut to a barren planet to save some portion of humanity. While on Earth, Cooper's son, who is not as loved as Cooper's daughter, becomes an incoherent lunatic that lacks any basic reasoning. The daughter needing to find some clue for the equation in her room, burns her brother's fields. Even though the daughter attempted to move the family out of the house and get to the room without violence, she burns the fields without attempting to reconcile. By far the largest problem of the movie is its deus ex machina, "the fifth dimension". The movie presents the fifth dimension as love, and makes blatant foreshadowing to this in first half of the movie at the beginning of the movie. In a movie that presents its self as intelligent and competent of science, then it would know to some degree that love is essentially a chemical in the brain. To change from a scientific view with unknowns about the universe to having love being a metaphysical object is absurd. It would have been better to present the human mind as the fifth dimension rather than one emotion. Through the use of the fifth dimension, Cooper enters a black hole transmit data back to his daughter through time and saves humanity. In essence, future Cooper sends past Cooper into the worm hole. All with the help of future humans that created the fifth dimension in the black hole. Thus the movie at the same time created a preposterous dimension and a time traveling paradox. The ending ultimately was lack luster, with an exception of Cooper meeting his daughter for the last time. Cooper is found by the colonization ships and then goes off to find his fellow astronaut. The movie is three hours, which is far too long for such a predictable and hole ridden plot. In total, for the price of one ticket you get pretty awesome visuals, occasionally good character development, and a horribly flawed plot.
10.0~A rare gem of a film . . . purrlgurrl Sign in Permalink A grand adventure into both the unknown and the human heart. Who expects to be moved to tears by a science fiction film? Well, I was deeply, and left the the theater dabbing my eyes. Don't let that scare you away because this is science fiction for the mature and intelligent. It does what the very best science fiction always does, it provokes you to contemplate what it means to be human. I won't try to synopsize the plot because I can't do it justice. Just know that Ann Hathaway's character expresses the film's theme in a moving speech about love's transcendence of the dimensions of time and space. It's hard to single anyone out in a cast where everyone is at the top of their game, but McConaughey is the heart and soul of the film along with Mackenzie Foy as his young daughter Murph. Hathaway proves here again she has a talent deeper than many of her roles have allowed her to display. I read one film critic's description of the film as being a not quite as good version of Kubrick's 2001 for his generation. But, I don't believe that 2001 has held up well over time, in large part because Kubrick's vision was so cold and sterile. Whereas, the Nolans share a vision with genuine heart at its core, which I think makes it the stronger film. Check it out for yourself and see what you think.
5.0~Just couldn't get engaged... edward-v-h Sign in Permalink My first ever review, and I won't get into the technical aspects of the film, but like so many others, I found the film to be a huge disappointment, especially when I had read some "expert" reviews giving it 4/4 stars. I got excited to watch it, but the first 45 Min's dragged on, and on, and on. I really liked Matthew McConaughey's acting in True Detective. But in this film, the acting was very poor. I put that down to the direction. The other characters really did nothing for me either. Again, I put that down to the direction. When Matthew McConaughey was talking, I was constantly straining to hear what he was saying. There were times I wished the film had subtitles. There were a lot of aspects to the film that were ridiculous. If you were going to come back via a black hole to tell yourself to stay, then why wouldn't you spell that out clearly? Instead of a bit of paper that just says "stay" why not give the reason as well? And as for the watch/Morse code/farce on the second hand? Give me a break. Just send a text message to cell phone using "the force". Pffft! The watch bit just lost it for me. That's when I knew this film was pure cheese. Anyhow, I guess some people like fluff in their movies. But there is no way that this comes close to any of the Sci-Fi classics like 2001 or Contact. I've seen Lost in Space TV episodes from the 60's that seemed to have more credibility. Interstellar? That does not compute!
3.0~I tried but it failed, boringly michaeleb1025 Sign in Permalink So much of this film is so mediocre on so many levels that even though my young film nut friends recommended it highly, I could not muster any enthusiasm for it. I had trouble just getting through it. Maybe it was the lack of originality. When you see lighting, camera setups and set pieces borrowed from other movies you could think homage, but this piece demands complete innovation. The acting was tedious. Maybe it was the casting of a big name Hollywood bore in the lead. Maybe it was because the music was so drab and ponderous. Hans Zimmer is over used but not particularly gifted. Maybe the visuals were OK, but I did notice a space ship or two that were a little too optically printed. This movie would have benefited greatly by being created exclusively in the digital realm. Christopher Nolan's pretentious use of dead pixel film grain make the image lose intensity at times. What made 2001 a marvel in its time (also the film that this film tries to elaborate on), was the extreme precision of its image. Stanley Kubrick used the then state of the art 70mm Super Panavision and the best lenses that he could borrow or steal. In this present era 8k imaging would have helped this film attain a much finer quality that would made its other faults almost bearable. If you want to see better "end of the world as we know it" films, there are a great number of them that are either ludicrously fun or serious and inventive. They are a pleasure to watch compared to this tedious mess of environmentalist propaganda. If Christopher Nolan wants to keep remaking other peoples films, great. I just don't think he deserves the bloated praise some people are giving him for his efforts. I love movies about science fiction, fantasy, outer space travel and special effects. I have enjoyed movies like Pacific Rim, Kickass, Star Trek and even Avatar with its bizarre messages. Call me a troll or a hater, but I was very disappointed with this thing.
1.0~Really folks? benjaminwolf45-714-323554 Sign in Permalink I may drop a few spoilers here, so be warned. I find it very hard to understand why so many people thought this movie was so good. Yes, there was a good cast. Yes, the special effects were good (in this day and age that is expected.) But the story? Teaching that space travel to the Moon was a hoax? What's that about? The farmer just happens to be a trained astronaut? His daughter just happens to be a mathematical genius? The lies that are told, and this intelligent astronaut is so gullible? The denigration of education, as if that is any positive way to save mankind? The striving by the government to have more farmers, when it has been obvious since the industrial revolution that larger mechanized farms utilizing fewer farmers are more productive. The belief that new colonies can be created by bringing embryos to life? Who thought this up? The same people who strive for an uneducated populace? And amid all this, somehow commuter space travel is developed? Too much Bull for me to swallow! Really folks?????
4.0~A potentially great film but..... g-hbe Sign in Permalink ...ruined by almost indecipherable speech, especially on the part of Cooper. We chose this film as it had received good reviews and we like a good science fiction film, but within the first ten minutes we knew we were in for a 'what did he say' -fest. The actor playing Cooper had such mumbled, lazy diction and spoke in a semi whisper it was almost impossible to understand anything he said. About an hour in we almost decided to give up and watch an old 60's Doris Day & Rock Hudson comedy instead - at least you can hear every word clear as a bell. But we struggled through all 2.5 hours of it and came out the other end none the wiser. Do they go somewhere to learn how to mangle their speech? Or maybe they have their jaws wired?
10.0~a rare 10 out of 10 for me facebook-999-887838 Sign in Permalink What an incredible film, a mesmerizing ride from minute 1 to minute 169. I couldn't believe when it ended that it was already finished; time appeared to go away quickly when watching this in the theater and remember when it ended, I wished there was more of this epic movie. Great directing, great performances, the effects/sets could have been better (I like my detail which unfortunately some scenes/effects lacked) and you got to take a big leap of faith to ignore the obvious paradox. If you do the latter, you will enjoy a Nolan's masterpiece. One of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best sci-fi I have ever watched.
6.0~Nolans 'not quite' 2001 richard-810 Sign in Permalink This movie has achieved a very high rating on IMDb and so I had a very high level of expectation before seeing it. My one concern was that I've found Nolan's recent work (particularly Inception) to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. I found Interstellar to suffer from the same faults. Very interesting ideas, great cinematography, solid cast (although I wish Matthew McConaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. He doesn't seem to have fully recovered from his role in True Detective and I couldn't understand what he was saying much of the time and I was not alone in this. A number of reviewers have used the word 'epic' to describe this movie. I'd be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. A friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from Earth to Saturn and when you see Interstellar, it feels like you're making the same trip! An exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. Not all bad news however - some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular, although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources - obviously 2001/ 2010 and Arthur C Clarkes story 'Rendezvous with Rama'. Definitely worth seeing but I don't share the 'masterpiece' line of some reviewers. Good but not great.
10.0~Glad i didn't watch the trailer christopher-stiedl Sign in Permalink Interstellar - Review Certain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me. Why you might ask? Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it. The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. . Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :).
10.0~Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece, one of the best films ever! jacob199812-6-985282 Sign in Permalink I went to watch this film, not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about. It started off well, although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space. This does not effect the film though or my rating one bit, as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary! The special effects in this film are awesome, and are used in a way which I was literally at the edge of my seat, in shear anticipation, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. Its very tense in many parts, and it certainly keeps you thinking. I don't know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star, or say 'disappointing', 'rubbish' 'stick to batman, Nolan'! These people don't know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad! Its a brilliant film, something suitable for all the family! Definitely a film for everyone, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!
10.0~Incredible movie. Must see. jeffdreyer-154-53194 Sign in Permalink This movie is incredible. The visual masterpiece that Christopher Nolan created is out of this world. It will make you think about our place in the universe. You will leave this movie wishing our society would place more value in NASA and space exploration in general. We are a tiny spec in an unfathomable universe. There is so much we have yet to learn, so much we don't know, but we have the intelligence and ingenuity to find the answers, to experience the marvels, to solve the mysteries. The movie makes you think about how myopic our society is. In this movie, the world is doomed due to a lack of enough food. As a result, society changes from adventurers, explorers, engineers and visionaries, to a society just worrying about the "dirt" beneath our feet. Be ready for some complex ideas and just enjoy the emotional ride in this amazing movie! The character plot is thick, the characters are developed. There are scenes where time is morphed, and that will make you think about yourself in that situation. Matthew M. does a great job as the lead role. Go see this movie. Go look up at the stars. Go wonder what life is. Go wonder what is out there.
5.0~An overly ambitious, underwhelming sprawl, salvaged by a few nice bits luke-a-mcgowan Sign in Permalink Interstellar represents Christopher Nolan exceeding his reach in his obsession with difficult, gamechanging films. What he achieved with Inception he has bungled here with a overlong narrative that alternates between confusing and lazy. At 2hrs 50, this movie goes on far too long, and I blame the film's ridiculous indulgence in unnecessary subplots. Who cares if Brand is in love with one of the missing scientists? Who cares if Cooper's grandson has a cough? None of it contributes to the film's main plot (which itself is hard to describe after all the nonsensical science jibber). No original screenplay should be as long as this film is. The script is very lazy in some sections - if something needs to be somewhere, or explode, or if a realisation needs to be had, it will happen, no matter whether it makes sense or not. At times, Nolan attempts to explain why it happened but his explanations often just muddy the waters. He indulges in far too many deus ex machina for one film, and the film's final act follows Edge of Tomorrow and Fury to be one of the sappiest and most predictable endings to ruin what was meant to be a sad moment. The acting is fairly good, though the tanned, drawling McConaughey is horrendously miscast as an intellectual astronaut (though he plays the loving father with far greater conviction). Michael Caine plays Michael Caine for the 6th Nolan film in a row, and despite being seen in scenes 23 years apart he looks exactly the same. At this point, Michael Caine needs to start demonstrating some range or be remembered as one of the weakest recipients of two Academy Awards in history. Matt Damon and Casey Affleck are very memorable in brief scenes, with well-defined and motivated characters. Anne Hathaway is the film's highlight, as the film's female lead, she is fully at home in a spacesuit and providing much of the film's emotion. Jessica Chastain and McKenzie Foy are both hauntingly effective as Murph, with Chastain in particular giving a very impressive and emotional turn. Soundwise, Interstellar plays one giant crescendo, but once your ears adjust its a rather nice score. Visually, I am disappointed to note that Interstellar brought absolutely nothing new to the table - everything they did had been done before or better in Inception, Gravity or even Apollo 13. The plants looked beautiful, but there is nothing groundbreaking about creating water or ice through CGI. The visuals of outer space were lazily constructed save for the black hole, which would have been forgivable if Gravity wasn't such a recent memory. However, at the end of the day there is something unshakeably beautiful or memorable about Interstellar, and that feeling is the only thing that keeps Interstellar in positive review territory. Ultimately, this film will become one of those "I'm glad I saw it, but I won't watch it again".
6.0~Not The Film I Expected By A Long Shot james1844 Sign in Permalink The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed "overkill" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion.
1.0~Every hour of that movie feels like seven years on earth cineastFGD Sign in Permalink OK, as a start I'm not a scientist, I don't know much about astrophysics or physics in general, so you can imagine if someone like me is disturbed by the scientific level of this movie, it might mean something. I don't know whether the farmers' association of Iowa sponsored the movie, but the starting point is that due to some mysterious circumstances, sand storms and droughts plague humanity. And of all possible crops, corn, one of the least drought resistant crops, is the one to survive? This is laughable. Also, the nitrogen level in the air increases mysteriously, although we never learn why and what might cause it. The only hint we get is that our appetite for electronic gadgets might have caused this situation. OK, right! Strange enough there is nothing scientists can do about it, or they all have given up hope and now believe in Ronald Reagan playing Neil Armstrong in 'Moonlanding II'. Except for a top-secret NASA project that seeks to find a new world humanity can destroy, and that can make space rockets start unnoticed by anybody in the middle of the US. This group is apparently so short on personnel that they immediately recruit a guy, who just accidentally stumbles into their headquarter, as an astronaut. The mere fact that he once used to be a pilot out matters all missing training that astronauts usually go through before going into space. Although the crew starts out on a pretty standard 20th century space rocket, they magically transfer into a hyper-modern long distance space ship, that somehow hangs around unmanned in earth's orbit. The newly recruited pilot - having worked as a farmer for years - neatly fits into the hyper-modern apparatus without the need of any training or upgrading - some people are just gifted and act on pure instinct. We are then explained the concept of a wormhole with a piece of paper, before we, after some turmoil - caused by primitive human sentiments, such as love and aggression -, somehow end up in a black hole. At this point, my patience was drawing thin and I only occasionally took a glimpse at the film. The hero-pilot/instinct-astronaut can enter the black hole unprotected and even get out of it unharmed. Inside the black hole - which strangely enough is not black at all, but resembles a kaleidoscope on LSD - he quickly solves the formula for gravity with the help of a fellow astronaut- who happened to be dead, before he reemerges as a friend of some mysterious 5-dimensional creatures (who, by the way, remain completely mysterious all over the film). The hero- pilot/instinct-astronaut then transmits the gravity formula to his daughter on earth via Morse code (heaven forbid, if you think how long it takes just to Morse S O S, then imagine to Morse the expression "Double integral from minus infinity to one hundred"). The genius daughter of the hero-astronaut immediately decodes the information by throwing paper sheets around and saves humanity by creating a 5 dimensional room in space (that looks pretty three dimensional) as a copy of the earth, except that there is grass on the sky (to give us an idea of the 5th dimension) ... well, if you have lost track by now don't worry, watching the movie will leave you equally puzzled. By NOT watching it, you'll save yourself the extended boring scenes of rocket wings that inflate this unedited masterpiece to nearly 3! hours, the emotional drama, and Anne Hathaway's monologue about Love, the misunderstood force that breaks all boundaries and overcomes all spaces, cringe worthy. All in all, most probably the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. Compared to the pseudo-science and illogic of this movie, the guys from Star Trek really appear quite believable.
2.0~interstellar don't bother alpbennett Sign in Permalink Well I have watched an awful lot of science fiction in my life and I thought Mr Nolan could do no wrong but this film is so boring a poor Twilight zone story dragged out for what seemed like an eternity most of the film was shots of space with dull music unconvincing acting from surprisingly good actors just poor on all levels pity really it had all the right ingredients for greatness I cannot state how disappointed I was with this film I am not an action junkie or set in my ways about space movies I love watching good films this one just isn't very good as an after thought why is the end so rushed when it rolls on so slowly up until then with questions left in the air ?
2.0~Too long, too pretentious, too far-fetch rogerdob Sign in Permalink The movie did not need to be almost three hours long...this was a great example of why it is a bad choice to let a director have the last say over edits, cuts, and length of a film. So many scenes could have been cut. The only interesting part of the film was when the characters finally made it to different planets. However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible. The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does. Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit.
10.0~The "Titanic" of sci fi, and the best of it's kind, period. sedativchunk Sign in Permalink I have seen Interstellar twice now. Once in IMAX on the big screen and now at home on blu ray in my home theater. Let me begin by saying I am a huge science fiction fanatic. I've watched everything over the years from the typical Star Trek and Star Wars films to the classics such as 2001, 2010, Forbidden Planet, the Terminator, both versions of the Day the Earth Stood Still, the "Alien" franchise and many more including old B list movies such as "The First Spaceship on Venus". So I know science fiction. Strong above all, I consider Interstellar the best science fiction film ever made, period. If not, one of the top 10 best films made in the history of cinema. Great acting, great storyline, great visuals, captivating soundtrack, and overall just a solid film. Interstellar is the pinnacle of great filmmaking. This movie is truly a masterpiece from beginning to end. It only gets better when you rewatch it a second time, and unlike some films that are just eye candy in the theatre, this film looks and sounds great from the comfort of your home. The space scenes are brilliantly done and the alien landscapes are truly captivating. I simply don't know how to put it into words. Matthew McConaughey blew this one out of the water and then some, as well as the rest of the cast. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job with this film. There is simply nothing I can think of to say badly about this film. Whether you like science fiction movies or not, you should not pass up on watching Interstellar. This film is an epic masterpiece. Anyone bashing the science aspects of the film, plot, or other details are simply hating on this film because it is so good. And that's coming from someone with a college background in science and astronomy outside of my love for science fiction. This movie is not scientifically accurate 100% of the time, but it is easily overlooked at the general quality of the film itself. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Whether you like space flicks or not, this is a fantastic movie inside and out. I would rate it higher than a 10 if I could.
10.0~A quick review about one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. sjoerdschelvis Sign in Permalink Does not contain spoilers, just some information about what the movie is about. I have just watched this movie, I am writing this review as it has been 2 hours since it finished. And I am still in some sort of trance because of Interstellar, my mind is blown. Interstellar starts off by showing a realistic possible future of human Kind on planet earth. It gives you an idea what people are going trough. As the movie progresses it becomes clear that humans try to find a way to survive by exploring the universe and exploring black holes. With this extremely dangerous and interesting voyage, Interstaller delivers many emotions: Humanity, Love, desperation. This all with an understanding of the universe (it sounds a little vague, I know) It's hard to put to words. The extreme complexity of the universe shown in this movie really, REALLY makes you think. Though maybe the complexity of this movie might be hard to understand, I believe it's what makes it so great. This movie is a Masterpiece I didn't watch any trailers beforehand, and I advice not to read any information about it. The given ratings and reviews on Interstellar should be enough reason to go watch it. I won't be talking any more about it, since I believe watching a movie (or movies in general) with as little given information as possible gives you the greatest experience.
10.0~A masterpiece! ftt2000 Sign in Permalink A masterpiece that worth every moment of watching!
4.0~An entertaining movie but not as good as some make it out to be brianberta Sign in Permalink Many people nowadays say that Nolan is one of the greatest directors ever and all of his movies are masterpieces. However, there is a smaller group of people who say that while Nolan is a talented director, he's not the film making genius that fans make him out to be. Interstellar is a prime example of this. After Earth faces extinction due to a dust bowl, 4 astronauts and an intelligent robot are sent into space in hopes of finding a planet suitable for life. Firstly, I'm going to talk about the positives. Many people say that the third act makes no sense but actually the science in it holds a lot of credibility. I'm not going to go into detail about it because then this review would be as long as the movie is. But I can assure you that it's not incorrect. Realism isn't necessary is sci-fi movies but when movies do feature them, it makes them more entertaining so I appreciate what Nolan has done. I really like the cgi. It is well-done and it immerses the viewer into certain scenes. Matthew McConaughey gave a great performance. It's not the greatest one ever like some people say but it's still pretty great. All of the other actors and actresses give good performances too but McConaughey did the best. Also, the ending was great too. Now I'm going to get to the negative points. Firstly, the movie has clear issues with the pacing. This is most noticeable in the beginning as many grew bored as we impatiently waited for the shuttle to leave Earth. This sequence felt slower compared to the rest of the film. Also, the movie has poor character development. That's not to say that there aren't characters you can connect with. In fact, Cooper's relationship with Murph is well- done but the same can't be said about his other offspring, Tom. He is seen as a secondary character and gets little attention from Cooper which seems unrealistic. People say that Zimmer's score is fantastic. I find it catchy but it's not as good as it's made out to be. Most of the songs consist of just one tune being repeated over and over again. Much of Zimmer's work lacks variety and Interstellar is a prime example of this. Also, it plays unnecessarily loud. It drowns out all of the other background noise. It took me out of the experience. In an interview, Nolan made the argument that it shakes the seats which is supposed to immerse you but the score still played louder than it need to be. It would've still shook the seats if it played quieter. Also, there's the endless exposition. Nolan had issues with this before but Interstellar is perhaps his worst offender yet. It bogs the audience down under many hypothetical theories so often that the movie runs the risk of feeling more like an educational video on scientific concepts than it does a work of entertainment. I wish that he would leave his films more ambiguous. That way, there would be more of a reason for me to revisit them. Also, the planet with the waves wasn't that important to the plot. It felt more like a side plot. It didn't have as much to do with the plot as the second one did. I wish that more time was spent on it. Another big problem I had with the film was that it used the annoying 'fake death' cliché so often. This is when it seems like a character is about to die, only for them to come back to life. This was used in the tesseract scene. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought "It's so sad that Cooper's probably gong to die since his chances of survival are pretty much infinite." However, after I saw that he still survived, and after I watched the movie a second time, the sad and suspenseful feelings that I originally had vanished. The tesseract scene does nothing for me anymore. In fact, it even annoys me. In conclusion, Interstellar is a bad movie. It may have some positive points and its ambition and thought shines through. However, don't be fooled by the 10/10 ratings. This is not one of the greatest movies ever made. This is mediocre. It doesn't come close when compared to 2001.
5.0~A needlessly contrived display of self-indulgent filmmaking OurManInHavana Sign in Permalink Nolan is shooting, photographically, some of the best shots in his career. It looks beautiful, not only the sequences in space but also the scenes back on Earth. In terms of sound and vision, it is gorgeous to look in. However once one goes deeper, things begin to slide. Performance is lacklustre, characters do not seem fully developed nor did I have time to invest interest in them. The narrative is exposition-heavy and will most likely lose you in regards to interest and logic after the forty minute mark. This is a deeply unsatisfying film, boring, nonsensical, and wannabe-pretentious (despite Nolan's fan-base being some of the more lowbrow members of the fan community.)
2.0~Are people mad?? peeone Sign in Permalink I don't get the reviews of this film! The last 30 minutes or so brought back memories of the bizarre ending to Knowing. What was destroying the Earth? How was the lead saved near Saturn? How did 23 years pass in the time on the planet? How did our leading man keep his tan for so long?? I'm also not sure why when the face visor was cracked was there a struggle for air or why it took Brand so long to find him... They were only walking distance and down a small hill! I loved Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy but something went wrong here. It was a horrid piece with too many inconsistencies. I know one should suspend belief in a movie but seriously! Sadly, I will never claim back those 2 hours and 49 minutes. At least previews were decent!! This was reminiscent of The Tree of life just so bad!
7.0~Good Movie, Worth the money, but not Great blperoc Sign in Permalink I was really looking forward to watching some decent sci-fi and when I was this was on at the local regal cinemas I decided to check it out. Jumped on IMDb quick and was shocked to see it had a 9.3 rating at that time...maybe it was a mistake to look at the rating, it may have pushed my expectations too high. I was expecting something "over the top" good, and it just wasn't. The movie could have used more technology and more serious thinking and dialog. The revelation at the end I saw coming probably in the first 30 minutes of this nearly 3 hour movie. There are some good and exciting moments, and there are definitely scenes that have the cool factor, but it is not a 9.0+ movie. I give it a solid 7. It seems a lot of people enjoyed the movie a lot more than me and that is great, but this is my opinion of it.
1.0~Shoot me BruthaVincent Sign in Permalink Previously having been a fan of a few of Nolan's films that actually were the opposite of what this film is - masterpieces, I peeked at the ratings here on IMDb. However had I scrolled further down to see where they were coming from and what the reviews really were, I probably would've discovered the truth and not have decided to take the inevitable trip into this black hole with Nolan and suffer, something I am extremely embarrassed about and will always be haunted for. Unfortunately I cannot get the three hours of my life taken away by this film. Do not watch this. At a great probability, an atrocious waste of money went into making this because I couldn't help but question where it all went. It probably went into a black hole. Common sense was extremely uncommon in the entire film and to an extent that would actually anger you, making you wonder how stupid the director thinks of you otherwise. Like plenty others, I felt a necessary urge to be informant about this tragedy and so created an IMDb account just to write this. Not surprisingly, I found that a lot of others have already said most of what I wanted to say about the film.I'm going to try to sum up some scenes, shortened to the best of my ability that would give you an idea of how awful this movie really was and how dreadful my time went sitting through it all hoping to find a little substance somewhere down the line, being a patient guy. On the real this movie is not even worth your 10 dollars on a DVD rental. You'd probably sleep through all of it in any case. So I spend twenty dollars to go see this and upon the first ten minutes I find myself looking back at my life wondering where I had gone wrong to deserve this. To begin with, the start of this film with Mathew McConaughey on some unknown farmland somewhere and who knows where, does not create any picture or lead you anywhere for you to even develop one on your own, to get a hold of whether an 'Interstellar' will actually begin to unfold or whether not. Our lead, with his kids drives his truck off road down on to fields of corn ( with a flat tire ) to follow what seems to be some "Nasa test drone/ robot plane", as soon as he spots it randomly flying in the air. So he drives with his kids for say over twenty minutes with the flat as his car runs down heavy bushes of corn fields, where he commands his kid son to "take the wheel" while he moves in the backseat now to turn on his laptop through which he has decided to and even knows how to track this drone! From this point on I tried hard to stay awake. He later just happens to stumble upon a Nasa base that also happens to be only minutes away from where he lives. I steady awake to the part where our hero gets out the car outside the Nasa base with blinding lights in front of him. Next, he gets whacked by a robot, taken hostage and then wakes up in front of Anne Hathaway, inside the base. Then you've got Michael Caine telling him that he is "the chosen one" to fly a rocket in spite of the fact that Matthew mistakenly discovered the base. After exchanging a few words, our hero seems fit to be the pilot of the rocket ship ( without real training ) for a mission everybody is newly introduced to. What is this mission about? To go find another planet that would sustain life because Earth is no longer going to be a hospitable place in a few years although no one knows why. That is not it. Guess where they're all going to look for one? In a black hole. Forty minutes deep and you'll find that by now you'd rather walk out because it doesn't really matter anymore how the film turns out. Later nearing the end, McConaughey's ship is about to run out of fuel any minute where the ship explodes at full capacity leaving him to fall into the black hole to find himself in a five dimensional wall space. Here he communicates to Earth with the assistance of the robot that should've been destroyed in that ship, to his daughter through a wrist watch lying on her bedroom shelf at home and she happens to sense what is exactly going on Wow this was just terrible. Now, to all those of you who have the slightest idea of what a black hole is and what it does or doesn't do for that matter, do not waste your time watching this even on DVD. In fact, make sure you do not waste your hours even watching it for free on television shortly soon because it would make you so sad, scared and bored all at the same time like you couldn't believe. Not one minute of this film was "possible" if you like, even bit by bit, to create any practical sense of what went on or even what could have come out of it. This movie was so bad I came out paralyzed. To my horror, I'm left with no words to describe the experience and I'm only trying. I consider myself pretty tough after having the courage to sit entirely through and not walk out within the first twenty minutes like I should have done.
7.0~Ambitions make the filming amazing and the plot illogical to sentimental absurdity secondtake Sign in Permalink Interstallar (2014) This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best—shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance—it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed. But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like "Memento" takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call "meaning." They are entertainments. "Interstellar" is purely horrible science—it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something "deep" about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing. Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in "Batman Rises" are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But "Interstallar" takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see "Gravity" for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature. There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick—and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker—Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big. See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.) Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints—as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google. But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms.
10.0~Amazing story,music, and cinematic AkmalFahri7810 Sign in Permalink I love this movie.........................................
4.0~A massive insult to sci-fi movies fisz_1123 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is more like a fairy tale that only 10 year olds will find worth watching. At one point, a great detail is placed onto the time dilation phenomenon, with Cooper being young while his daughter getting old and all that. However, at the same time, Nolan completely dismissed the fact that Cooper cannot simply survive the massive gravitational pull near a black hole, let alone going through the event horizon, having the space shuttle almost intake for quite some time, pulling the ejector of the pilot's seat, and still be alive! This whole thing is akin to kissing Snow White out of death. Just when I thought that going through a black hole was a complete joke, then it actually got much worse when Cooper ended up floating in a 5 dimensional compressed to 3 dimensional cr*p behind a book shelf. It was really weird and it really made the movie descend to the utmost stupidity. It didn't end there. Let us bring Cooper back to Saturn when the 5 dimensional joke was over, and let him live, meet his dying daughter, then fly back to space looking for the other astronaut, who was actually presumed to be alive in a hibernator thing. Good luck looking for her in the outer space, as if his dying daughter is not enough of a problem, At this point I wished I could actually go inside a black hole and get my 3 hours back.
5.0~Pretentious crap wrapped in a shiny box zoricaffx Sign in Permalink This "movie" is an absolute waist of time. So pathetic, pretentious, wannabe philosophic Nolan's puke with terrible acting... nothing more than that. Are people becoming this dumb to find this movie actually good? I could not find anything in it that would touch me, move me, it was just so empty, without any WOW moment (except maybe the water part). What was the point of this movie? I feel it has none - maybe just to make money as that is the point of life we live for these days. Love as a premise is OK, but it just got waisted in this one. Sorry to all who liked it, but something is going so wrong in Hollywood. I feel so embarrassed for the movie industry...
4.0~Made no sense and slow pace chris-brindley Sign in Permalink I believe that once people get on the band wagon they follow the hype of this move, hence the mega score of 9.5. I think Chris Nolan wanted to enter himself in the realms of Stanley 2001. I wont bore myself or anyone else, my major issues, 1. Why use Saturn rocket to launch out of earth when they had these cool ships in the rest of the movie to fly up and down from planets. 2:They can go through worm holes, find earth like planets but cant detect its a frozen rock and the other has no land at all. 3.If he could send a message to say STAY, why would he then have sent the co ordinates to NASA headquarters, why send anything at all. 4.MATT DAMON, didn't fit role.
1.0~Pure unadulterated dog squeeze. Torture!! zomick-155-501651 Sign in Permalink There is no way on earth that these positive reviews are real. This was, hands down, the worst movie experience of my life. It made Shark Boy and Lava Girl seem like a masterpiece. (Both of these movies were seen at the urging of the same son---albeit almost a decade apart). I cannot believe I ruined date night with my wife over this 3 hour hell-fest. I alternated between scratching my head, holding back laughing, wanting to yell out jokes about Lincoln commercials and not being able to hold back laughing. Based on the looks from everyone else as they were leaving the theater, we all shared the same sentiments. Go ahead, blow $10 on this miserable, ridiculous, implausible pile of poopy that would make M Night Shamalyan scream out "you have got to be friggin' kidding me" at the movies attempts at plot twists.
6.0~Not as good as it could be face-tommy Sign in Permalink The movie is incredibly beautiful but it is not intelligent but is mostly a strange mix that does not quite know what it wants. I like it when science and technology are described believable which at times is the case here, but just as in the masterpiece in 2001, it falls hard when you mix in philosophy with a high level of abstraction. Of course there are more holes in the script than can be listed here. One obvious to me is that if the descendants of humanity are those that make us survive Who was it that saved us the first time? We meet several parallel stories and my 14 year old daughter even shed a tear over something she could not quite explain afterwards. We meet the stories about how humans devastated the earth's resources, technophobia and heroes immortality. The only person who seems quite realistic, however, Matt Daemon. It's like his mixture of malice, selfishness and cowardice doing so the movie gets off the ground for a short while. And it is of course not good for a film largely set in space (pun intended).
2.0~Don't Waste Your Time. richard-lyons15 Sign in Permalink Don't waste your time (not intended as a pun!). This is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen, I love Sci-fi and was really looking forward to seeing this following the great reception it received, the people who liked this movie must have been watching a different version to the one that I watched. It is overlong at nearly 3 hours, where not a lot happens, the acting is wooden and hopeless from everyone except the young girl; Matthew McConaughty as the main character is totally miscast and 'MUMBLES' throughout his entire performance (I have perfect hearing, but was having to strain to hear what he was saying), Michael Caine and John Lithgow are wasted talents in this film, and are not given much to do. But what was most annoying was the never ending oozing over- sentimentality about family 'relationships' that would even have Steven Spielburg blushing! If you go to see this expecting a film about man's push to the stars...forget it. Also the 'revelation' how the girl works out the answer is so ridiculous that it actually made me laugh.
10.0~Great Movie! acsacs Sign in Permalink One of my favorite movies of all time! Makes you think, and its full of suspense! Exciting movie!
6.0~Why the dreamy "aberrated" ending mtfr Sign in Permalink Interstellar as a movie wasn't bad at all. My only problem with the movie was how the story conveyed the perspective of the gloominess and the extended boring and silent moments that made it less interesting. Another problem was the ending, it was totally unexplainable and lame. So "why" do such a great movie, then ruin it with such unnecessary strange anonymous ending with Anne Hathaway living alone in a seemingly depressed way, while Matthew Mcconaughey is living in another spiral world and all of a sudden: The End?! Unless there's a sequel, thats unacceptable. I know that some may enjoy the visuals and the idea of the after world, but thats simply letting the viewer feel in some way empty and kind of regret watching a movie that may be overrated "a bit" due to the scenes I have mentioned before.
1.0~Watched one hour and gave up zen141854 Sign in Permalink Watched 2001 space od. instead. How can this film get a higher score on IMDb than a classic proper sci film and not some family drama stretched out and a bit of futuristic spice? I can only think this gets such a high rating due to viewers not seeing old films and being won over by modern day bandwagons to jump on. Also the lead character is so wooden. He acts like a 2 by 4. And he mumbles his stiffly delivered bits. This would not matter in a proper sci-fi film but here in this melodrama masquerade it does matter. Or really it doesn't matter. This is over rated tripe.
5.0~A most confusing cinema experience! merleman38 Sign in Permalink I get all the gobbledygook stuff about the fifth dimension aliens and about time/space continuum and growing old while those back on earth didn't age or visa-versa, but what the heck happened with the guy they found on the cold world? Did he just go crazy or was he jealous of Matthew M, or was he just trying to save all five thousand embryos? I mean what was the big lie that Michael Caine, Ann Hathaway's father supposedly pulled on them all? This film was visually fascinating, even spectacular in certain parts......but the parts had a very hard time sticking together. Generally a vivid Sci-Fi addition to the film genre, but hopelessly messy and convoluted with enough plot holes to run a black hole through! HA! The visualization of the aliens fifth dimension which they manipulated to three dimensions so that Matthew M could rattle the bookcase back on earth time/space continuum was pretty cool, but what was the secret mathematical formula that Murph, his daughter was finding or found? Did what she accomplish make it possible for earthlings 125 earth years later to be living on a giant circular tube like in Rama? And why oh why was this "new Earth" named after old Murph have to be out at Saturn not in an Earth orbit? Nothing was very clear. Would recommend you wait and get it from Netflix. It would be substantially cheaper and you would be able to go back and forth to see if you could understand it. Many other elements of this film bothered me. Why spend the first hour or so on a rather teary eyed Matthew M crying"I must go to the stars", but daughter Murph can't or won't accept this and everyone is both mad and sad. It all takes place on an Earth far gone into a kind of encroaching desert complete with endless sand storms and the failure of all crops except(if you can believe it) corn! All of this subplot could have been handled with a 10 minute introduction. Through out the film there is an underlying element of sadness. It doesn't help that there is no humour, no romance, no chemistry between Matthew M and Ann Hathaway. There really is, in my opinion a real problem with the entire script. The longer it's been since I've seen this bloated, complicated and seriously flawed film, the more problems I find with the film. It simply amazes me that serious film reviewers find this film so radiant and uplifting. I mean the final "message" this film seems to deliver is that there is nothing that love cannot conquer and that it is the only thing that ever matters. Gee I thought that most humans with any intelligence and sensitivity knew this already. 5 out of 10 Stars because of the really super special effects and the fact that the film makers finally understood that there is NO sound in outer space! Finally I paid $15.00 to see this in an Imax theater and what a waste of good green.
10.0~Wow!! connorcon Sign in Permalink Absolutely mind blowing. Awesome. A must see. If and when the viewer realizes by themselves what is happening you will feel amazing a tingly feeling will rush over you and you will be happy (personal experience (not you know in a profanic way or anything like that absolutely nothing like that)). I wish I could give a much higher review (number, 100+) but I can't. This movie is absolutely just, Wow. The ending even opens up a sequel, where he could go and get her for an example. I know I'm being redundant here but, wow. There are only two things that I didn't get. The first was why (Spoilers) Matt Damon (Mann) killed David Gyasi (Romilly) and how Matthew McConaughey (Copper) got back to our solar system. Other than that it was a great movie.
1.0~Sadly, a real disappointment fossilwwjd Sign in Permalink ** MINOR SPOILER ** I was really looking forward to this film. I like movies and I like science fiction. I like most of Christopher Nolan's films. And I think Matthew McConaughey has done some great acting work (True Detective for example). So the film seemed to have all the ingredients that would make it enjoyable. Sadly though I found it to be a disappointment. I think there are three reasons for this. First, and foremost, I did not make any emotional connection with the characters. Matthew was supposed to be the hero and protagonist of the film but I didn't connect to him at all. Other characters e.g. the daughter, the grown up son, the Matt Damon character I found irritating. Regardless of the subject matter of a film I need to emotionally connect with the characters in some way. Secondly, there were too many basic plot points that made no (common) sense (I'm not talking about the science not making "science sense" as that's accepted and okay in a science fiction film). *** SPOILER NEXT** For example Matthew McConaughey turns up at the NASA base and without any credible explanation is told he'll be the pilot of the space ship?**SPOILER ENDS** Thirdly, I think in attempt to make a serious weighty science fiction film with gravitas, the entire tone of the film became too unremittingly serious...and they omitted to lighten the mood occasionally with a bit of appropriate humour. Take as a comparison The Shawshank Redemption (which currently tops IMDb's greatest movie poll). A great film with gravitas and a serious message, often emotionally dark and harrowing at times..but it uses humour appropriately to balance the tone of the overall film. So very sadly a real disappointment I'm afraid...and I find myself genuinely puzzled why this film has got such a high IMDb rating.....in exactly the same way (and same reasons) that I was puzzled by the high rating for Skyfall.
5.0~Largely Over-hyped, Laboriously Flawed my_anywhere Sign in Permalink I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I'm a huge science fiction fan, and if Nolan had kept the "realism" and tone that the first hour or so promised, I would've been more than happy with this film. Nolan's imagination is impressive, an expansive force that drives many of his movies. However, it is also his downfall in "Interstellar," a film in which he doesn't have the satisfying answers to reconcile the realistic fiction he wants to portray. The plot is littered with points that exist because, well...science. For instance, the characters refer frequently to an equation Michael Cain's character is investigating to solve a "gravity" problem. But not much explanation is put for into how this would solve anything about bringing a colony of people into space. Finally, this opinion will probably cause many people to ignore me: I feel Nolan is still a very good filmmaker, but this movie glimpses him falling into the same "black hole" (see what I did there?) which ensnared M. Night Shyamalan. Because "Inception" and his Dark Knight trilogy were such a massive, profound success, he feels the need to make every ounce of dialogue ooze from the actors' mouths as if it's the most important, mind-altering thing you've ever heard. The movie becomes bogged down with long, dragging sequences of people staring as if in wonder, coming to realizations that are meant to inspire awe in us. However, these do little more than bloat an already over-long running time that felt like 7 years, but amounted to one Earth hour. The end serves up a slew of maddeningly predictable "twists" that were pretty obvious an hour before the big reveal. I will say the acting is done incredibly well by the cast, even if their script is not always on par with their talents. As always, Nolan is exceptional with visuals, and most of the tremendously dramatic middle portion was effective, albeit borderline overdone with sap. I could've managed without as many repetitions of Dylan Thomas' "Do not go gentle into that good night." A beautiful poem that is awkwardly spouted throughout the film. A couple times was effective, five times was pretentious. This will not deter me from seeing future Nolan feature presentations, however, it in no way deserves the IMDb "9" rating that it has simply because it is Nolan. I can see why people would be impressed enough by the visuals to forgo the convoluted, flawed story, but not enough to land the film in any top 250. If this exact film were released under any other filmmaker's name (besides perhaps Spielberg or the like), I can guarantee you it would be far less lauded by audiences.
1.0~Thanks for the headache Nolan! dstewart_183 Sign in Permalink The movie had a few moments that were well acted I suppose and as you watched you felt a potential as possibly emerging at any moment. Seemed to be some mumbling going on that became annoying. Didn't seem to be any interactions between characters that was particularly compelling or established a bond with the viewer. The concepts of space were like smoke and mirrors even if you gave them a tremendous amount of slack considering it's only a movie. I was going to attempt to watch it again to see if there was something missed in making the connect on this movie but after reading so many other reviews exclaiming such disappointment, I decided to forgo the extra headache!
4.0~A Total Disappointment michaellu5250 Sign in Permalink To tell the truth, it is a total disappointment. There are too many flaws in this film. The director put too many ideas into the film without building strong characters. The main character Cooper does not struggle much when he decides to put his life in danger. Also, he successfully completes all his tasks and miraculously survives to the end. Everything seems so easy to him that makes the whole mission totally unbelievable. The film in many ways just forces the viewer to believe that everything happens in the film makes sense; however, many parts and as well as the ending are just not convincing at all. In short, it is one of the worst scientific films that I have ever seen.
10.0~A Brilliantly Emotional Journey liana-moisescu Sign in Permalink I just returned after seeing "Interstellar" again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film. First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic? The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details. The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest. This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike "Interstellar" - it's that good. What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint.
5.0~Masterpiece? LOLOLOL demariamax Sign in Permalink I'm not used to write reviews, but this time i must put down something because i had been waiting for this movie, i really wanted to watch it. Yes, i was a bit surprised reading negative comments on IMDb, but it helped: after that i was a little suspicious, something like "OK, maybe it's not a masterpiece...". Anyway, let's give a chance and go to the theater. 12 meters screen, Dolby 7.1, popcorn, nothing is missing, turn off the lights and let's start. . Special effects: they're OK, nothing amazing but they're OK. But that's the good part. Now the rest. . Plot: childish. 5 minutes before you know what it's going to happen, always. And holes everywhere. . Dialogues: predictable, flat, no humor, no irony. . Acting: impossible to judge, too damn stupid plot, every actor has 7 words at max to say for every scene. And after the first two hours you struggle to stay awake, no way to judge acting. . Science facts: hilarious. Probably written by the same child responsible for the plot. . Length: almost 3 hours, a real torture considering quality. . Soundtrack: music tries to put some tension in the movie but there are no miracles and sometimes results are even disturbing. . Final: "How long have we recorded until now? 3 hours already? OK, maybe it's enough, let's finish it somehow, any idea? But a short one, please". That's all. Mr. Christopher Nolan gave us Inception, a great movie, and now nothing more than a soup: take something from 2001 A Space Oddissey, mix it with several SF movies, serve all together with no virtue, many errors and you got Interstellar. There's no trace of masterpiece here (as it's possible to read in some comments): Interstellar is arrogant, pedantic, confused, self-indulgent and very, hardly, deeply, terribly boring. And it doesn't matter if Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon, Michael Caine or Anne Hathaway appear: on the contrary, it's a real waste of talents, we all know it would be possible to make a great movie with this cast. I'm going to write something that i didn't imagine: avoid it. I took 3 hours of my life and throwed them down the drain. Be smarter.
3.0~What? susan-george-1 Sign in Permalink Ok, I'm a big fan of both Matthew McConaughey and Matt Damon, and this movie had some good acting and good special effects. Some of the story was even believable and interesting, but when it came to that whole book shelf in the worm hole thing - well that just ruined it for me. So let me try to get this straight - did McConaughey go into a black hole or was it a worm hole? And once inside the whatever kind of hole it was, he ended up being outside his spaceship and behind his daughters bookshelf. And then he just suddenly woke up inside a hospital?!?! So who went in the hole to rescue him? I'm sorry, but once the bookshelves came into play, I couldn't figure out what was going on and it didn't make any sense! Plus, McConaughey left Earth when his daughter was a little girl, and when he finally sees her again at the end of the movie, she is very old and near the end of her life. You'd think they'd want to spend some time catching up, but they spend about 2 minutes together and that's it.
3.0~this is the worst film of 2014 tennis-hero Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan had sold out either that or he has zero talent and someone else made memento thats how bad this film is- there are times when the schmaltz borders on Michael bay territory- thankfully it never goes full bay the TLDR version of why this film sucks cooper played by that douche bag is awful- i don't know if its bad directing or his obnoxious voice but its irritating i swear he cant act- hes supposed to be an engineer but you feel like hes a lost drug dealer speaking of annoying- Hathaway- Why is she here, her top lip is hairier than ron Jeremy's back he acting is awful- why is cat-woman in this film- acting exactly like cat-woman- why cant she give more than one facial expression why does she look like a cat peed on her half the time- that surly expression like shes the most entitled female you'll ever meet- oh and the eating disorder body shape= God eat something woman, you look like a teenage boy NOLAN- why cant you write a female who has more than 1 dimension- aren't we going to evolve into 5 dimensional beings? well certainly your writing never will AND THE SCHMALTZ! that kills this film- you go in expecting an artistic epic- you get Spielberg after a divorce settlement- its bad its REALLY BAD the ending is so bad i wish Michael bay directed it so i wouldn't hate Nolan so much this is the kind of film Seth mcfarlen will enjoy Nolan you son of a female dog- i spent money on this you btard i feel robbed by this film even Michael bay gives better value for...... no, no he doesn't on the plus side- the robot TARS- has more personality than the rest of the film combined
3.0~Mumbling actors and extremely loud music - not a great combination. d_m_s Sign in Permalink I never really felt much interested in Interstellar because I'm pretty bored with Christopher Nolan now. His films are getting increasingly more epic and complex but at the same time, predictable. I just feel I know exactly what I am going to get so don't have any inclination to watch his films. But, stuck for something to watch this weekend, we gave it a go. The last 20 minutes were a bit of an emotional roller coaster (despite what seemed like a few plot holes and inconsistencies, which I need to look into in case I just didn't get it). But it did not make up for the rest of the film, which I found not only boring but irritating. Most of the film I felt was unwatchable because Matthew McConaughey (an over-rated actor whom I don't like anyway) mumbles his way through the entire performance, meaning I had to turn the volume up high to hear what he was saying. However, there are frequent bursts of extremely loud music, far far louder than necessary and since the volume is up high to compensate for mumbling, it constantly suddenly gets too loud to comfortably watch. I had to sit through the whole film with the remote control at the ready, adjusting the volume up and down for the whole duration. When viewing the IMDb boards I can see this is a common problem and it has even been up for discussion in the newspapers. Now, whether Nolan intended this anomaly or not I don't care, it made the film irritating and difficult to watch. Apart from that, I found the whole thing dull. The characters were dull, the storyline was dull and I do not have the desire to watch this film ever again so it has no repeat-viewing value.
1.0~The positive reviews are fiction jmkaep Sign in Permalink I watched this painfully boring movie to the end - All 2+ hours of it. Everything in the film rang false. I am not as erudite as some of the negative reviewers here but they are not lying. I hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over and over again. Parental guilt, love, duty, heroism, blah, blah, blah. This movie does it at every turn until you can't stop groaning. The suspension of disbelief. What every work of fiction aims to achieve. Once that stops working you're in trouble. No you can't drive a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without losing control. No corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on the ground when it is green. Then there were a lot of scientific facts that were ignored or glossed over about space travel. I'm not a scientist but there were many times when I said, "Wait, what, that doesn't sound right". Anyway I think I reached the minimum number of characters so I can stop. Do not pay to see this movie. Enough said.
9.0~too much try abdulsekur Sign in Permalink This movie is not 1 out of 10, but i have to give this rating so that we can balance its position. Interstellar tries too much to make you belief it is all about science, but the truth is that it is not ! I can can say until Matt Damon appears in the movie, everything goes well. From that point, absurdity and nonsense begin. What the hell is a space ship hanging out into a black hole like taking a walk on the street. Every 3 dimensional object turns into light or energy with black hole's incredible and unmeasurable gravity. However, our full of science movie demonstrates that you can get rid off a black hole with a jet engine !!! After that scene, i realized that this film is way too much more fiction than science. What about, our hero walks into a black hole at one piece ! oops, i forget he is into a space outfit, it explains everything ! This film acts like the Gravity movie, but in fact its more like star trek.
9.0~Mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty Pavan_Daggupati Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, beautiful, complex and thrilling adventure.The film is a mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty.Visually it is one of the best film ever made if not the best. Totally, is it the best film ever made? i don't know. A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely. Performances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity, Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental. Don't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible.
5.0~Science fiction with a massive dose of political/commercial correctness Fandust Sign in Permalink The amount of political/commercial correctness we must endure with our science fiction is increasing with time. I don't know how it can get any worse. If they were going to have someone's daughter save the world, couldn't it have at least been Bruce Willis's daughter? There's a line in the movie about the people being unwilling to pay for NASA missions. That's so true today in the real world, and it's so very sad. Besides the massive load of political correctness, the story is nonsense. But of course that doesn't matter to the current masses, his daughter saves the world! Try counting the number of times her father cries during the movie...
10.0~A Truly Mesmerising Sc-Fi Film of 2014 nick-sultana Sign in Permalink When the name Christopher Nolan comes to mind, we think of Memento. The Prestige, Inception and the Dark Knight Trilogy as films that changed, challenged and kept audiences in awe of what each of those films bring. But his latest offering is indeed not only up there with the best sci-fi themed films such as Inception, Gravity and 2001: A Space Odyssey (as it plays an inspiration for Interstellar along with other acclaimed science fiction classics) but one of the best and original pieces of film made this year. I'll try not to give too much away but the story is centered on a not too distant future where the Earth has become unsustainable for the human population; dust storms scour the land and mankind itself has reverted to crop farming for food but with little luck to boot. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is widowed and once was a NASA test pilot and engineer but resides now as a crop farmer alongside his teenage son Tom, younger daughter Murphy (or 'Murph' as her nickname) and father-in-law Donald. Murph believes that ghosts are trying to communicate her and they have given her coordinates of a possible location to discover, but it leads to secret NASA group lead by Professor Brand (Michael Cane) who theorizes that a possible wormhole discovered orbiting Saturn could lead to possible new worlds for human colonisation and asks for Cooper's help in leading the expedition along with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and 2 other NASA astronauts. The events that follow take off will lead to an adventure like no other that's visually spectacular, emotional and engaging. As said, Nolan has topped this works with this marvelous gem. Being based by theoretical physicist Kip Thorne's work, Nolan gives us the scenario of human life in another universe and taking 4 years to write the most realistic script alongside his brother Jonathan, the final result was indeed different to what I and others were expecting. The direction as always is spot on as already seen in his last films; he takes story seriously, pace is steady but never broken and characters are never wasted in his vision. The amount of time that was taken to be convinced on screen was a long journey for Nolan and his crew through financing, development, writing etc but the end result was indeed captivating and a step up in terms of science fiction in film. The casting and performances are all fantastic; these include Oscar winners Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Jessica Chastain and a surprising appearance of another one (but I won't be revealing this).The supporting talents of Wes Bentley, Topher Grace, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck and the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart are all . McConaughey in particular has amped up his acting roles since his role in The Lincoln Lawyer and only this year won best actor for Dallas Buyers Club, he gives not only a realistic depiction of man losing not only his reason for existence but yet redeem it all for the sake of mankind, but he conveys emotion, hope and yet convincing enough to be the film's hero. Hathaway similarly does this as well with excellence and has driven herself to be involved in captivating films since Les Miserables, expanding her acting range. The topping performance of all (in my opinion ) was Jessica Chastain, since seeing Zero Dark Thirty she can be incredible in drama driven roles and breathing life into her characters so I'm betting she will get Oscar attention alongside McConaughey and Hathaway. Music here is incredibly captivating and who else to deliver this is award winning and highly acclaimed composer Hans Zimmer (a favorite of mine to listen to). To describe Intersellar's score, Zimmer says that "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are probably in the bin" and like '2001' the music is beautiful and plays a role in the story's emotion. Visual effects here are becoming more CGI than practical but Nolan highly prefers the practical magic and minor CGI to bring the realistic effect. The use of miniature effects, built and designed sets and production are all in for Oscar worthy attention, and this was possible because of visual effects team Double Negative. Overall, Interstellar is a captivating, engaging and emotional film release of the year and only a year after 'Gravity' had changed the mold on science fiction, but Interstellar adds more with its concept, cast, music and atmosphere that creates a beautiful journey to the unknown that will indeed earn Oscars wins in the next awards season.
10.0~Interstellar...Adrenaline rush!! Masterpiece mohamed-eltabbakh Sign in Permalink And i thought Christopher Nolan couldn't do better than Inception...but this without a doubt topped the list. I've watched the trailer many times and heard a lot about the movie before going...had so much expectations and what i saw exceeded all my expectations... It's a movie that's gonna 'literally' blow your mind and boost up your adrenaline to very high levels...it fully gets your attention for 170 minutes... Everything about the movie is really excellent...the story line, the acting specially from Matthew McConaughey, the visuals, and of course as always the music from the brilliant Hans Zimmer. It's really one of my all time best movies
6.0~Don't believe the hype indiedavid Sign in Permalink "Interstellar" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched "Gravity" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the "Contact" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up.
5.0~It's an Okay movie sbusjbs Sign in Permalink Definitely better than Gravity, for me. Bit slow for a long movie, almost fell asleep. The background music was so loud, couldn't hear some dialogs. Just because you travel at speed of light, I don't agree you age slower. I don't think Einstein meant this by his special theory of relativity, but if he did, I don't agree with him either. Liked Matthew's action. Matt Damon should not have accepted his role :) especially with Bourne series coming up next year. Bottom line, you may not be disappointed, but you may not be overly impressed either.
1.0~Special Effects + Ignorance + Urban Legands = Instellar Hagia_Sophia Sign in Permalink I would normally not comment on a film that I didn't like, because it would be universally panned. But when I saw how high the ratings are on IMDb, I was astonished. Are there that many people who actually do not believe that men went to the Moon, or that somehow education for the masses is a bad thing? Are there people who think that somehow having more farmers means more food production? If the food supply were to be tittering on depletion it would most likely be because education and scientific research had been discouraged long before there was any food crisis. This film begins with the absurd and then proceeds to the unbelievable. That down home farmer with the rebellious daughter just happens to be the long lost astronaut who is going to save the world. It's here that the movie switches from social criticism to fairy tale. It is just so disheartening that a film so full of misconceptions and false premises appeals to so many people.
1.0~Definitely a nobrainer nyiri-timea Sign in Permalink It has so many unrealistic aspects, let's see a few of them: 1. If the people are starving on Earth why wouldn't the scientists try to do anything (birth control, artificial foods, move in a closed place with controlled and filtered air etc.) No, they just send a couple of people through a wormhole. 2. If the Earth is dying why the scientists work in small groups. Wouldn't it be logical to not work as individual countries but as a whole like they do in real life? 3. Why they send an unknown guy, who just stumbled through the door, the captain a mission? 4. They sent the first group through the wormhole and after 10 years they send another because no answer was received from the first group - just like they don't receive messages from the second group, but that's not a problem... 5. In the beginning they say they can only send and receive small binary info through the wormhole but later they can send HD videos too (but it's just a one way road obviously) 6. If there's no chance for survival in Earth why would they send only less than 10 people (and just one girl)? And not send the DNA database they already have? 7. If in the first planet the time is slow -because of the black hole's gravity- why is it the same as on Earth in the spaceship which is just a few thousand kilometers from that planet? 8. Why would the old guy work in something that is surely a dead end and burn resources instead of doing something useful? 9. Why do I need to listen to so many whining and crying and "emotional" conversations? Seeing crying people should make me cry too? Well, it doesn't. 10.The scientific explanations are like 4th grade elementary school. +1 The music is really bad. There was endless possibilities with this movie and I feel it just stayed in the starting line. If someone who didn't care about science get's interested based on that movie, that's great, but I cannot say anything else positive about this movie.
1.0~Scifi junk v-udayshankar Sign in Permalink Just could not believe Nolan would have created this junk. I could hardly see any action sequence and all I get to see is a family melodrama in the name of a sci-fi movie. The plot is good, but the movie clearly missed the direction it needed. Well the concept of space travel, gravity, wormhole, blackhole all looks good in books, to know more about it I would have read the brief history of time again or watched more documents on the Theory of relativity or blackholes, but to bring it out in reality one has to really evolve a lovely plot which was definitely missing in this movie. If it was any other director I would have give it a 5 star. But, I have always looked upon Nolan in the leagues of Spielberg, James Cameron or Guy Ritchie. So, for all the great expectations and the disappointment, all I could give is 1 star. Sorry Nolan half the theater was empty by the time 1 hr flew and I had a take a short nap while the movie was running at a slow pace.
9.0~Physics Doesn't Have Meaning Here thenothingness Sign in Permalink Okay, some pepole says there are error with psychics. But director made it straight becuase here will be hard to understanding. I like cast choice, Anne Hathaway was amazing but Matthew McConaughey was better. Michael Caine was good for supporting character. Special effect, soundtrack was amazing! Camera moves are smooth, not dynamic by this are pleasing to the eye. Ending was a mystery, he is saved or not? But only director know.
9.0~Interstellar: An Emotional Rollercoaster throughout Space bix-71196 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is one of the most well made, enjoyable and thoughtfull movie out there. Christopher Nolan surely outdid himself this time. This movie puts other space sci-fi movies like the Martian and Gravity to shame with its deep story and graphics. Let's start with the story. TL;DR, something's wrong with Earth. We never get told that but you instantly get the feeling that something's up throughout the whole movie. Coop, a retired pilot and his daughter Murph find a secret NASA base (or SNASA if you're nasty). Anyways Coop gets sent to space to find a new world for human kind and travels through a wormhole with a squad of scientists. You clearly see that a lot of time has got into this script of the movie and the science behind it. The whole movie is based around the Relativity theory and gravity. They talk about gravity a lot during the first segment of the movie, when they're on Earth, but then it becomes less important since they go into space for a majority of the second half of the movie. Gravity becomes a huge factor later on though especially at the very end where (SPOILERS) Coop gets stuck in a black hole and communicates with his daughter back in time using gravity. Also throughout the movie we get the feeling that time's important. Cooper and his co-worker dr Brand counts the seconds until they can get back to their respectivr family. Time becomes a huge factor when they travel to other planets and time moves differently than on Earth or in other places. I say that Interstellar has 3 major heartbreaks, or moments when you truly feel for the characters. The first one comes when Cooper leaves Earth and hus daughter gets real upset with him and smashes his watch. You truly feel because how on Earth are you going to leave the planet knowing your daughter is mad at you and that you might never see her again. The second one comes after dr Brand and Coop returns from the first planet only to realize that dr Romally who they left on the ship has aged 20 years while they've been down there for about an hour. Right after this comes heartbreak three when Cooper recieves messages from his son Tom and his daughter Murph and how crap their lives has turned into. Secondly we gotta talk about the music and sounds. This is done perfectly and they made the sounds accoring to the laws of nature and oly use music when needed to. The soundtrack couldn't be better. The cast is also perfect with Matthew McCaughney as lead actor. However I think the actors playing Murph did a better job since they all have the same personallity and actually kinda look alike (cootoes to the makeup artists). This movie isn't perfect and the only real issue I had was with the plotholes surrounding how Coop got back to Cooper station or how NASA got shut down and then continued to do extraordinairy research and develop gear that is move advanced than modern day. Sure we don'g know when this is but you get a feeling that it isn't that far from today. Overall, great movie. A MUST WATCH!
1.0~Total disappointment johnny_forest Sign in Permalink I saw the trailer and "The Science Of Interstellar" on Youtube and I felt compelled to watch the movie. Oh boy, the movie was such a disappointment. There no respect for science in Interstellar. The movie is a waste of time and money. It was without logic and too long. I don't understand how such an awful movie can have 9/10 stars. It's beyond my comprehension. The music is to loud and for nothing. There is no real tension. After reading the 10/10 reviews, I felt compelled to register an account on IMDb to say how awful the movie was. Stay way please or you'll regret it. From now on I will never rely on IMDb reviews when it comes to decide what to watch. IMDb, you disappointed me!
8.0~Thought-provoking adventure, redcrystal Sign in Permalink This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors. First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are "they" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath. I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive. It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced "the message" of the movie. But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions. I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness. Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly. Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now.
1.0~Red Alert! professordanielrodrigues Sign in Permalink I created this profile just to warn other innocent viewers to steer clear of this monumentally boring, confused and improbable story. SPOILERS AHEAD! This is THE suspension of disbelief movie, if you like the concept, you've found your turkey. The movie begins with an unbelievable future America that is turning into a dust-bowl. The US has no more armed forces, we are told (This is like asking us to believe America will one day move to Mongolia) and the only crop left is corn, acres and acres of it. Perhaps this explains why the whole movie is so corny. The hero lives with his daughter and son and father in a farm, which is "haunted" (books fall off shelves). One day, they are driving their pickup when they get a flat tire, and immediately upon this an Indian??air force drone flies by and they chase it to retrieve its solar cells - flat tire notwithstanding - through miles and miles of corn. This event has NOTHING to do with the rest of the story and is never mentioned again. Then they go to his children's school, where he's told his son is not smart enough to become an engineer, just a farmer, but his daughter is very smart. Uh. When they get home, the "ghost" has attracted the crop machinery back to his house (and drops a few books too). But wait, he soon realizes (just how is not very clear) that it is not a ghost but a GRAVITATIONAL wave transmitting coordinates in Morse code??? He drives with daughter at night to the coordinates and TA-DA! They have found what's left of NASA! Scientists have secretly known that soon even corn will die and are preparing A) A giant space station where ALL of mankind can go (all 7 billion of us...sure) or B)A space incubator that will restart human population on another world. Of course, as we all know, this is far simpler than protecting crops or altering them genetically. Oh yes, and they want our hero to fly the spaceship to other potentially habitable worlds. Did I mention that some mysterious unbelievably advanced aliens who want to help us have conveniently created a huge plot hole, I mean, worm hole, near Saturn, and that this wormhole can be navigated through to another galaxy? (Don't ask me which). Of course, as we all know, placing wormholes around Saturn is far simpler than protecting Earth's crops. And so off they go, not before some of the corniest scenes of "Daddy don't leave me", literally smack in the middle of corn, but the plot (or whatever this is) must go on. They hibernate through 2 years of space travel to Saturn (at this point I was seriously considering hibernating myself) and when they get there, they dive into the friendly plot hole, I mean, wormhole, at the other end of which they must choose between 3 planets (they had already sent 3 explorers ahead, one to each planet). The first one is covered in waist-deep water, with HUGE swells the size of mountains, that never break, in defiance of the laws of physics. The explorer they sent ahead is dead (from boredom I guess). Oh yes, and because it's close to the plot-hole time passes very fast on it, one hour is like 7 years back on Earth. A truly enticing candidate to colonize. The second planet is icy, and they awaken the 2nd explorer, who has lied to them, sent false data, they find out the planet is uninhabitable, but he wanted someone to come rescue him, and then tries to kill everyone in order to save the mission. Wait, you did not understand his logic? Neither did I. Of course, probes and remote sensors are not part of this movie's universe, you have to personally LAND on a planet to see that it's deep frozen in ammonia or has moving mountains of water every 5 minutes. Then they get back to the station - oh yes, by this time 2 or 3 astronauts have died - I do not remember for sure, as they were as expendable as fuel and as captivating as corn. In the end, he sends the girl astronaut to the last planet - which might mean her death, but hey he wants to be chivalrous - and dives into the plot hole - I mean, black hole - to see what's inside it. Finally....TA- DA! We see what's inside the black hole: A library! His house's library room, where he can see his daughter, and he tries to contact her to tell her that gravity can bend time, and with this solve the Earth's problems! But since she cannot hear him (the scenes are ridiculous, he floats behind the bookshelves, I half expected him to put his head among the books and shout "Peek-a-boo" to her at any moment) he has to send her the information through...Morse code! Get it? HE was the ghost all along, through the power of corn, I mean, the power of love! She figures it out, because her old watch's hand is trembling (A sensible and very logical conclusion) and cries EUREKA! and saves the day! Well, after this rigmarole noodly black hole, I mean, plot hole, in the end he is saved, he is now in the future, meets his dying old daughter, and she tells him to go back to meet the girl astronaut in the 3rd planet she is. And all this circumvented, confusing, over-corny plot-hole-ridden monstrous nonsense is told in such a slurred, corny, slow agonizing rhythm at least THIS part works, you actually believe the black hole can really slow down time - because the film lasts 3 hours, but feels more like 20. Good points? The movie ends. It takes forever, but it ends.
1.0~If you like Barbie films, than this is the one for you! laurentiucosma25 Sign in Permalink Wow! This movie was so horrible that I needed to add a review, but adding a review required an account, so I did that too just to share my opinion about this Alice Goes To Wonder Universe crap. I've enjoyed almost all of Nolan's movies especially Batman series, but I have to say that with this film, he is off my list, period. So the story goes like the typical Hollywood bs, some random farmer/hacker/drone expert/pilot/father/emotionally balanced/wise guy just discovers some weird gravitational anomaly that leads him to some really hidden NASA headquarters where they plan a save the world mission but they did not have a pilot, but they are in luck because of Mud, who happens to be a pilot and so they set to save the world in a 20th century rocket combined with a very high-tech space ship that will blow you away but not them cause they are in cryo-sleep. Next mission objective is to fly trough a warm hole which you know in theory that it is created only when the space-time is bended due to enormous gravity, but they are bullet-proof so they have no problem passing trough it with their gravity proof suits. Can you imagine that? I can't. So they pass miraculously trough it and are plain bored, they have seen the show already, its like watching a game of football on a boring Sunday. So they arrive at this planet which has water on it but due to the gravity swings a tsunami just appears and they have to save their lives, where are the bullet-gravity-proof suits when you need them? So the rest boils down to the same fairy tale that's been going on from the start of the film, well they could just put Santa in the movie and still be credible. So, enough is enough, I will not waste any more time on this review as you should not waste yours on watching it. A walk in the park or a good book suggested by the other real reviews in here will make your day far more better. So, sadly, turn out that Idiocracy is not far away. 8.7 to this peace of crap? I hope is just a technical problem because if it is the other way around then no comment.
10.0~Moving and Incredible. dhesswfb Sign in Permalink I have never liked the Oscars due to the attitudes of the actors and the often unfair results, but this year really did it. Birdman? BIRDMAN? Are you kidding me? Interstellar was one of, if not THE, greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. This movie deserved at least four more Oscars than it received. First of all, Christopher Nolan created a movie that could appeal to everyone: while it has science statistics, it also has tense action scenes, nail-biters, and incredible emotional scenes. I have never been one to cry at movies- the only movie I recall crying at was Saving Private Ryan. Interstellar was at another level. It moved me. I cried three or four times, and everyone I have talked to, including "tough guys" like me, cried. While some of the science in the movie, such as the Tesseract scene, was difficult for me to follow, subsequent viewings of the movie reveal just how deep and layered this movie is. The Tesseract scene was one of the scenes in which I teared up while viewing the movie for the second time. It is amazing because Cooper is, in that moment, God. He controls the past and the future, and in this mind- bending center of the black hole, time is tangible. Everything that can happen will happen or has happened. I think this movie was too deep for the Academy to handle, since they are just a bunch of dumb old white men. Also, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack alone is Oscar-worthy. The music added heavily to the emotional aspects of the movie and each measure was carefully designed to evoke the passion and energy of this film. While Anne Hathaway may not have given her best performance, Matthew McConaughey's performance was one of the best I have ever seen by an actor. The scene in which he watches his children's video messages as their lives progress has to be one of the most moving scenes in film history, right up there with the end of The Green Mile. McConaughey deserved an Oscar for his jaw-breaking performance. An unsung hero of the movie was scientific consultant Kip Thorne, who contributed his vast knowledge of theoretical physics to the film to make it incredibly plausible. Another person who deserves more credit is Matt Damon, who plays in a cameo role as Dr. Mann on the frozen planet named after him. While he plays a minor role, his feelings of fear and despair utterly chilled me, and his fight with Cooper was utterly symbolic of our society: while he believed he would be able to make the ultimate sacrifice in the attempt to save humankind, he found that he valued his own life too much. This relatively small and surprising twist in Interstellar was, in my opinion, one of the most moving and significant parts of the film. I've watched too many movies in my life to count, but I believe this is the best I've ever seen. Better than Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, The Godfather, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, Casablanca, High Noon, Some Like It Hot, Gone With The Wind, and every other movie I've seen. Christopher Nolan was never my favorite director, nor was Matthew McConaughey my favorite actor (in fact I disliked them both), but this film leaves me speechless. It is unexplainable what I experienced and came away from the film with. This stunning and moving story is unforgettable, and if you haven't watched it you must. Interstellar is not just a movie, but an experience.
1.0~More plots holes than swiss cheese & a total waste of the 70mm film it was shot on. tmcsher Sign in Permalink This has got to be the stupidest, most absurd, ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life. There are so many ludicrous, illogical leaps in this movie that it would take days to mention them all, days. Nothing made sense from a logical standpoint in the entire film. Not one thing. Absolutely nothing in the script worked. Every aspect of it was so ludicrous that I was rolling my eyes, throwing up my hands or even laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. Masterpiece my ass. And the comparisons to 2001, give me a break. If you think this film is thought provoking you have an IQ of less than zero. A total waste of the 70mm film it was shot on.
10.0~The Greatest Adventure Ever Told umimelectric Sign in Permalink A masterpiece of film-making. 10/10; will cry again when the credits roll. Instant classic that became even better upon my second viewing, which inspired this review. It's been out for 4 years now and there's over 3,000 reviews on this film, mostly positive, so I can't write anything now that hasn't been written already on it. If you haven't seen it, and you somehow find my review among the many out there, please please please do yourself a favor and watch the most exciting, heartbreaking, passionate science fiction story ever told.
4.0~Very disappointing DreadfulA Sign in Permalink First of all, I was really looking forward to Interstellar. First few months I somewhat regret not going to theater and see it, but definitely not anymore. Interstellar has to be one of the biggest letdowns in recent memory. I was expecting intelligent scifi, beautiful locales and effects and witness the awe of deep space. Instead I got a dragging, confusing and altogether overlong movie. During the first hour I was already in belief that I wasn't watching the same movie I was going to. It was about a father-daughter relationship, which could be OK if situated in space (Ripley and her daughter/Newt was written brilliantly) but here it happened in Midwest cornfields. The characters were farmers, it's understandable, but I quickly learned that the whole world's population has supposedly turned into farming. Yeah right. Still conveniently the father (McConaughey) used to pilot for Nasa as well, and when he suddenly finds out a hidden Nasa base, he is instantly asked to fly a spaceship into space. Just like that. He even admitted that he hasn't been in space and hasn't even flown in about ten years. No wonder the US government won't support Nasa if they make such ridiculous decisions. When Interstellar finally speed warps us into space (as like the tech stuff was less important than witnessing crops die for almost an hour) we get mostly unimpressive scenery and effects. Only thing I liked in the movie, visually that is, was the black hole from distance. Beautiful. Other that that, bland, boring, uninteresting. The two planets they landed were so empty and barren, almost like early computerized, wired virtual worlds that had nothing in there. If either of these would be mankind's future home, I would rather die on Earth. I mean come on, water world with only two feet deep water and a mile high tidal waves. Sure there was a black hole nearby, that would have a huge gravitational pull, like a million times stronger than our Moon. But in that case, wouldn't it be clear that this planet is not habitable? The crew even had to carefully calculate the trajectory to land there. Otherwise they would have sucked into black hole, like I think would happen to the planet also in not too distant future. It's not like it's a star that has matching gravitational pull to stay there. Heck, Earth doesn't even have enough pull to prevent the Moon from escaping some day. Technologies aside the character development was just lazy. McConaughey wasn't very convincing as a man who was going to save the world. He was more believable as a farmer that had a hobby of flying miniature airplanes and snatching drones. Hathaway looked like she was lost during most of the movie. Her relationship with the other characters was non existent. I felt sorry for Romilly, because he had to wait for 20 years for others to return from water planet, and meanwhile they were basically just lallygagging down there. Mann at first seemed like a decent guy but suddenly wen't berserk for no reason, considering he was in cryo most of the time (I would have expected that from Romilly). The same can be said of prof Brand. He seriously must have been insane to come up with a covert operation like that to send their supposedly best men to a one-way trip through a wormhole. The robot was maybe the worst design ever. At first I didn't even notice to whom Cooper was talking to after he was caught lurking outside the Nasa base. Tars looked like a wall with a display in it, and suddenly when it moved I was in disbelief. In all sense I would expect it to have been clumsy and impossible to maneuver but it rotated and morphed into whatever form when necessary. C-3PO had human shape but it's movement was intentionally limited to appear as a believable robot. I think Nolan and co were too inspired by 2001:Space Odyssey that they tried to recreate something visually as epic but never managed to do so. It's like they weren't even trying. I guess Hollywood studios must have a database for stock space model designs and textures that Nolan used, because the creativity was lacking big time. I recently watched a Blu-Ray version of 2001:Space Odyssey and was still blown away by the visuals, and that's something made almost five decades ago. Also there wasn't much going on in the audio department, just a lot of LF effects. Audio-visually Gravity was superior, and Contact was better written and it's wormhole effect nicely executed. The ending was surprising, but thinking it afterwards it makes even less sense. Like the movie as a whole. Cooper meeting his descendants and his daughter felt awkward, as no one in the room seemed to care who he was. So why should I? I really liked Inception. It was a scifi movie about dreams. I don't known what Interstellar really is. A realistic space movie it is not, that is for certain. A scifi maybe? No, too boring. A drama then? Perhaps, if you can stomach it.
5.0~What happens with you guys? nicolas-174 Sign in Permalink I can understand that some you yours haven't heard about the relativity and the relation between gravity and time. But it's been +70 years that it has been proved that time is slower when things are not moving and faster when they move. Einstein explained and a countless books after him that at the light speed, objects have an infinite gravity and time is stopped. You will find many documentaries on you tube if you search... So many feels that by seeing this movie, they have discovered some hidden secret, thanks the Nolands for teaching E=Mc2 to the average American who still think that we are on Earth since Jesus. Apart from that people a crying all the time in this movie, that's too much really. The movie is slow and even if there is some tension and some surprises, it is just an average movie. The visuals are not so great, I think the Noland Brothers didn't wanted to make a 2nd Space Odyssey. The music is at the opposite of the Kubrik movie and Interstellar tries to be as realistic as possible without abusing of space wide angle. The problem is that there is a lot of empty spaces, there are only a few actors, the planets are empty. This movie does not gives you a great feeling about the conquest of space. Not so boring for 3 hours, but not so good too too. What's Noland's next movie? the UFO? The life of Jesus after he landed from Mars? The quantum physics and their relation with the time and space? Who knows...
5.0~Falls apart after the first act. kylevanwagner Sign in Permalink The first third of this movie is absolutely captivating and has such potential. The foundation is there for an epic sci-fi masterpiece. The score is overwhelmingly good and it's shot really well with some beautiful visuals. I hate that those brilliant successes are wasted on the plot and character failings that come rapid fire in the second and third acts. It becomes laughable, falling flat on its face as it takes itself far too seriously and tries to do far too much. Those two "eurekas" yelled at the end are a travesty. Just, so bad. TARS and CASE are by far the most engaging characters in the movie, and they're robots. It suffers from over exposition, audience hand holding, emotional ramblings that leave you wishing for characters to die so they'll just shut up already, and cramming its nonsense plot devices down the viewer's throat over and over again in scenes that are three times longer than they need to be, much like this sentence.
1.0~Total nonsense coljam21 Sign in Permalink When I saw this was directed by Chris Nolan I said there's no way I can miss this movie. Then I checked out the ratings on IMDb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep. This movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future, however when cooper goes to his daughter's school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube TV in the classroom. Huh? Tube tvs can't be found anywhere in 2014 yet we're expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future. Also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? They made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and that's it. OK so what's the point. Going through the worm hole was OK but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical. Like out of a Disney fairytale. This film was filled with A listers but fell flat. Matt Damon's character was totally predictable and so was the ending. I really don't understand the appeal and high ratings.
6.0~Nice poetry, vapid science. Vard_Antinyan Sign in Permalink One thing I learned from great movies is that they have their quality aspects proportional to each other. You imagine what you get if you have great acting and poor directing, or great directing and poor story, or great story and poor focus. What do we have in this movie? Great acting, great directing, great poetry, and absurd scientific claims, which kills the joy of watching the movie if you are a little aware of the principles of modern physics. If you are an artist or musician, or anyone who has no knowledge about quantum mechanics, relativity, and modern cosmology, you can go and watch this movie and enjoy its great poetry. If you, however, have some knowledge I warn you that you may feel distrust and disappointment to the whole story and start blaming all the actors and the director for making such serious efforts while the story is scientifically absurd. I mean if the director (and the rest) intend to create a sci-fi movie they must avoid too detailed and serious explanations of how things happens in the universe (with serious faces). This reflects their ignorance and spoils the poetry of the movie. I can bring few facts from the movie that is nonsense and they needed to avoid it. 1. A warm hole is a theoretical concept, and in practice no one even remotely knows what it is yet. 2. You may travel through a warm hole, but you cant direct yourself to a particular planet. 3. A black hole has several orders of magnitude more gravity and warmth than the sun, anything falling into it burns down and becomes about the size of an atom. The protagonist would be dead long before reaching its center. 4. And all this nonsense of looking to our particular earth from the black hole just because it has different dimensionality ... I don't even want to talk about it. 5. After 30 years their children needed to think about other life related things as well, and not sitting and talking about their father's mission all the time (be a bit realistic about life). 6. The biggest nonsense - after years father and daughter are meeting and just smiling and crying. This is not an American drama folks, the man has been in another galaxy and see the most unnatural thing in life: his daughter is 80 years old. They both should have been perplexed, got panic attack, feel extreme feelings, collapse or something. What the hell was that? A meeting with tears and smile? To sum up: The immensity of the universe and its effect on human aspect is is poorly explored. There should have been abnormal feelings going on in the move due to this, but we saw none!
10.0~Some of the best sci-fi in ages larry-738-646874 Sign in Permalink It's long, but you rarely feel it, and when it approaches its end, you're not ready. It felt like a demonstration of both the futility of life and it's preciousness somehow fused simultaneously. I came for the space opera, I left with an emotional experience. The views were spectacular, a black hole, a worm hole, time dilation, 5th dimension, other inconceivable worlds: I'll be thinking about this movie for a while. The film is decidedly unpolitical and free of agendas. Worth seeing. Worth owning. Worth your time. One of the best sci-fi films in ages.
5.0~The secret is out ... Nolan has created a dud !!! chandrachud Sign in Permalink I finally watched this movie and the secret is out ... Nolan has created a dud. I have realized that the combined IQ of all Nolanites is sub-zero. Add to that the fact that this movie is receiving 9.1 rating. 9.1 realllly ? What is there in this f**king movie ? I think Nolan has duped us all with this colossal mess. He must have run out of ideas or something .... The other reviews suggest that the imagery in this movie is top notch. Well, it ain't that good. trust me . I have seen it all before in sci-fi movies. The 3 hrs of this piece of sh*t is something I am never going to get back. Stay away from this one folks ... nolan must have slept through while directing this crap.
2.0~Worst Nolan Movie? JrSr14 Sign in Permalink My wife and I LOVED Memento and The Prestige and we don't agree on movies all that often. The Batman movies were clearly made by committee but watchable. Interstellar started well. I haven't seen a high dollar film deteriorate into ham-handed Scifi cliché since I can't remember when! 8.2??!!?? We're so disappointed in you all! I wish the best for Dunkirk but am suspecting it will be the next Red Tails...
6.0~Solide movie with a sad ending martinzegi Sign in Permalink I recommend everyone who didn't see this movie yet to watch it. I don't regret having watched it. It's a good and pretty exciting movie, powerful in its sound effects and emotions. The big minus is in my opinion the end. Finally, Cooper meets his daughter Murph again, but she's a very old lady now preparing for the death in the hospital. He only says hello to her and leaves right again and is searching his NASA buddy in the space! I hoped for an end in the bed room at farmers house, Murph should has been still a kid and Cooper still his age!
10.0~Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark bob-the-movie-man Sign in Permalink Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it. Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema. We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found. The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns. Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act. To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL). In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's "stargate" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous. Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't "go quietly into the night"! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role. Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension. I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey). However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN! (If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of previous reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future notifications. Thanks).
8.0~Great movie. RomeuViana Sign in Permalink Great movie. The beginning is interesting, as we learn that they are in some future year, and there is lack of food, etc. I liked that part, of introducing the viewer to the future Earth. The worst thing is that it may actually be accurate. The movie has beautiful pictures but the first half gets a little boring, nothing really happens. However, that changes in the second half, as the team travels through space. Things start happening and emotions start appearing, as well as suspense. There are good dialogues between the crew and those talks between astronauts and their families are really touching. However, in the last third of the movie, it really gets astonishing. The part of Matt Damon's planet is exciting and from there it goes all the way up. It reaches its climax when the rocket is drawn to the black hole and all the process gets explained. It is a mind twisting movie with a great final. Also, the soundtrack is really amazing, which is easy to explain: Hans Zimmer. Matthew Mcconaughey has a great performance and for me it's one of the movies of the year.
1.0~Interstellar nonsense carson120 Sign in Permalink I haven't sat through such a load of tosh in a long time. The film's central thesis is that mankind has screwed up the planet and it can only be saved by American science and technology. Nothing unusual then for a Hollywood epic. At least God and religion weren't thrown into its specious mix, although love is, in the shape of the central father-daughter relationship. Of course the father is an all-American hero whose daughter grows up to be a brilliant scientist. However, he has to leave her behind, so that later, with her help, he can save mankind. It's the Right-Stuff meets Contact meets Buck Rogers? Meanwhile, the rest of us are left starving, and choking on our own pollution. Other critics have pointed out the holes in the film's plot but to my mind it's worst sin is its total lack of humour. Oh, I forgot, it had talking robots who could occasionally be sarcastic. Now there's an original idea! I split my sides laughing. Poor old Carl Sagan would be turning in his grave, if he had lived long enough to see this humourless piece of nonsense.
10.0~One of the best! ravanan91 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best of Nolan's, and you could say one of the best movies that ever came out. You can bet on that! I see this movie as his passion, just like his other movies such as "Inception", "The Following", "Memento"-of courses is a must, his "Batman"-series. It creates a visual awe, and you find it a complete movie. The science explained here, for example - the black hole and the worm hole, are astounding and visually amazing ... just amazing! The humanity explained here, the suspense that comes till the end, the crops shown, the gravity, astounding and astounding and 'm still in awe after watching this movie.I don't wanna spoil by saying the rest of the story (lol). Just watch it, this is a must watch for everyone.
1.0~Awful, Absolutely pointless dusky_solace Sign in Permalink It was awful, absolutely pointless. Without any drama that we can expect from this kind of directors, Nolan tried to make you excited by visual effect and music but these tricks! also doesn't work. We can clearly see everything comes from market: last year Gravity made and worked and Matthew McConaughey comes to media because of one successful series and film and today these two come together for more profit, or to just save the humanity :)) It's very funny and this film received high points because it can't even entertain you. I think generally saving the world idea like this film is bullshit and wasting the time but i diet think that it can be successful jet in box office like this. Don't waste your time and don't engage in fake world.
10.0~Awesome Movie :) create-and-love-dg Sign in Permalink It is almost impossible to describe how great the movie was. It had a little bit of everything, because there was love, suspense, emotions. It was impossible to figure out what was going to be next, it was not that predictable. Also i like the way they managed the "time" how people on the earth were growing old, while the people in the space their time passed different. I really liked any detail in the movie. I specially do not like movies about space, but Interstellar changed my mind completely. Also the visuals were incredibly well done. I really recommend this movie.
1.0~A Frozen Cloud of Horse Poopy dentrex Sign in Permalink Dear God, what is this? I could not believe what I was seeing after all the positive reviews. I watched on Amazon video, and thank goodness for that because I would have demanded my money back at a theater. This 'film' is a naked excercise in making an IMAX film for the sake of screwing the public out of more money to... watch it on IMAX. I tell you, having experienced the format live, once you get past the "gee whiz factor" of a ginormous screen in your face, it's just a movie. And to further insult my sensibilities it's likely the last IMAX movie to actually use the large format physical film. I'll bet that cost a fortune for three hours of inanity. I thought Nolan was a great director before this. He likely still is but this material is way out of his reach. We don't have any of the 'great' directors anymore in my opinion, but he's one of the very good ones. But when I heard organ music cues at certain points in this movie, I cringed at the Kubrick-ian references. Kubrick would have walked out of this 3 hour morass. The plot holes are akin to a piece of swiss cheese. Good acting is absolutely wasted with trite dialogue and scenery-chewing to the point of choking. Long speeches about love... and other stuff that was supposed to sound monumental and mind-blowing. Ugh. I kept thinking that Michael Caine's character's last lines as he died would be "...at least I don't have to look at that awful script anymore". And as events in the film transpired, I was constantly saying "Wait...what? Huh? How did the - I mean, where... which?" And of course there's the "mysterious ending" that will keep amateur you-tubers in business for years explaining. As far as scientific accuracy, first let me say that I had a whole year of college physics, and have a dear friend who actaully had a master's degree in that subject and had studied quantum mechanics and relativity, and I do I have a conceptual understanding of the matter at hand. This movie really pushes the envelope in that department. All that time dilation stuff is not reconciled properly. Frozen clouds? The film makers went to great pains to point that out as the 'one thing' that wasn't accurate. Oh yeah? I could devote an entire review to that, and I won't. The sad part is that the special effects were 10 stars all the way. The oscar was well deserved. The sadder part is that I smell a sequel at some point. A huge disappontment, a waste of great acting talent, and another case of overblown Hollywood hype gone viral, but come home to roost in the bargain bin at the dollar store. Where it belongs.
3.0~Threes hours of nothing... marlae Sign in Permalink Three hours of fragmented, convoluted and confusing film. Not to mention, the sequences were not even logical, the storyline was a mess and the special effects were better in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you want a space love story, yeah, OK it's got a love story. What film doesn't it. I think people are so much in love with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, that if the Flintstones were found in the black hole, they give this film a great review. The only thing I found in that black hole is overrated! In summary: boring, to long and ridiculous plot.
1.0~Sappy sentimentality and silly science tigerfish50 Sign in Permalink 'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn. After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction.
1.0~2001: A Space Odyssey This Movie Is Not Tikinaut Sign in Permalink When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was excited. It looked to be an epic sci-fi story in the vein of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Not even close. Instead, I would liken this movie more to the awful sequel to 2001, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, which is actually much better than Interstellar. This movie is a perfect example of a director not being reigned in by his producer. What you get here are almost three hours of an immensely drawn out story that is incredibly boring and overwrought for its own good. In fact, my wife walked out of the room after 30 minutes. Hoping that the story would eventually pick up, I continued to watch this dud for another half hour, eventually turning off the DVD player to watch something more interesting on regular television. I did watch the second half the next day though. However, my follow up viewing just further confirmed to me just how bad this movie is. Again, the nearly 3 hour length of this movie is its major problem. They could have easily cut 45 minutes out. In fact, the first 45 minutes of this movie is spent trying to develop the relationship between the father (Matthew McConaughey) and his young daughter, which is a major part of the story. Unfortunately, all that character development fails, because in the end, you could care less. In fact, throughout the entire movie Matthew McConaughey drivels in this low, gravel voice that, after 15 minutes or so, became frustratingly annoying to listen to. Anne Hathaway plays a scientist. Unfortunately, her character is cold and aloof and you end up not caring about her either. Her important scientific training also gets thrown out along the way as she trades that all in for an emotional attachment that puts her mission in peril. I was like, "Huh? Really?" Would her character have made THAT decision? Oh, that's right. She's a woman. They get emotional. Same goes for John Lithgow, Matt Damon and Michael Cain. All are capable actors. But in this movie they are forgettable, cardboard cut out characters who, again, the viewer could care less about. The visuals are interesting. However, bad dialog and overly lengthy scenes make this movie drag on far too long. In fact, Interstellar even borrows a scene from 2010 involving the mission's artificially intelligent computer HAL 9000 (here, a robot) and its willingness to do whatever its human masters ask of it. The last 10 minutes of this movie is completely superfluous. It reminded me a lot of the ending to A.I. where the movie ends with a "feel good" epilogue. Same thing going on here. Sometimes less is more. A two hour movie with faster pacing, a tighter story and better character development would have made a galaxy of difference here. I'm not sure if this would have necessarily made this movie any better in my opinion, just more watchable in one sitting without the viewer's butt getting sore! To be fair, I would have given this movie 5 stars out of 10. Again, the visuals and premise are interesting. However, the one star is to offset the over abundance of 10 star reviews here - which I don't believe this movie deserves. Glad I waited for this movie to come out on RedBox. I would have never paid theater prices for what seemed to me to be a nearly three hour director's cut.
1.0~Deceptively over rated f_cana Sign in Permalink This movie should have 5 out of 10 but it's so overrated that I'll give one star. This is a very long film with some great visual effects but just that. When you make a movie, specially a sci-fi one, you make a implicit contract with the audience where you say what is possible or not, the problem here is that this contract is broken in the middle of the film, this make people confused about what it is happening. When I watched I have feeling that I was talking with a petulant wannabe- scientific fanboy; there are so many speeches about nonsense physics and poetry quotes that make me sick. The plot is quite predictable once you are watching it, you will realize what is going to happen. I don't really understand how someone could compare this with 2001:A space odyssey.
5.0~Decent Visuals but very lazy story telling... majoreasy Sign in Permalink Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below! 1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did. 2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent. 3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work. 4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me. Sidenotes: A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done. C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away? D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale. I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again.
2.0~Not my liking... pendenquejohn Sign in Permalink To be completely honest, this is easily the most boring movie I've probably ever watched. The first part of the movie is a complete utter bore. Things actually picked up a bit midway through when they reached to their destination but even so it then falls back as flat as it all started. Though the plot of the movie is quite an interesting one, it does take in my opinion a little bit too much time to get put into place which makes it really annoying at first. The lack of action of any sort, I mean even the most innocuous ones really brings the spectator to sleep all throughout. It's actually hard to keep focus during the whole thing without doing something on a side actually with the long sequences of boring dialog. These, between the different characters are rather toneless, emotionless and they all speak like as if they were in some sort of documentary. It's actually quite unfortunate because the story in itself is quite interesting but the way it is played is just completely boring.
8.0~Original and thrilling, but a bit overlong mistramicizia Sign in Permalink With 169 minutes runtime, this is the longest Christopher Nolan feature and one of the longest movies I've ever seen. In the beginning, the whole idea of some "end of the world" could be seen as a cliche, but taking into regard that Nolan always offers us something that's original, or narrated in a unique way, it probably has a good explanation and an unexpected turn of events. Which it does. As someone who's watched many films about space, it was rather fun and interesting to see taking it to a new level. There's an emotional aspect of father having to leave his family in order to save humanity, which may be distressing and disturbing to many. I am not saying the movie is bad. In fact, probably one of the best movies with this thematic. It is just that at some points it felt overlong and unnecessary (maybe there are people who saw this as an almost 70 year long movie, so I can't blame them either), especially the dialogues. However, the duration sometimes is justified by spectacular shots and well-executed CGI, which is rather fascinating in itself, despite the plot. There are also some scientifical parts which are sometimes hard to follow, and I read more about some things I wasn't quite sure about, sometimes finding them described and explained completely differently than what's shown in the movie. However, one cannot blame the director for that, since many in the audience probably don't understand the subject completely. It was explained reasonably. The ending confused me a bit, which is also why I was slightly dissatisfied after finishing this movie. But generally, I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers
4.0~Disappointed megha27 Sign in Permalink I am a Nolan fan but, and perhaps that's why, I see Interstellar as a failed magic act. The multi-layered surprise and amazement that we have come to expect of Nolan's films did not deliver. I believe this particular film, like Prometheus, failed due to the maker's inherent desire to create an epic - it took on too much, tried too hard and did it all wrong. I'm willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of artistic creativity, assume space suits and modern telecommunication systems pass unscathed through black holes (and really, who knows?) but there are things that cannot be excused with the budget and resources at the disposal of this genius film-making team (such as bad script and poor plot planning). IDEA / PLOT The overarching idea is good, if not new. I found it hard to feel amazed by the (too many) plot twists. Ultimately the combination of all of them was tepid. We were expecting Murphy to be older than Cooper midway onwards. Murphy's brilliant solution leading to mankind's escape from earth failed to awe. Firstly - a massive stretch on the Morse code / quantum data, secondly - the two laugh-out-loud "eureka" moments - and thirdly, the "aha" factor on seeing the new, curved reality space station was completely missing that feeling - "aha, so that was it, that's what it was all about". More failures - Matt Damon segue and the very overdone "ghost" revelation. SYMBOLISM / KEY TWIST The portrayal of the time dimension within a three dimensional world in the form of the undulating bookshelf wall was beautifully rendered. However everything else about that scene felt wrong - the space-suited Cooper - would he have stayed in exactly that form inside a singularity even if future advanced beings - them / us - have helpfully carved him a neat 3-D nook in a 5-D world? This needed exploration and some complexity. The continuation of his radio communication equipment felt way too convenient, the whole frantic scene "explained" again by the unexplained rush that's a hallmark of this film. So, although the symbolic setup was good, I had to work hard to suspend disbelief - to get Cooper to the back of the bedroom wall and have him throw out clues using gravity and love as forces transcending dimensions - why back of the wall? Why not front? Why did the space-time continuum stop him there (that you can't go back in the time dimension, does not explain how he could gravitationally interfere with that particular room - in the past - and why he couldn't, I don't know, leave a Morse code message to himself well before all of this happened? Also, why his daughter? We get no clue in the first part of the film why this duo in particular is chosen, the only hint to Murhpy's future proclivity for the sciences coming from a penchant for decoding Morse and Michael Caine's all- forgiving view of her as a"firebrand" or something such.) PACING / DIALOG Plot pacing was terrible (variously too slow and too fast). Dialog was terrible. It would have benefited from further revision and thought around how to present this particular story to the layman. I found myself wondering how an actor of Matt Damon's caliber did not just wave a huge red flag when he had to say why Prof Brand knew the mission would fail -"because he could not reconcile quantum physics with the theory of relativity" (not a direct quote). Even if he isn't a physicist. The only lines I can still recall liking in the film are by Dylan Thomas (also overused). PRESENTATION I write this with only an armchair enthusiasm for physics, familiarity limited to the most dumbed-down works of Stephen Hawking. I found most of the science concepts used very trite - wormholes, black holes, relativity, time dilation - trite because of their portrayal as convenient plot tools. Having agreed in an extreme and completely unexplained hurry to leave his family behind perhaps forever, we then find out that Cooper needs to be told these concepts one at a time using, at varying moments, a folded paper pierced by a pen, oyster/pearl metaphors, and a suddenly-presented love interest for Anne Hathaway (that plot point on love being an unexplained force was particularly deeply unconvincing). I understand some of the angles needed to be explained to most people, but Nolan has done hard things more elegantly in the past. That is where one expected Nolan to deliver. As things were it made you wonder the entire time why this crew was the best of humanity. Murphy's law, indeed. ACTING Matthew McConaughey's drawl was sporadic and seemed unnecessary. His character did not convince me either that he was the guy who is most capable of being spontaneously recruited for an urgent NASA mission (and what if he had refused?), nor that he was the guy who loved his daughter in a unique way that transcended dimensions (or more so than anyone else), nor even as a suitable candidate to return from this odyssey with all its shenanigans through black holes, gyrating space stations and a cracked space helmet (!) We never know his history well enough. Anne Hathaway and the rest of the crew were no more impressive. Michael Caine was convincing, but ultimately confusing, as his confession left more questions asked than answered. TARS stole the show, and should have had more lines. EFFECTS / SCORE The effects were not comparable to Gravity. I wondered why their spacecraft was not equipped with the basic equipment to check metrics / giant waves / frozen clouds / landing conditions when any commercial satellite today will do that for you and tell you where you are to a foot's accuracy. But, details. The score was beautiful, and one of Zimmer's best. What a waste.
10.0~Perfect example of filming making at its best!! mkelly54 Sign in Permalink This is what I'm always looking for in a movie: amazing and thought-provoking script, finely detailed and imaginative cinematography and CGI, inspired and believable acting and a soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) that connects viewers with the story, adding tension, passion, soul scouring drama and pause through well crafted music. Unlike many science fiction movies, Interstellar goes the extra light year to bring home the themes of family, loss, unfathomable exploration and dimensions beyond our scope of reality. Leave everything at home and experience this tremendous work of art! Hell, make it a holiday present to yourself and everyone you know. I know there are a lot of excellent movies that will be released between now and the end of the year, but this is an absolute must see!
5.0~IMAX disappointment of 2014 ian1000 Sign in Permalink I only stayed the duration so that I could write a review. I'd heard that the script was less than perfect, so I went to my local IMAX mainly for a visual treat. Nothing took away my breath. The space scenes uninspiring , the planet scenes were OK not not worth my 3 hours. The plot veers into dreadful sentimentality, and the "clever parts" are unconvincing. Having said all that, the end scenes were good, and even moving. "Gravity" lacked much of a plot, but it looked a lot better than this, and was a lot more enjoyable. Such a shame.
9.0~Absolutely Brilliant gavin6942 Sign in Permalink A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival. Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors. This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a "Hathaway hater" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in "Wild". This may be the greatest ever film about physics.
10.0~Exploration and Love. Interstellar, a story about the human condition. RajatKundu Sign in Permalink For a long time science fiction was not considered to be mainstream entertainment material. This was true for literature, performance arts and other audio visual entertainment resources. What's unfortunate is that in some sections of the appreciative society of media arts, science fiction is still considered to be an outsider. This in spite of sci-fi being a hugely popular genre and movies based on such bringing in huge amounts of money. For example, in recent years, two of the best movies ever made were rejected an Oscar for the Best Motion Picture at the Academy Awards. Gravity was lucky enough to be nominated in the category, Interstellar was not. I think it's time that is changed. Interstellar was the best movie of last year. Period. Much like Gravity shows the human nature of survival and the fighting spirit, Interstellar shows the human condition of exploration and love. In the near future when all the natural resources of the planet is decimated, a small team of explorers go on one last ride to the space in search of another planet that can sustain human civilization. They are not entirely sure of the outcome of this mission and there's a chance that they might not come back alive or even if they do, the planet won't be there anymore. Against all odds, the team solves the problem of survival and go on to explore a lot more than they were meant to. Christopher Nolan must be a magician. He is a genius, everybody knows that. But mere genius cannot bring such a story to life, only magic can. Mathew McConaughey is fast becoming my favorite actor and I've always liked Anne Hathaway. Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine are good as ever. This is a movie everybody should see. That is that. Another film released last year moved me a great extent, Boyhood. It was nominated for the Best Motion Picture Category at the Academy Awards but it didn't win. I was heartbroken. I was manic when Interstellar wasn't nominated.
5.0~Planet Earth is good enough. ckdos2 Sign in Permalink Despite good acting and wonderful special effects I'm still wondering why the characters need to find another planet to live on when they already have the magnificent Planet Earth? When young LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District) students see this movie they actually think that if and when Planet Earth is destroyed that a space ship will be waiting to load all 9 billion earthlings, fly them through a wormhole and land them all safely on a new habitable planet. Some students even laugh at the thought of taking care of their home Planet Earth because it is disposable. This is the sad message that this predictable, fast bucks movie presents to the next generation that will be the future caretakers of our one and ONLY Planet Earth.
10.0~Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie pipoulefr Sign in Permalink I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie. And this is IT! When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will. First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years). Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him "X". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly "X", will managed to convince you about that. My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say "we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.
1.0~3 Hour Alternative to this Movie: A Root Canal vharrison-3 Sign in Permalink Save your money and your time. Except that the CGI moments were great (but were better done in the new "Cosmos" TV series and the film "Gravity"), this film at nearly every level of filmmaking was boring. This certainly would be true if you have no interest whatsoever in science fiction or fact. I had problems enjoying this film on several levels: 1. The annoying musical score: Never seemed to fit the moment, bombastic. 2. The over-the-top soap opera-type melodrama: All characters it seemed carried an unlimited supply of angst and tears. 3. The irritation of trying to hear the actors mumble inane dialogue, especially Michael Caine. 4. Burning corn fields look like Iraq oil fields on fire. 5. After 23 years, the watch left on the bookshelf still ticking and evidently keeping time. 6. Chasing speeding drone through cornfield with a flat tire all with a smooth ride. 7. Hollywood "Wild-west-type" mano-mano fist-fight between Damon & McConaughey in air tight space suits, through a worm hole on an ice planet in another galaxy far, far away. 8. Midway and unexplained appearance of the Topher Grace character. 9. Sets and props often looked like they were borrowed from ancient TV show "Twlilight Zone" 10. Absolutely zilch on-screen chemistry among actors. 11. Poor Ellen Burstyn looking so artificial in all that heavy latex and make up. I quit, you get the picture of this picture. Awful!
10.0~This is not a Movie. This is an 'Experience' s-vinaykumar123456 Sign in Permalink There used to be movies where the purpose of it might be giving entertainment, educating or enlightening them. But apart from most of the movies, 'Interstellar' is more than that. It is not a movie. You never realize that you spent 2 hrs 40 mins in the theater. It blends with you. It makes you a third person in the lives of the character watching then to go through all the experiences they have. This is not a movie, this is an absolute experience that everyone should experience. It educates you, It questions you wit to the maximum level possible (How many of you understand quantum physics and Wave theory?) It raises an in-numerous questions even to the researchers who are the top in this domain, Is that possible? The answer is yes and no at the same time. For believers, it is possible as explains the paradoxes and decodes how it is possible and for non-believers, there are always questions that cant be answered. Apart for science, the human connections are stupendous. It makes you to connect emotional not just to a character but to the future of the earth. And the best part in the movie is subtlety in the picturing it. There is enormous possibility of making it more of a scifi journey showing colorful planets etc etc. But Nolan used what is required without going for too much unnecessary visual elevations. The science, emotions, story & the screenplay are the best in the movie. It is an experience that everyone should experience. Question your wits !?
6.0~Great start then all downhill a_sad_cow Sign in Permalink The beginning is awesome. Matthew McConaughey establishes himself in what could be one of his greatest roles. The themes of the movie are powerful, covering our inability to forecast/compensate for a changing ecosystem coupled with our stubborn refusal to fund great endeavors like NASA. We do need to get off this planet and that's about where the movie ends for me. Because they're stealing from the Inception/Transcendence genre, we start seeing plot devices for the sake of plot devices, some of which make no sense. This wormhole for instance. Or the tesseract. If humanity doesn't survive Earth, how does it retroactively create the impressive and nearly impossible things they're going to save humanity with. It's the kind of paradox that movie-goers pay good money for and leave good reviews, but it's ultimately garbage. What also got me was the reused tropes. 2 main characters and an extra on a mission. Does this guy die or go crazy? Die. Check, next one goes crazy. Check. And that ending...the whole "if you want it bad enough, things will turn out good" bit. Nothing to do with saving yourself.
5.0~Much Ado about Not Much blufrog49 Sign in Permalink First, I did NOT see this in IMAX. If the director's goal was to make us (me, at least) feel ignorant because all the mumbo-jumbo is over our heads, he succeeded. Visually, it's pretty good, but not nearly as good as last year's "Gravity" and tries to duplicate the emotions of that movie, unsuccessfully. The movie is way too long and overwrought. The acting is good, but the storyline is so convoluted that you don't really care about most of the characters. And of course (SPOILER!), the Black guy has to die. This might be worth seeing in an IMAX theater, if your ticket is discounted--otherwise wait for Netflix.
5.0~A great painter, A grand canvas and A childish doodle abhinav-prkash Sign in Permalink Interstellar, despite its take on intergalactic travel, event horizon, blackhole, space-time warp, and 5 dimensions, is too naive and elementary work of an otherwise great director. It can also be said it's a 3 hours long and 300 million dollars tribute to 15 minutes of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Either way, the idea I am trying to send across this wormhole is that Interstellar is an infantile and immature movie that could had been fun, had it not taken itself too seriously. Stripped off all the bells and whistles, the key plot element of Interstellar is the ancient concept of time-travel and how you can revisit your past to send signals that your past self thought coming from providence or their guardian angels. Deja Vu? Yes indeed! After all this is the very plot device that is at the heart of Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. So the main problem with Interstellar is that it doesn't have anything new to offer. On top of it you have some dead serious actors who talk and talk and talk and talk about concepts of love, belief, faith, and trust while crossing wormholes, black holes, event horizons and what not. And then they talk some more on every planet that they visit. Well, the movie is not a complete wash-off thanks to a very impressive and realistic performance by Matthew McConaughey whose powerful acting somewhat lift up a movie that runs haywire most of the time because Nolan was playing with concepts beyond his ken. I am sure that by the time he was half way through directing it, even he did not have an idea that what the heck he was making. But I believe that's okay for once. Every great director deserves to make one or two duds in their career so my faith in Nolan is not yet broken. One small note for sci-fi fans. the physics used here is just the elementary theoretical physics which no can prove and no can disprove. In fact it will be more correct to day that this movie uses meta-physics more than physics -example- Love is presented as the 5th dimension of universe and belief can overcome all physical odds-like easily locating a floating astronaut in the infinite swathe of universe!
3.0~Overlong and ONLY amazing in parts, DISAPPOINTED! asharma-50427 Sign in Permalink Let me say at the start: Incredible Imagination! But if you are looking for a 'space' movie, don't even bother. I watched this movie for, well, some visual graphics! And boy there stunning! Liked the imagination of life on another planet and also how it was portrayed. I signed for a special space journey. How did I get? It was 40 minutes into the movie that saw some action. Lot of heavy accented and emotional drivel were served before and prior that. Ok, so 20 minutes of 'real' action out of first 95 minutes. Still hopeful (Its a long long movie),'then again 10 minutes of graphics and action. Then incredible imagination! Loved that but wasn't watching this movie fir imagination. And then it ended. 3 hours passed by, out of which only 30 minutes of space-time (No pun intended). So, it boils down to what you signed for. Emotional drama or space expedition. If the later is your choice then you shall be terribly, terribly disappointed for 124 years. By the way, the robot was really sarcastic and fantastic!
6.0~A Over-hyped Imperfect Movie... dplowsav Sign in Permalink Interstellar is not a bad film. Lets get that out of the way... Nor is it a great film either. It straddles the fence of imperfection ever so well. There are some great moments and then there are some very long drawn out moments that make you shout at the screen and say, "Shut up already and get on with it!" Once such scene came when Anne Hathaway was talking about love... a lot. Yes, there was a lot of talk about love and analyzing what love means. That moment sucked me out of the film, because I found it hard to be dragged into the immersive experience that Interstellar should be, when it is coupled up with such bad writing that doesn't blend in a scene well. Such out of context reality smashing moments happen a lot in Interstellar that makes you wonder if the writers were tripping out on their own interstellar experience. Another scene comes at the revealing of a betrayal, of sorts, from a certain character. Without going into too much, all I'll say is that the scene felt hammy, rushed and again, didn't blend in what was going on. While I 'get it', as in the reasons for the betrayal, I didn't 'get it' in terms of why it had to happen, and it just felt... strange. By the time the film matures in the middle, it goes downhill and your left on a spiraling out of control adventure that is the result of some new age writing gone bad. If that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the endless scenes of key dialogue that I could hardly hear, because Nolan likes to blare his music up over important dialogue. Maybe it was just the Cinema sound system being extra enthusiastic, or maybe once again, a criticism that I've aimed at Nolan before, is that he really needs to edit his movies better and get an editor that doesn't make it hard for the viewer to hear what's being said. It is blatantly criminal in the sheer bad editing that this film suffers from. The film does have its good moments, although I would have to call them rare, but again the visual effects are splendid and is possibly the only reason why this film is a 6 for me, and not a 5 or lower. There literally some scenes in the film that made me go 'wow...' and look on with delight. It's for these scenes that you need to go and watch Interstellar, but be warned, that the rest of the film performs below its expectation. Major Gripe: Time for a major gripe, and I thought it would be the editing of the film, but no. It comes down to design. Now, I've read that there are those that liked the robots, TARS, and CASE. That's fine, and I'll admit the design is unusual and somewhat funky. Yet the positive reviewers probably don't or won't, look at the faults in design. Well I saw the fault in the design all too clear; In one particular scene, just after getting out of the shuttle after landing on a new planet, TARS is scene 'walking' for want of a better word, onto the planet. Yet I caught that moment when it awkwardly tried to maintain its balance. What was it doing with its left leg? I wondered to myself... And ever since I saw that strange fault, I couldn't let it go. The more I looked at its wobbly movements and its rather awkward looking design and its very human personality with its very human non-robotic voice, I just couldn't get into it that this was a robot. I kept on imagining a guy in a suit... and that's the problem. When you design a robot for a film, you need to get it across to the audiences that this is a robot. Not some strange puppet on a string or anything else, but a robot. Sadly Nolan failed in getting this across because of the voice being used, because of the very human personality and because of the rather awkward looking way it just went about. There was nothing about the robot that I honestly liked, it just didn't feel like one, and at no time in the film is it explained where the tech came from, impressive tech at that, yet it just didn't translate well onto the screen. Interstellar is a decent film. Is it worth the prestigious rating of 9.0 that most reviewers give it? I personally don't think so, and I think in a lot of cases such positive reviews come from the reviewer being dazzled with special effects and in a lot of cases that is the case. It happened with Gravity; people were so amazed at the effects they just threw 9's at it all day. Interstellar is not about any of that, it's about the story, and sadly, it lacks a decent one.
4.0~Interesting and visually stunning...but I just couldn't get invested in the story. RevRonster Sign in Permalink I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's work and was really excited to see "Interstellar." While the film started very strong and was loaded with emotional promise, the story just lost me and I quickly found myself growing bored with it. Yes, the film is visually stunning, Matthew McConaughey is awesome in his role, and the film has some very entertaining robots that provide some light-hearted and cool moments, the story's emotional impact was lost due to Nolan showing off how much he knew about science and time. While what we are presented with is interesting and neat to learn, they weren't presented in a way I felt was meshing with the story. They felt more like intermissions where the story is stopped and the audience is forced to pull out their textbooks to learn about what is going to happen. It felt like Nolan was stopping the emotional course of the story to show you all how hard he knows science. And while I loved McConaughey in the film, I felt a lot of the performances weren't coming close to what he was brining. Heck, even some of the characters come off as superfluous as they lack any real depth and feel tacked on in order to achieve the next plot device—for example, the surprise addition of a well known actor comes off as a needless villain that did little to really create tension and felt like something that was thrown in at the last minute. I still really enjoy Nolan's work and will forever admit that the visuals were gorgeous and McConaughey was very enjoyable in the film—and yes, I will say that all the science Nolan drops on us is very intriguing and cool but, in the end, I just couldn't invest myself in the story. It starts very strong but once the story took to the stars and traveling through black holes, the emphasis went from deep emotion to deep thought and that hurt the overall presentation for me. Science is pretty awesome but I just didn't see a balance of getting the human factor and the academic factor right. They didn't seem to gel and that kept me from getting fully invested in the journey to save the human race. Hello! The name is Rev. Ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, bad jokes, geek references, and other movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at "Interstellar" and other films that can instantly get the ears of Neil deGrasse Tyson to perk up) you can visit my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com. If you don't want to do that because I didn't like the movie and that automatically makes you hate me and desire to call me "stupid" (because we like doing that on the internet), then you don't really need to visit my blog.
1.0~Time is relative...Relative to doing almost anything else, this is movie is BORING!! GdM99 Sign in Permalink The movie chronicles the journey of a group of astronauts traveling through space in search of a new planet on which to establish a new colony of humans. Due to the physics involved, they remain young, whilst their family back on earth grow old. Their entire journey lasts for about 60 years. Considering the high ratings, I really expected this to be an epic movie. In reality, nothing happens. It literally felt as though I was trapped in their tiny little space ship for 60 years. The plot is based on complex theoretical concepts, but in the end makes no sense whatsoever. There is no action, no romance, no comedy, no special effects and very little meaningful dialogue. If anything, the movie has more of a documentary feel to it. The visuals were nothing special, and the music reminded me of a superman movie from the early 80s. I just didn't get it.
10.0~Deserves #1 on IMDb razvan-rogoz Sign in Permalink Simply put it, this is a masterpiece. I had no expectations when I went to see this movie. The "complaining" brigade on IMDb made this happen, since they are always unsatisfied. However, even if the action lost momentum in some parts and the movie is LONG (almost 3 hours), it is simply a masterpiece. From the story, to the acting, to the soundtrack (search "No time for caution" on YouTube) to the bitter sweet conclusion, to the fact that 99% of the movie is actually scientific (and yes, I've searched that up), it is the best movie I have ever seen. If you thought movies like Inception can blow your mind, then watch this.
6.0~Another Nolan "blah blah" movie aliases-54566 Sign in Permalink This film was actually not as bad as some of the director's other flops, having some emotional moments and one interesting character that was Murphy, being decently casted. The relationship between the father and his daughter had the entire film afloat and kept me going despite its many flaws. The issues with this film are typical Nolan: first of all, repeatedly bad casting. During the first 20 minutes I was still trying to get over mcconaughey being an Astronaut. You could at least try to get rid of the heavy cowboy accent... Then, every scene is dragged over half an hour for no reason. You can take a nap occasionally and check in to see what's changed. Is mcconaughey back home yet? No? OK. Then you have the music. Goodness, WHAT? IT'S TOO LOUD I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING! Some sound check would've been nice. In addition, some of the action scenes were completely out of sync with the music score. Then you blink and Matt Damon is suddenly in the movie. What is Damon doing here, looking very old... Wait what is happening now... Is he gone? OK. Then the movie turns to 2001 Kubrick and I wonder if mcconaughey is going to turn into a baby. Thankfully he didn't. Finally, if you made it this far, you get some closure with mcconaughey and his daughter. Worth the wait? If you take many breaks and have a free afternoon, why not.
1.0~Complete Crap - Amazingly Bad movie storepulls Sign in Permalink Let me just say that the plot is good, the story seems cool, the message is good, but when you start watching the movie, it just gets worse and worse till the end. It is a Complete waste of time, giving you nothing but a bad taste in your mouth. This movie really sucks. Anyone who thinks this movie is great, has never seen a good sci-fi movie before, or is on drugs, or being paid. Matthew McConaughey keeps mumbling threw out the movie, absolutely cannot stand the irritating music that Booms on boring things, trying to keep you interested in actors that don't even do a good job, I mean Matt? Seems like a amateur, everyone seemed very lame, and there are no aliens, there is no life, there is nothing to make you go wow, you see the same people doing a lot of nothing, hoping they all get killed so the movie will end, and the logic, the science, they screw up on their mission, and some of the special effects are worse then 1960's Doctor Who. The only thing good about this movie are some of the great CGI scenes, other than that, I think it is one of the absolute worst sci-fi movies I have ever seen. So many bad things, it would take me a year to write it all down, it is a classic movie, classic as being top 10 of the worse ever sci-fi made in the last 10 years. How can this crap get such high reviews? it is very low budget, bad acting, bad everything, has anyone ever seen STAR WARS, STAR TREK? Inception? or Apocalypse Now? if not watch one of these great movies. Then watch this total crap movie, it should get a score of no more then a 4, at the most. But the ruining of the actors, makes me give it a 1, on top of all the illogical nonsense. Especially at the end, he goes into a black hole? like his body could survive it? but lets just say he could, then multi dimensions, to where he turns a clock, and then that saves humanity somehow? While crashing into a building, somehow looking in a window, then somehow they build a colony in space that of course he wakes up to a baseball game which is probably the only reason he agreed to do the movie, to them rebuilding his old crappy house back home? I mean what the heck? Makes no sense at all. How did this movie hack the movie rating system?
1.0~The worst film ever! barry_dobson Sign in Permalink I joined this site in the hope that if I can just save one person the ordeal of putting themselves through nearly 3 hours of hell it wont have been a total waste of my time. I watched it based on the super high ratings on here. More fool me. Have we been watching the same film? Dreary, technically way to complex to the point that its not even worth trying to figure out what is going on, bad sound on much of the dialogue and just plain daft but not in a funny way! Some good(ish) acting but no likable or believable characters. Bonkers doesn't even begin to describe it. I will think twice before watching a film based on reviews from this site in future.
2.0~I guess I'm in the minority jmarks13 Sign in Permalink Sad to say, the movie was, in my opinion, awful. I had a feeling this might be the case, given all the hype and the few teaser trailers I had seen. But, being ever hopeful and a fan of classic scifi and taking the epic length to signal a possible epic movie on the order of 2001: A Space Odyssey, I went. Mistake. All the characters are stock, the dialogue is uninspired and at times embarrassing, the special effects are only par for the course, and the plot is absurd beyond belief. How physicist Kip Thorne could have permitted his name to be associated with this production is itself beyond belief. And aside from countless hat-tips to 2001, the movie relied on cinematic intimations of a host of awful scifi predecessors, such as the original Tron and Disney's Black Hole. Do not waste your money and especially time (no matter how many dimensions you have!) on this disappointing film.
3.0~As a sci-fi fan i'm not impressed! dnikol76 Sign in Permalink Unfortunately the film didn't reach the high expectations I had for it! I love sci-fi movies but Interstellar left me flat and disappointed. First the opening hour of the film was boring and ordinary and the 'Earth's problem' with the sand storms was somehow underplayed and unmoving. I thought that maybe when they go in space things could get better... well, they did for a while but then the crew landed on the Ice covered planet and things got pretty sour. The idea of Cooper getting into the dimensional space and wrapping the story with the beginning was good but then again the end was OK and obviously left for a 2nd film. The sound was not good at all - I could barely hear and understand what they were saying, so maybe 50% of the films sound was a high pitched music overpowering the scenes. At the end I thought - this is a film for people who doesn't like sci- fi movies, don't believe in life in other planets and are narrow minded and believe only in conventional science. I suppose they got to watch something like that and like it... I appreciate the effort of everybody involved in this creation but it's not for me.
9.0~Amazing Sci-fi GanzEhrlich Sign in Permalink The premise looked great. The music used for the later trailers (Final Frontier by Thomas Bergersen) was the most awesome ever. And the film delivered. Christopher Nolan continues to create the most brilliant twist- filled stories and this was no exception. We have Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a widowed former pilot living on a barren Earth, climate change causing dust storms that have wiped out all crops bar corn. When his bright daughter Murph is convinced that a ghost has sent coordinates to an unknown location, the two discover a project, to launch a spacecraft though a wormhole near Saturn, that will lead to other worlds and galaxies, some that could be infinitely far from our own. So along with Anne Hathaway, David Gyasi and Wes Bentley, the four astronauts travel through the wormhole on their mission to find a new alternate home other than the dying Earth. The story was yes, a little clichéd but still fantastic to watch although what you predicted would happen after watching the trailer happened in the film. The deliberately rough sound-mixing was frustrating but I accepted it since Nolan was trying to add realism. The plot thickened so much in the middle that my head was spinning and in the scene where the airlock exploded I suddenly found that I was grasping my head in my hands like in a plane during an emergency landing, it was that shocking! The film is a little long, but at no point was I bored watching because every scene had something that drew me in, whether it was the dialogue or the action, or the great score, once again, by Hans Zimmer. I don't have a favourite scene in Interstellar, because there were so many. When a film is like that and at no points am I waiting for the next scene to come along, I usually give it 10/10. The performances were all top-notch as you'd expect, yet out of all of them, Mackenzie Foy as the younger version of Murph was the most eye-catching, regarding her inexperience. Before Intersteller, Mackenzie had played Edward and Bella's daughter in the hideous Twilight: Breaking Dawn movies and had a smaller role in the Conjuring. Just 12 when this was shot, with such an important role to play, Mackenzie's performance was very good for a child actor. It obviously wasn't quite Oscar-worthy, not as highly acclaimed as say, Haley Joel Osment's Oscar-nominated triumph in the Sixth Sense, but her emotional diversity was impressive. Watch out for this young and beautiful actress in years to come, for she might have a great future ahead. Some are convinced that she could be a great Ellie in a Last of Us movie. I am writing this just after the Oscar nominations have been released and it is sad that, despite 5 nominations, there none for Christopher Nolan himself, for Original Screenplay, Directing and Best Film, which many thought was a certainty. Although not as perfect as everyone imagined, Interstellar IS a classic sci-fi movie, with a lot going on in a lot of time (nearly 3 hours), but a ride you'll never forget.
6.0~disappointed bujtorgy Sign in Permalink First, I like all works of Christopher Nolan. Even Insomnia. But this movie... When I first heard about it, I was very happy, I couldn't wait to see it. I was sure, that I will do it in Imax, because it deserves the best available! Two days ago finally, with two friends I watched it. None of us was satisfied with the result. My friend was really angry, He was joking, that we should ask our money back. I don't felt so wrong, but: The movie was way too long, very, very loud (maybe it was only a local issue, but sometimes music was so loud, that I couldn't understand what actors told). Story was more or less OK (less...) quite predictable. Science part was below my expectations. We saw lot of similarities with 2001: Space Odyssey, but that movie is a timeless classic. This one I think I'll forget soon
10.0~Forget what professional critics have written... jnr235 Sign in Permalink I don't know where to begin. I can't stop thinking about this movie, and I'm only writing this review to convince others to see it. Interstellar has everything; great acting, a good plot and story, action, science fact AND fiction, a little romance, a huge (for me anyway) amount of tears, and a story that revolves around real people. The CGI was amazing, but it didn't feel artificial. I wish I could elaborate on what made this movie a winner, but I hate reviews that spoil the movie - what's the point of seeing it if you already know what will happen? Suffice to say, I can't think of a single person who wouldn't like this movie. Two negatives: plot holes, but come on, so much of astro/quantum physics is theory that you have to fill in the answers somehow. I give credit to the Nolan brothers for making a valiant effort. There is one scene where Anne Hathaway's character was speaking that was a little out of place. Other than that, this was a great movie. At the end of it, my kids (18,13), my mom (71), and I (42) all looked at each other and just said, wow. I love leaving a movie when you want to talk about it immediately, then shut up, so you can process it all over again. It's rare these days that a movie does this to me, and I couldn't be happier with how Interstellar made me feel. I will own this movie (and probably re-watch it A LOT). Also, I really hope that a directors cut is released on Blu-Ray, because I have a feeling that there's much more to the story to be told. I can't wait!
4.0~Most disappointing movie I've seen FDworter1950 Sign in Permalink I was looking forward to seeing this movie after all the great reviews only to be let down by the outrages "science" and "story". They explain and try to justify the science, but there is so many silly mistakes. Good things about the movie where the visuals, actors. The story it's self was just crap. I didn't read much about interstellar before seeing it as I wanted the best experience at the cinema, but I figured out the end at about at the half way point then though "no, it can't be that bad of a end". If you don't know much about physics and space watch it. If you do it depends how much you can ignore the stupid "science". Gravity was a much better movie and I though that was OK. I feel like interstellar is trying to take the plot of Sunshine and make it too complex for the writers to handle. Oh and that robot...
10.0~A handful of minor flaws swept away in a hurricane of brilliance. tigurrr Sign in Permalink This movie is complex enough that it requires a bit of mental gymnastics to pierce the surface fog of confluent ideas as we are drawn into a dystopian future. The stereotypical "mans greed" blowing up the planet gets left for a more simple but interesting "earths ecology has outgrown us" plot. NASA's Dr Brand draws on a number of scientific facts to base the ensuing world event of plant destroying blight, while at the same time juxtaposing the "failed wars of attrition" meme and then the civilian rewrite of history meme where the Apollo moon landings where fictional "history". The so called "educational professionals" lacking knowledge of actual science history becomes a bit grating as do the retro looks at future solar cells that can "power farms" . The icing on this cake is when we learn that future humans decide in great wisdom that MRI"s are more a convenience than a necessity. As none existed to diagnose Coopers wife. Again these small flaws amount to a few pot holes worth of plot devices on a highway star ride to another galaxy. The ever rustic voice inflections of McConnahey help water down some of the pretentiousness of the pending "end of the world" and the addition of Lithgow as father in law of widower Cooper works magic. 2010:YWMC fans will recall Lithgow has already had his shot at leaving earths orbit. The real emotional tension is the 3 way struggle of egos between Astronaut Brand (Hathaway), Space Cowboy McConnehey and his equally head strong daughter, Murphy. The technical use of AI as a supporting character was just the right touch to keep the objectiveness of events in reach of the viewer. Nolan pays homage to the age old, artificial lifeform we have come to expect in this genre, and has been so well perceived since before Robby the Robot. I found myself wishing and really half expecting TARS to break into a HAL9000 version of "Daisy" just to annoy Cooper. The betrayal by the assumed hero, Dr Mann and the subsequent heroic mission save by Cooper to dock with a spinning out of control station yields the definitive moment when Brand and Cooper are finally united in mind and spirit not just to survive but find a way to achieve something with the remaining assets of the now shambles of their mission. Here again small science flaws, like the near impossibility of approaching a black hole at such distances and surviving can be overlooked for the moment we discover who "THEY" are and the part Cooper and his sidekick robot dog TARS will play. The final scenes close with the third iteration of Murphy Cooper as the time paradox reaches it's conclusion and the now older than her father, wiser, daughter of Cooper sends him on one final mission, a man lost in time as it were, travelling yet again to the one person left alive that actually knows who he is and truthfully means something to him. This movie really deserves more than 10 stars as it portrays the epic heroes journey as well as has been done and blends the story in a future of a bleak fate of human extinction and hope for survival in the process. Interstellar is Chris Nolans Mona Lisa.
10.0~An Exceedingly well made SCIENCE FICTION will RULE the genre for decades to come senthil-thanika Sign in Permalink I heard that writer Jonathan Nolan have joined a college to study about Astro physics and terminologies for perfecting science, thus its shows the tremendous commitment toward film making. Hope he wins best screenplay with chris Nolan. Now coming to the movie 1) Ever since i watched Mud i fell in love with Matthew Mcconaughey, since then he never let his fans down. dallas bayers club, True Detective breathtakingly top notch acting. his way of delivering dialog are like whispering and humming which i profoundly love those thing from the actor. He will add lots more awards in future for sure. In this movie he is so emotional, very gutting persona, raw acting performance(which he does so many times) he is so nice to see in big screen so soothing as an actor.... 2)anne, foy, jessica - these actor supports their roles very well. foy as young murph is outstanding. 3)Editing- this films drives in this department mostly. who ever done this job for this film should be appreciated. very slick, clever, not confusing. 4)sounding and background score- if your hear it alone you wont find as Dark knight trilogy. but with the movie it does the job its so witting and very humming like music. 5)captain of the ship: Nolan is a filmmaker the world never forgets. he is overdone himself again. after inception this script will get him in to new height in his career. bottomline:every penny is worth for watching this movie in theatres. 10/10
5.0~Is Christopher Nolan Ever Going to Make Another Good Movie? evanston_dad Sign in Permalink OK, time for me to turn in my Christopher Nolan card. Ever since "Memento," I've been waiting for Christopher Nolan to make another film that isn't a big hot mess, and it seems I will be waiting forever. He comes up with terrific conceits that clearly make sense to him, but he simply cannot translate them to the screen and make them intelligible to anyone else. "Interstellar" is his latest load of hooey, nearly three hours of sci-fi mumbo jumbo queasily married to a sentimental father/daughter drama. It goes on forever and includes all manner of tangents that a more concise writer or editor (anybody, please!) would have excised. Indeed, Nolan's biggest failing as a writer/director is that he can't seem to get his thoughts organized, and every movie he makes feels like a rough draft that no one ever got around to assembling into a coherent narrative. To give him credit, "Interstellar" isn't anywhere nearly as incoherent as "The Prestige" or "Inception," and it's not as leadenly humorless and self-important as "The Dark Knight," but it's just as exasperating as all of those other movies in its tendency to start with a good concept that it then buries under a heap of directorial self indulgence. I learned a long time ago to simply stop going to see Oliver Stone or Spike Lee movies when I realized that neither was ever going to make a good movie, and I guess I now have to add Nolan to that dubious list. Grade: C
10.0~Interstellar – An Astronomical Achievement Semsung Sign in Permalink There is something deeply haunting about this film: A quality that Christopher Nolan seems to be able to instill into his movies – an unforgettable quality that keeps you thinking about his films for days after you've seen them. I found it to be the same case with The Prestige, with Inception and Memento to name a few. But Interstellar is different Somehow it feels as if a climax has been reached with a certain style of direction; there is a culmination of themes that have ran through other Nolan movies; mystery, curiosity, exploration, sacrifice BUT, what makes this stand out over the others is the haunting quality of love that pervades the entire movie. It isn't at all in the sentimental or romantic sense, but an underlying pulse that builds and builds and finally comes to the fore in the last quarter of the film; as if it creeps in through the back door and suddenly makes itself undeniably known; not only physically, but also spiritually... And that's when you become desperately moved by the humanity that is portrayed through the cast; that's where the message comes together loud and clear, that this is not really a Sci Fi movie at all, but a deeply poignant film about what it is to really be human, shot through two parallel stories; in fact in two parallel dimensions where time and space are trumped by the energy of Love – an energy that is embodied in every human being. Interstellar is a multidimensional, multi-layered expression of creativity at its finest, filled with intelligence and sensitivity presenting an infinity of possible interpretations to the viewer. Like many of Christopher Nolan's movies; it makes you THINK. But not only that: I found myself profoundly touched on a very emotional level at the rawness with which the paradox of human existence was expressed – in a nutshell; love versus fear of annihilation. The characters in the film are split between those who are motivated by love and those who are motivated by fear – and within this, there are those who begin with one motivation and end with the other. It is a film that explores the very core of humanity; presenting such qualities as faith, hope, courage, sacrifice; and on the flip side anger, betrayal, hopelessness and remorse, all against the backdrop of the unknown emptiness of space. I felt that the message of the film was really about choice. The choice of whether to remain in fear which emerges as a result of threat to our survival, or to choose the higher frequency of love, which means to override the survival instinct and take risks based on faith. If I could write an equation to express the perfection of this film it would be expressed as 10/10 Flawless!
6.0~Bit too overrated rtneu Sign in Permalink I am sorry but found this movie to be highly over rated. It was high on visual effects but low on the content in terms of script, story and the future of the world basically.I am sure it will grab few awards in these categories. There was a similar hype around Avatar but when I saw Avatar, it had something new to offer. Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie. Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger.
4.0~Wanted to like it... calle_2565 Sign in Permalink *Sigh* Here we go, about to give a 9+ rated movie my opinion. First off, I'd like to mention that I like Nolan. Memento and The Prestige are really great movies, entertaining and mysterious. Lately however, I did not enjoy Inception and the last Batman movie (You don't build up Bane like that and just brush him aside in the last 20 minutes, that is just bull!). And to an extent, I did enjoy parts of this movie. The idea of humanity being doomed is interesting, the fact that Nolan hired scientists (Physicists) to provide with data to create a seemingly realistic wormhole and other visually amazing stuff, the turn of Matt Damons character and the overall dark tone throughout the movie. But I mean, come on. There is so much you could remove and still get the message across. The ending, first of all. Why not, in true Nolan fashion, end it when Matthew McConaughey is done changing the past causing the exact same outcome, yet changing the future. Cut to overwhelming light, annnnnnnnnd credits, implying that the world would carry on. As well as the beginning could be cut down, and a whole part in the middle while exploring the other planets. I just think it was way to long, and some parts was just too wacky. Which is most evident in the part with Matthew McConaughey that I tried to described. And also a huge problem I have, the music at some points. It's not good, or needed in every scene. Sometimes you can't hear what the characters are saying. Less is more. But, yeah. I'm not qualified to talk about physics and it's just my opinion, but no I think this movie tries to change the formula of movies like Armageddon, by making it more complex and nonsensical to myself. Because, if the ending is just as sappy and coincidental as other movies regarding saving the world, why complicate things? Oh well, nice visuals, cool parts and ideas. But, not my cup of tea.
10.0~Best sci-fi ever? asda-man Sign in Permalink children I shall be talking about Interstellar. But before I do, I think I better give you a little context, just to show how high my expectations were for this film. I love Christopher Nolan. I am a Nolanite, or Nolanoid, or whatever people who like Christopher Nolan are called. I've pretty much loved every film he's ever done. It confuses me when people slag him off because he's clearly the best writer/director to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since Steven Spielberg, only I think that his films are much better than Steven's. His films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters. As soon as I heard Christopher Nolan's next film was a sci-fi film called, Interstellar, I was excited. I was so excited that I only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer. It was enough, I was sold and I didn't want to see any other trailer, because I wanted to know and see as little as possible. I decided that Interstellar needed to be seen in IMAX, so I booked my ticket to see Interstellar on the biggest screen in the UK. Even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews (I was hoping for full-on rave ones, like when The Dark Knight and Inception came out) I still put my trust into Christopher to deliver me something extraordinary. I don't know if it's the gigantic screen talking, but Interstellar absolutely delivered. This was the best experience I've ever had at the cinema. The huge screen and ear-popping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it, I felt like I had been for a little trip out in space. I'm not sure if this will translate quite so well on your TV screen at home, however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on. Whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heart-stopping set-pieces, at its heart it's an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe. I was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started. The stuff before Matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film. We learn so much about Coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into (three hours which fly by, I might add). There's a strong focus on the relationship between Coop and his daughter, and it's this relationship which drives the film right up to, and including, its jaw-dropping conclusion. The first hour is also quite funny too, which was a nice surprise as Nolan doesn't normally dabble in too much humour. There's a really emotional scene where Coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter, who he doesn't know when he's going to see again, before his space travels. It's beautifully acted by both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film. After this the film adopts an entirely new setting. Literally. We're blasted off into space and the fun really begins. The less you know about the space scenes, the better, as it's a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going! Suffice to say that Interstellar is jam-packed with eye-popping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last year's Gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison. With The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and Interstellar is his biggest yet. He has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it, we should be nurturing it! Interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water. The action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. It's a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished. He's left the big drums and strings behind and re-invented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film. A lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of Interstellar. I can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand. It's complex, but it's still easy enough to follow. However, Christopher completely rips up the rule book and Interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes. Personally, I loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which Christopher Nolan has going inside his head. I found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level. I don't understand it all, but I have my theories and I'm sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb. Interstellar is a truly remarkable experience. It boasts awesome ideas and visuals, but it never forgets its heart. I'm a tough cookie to make cry, but I'm not going to lie (ooh poetry!) there were three occasions when I had tears filling up in my eyes. There are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why I go to the cinema. I don't just want crazy visuals and excitement, I want to be moved and I want to be invested in characters so that I care what happens to them at the end. Interstellar more than achieves that. I'll need to give it another watch to work out where I'd put it on Christopher Nolan's mesmerising filmography, but he hasn't let me down. I hope that Interstellar is seen as a sci-fi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade. Read more weird, dazzling and uncut reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com
1.0~What's wrong with this movie? si_phil Sign in Permalink 1. Far far too long. Nearly 3 hours? 2. 50% of McConnaughey's dialogue totally incomprehensible. He hardly moves his lips so what he says comes out as a hoarse whisper. Didn't have that problem listening to Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway or Matt Damon. 3. Characters doing random things that had no logic. Why did Matt Damon suddenly attack Cooper? 4. That annoying thing where actors suddenly start explaining the plot. "We're approaching a wormhole. So, tell me all about wormholes". "Ok, this is how it goes...." 5. Mostly, the film was just boring. Lots of films last around the 3 hour mark and you need to have something to keep the audience's interest going. My interest lapsed around the halfway mark.
5.0~Interesting plot,overwrought and over dramatic and intrusive film score bprice-537-593435 Sign in Permalink As others have noted this movie aspires to bring a 2001: A Space Odyssey sense of awe and spirituality to the viewer. It fails. The plot twists and science behind them are not believable. Add a cheesy overwrought film score that features a church organ blasting away at 140 decibels to make us 'feel' the drama of each situation - and you have an almost laughable movie. The music was also way to loud in parts and drowned out the dialog often. What's with that? Is it because the dialog wasn't achieving its intended dramatic effect - so the music is supposed to? Just weird and ineffective. There is no subtlety anywhere in this movie - you are told what to feel where and when with over dramatic scenes and music. The space effects were awesome. The editing was edgy and interesting and the cinematography was excellent. Acting good too so not everything about the movie was poorly done. I won't be recommending it to my friends, however.
1.0~Crying in Space birdmw Sign in Permalink This movie based on an amazing book, and was drawn into a dramatic and hyper realistic screenplay by Spielberg before that script was ultimately butchered into this movie by Christopher Nolan. Read the summary of the original script - it is such a good idea for a movie. Space sex?! How cool! What we have with Interstellar is "crying in space". Every character gets at least one long crying scene. It's too much. The soundtrack is repetitive and exhausting. The dialogue is bland, the back-story is weak and I could go on but none of this is my real grip with Interstellar. I think the movie is unrealistic, but not in a "physics of space isn't real enough" kinda way - which is the complaint most people have when saying this movie is unrealistic. I thought the characters were unrealistic. I just couldn't believe that THEY believed we hadn't gone to the moon in a day when traveling to Saturn as a species is possible. I couldn't believe that Matthew McC. would be so emotionally weak yet be able to hack a predator drone on the fly and be an expert farmer and an expert pilot. I couldn't believe the length that the characters would go to in order to deceive each-other. Now for the technology - I am okay with it being a little off but the inconsistency is what is tough to swallow. But you saw regular normal ol' Saturn rocket boosters needed to get off of earth, yet they could zip around near a black hole with gravity 8,000 times that of earth with tiny little engines? They have Artificial Intelligence capable of reliable and super-complex reasoning, with extremely strong limbs, and they chose to give it a refrigerator for a chassis?
4.0~Welcome To Matthew McConaughey's Face thelocalworld-167-445890 Sign in Permalink This contains spoilers. I don't normally support or condone drug use, but you might not want to see this movie sober, especially if you like logic or consistency. I have to say that I absolutely loved some of the visuals, which were first-rate and well-done. I loved the sequence of them flying into the wormhole in particular. It was a joy ride, literally. The cinematography was first rate. No question. What I didn't like. Some of the cast and cheesy dialog didn't work for me. Matt Damon was a buzz kill. What movie is this again? Is there an actor shortage? I was half expecting Samuel Jackson to appear next asking for his space suit? I didn't buy Hathaway's character development or her portrayal of it. First, she comes off as cold and clinical, then she is talking about the power of love. And Coop is all about love of family but makes the cold clinical decision to forego the love planet. The young daughter's performance and lines felt, well, scripted. And outside of a few European films, I have never seen so many extreme close-ups in my life. I know we are on a spaceship and are supposed to feel claustrophobic, but come on, do we have to be two inches from Matthew McConaughey's face the whole time. David Gyasi was fantastic and I actually wished he had more screen time. Ellen Burstyn was a pleasant surprise. The score by Hans Zimmer was absurd. Nothing subtle about it. I almost felt like my ears were date raped. You notice this too when there is suddenly silence in the film in space, but then you start wondering why isn't it more silence. Science fact: No sound in space. I could buy that the Earth was in trouble, but it didn't make sense that the situation could not be fixed. Certainly, the challenges to fix the problems on Earth would not be greater than trying to grow corn in space. But one of my biggest problems that kept pulling me out of the movie was the unbelievability of the story within itself. We are led to believe that Coop exists in a dust-bowl, corn-fed, truck-driving world, and doesn't think twice about driving through corn fields, yet he only lives a few hours away from a massive spaceship under construction as well as the rocket launching pad for an underground NASA? Okay, I will still go along. And then he fires out into space, and lo and behold, we have a spaceship already there and it can put you into an Avatar-type sleep chamber. But wait!! This is not a clean sleep chamber, this is a space station with dirty tile floors, and you just hop in, clothes and all, the life sauce just goes over you. No squirming or gagging. Just under you go, clothes and all, and you are good to go. And what's more, the chambers apparently don't need maintenance and can run forever. It seems right there that is your solution to the problem on Earth. Just put everyone in the life sauce and wake them up when the weather is better. And...and...when you are awaken, as Matt Damon is, no coughing, no gagging, no huffing and puffing...no speech like you hear the guy in Avatar giving...."You will be nauseous. You will be tired.." No you are just up and at em. 100% good to go. Yes, that's some good technology us humans already have. Hmmm, maybe that could solve our extinction problem. Any hoo, after that, we suddenly have Anne Hathaway change characters and now she is giving a monologue ala Huey Lewis and The News about the Power of Love, and about why she so much wants to hook up with someone she loves. But Coop, although fresh off a cry fest on the video monitor with his kids, is inexplicably the cold clinician now is having none of that love talk and wants to go to the planet that is still giving off a signal. That's real. That's tangible. What's love got to do with it? And then, the kicker, Matt Damon appears, and it is the Bourne Supremacy on Planet X. And even though he has been in death sleep for God only knows how long, he can still kick butt and head butt you so hard you space helmet will crack. And then, Matthew McConaughey will struggle for breath and be conveniently rescued by Anne Hathaway flying the millennium falcon. I thought Coop was the pilot. Maybe he taught her how to fly in a love scene we didn't see? Kind of like Ghost and that ceramic pot, except it would have been Matthew putting his hands on hers while she worked the controls. Oh maybe, us humans have a Matrix-type training program that you plug into your brain and you download your flight skills. Us humans have some good technology in the future, but we can't save that darn corn!! I was also thrown out of the movie at other points, especially when they landed on water world. And how convenient is that? Well, the whole planet only has three feet of water, just shallow enough for the landing gear. And even when your space ship, let's call it the Millennium Falcon, gets hit by a tidal wave, it doesn't damage anything. You just have to let it air out and it should be good to go in about an hour. The ship is basically indestructible. That's some amazing technology us humans have again!! And finally, at the very end of the movie, when all is resolved and humanity has been saved, Coop simply hops in another Millennium Falcon and is going to fly back to the love of his life...oh wait...I thought she was in love with someone else. Oh well, it doesn't matter. There is no need for consistency. This is science fantasy.
10.0~Creative Masterpiece. TomLong0507 Sign in Permalink This is hands down the most beautiful and thought-provoking film Christopher Nolan has made to date! All of the film's elements come together marvelously, from the great acting and often times emotional story to the dazzling effects, images, and music! Matthew McConaughey gives a powerful and moving performance in the lead. There were also some great supporting performances from Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, etc. Hans Zimmer, who composed most of Nolan's previous films once again composes an epic and unforgettable score for this one as well. And of course, the effects are simply gorgeous, need I say more?! Despite the lengthy three-hour runtime, I didn't mind it a bit this time around, as the film kept me completely engaged from start to finish!
1.0~Lost me in space sammie-75089 Sign in Permalink This is Hollywood's hair-brained attempt to one-up "Gravity," which swept the Academy Awards the previous year. But just as "Gravity" was full of crap, so is this movie. What did we get? Just more fodder from Tinseltown producers with over-active imaginations which produced nearly 3 hours of something that didn't add up, gel, connect or make any sense. To understand and grasp this movie, first I had to get past the mumbling dialog of Matthew "Mush Mouth" McConaughey. Without the closed captioning on my TV, I would have missed 80% of what he said. Moreover, to understand this movie, it would have helped greatly if I was an expert in/or believed in: 1. Quantum mechanics 2. Quantum physics 3. Time travel 4. Einstein's theory of relativity 5. Black Holes 6. Event horizons 7. Singularities 8. Worm holes 9. Extra-Terrestrial Life. This is another confusing, far-fetched space movie that is lost in space. If you need a "Fifth Dimension" fix, try the singing group from the 60s. If you want more entertainment or stimulation, try "Uncle Buck." If you want something visually stunning, go look at a redwood.
7.0~Multi-dimensional mess fiolinisme Sign in Permalink 9.1 at IMDb? Seriously?? 4 of my 5 stars are for the visual effects. 1 star is for McConaugh and Hathaway. The Nolan brothers, however, get zilch for their bullshit cosmology mixed with banal sentimentality and quasi-philosophy. It is a mystery to me, why some filmmakers love to mix so much "science" into their movies, when most of it is so horrendously unrealistic, misleading, incomprehensible and incorrect. Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why "2001" will remain a masterpiece and why "Interstellar" will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real...
10.0~Blown Away - robertgarytaylor Sign in Permalink I don't ever write reviews, although I'm always grateful to the people that do on this site! Put simply, you HAVE to see this film. For the first time in years I feel like I've seen a film where the director hasn't instantly assumed that the audience are stupid or 9 years old. The film is brilliantly paced, with well-placed action, and great dialogue. For me, this is the best film to arrive within the last 10 years at the very least. It is a must see, and I honestly believe that anyone watching this will come away aching to see it again - which I will! For me this film is a definite 10/10, it kept me involved all the way through, and one scene in particular sticks in my mind days after the film. You'll know it when you see it!
9.0~Interstellar: a true space odyssey. icasilas Sign in Permalink How could I describe such a beautiful picture, such outstanding performances and top notch directing? Christopher Nolan's interstellar is the year's true gem, and above the most authentic scientific experience that Hollywood has ever witnessed throughout al its long history of space films, an astonishing accuracy that was guaranteed by the now Nobel prize winner Tip Thorn. It is a true Oscar worthy masterpiece. Interstellar is a perfect mix between brilliant cinematography, staggering visual effects, and a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of astrology, and is inarguably the best picture by visionary director Christopher Nolan (I still concur to that statement in the year 2018, after 'Dunkirk ' his latest epic film, has been brought to the big screen). But let's not speak profusely about the brilliance of Christopher Nolan, for it is a universal consensus. Instead let's dwell on the real charm of this movie, the one that transcends its scientific accuracy, which is its incredible ensemble cast and their respective performances, starting by Mathew Mconaughey who made an Oscar worthy piece of acting, portraying Joseph Cooper, a widowed spacecraft pilot who struggles between his responsibilities as a father and those of the leader of earth's last hope to escape an impeding extinction, a character with so much emotion to show but in such unforgiving conditions and that only an experienced and talented actor can understand and depict. In such a dark apocalyptic atmosphere, though shot dynamically and rather beautifully by Christopher Nolan's camera, shines a persona that soaks all the heavy scientific and gripping scent of the movie into a gentle mix of hope and affection: in a time of hopelessness and fear, Amelia Brand, portrayed by the beautifully talented Anne Hathaway, disavows science in a time where can only lead to her doom and acknowledges entities that not even science can understand, human sentiments that transcend space and time. This stance, though seen by some as criminally obscene and illogical, is of the essence of this picture's philosophy, one that is meticulously explained and pictured by the beautiful imagery and clever dialogue that interstellar has more than enough to show. Another exceptional feature of this picture its perfectly timed usage of wide shots, using this to create peaceful pauses throughout the intense course of the film to silently stare to the inspiring abyss of the deep dark space, giving the viewer a sense of immersion and serenity that only a few movies succeeded in achieving. One might call interstellar a technical masterpiece, a visual chef d'oeuvre or a scientific reference, yet its most important aspect is far more deeper in my opinion, one that supersedes the story or the future it represents: the depiction of humanity as a lonely entity in this universe and exploring our connection with it, discovering that the outcome of us being the only species even when settling in the fourth dimension is quite possible is for me very unsettling, what's most praise worthy in this marvellous picture is the question it leaves the audience with, as it is for all the pictures that Christopher Nolan has blessed us with.
1.0~Rubbish Plot and full of holes keithryder99 Sign in Permalink How can anyone give this film 10/10 ? It lasts for 3 hours and for the first hour NOTHING happens. They could have condensed the first hour to 10 minutes. Poor plot. NASA developing a secret base because the public would not support spending on such expensive waste of money. Err maybe they would have spotted the dirty great big rocket launching and wonder what it was ?? How about picking the most ridiculous planet that orbits a black hole? You would never be able to develop and further space as anything in orbit had 7 years for every hour on the surface! That stupid puddle planet ! and the statement that the explorer had just arrived in their time due to relativity ??.. Err it took 2 years for them to get to Jupiter where the wormhole was. So assuming they did not leave until they reported back, they would have been on the surface for 2 years. Why can't the transmit back real information ( I may have missed that) when they can send video messages ? Sending back fake data about a planet that is frozen and has ammonia I the air so that it looks good is Lame as hell. You picked someone to go on a mission through a wormhole alone but they crumble about dying on a frozen planet is stupid. Anyway you could spot what the planet was like from a long long way to know it was fake. Hmm turning the Robot into a bomb that self destructs ? Why ? Could they not spot when they landed it was fake? I.E a frozen landscape for miles around is not what I would have called a viable planet. Ahh yes and sending messages back through the wormhole using gravity to encode data in the watch ticking using Morse code ????? Pathetic I had no joy watching this film, except when it went off. Science fiction this is not.
1.0~Better watch "Penguins of Madagascar" instead weruaga Sign in Permalink I always liked SiFi movies, the Alien saga, 2001 Space Odyssey, Gravity, and even Star Wars, of course: they invite you to dream about extraterrestrial creatures, exploration of the Cosmos, interstellar fights, and what might be like living beyond the earth. Well, "Interstellar" falls very short at that. Why? simply because it goes well beyond what it is possible. And let's keep it clear, I am stating that in a bad sense. After NASA's Orion struggles on building a shuttle to send humans to asteroids and even Mars! (for the sake of what?!), Interstellar illustrates us how to even get into BLACK holes, scape out of them, and see your own daughter dying while you still have more energy (and time) to keep procreating. What is next?! It is a shame that a gang can keep you nearly three hours (while getting your money) to brief you about "real" science and the "new" fifth dimension with which that you can communicate through the 3D space and time. Bad, bad, and bad.
2.0~Sloppy and skips over so many necessary details jschwantz Sign in Permalink I don't know where to start. Maybe it was the first half of the film where I'm watching a horrible whining child actor ruin any hope this film had, but the ending wrapped up like a 7th grade home science experiment gone wrong. Anne Hathaway's role could have been played by any other Hollywood starlet, because it required absolutely no depth. This is mainly thanks to bland script writing, but congrats to Matthew Mcconaughey for portraying the only realistic character all the way through this silly and stupid story. Poor Wes Bentley, his character served absolutely no purpose in this film, and when he's gone, nobody ever mentions it again. The only notable part of this film is Matt Damon's guest performance, offering some drama and suspense. Otherwise, between the cheesy graphics and a mythical 3rd dimension of love, I couldn't help but roll my eyes over and over again at this garbage. I guess if you're a Sci-fi lover you will find some joy in this movie, but I thought it was long, lame, and in 2 years we'll all being saying "Interstellar who?"
1.0~Awful movie. Disappointing voxseminaristae Sign in Permalink It's a shame that people are rating this movie so high. I registered just to put some sense into IMDb. I actually don't believe in the ratings of this site anymore. Possible explanation for a high rating is that people are paid to rate the movie or most people think they are geniuses if they tell their friends that they love a sci-fi mind-blowing movie even though that movie actually doesn't make sense. I love Nolan but he dropped the ball on this one. This has potential but he created a mess out of it. A lot of scientific inconsistencies, useless characters, messy plots. One of the most overrated films ever. Let's bring back some credibility in this site
1.0~Definitely the worst movie i have ever seen, complete waste of time nimrod-rokach1994 Sign in Permalink Hated every second of the movie, in order to really understand what's is going on you have to do a doctorate in physics, plus everything is going so so slowly and so dramatic! even when you do understand the movie you can see that it's not even close to the real estimates about space and time, it all changed to fit in a drama movie to make the tension. After seeing this movie i wanted to just get back in time just to never see this movie, a complete waste of time. The agony of seeing this movie! it's like the creators just tried to fill this movie with more and more Cr**. In addition the actors don't even belong to this kind of genre, their act doesn't well fit in this movie.
6.0~I am surprised why this movie is regarded as a 'great' movie. prasad-mapatuna Sign in Permalink I am fine with giving it 6 stars for entertainment value. But I am wondering why so many people think this is a great movie!? The movie is far too sentimental, clichéd and not-conforming-to-known-laws-of-physics of the known universe, to earn the status of a 'great' movie. When I say not-conforming-to-known-laws-of-physics, I am not necessarily referring to the worm-holes or time travel. I am referring to simple things like driving a truck with a flat tire through the corn fields. All in all, I like the premise this movie is built upon. Although I have put the spoiler alert in my review, I will still try not to spoil is too much and just say that "them" is nothing but future "us" is a fascinating concept. And the moral messages in the movie are pretty standard, and I am OK with that too. However, one thing bothers me. I have watched most of the top 100 movies in IMDb and I generally agree with those ratings. The current rating for this movie is not doing justice for other top movies in IMDb. All I am saying it that this does not belong in the first 100. I hope that 'anomaly in the gravity' (pun intended) will be fixed over the time.
5.0~Galactic disappointment Lele Sign in Permalink I am a big fan of Sci-Fi and I had great expectations from this movie, but I didn't like it. I'll try to explain why this movie disappointed me. ***plenty of spoilers*** 1. too long. The episode about the crazy unfrozen scientist (Matt Damon) was useless. Did they need the cliché of the 'crazy character who wants to destroy the whole thing at 3/4 of the movie'? The after ending where the main character flies (HOW???) to reach his Eve to restart human race on another planet in another galaxy. Too long prologue: even Kubrick odyssey has a shorter one! 2. too love. OK, gravitational fields can travel through time and space, but love??? This is not even wrong: is meaningless, at least in a Sci-Fi movie. What should we expect after this? The Hand of God which saves His beloved Earth? 3. too fragmented I hated the editing of scenes on Earth and on another galaxy in sequence. Imagine the sequence of Dave while killing HAL9000 interrupted by scenes on Earth showing people talking! It was fun the idea of schools rewriting history books to tell students that men never went on the Moon! 5/10
2.0~Maybe it is just me...... glance914 Sign in Permalink For me, Nolan is becoming like M Night...... He has reached that point, or some producer, where they continually push and try to top whatever was done in the past. Yes, that should entirely be the case.....but not to a point of stupidity. M Night tried to always shock, and that stupidity moment was The Happening. No pun intended, but I didn't feel that the characters really understood the Gravity of the situation, they never seemed to be bothered, and I mean really bothered about the loss of time. For example....do you think after travelling 2 years away from my kids with the prospect of never seeing them again, that I am going to accept a team mates stupidity that leads to the death of someone and the loss of 23 years? Seriously, there would be some trouble afoot!!! Do you think a character that has sat around waiting for said folks to return after 23 years would be in any state to continue with the mission? Have some coca and lets get on our way........ The killer for me was the last scene where the main character is shunned and ignored by his grand kids, and great grand kids. Yes, get out of the hospital, Murph wants to be around her family..... No one seems to truly acknowledge that the hero of the planet was of any worth, and he is pretty cool with that! I can handle he Blight, the 5 dimension, the space travel and more, I just cannot abide by inhuman behavior...... Exit by stealing a space craft with Deep Blue.......sigh.........
10.0~Superb! vyrussu Sign in Permalink well, another movie by Christopher Nolan arrives... and is a movie well done, indeed Nolan never disappoints. Is a movie that will stay in your head for long time, and for sure it's a movie that will remain in history on it's own... I don't know where to begin, the visual of the movie are just breathtaking (on earth or in space, everything is done just perfect, will make you really enjoy the movie) but audio its the one that really excels, it fit perfectly the whole movie and is very powerful and meaningful. I'm sorry for my English, i cannot describe very well what i want to say, but please go and see the movie, you will not regret a second of it... It's a movie that should set a new standard in cinema. Thank you Christopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer and the whole crew for doing this masterpiece!
5.0~More drama than sci-fi, should have been better. bill0033 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has made some great films, but alas, this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were. Here's hoping Mr. Nolan gets back on track next time out.

6.0~Ghost Protocol ghost_dog86 Sign in Permalink There are moments during "Interstellar" which may be compared to "2001: A Space Odyssey" (a better movie). There are moments during "Interstellar" which may be compared to "Prometheus" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within "Interstellar" that are completely ripped off from "Inception" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, "Interstellar" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date. This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world. OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of "Interstellar" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the "gravity" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2. Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of "Interstellar", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see "Interstellar" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up.
10.0~A fantastic movie. john-eivind Sign in Permalink This movie is excellent, and it has some great special effects. The acting was also good, i got sucked into the movie right from the start, that's what i call movie-magic. There's not many movies or producers can do this so big shout-out to Christopher Nolan! I saw no flaws to the movie and the movie is very original, i haven't seen any movie like this before, the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect. The question many people ask "How will the earth and the humans be in 100 years(or longer)" and i like how this movie shows possibilities over what can actually happen, cause nobody has any idea whats happening in a 100 years. I also like the "more than 3 dimensional" talk in it, all in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch. This movie gets 10/10 from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call them "tear" scenes and "joy" scenes, it brings you so far into the movie and its great! Written by John.
7.0~Disappears up its own black hole. BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!). Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result. For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!! And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired). If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie. 7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.
3.0~The Greatest Disappointment--A Wasted Zeitgeist anarchpatriarch Sign in Permalink Jessica Chastain asked her facebook followers if Interstellar affected their minds and hearts. Mind? No. My mind was not affected by this farcically "scientific" script. Our next big step will indeed be into interstellar waters, but my greatest fear is that humanity will treat the event as it was portrayed in this film. Awe, inspiration, humility. These are what the great enveloping dark must, should inspire. Instead, we get a movie about a wormhole that transports us to another galaxy before we've even set foot outside our solar system, and none of the characters can be bothered to muse on that fact. Do you know what a black hole can do? It has the phenomenal gravitational capacity to warp the space of a universe inside of it. Instead of that effect, which would inspire awe and humility, we get faux-metaphysical themes poorly set up by a lacking script. No, Interstellar did not affect my mind, nor heart. A mega-blockbuster had the chance to showcase to millions what we humans can find within ourselves by venturing into the cosmic arena. What do you think we got, instead?
1.0~What did I just watch? laura-jensen Sign in Permalink As others have done, I'm giving this a 1 to counter at least one absurd 10 given somewhere out there from behind a bookshelf in the fifth dimension. I won't go into the plot here, there are thousands of other reviews that have done so, I'm simply going to comment on why this movie is so not a 10 star flick. Other than Christopher Nolan stalkers loving from afar, this movie is a 3 hour exercise in endurance. Once I start to watch a movie, even for all of the faults I may find, I typically watch to the end...only with Interstellar it just wouldn't end. It was torture. I'm a huge believer that sci-fi movies are fantasy, an escape from the every day, a time to allow the improbable to take over...but they still have to make sense. The disconnect from scientific theory in this movie is of epic proportions. For example, I couldn't get over the complete avoidance of event horizon as the film wrapped up. I found myself completely irritated by this because the film relied so much on general relativity to develop the story line, and then just bastardized the entire premise of the theory so that the main character could survive was a total rip off. The acting was so over the top it was, at times, comedic. The character development was so poor that, as an example, I have no idea what Topher Grace's role even was, I was just like, "hey, Topher Grace is in this movie"? Given the fact that the viewer was offered the opportunity to visit a different GALAXY, it was a total snoozer to see that all that is out there is Waterworld, Iceland and the Grand Canyon. I could go on, but I won't. I've lost enough time in my life to this awful film.
1.0~This movie is totally ridiculous! jonnysolem Sign in Permalink First of all, why don't Matthew McConaughey use his vocal cord anymore. His talking sound comes from squeezing his throat together and it sounds like Clint Eastwood or Christian Bale, when Bale was acting in Batman. You know, sounding very tough, very super-masculine. It is really annoying. Second. This movie is made to look like a good movie, but it's not. It is a parody, a comic parody. And not such a good one. Matthew is send out in outer space to save the world. In outer space he meets with Matt Damon, who joins the movie for some minutes, probably as a quality alibi. Damon wakes up from deep sleep, made better in Alien more than 36 years ago. After five minutes his gone, blown away into outer space, made better several times before in several movies. Matthew, after a while, and between some really bad dialogs, ends miraculously up in a strange dimension made of aliens or humans from the future, made better in The Abyss 26 years ago. From there his daughter, who is years and several dimensions away, she understands everything, because Matthew uses... morse. Yes, good oldfashion morse, you know, dot dot dot line line dot dot. The whole thing is actually pretty funny, if you like really bad comic. And everything is accompanied with classical drama music, like in The Godfather. BIG SCREEN MOVE :), off course, made better so many times before. In the end the producers have made a nice scene for those who have never seen a really good movie before. And voilà, we have 8,7 on IMDb. Spooky.
3.0~Tries too hard..... chadnchady Sign in Permalink I felt like walking out of the cinemas at a few points in the movie. Don't get me wrong I like Nolan's previous films (even though Inception took a second viewing to actually appreciate it), but this doesn't come close. First of all, I like science fiction. I understand to develop new fresh plots that viewers haven't come across before, sometimes you need to push that concept envelop. However this film wasn't about science fiction, it was just 'fiction'. It had the vibe of another space film called 'contact' about 10 years ago which I thought sucked. Way too slow paced while trying to mix humanity morale on top of science. I am not going to go to the details but basically this movie suggests with the power of love, man can achieve great things - teleportation/time travel/telepathy/gravity manipulation...it goes on. The movie gets 3 stars for visuals/sound/acting. Everything else is bad. Don't go to the cinemas, save your 3 hrs and money.
8.0~Depressing but Visually Stunning. anaconda-40658 Sign in Permalink Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time. Glorious special effects are out of this world creating what science only dreams of. Score: 8 / 10
4.0~A shadow of what a masterpiece is Monkey-D-Luffy Sign in Permalink I don't know why there are so many gushing reviews of Interstellar here. Well that perplexed feeling looms over most of the contemporary movies I've watched this year. What this movie did, with its naked emotion and soaring music (some of it pretty good), is not convince me that Interstellar is a very good movie, but instead remind me of the genuinely great moments I've experienced watching other visual media. Interstellar was a conduit for me. So till now no Nolan film has dethroned Memento as the best film of the director, IMHO. Interstellar elicited few thoughts from me. I was not moved by it. But I can appreciate some of the craftsmanship that went into its making. The film was like the stream of consciousness product of a boring and blunt mind. I was not compatible for this and 99% of movies, something worrying for me if I aspire to remain a cinephile. But like I said, I could appreciate the pacing and the fact that time flew by quickly, almost 3 hours of it. Gone, like that. If only I could be part of the smiling and awestruck majority of the fandom. I think I speak for everybody when I say that nobody below the age of 10 didn't see the major twist - no other word for it - and didn't guess who the ghost was. OTOH, few people could have picked up on the importance of the watch. After that moment, when the movie was winding down, things began to look indecently glorious and silly. Too much of a happy ending, except for poor John Lithgow. The eureka moment was not one for the writing team. The concept of time travel is often smart when the time machine is not a machine. Of course, in storytelling jargon, a time machine is always a device! But this movie is very much a product of its period, and it seems geared up to be appreciated across several generations. I can't see Interstellar be waylaid by anonymity. But that's not praise from me, but simply facts. Cold hard facts, because I felt nothing. Hope this review has been useful to you.
2.0~Lame-o! mowasteph Sign in Permalink Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started... It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example. I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away) Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay "tapes from loved ones at home" across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot? Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams "That my father up there!"? Well the entire "human" aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?
8.0~Soap Rizzyay Sign in Permalink (((SPOILERS!!!))) So you like it when actors cry on screen? Then man oh man, have I got the movie of the century for you! As for me, I have nothing against a good tear every now and then. But when people cry in almost all scenes, it all starts to seem a bit pretentious. In fact, I felt like Interstellar was pressuring me to feel for the characters. When that happens, I get kinda disconnected with the movie. But it wasn't just the over-the-top display of emotions that I disliked. From the very beginning I had this strange feeling that something was wrong. And then, midway through the movie, it hit me. I had a huge revelation, something I had never noticed before: Christopher Nolan, one of the most gifted movie directors of our time, is amazingly bad at directing drama! Then I started to think about movies like Inception and Dark Knight - movies which I really enjoyed - and suddenly I realized that they don't have good drama direction either! Of course those movies aren't that much about drama, nor should they be, so this flaw has been easy to miss. But bad drama is really a major screw-up in a movie that oh so desperately wants to open up your tear channels. In fact, while the space sequences contain a lot of good stuff, the entire drama part seems to be taken from the Big Book of Hollywood clichés. Have you read that book, mr. Nolan? I think I saw it in Murph's bookshelf... What do I mean? Well, they live in a cliché farm, communicating only through cliché phrases, as if they were characters in a 19th-century book. It just didn't seem real to me. Furthermore, many of the nonverbal visual images were over-the-top sentimental and clichéd as well. And I'm not talking only about McConaughey's face while he was forcing them tears out (YET AGAIN!!!). Take the ending, for example. How much do we get to see of the new home planet? Well, the American flag is there, waving proudly in the wind, and... then it ends. Oh, a patriotic message instead of a universal one like the theme of the movie would have suggested? Call me crazy, but I really would've wanted to see something else at the climax point. Something like, I dunno, how about... THE FRIGGIN' NEW HOME PLANET?!? Furthermore, there is something seriously wrong with the rhythm and pace of the movie. No, I don't mean it was too slow. I'm talking about the pacing of individual scenes. Things like this: when they enter the wormhole, we get to see this visually stunning trip from our galaxy to another one. Well, we kinda get to see it. To be exact, we see approximately 2 seconds of this awesome wormhole jump, then 10 seconds of Matthew McConaughey's face. Then 2 seconds of jump, then 10 seconds of face. IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND, MR NOLAN! 10 seconds of jump, then 2 seconds of face. Or how 'bout this idea: don't show McConaughey's face at all! We've seen it already, we know how he looks like! I mean, why create this stunning visual moment, if ye ain't gonna show it to the audience properly?! And don't tell me its because Kubrick did a similar thing in his weird space-jump-scene in "2001", because that was supposed to be like a montage thing, to add some extra weirdness to the scene, so that one had a real purpose! Furthermore, when you get to be the first human being who enters the 5th dimension, you don't start mumbling how love guides you through that weird twisted world you found. Perhaps AFTERWARDS Cooper could've mumbled something like "maybe it was love all along that guided me". That might've worked. But not while you are experiencing something new and magnificent, something you can't quite understand. The experience should be so overwhelming that you can hardly speak! There is simply no room for preaching about love in that situation! (Especially since you are only preaching to a friggin' computer!) Furthermore, after mumbling a ton of clichés about love, how did Cooper suddenly come to the conclusion that the whole "3D-world-inside-the-5D-world" was created by humans of the future? Did love tell him that too? There was no reason for him to think that. He was like, "hey, this idea suddenly popped up to my head, so it HAS to be true!" And remember, it is the same guy who gave his daughter a huge speech about not drawing irrational conclusions until all available data was observed and analyzed! Talk about incoherent characters! *** But enough about the bad drama. Now, the movie had good elements too: -I liked the space visuals. -I liked it how Nolan tried to make all the space stuff coherent with modern science. In fact, the whole "hey-let's-jump-through-a-black-hole-into-another-dimension" -scenario actually seemed more believable than all the drama! -I liked how the theoretical parts were not dumbed down for the masses, it really allowed the movie to play creatively with the concepts of time and space. And Nolan is really good at that stuff! In fact, Interstellar would've easily made an intelligent space adventure genre movie! But I suppose Nolan had more ambitious artistic goals. And I get it! We all strive to find the limits of our talent, and... well, I think Nolan just found his. Oh, and to those comparing Nolan to Stanley Kubrick: Nolan is a good movie director, but he still lacks Kubrick's coherence greatly. And Interstellar is no "2001", even without the flaws. Heck, "2001" had major flaws as well, but it also had a grand vision that perfectly connected the plot, the themes, and the visuals into one big ball of artistic greatness. Nolan still has a long way to go.
1.0~Don't bother. paynetw Sign in Permalink Matthew mumbles his way through this movie. It would have been bearable without him in it. If you can cope with mumbling unbearable dialogue from the main character then go for it. I watched the entire movie, but lost the will to live after 10 mins. The movie was nowhere as clever as some of the reviews I've read would make you believe. This of course is my personal opinion, I like to be entertained, I don't like having to put my ear next to my sound bar, just to try to make out what Cooper is saying. Matthew kills the role of Cooper.. If you're after fast paced movie action then look away. If you're after some long drawn-out movie that goes nowhere then this is for you.. Enjoy.
6.0~Overrated dvigrad1 Sign in Permalink I won't give it a 1 to even things up a little, I give it a 6 which is real. Maybe 6.5 but 7 would be a stretch. I'm disappointed with a film that I waited for so long, with a great title that was waisted. Interstellar should have been a masterpiece, with, well, a lot of Interstellar traveling. The duration is just to long, especially the first part, which brings nothing extra to the story. It's just to stretched out trying to bring I don't know what. A feel of 2001 maybe, but 2001 is in another galaxy for this one. I didn't like Inception either, so maybe it has got to be something with Nolan. I'm a sci-fi fan, but today everyone's trying to make sci-fi, but they don't succeed. They are doing it wrong! District 9 was the last good sci-fi I watched. Interstellar has got great visuals, I give it that, but Gravity had more (another film that sucked big time). I wouldn't watch it again.
10.0~Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight and Inception RossRivero99 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is by far 2014's best science fiction as well as being one of the best science fiction movies of all time along with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), Star Wars (1977) (along with The empire strikes back (1980)), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Avatar (2009), Minority Report (2002), Gravity (2013), The Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and all three of the Iron Man movies (2008-2013). Out of all the movies that I just listed it reminds me of Grvity when it comes to the emotions of the characters but this movie telling more of a story, and as well as 2001 when it comes to the visuals.The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a farmer whose daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy)notice that there is drought and famine that leads to dust storms and then they are led to NASA where they will meet a man named Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) who convinces Cooper to go on the mission to save earth and he then agrees to it but hates the feeling of leaving his children behind without seeing them grow up for many years but luckily they have their grandfather (played by John Lithgow) who watches them for the rest of his life. Christopher Nolan's direction and his script (co-written by his brother Jonathan Nolan) are just perfect for the movie to have, and not only that but even Hans Zimmer's suspenseful score is amazing. At this past Oscars ceremony this movie got 5 well deserved Oscar nominations but the only Oscar that it went off with was for visual effects when I think it deserved a whole lot more in my personal opinion. Even the cast delivers great and top notch performances not only from McConaughey, Caine, and Lithgow, but also from Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo as the principal that his kids went to school to, William Devane (who appears on the Rosland Capital commercials) and one of the people who work at NASA, Matt Damon, Topher Grace, and David Gyasi as one of the crew members on the mission. The final scene in this movie was complicated but harrowing at the same time where Murph (this time played by the legendary Ellen Burstyn) is in the hospital when Cooper is 124 years old but is still young. This is one of 2014's very best films.
5.0~ludicrous story and too sentimental krzysiektom Sign in Permalink I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstallar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that "love is the only thing (a "thing"??) which overcomes time and space". Corny and retarded, and very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach. I guess the film will be nominated at least for special effects and musical score, but it is certainly not a masterpiece.
10.0~Rage against the dying of the light. twominds79 Sign in Permalink I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost. Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember. Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers. I laughed , Cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. An instant 10/10 that gets better on viewing. I can't stress how much I recommend this film. Drop what you're doing!!
1.0~Got tricked by paid reviews neojav Sign in Permalink I watched this movie yesterday. I was very excited after reading so many perfect 10 star reviews for this movie so I was expecting a perfect movie, really! Before I continue, I must say I really love sci-fi movies, and I am deeply interested in black holes, time travel, wormholes, interstellar traveling. Wow, I couldn't think twice, this could be the perfect fit for me! I had really high expectations. For the entire movie I was feeling like: "the best part of the movie should soon", but never came. I had hard time understanding what was really happening, and too many minutes of the movie were badly wasted in dramatic scenes of love, confusing speeches, formulas. All I wanted to see was the wormhole travel, spacetime and gravity distortion, galaxies, nebulae, etc. I mean, I wanted to see what is in the deep space, and what could be human life in a planet million light years away from us. SPOILERS AHEAD Maybe the movie drove me nuts, or I lost interest, but after they crossed into the new galaxy, all I felt was confusion. I never understood what was really happening, what were they rescuing, what were those 3 planets and how they knew too much about them, why was there a black hole? Even I tried hard connecting every scene and plot in the movie, I failed. What I disliked the most was the fact that the feeling of discovering something AMAZING and new was not successfully transmitted to us. I wanted to feel that great emotion of discovering deeps space but I failed. Instead the characters talked about crazy physics and plans to save humanity. Not to mention the multi-plot scenes after the fight, totally no sense. Please don't get tricked by this website and fake reviews ad I did. This is reason I signed up at IMDb (first review), to warn others. The idea of the movie is fantastic, but poorly developed and acted, totally confusing, too much cliché. Watch it but don't have high expectations as me, you will be disappointed.
3.0~Nolan's worst movie by far muz-13 Sign in Permalink I was excited for this movie. I liked pretty much all of Nolan's previous movies and I love sci-fi. Judging from the reviews, I was expecting something similar to the quality and entertainment of Inception. What I got was probably one of the most boring movies I've seen on cinema. The movie is unnecessary long, the dialogs are predictable and make you laugh, and the subject of the movie (which btw is not interstellar traveling) has been done several time before (awfully usually). We get it. Family is important, love is valuable. This is not a sci-fi movie, this is his is a family movie about a father's love for his children. I will not go into details to avoid spoilers, but there were about 10 minutes after the first slow hour that got me excited for the rest of the movie, but it was only a break and we were back to boredom and more crying by McConaughey. I found the acting pretty bad, which I guess is a result of the awful script, since I liked McConaughey's acting on Dallas Buyers Club (and partially on true detective).
2.0~Feel-stupid movie of the century. Bauer08 Sign in Permalink Do you enjoy getting a root canal? Do you like watching paint dry? Do you easily tear up hearing sappy dialogue tugging at your heartstrings? Do you feel your life is too action-packed and needs an injection of boredom? Do you loathe scientific accuracy? Do you like church organs and Matt Damon? If the answer to all of the above is a resounding "yes!", then Interstellar is the perfect movie for you! Somewhere in the near future, the World is in dire straits and our food resources are quickly running out. We need a bold and brilliant idea to save the human race, and we need it NOW. So we call Matthew McConaoughoughuoaughey, who plays a cool, whispering, southern crop- dusting farmer (yeah, it's one of his more challenging roles) who apparently used to be an astronaut. No need to train him or do any tests of any sort - we just let him captain human kind's last hope and put him on a space ship the next day. Yup, no big black plot holes there. Apparently humanity is now able to navigate black holes - but are unable to create a robot that doesn't look like a ridiculous Tetris brick, and isn't as impractical as jumping out of a plane only wearing a cocktail dress. Also, we can't find solutions to an immediate and alarming famine that threatens to wipe out humanity - but we have the means to send people to far regions of space, have invented cryostasis and a bunch of other 23rd century gadgets. Oh, and don't bother trying to make sense of the whole premise, that the world is in dire need of help NOW - yet our top scientist sends humanity's last hope on a mission built on a false premise, that he knows will fail, and most likely will take many decades to complete. No. Just DON'T question that! Just like the people back on Earth, you will grow about 90 years older watching this movie. It may sound a bit harsh, I know - but consider spending close to three hours listening to Matthew "Can I take my szszszshirt off?" McConaughey trying to be cool while lisping and vocal frying his way through space (yes, the way he has done the past 10 movies he made). While he's busy doing that, an amazingly inept and irksome Anne Hathaway makes it hard not to put your fist through the screen, or pull out the last strands of hair you have left. And just as I thought things couldn't possibly get any better; Matt Damon suddenly pops up as a "welcome" surprise. Thankfully, they didn't credit him on IMDb, so all of us who enjoy the incredible range of Mr. Damons two facial expressions had the pleasure of this amazing cameo "gift". Thank you SO much. And the music? Nolan went for a quiet soundscape, so he asked Hans Zimmer to only score about 1/3 of the movie. So naturally, Zimmer filled that third with a church organ, mixed so perfectly that at times it's impossible to even hear the dialogue. I have absolutely no idea why people find this movie praise-worthy. I honestly don't. I guess Nolan is the M. Night Shyamalan of the decade: Remember "6th sense"? Everybody praised that movie and the following few movies he created for being different, thought- provoking etc. Then came a slew of incomprehensible flicks, where all we got was building suspense, scary music andwell, that was basically it. Slowly the vast majority of former M. Night fans began to understand what others saw from the get-go: That you can only fool people into believing that what you're making is brilliant art for so long. After a while they will stop "interpreting" your work - and see it for what it is: Pretty much nothing. The Emperor's New Clothes all over again. But that's the thing; when served nonsense, some people will interpret their confusion as being in the presence of a great director. Others will call it they way they see it: non-sensical. Don't get me wrong; I like some of Nolan's work. I never understood Inception, and it left me cold - but at least the cinematography was beautiful. With his Batman movies he upped the ante of the whole superhero genre by combining great action with believable character development. Interstellar does none of that. Even the cinematography is bland, especially considering the possibilities and tools available to directors nowadays. I can think of nothing more mind-boggling than space travel, yet Nolan manages to completely underwhelm our visual sense with the imagery in this movie. If you liked "Gravity", chances are you are going to love "Interstellar". If you happened to think "Gravity" was an absolute insult to anyone with an IQ over 90, or anyone who has seen more than two movies in their entire life - then "Interstellar" will be 3 very long hours. On the other hand, you can watch the movie while kicking your shin really hard against a coffee table. That might remove focus from the pain - of watching the movie. If you're into shrooms or meth, this movie will most likely make more sense to you - depending on how much you take. I'm giving this movie 5 stars, mostly for comic value. Then I subtract 1 star because Anne Hathaway's character is so unfathomably inept, 1 star for McConaughey's annoying whistling lisp and perpetual difficulty making sense while trying to sound cool, and 1 star for the sheer presence of Matt Damon. Like a black hole, that guy can suck any and all life and believability out of any scene or movie without even trying. 2 stars. You're welcome. PS: They all meet George Clooney's ghost at the end.
4.0~Deja vu lale-ba Sign in Permalink For God's sake people, cut with your praises. Anyone who has read or seen any of the Space odyssey books/films will be bored to death watching this cheap and hollow ripoff of the story about space and time travel, alien intelligence and human/robot interfacing. The theme itself is fascinating, but the story and character development simply doesn't exist. Cuts are done with a chainsaw, story is full of holes and the twist at the end isn't as nearly dramatic as in previous Nolan's flicks. Cast is really, really terrible, lead by the Matt Daaaaaamon. Design is truly non innovative, production of the space movie looks really cheap and Zimmer's music is totally offbeat. There are some good things as well, like the scene with the video messages, or the ending design of the library scene. However, two scenes is really not nearly enough for a such hugely anticipated movie that comes from such an outstanding director. Although I consider myself a big CN fan, I must sadly admit that the Hollywood has ran him over and that his career is in a steep decline following Inception.
2.0~Turgid concatenation of sci-fi clichés percyporcelain Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan does sci-fi... to which I feel like saying to this hitherto great director, don't bother! The cinematography is great but that's about it, otherwise it's like 2001, Blade Runner and Star Trek all thrown into a blender with a shot of gratuitous emotional hysteria carved out of a soap opera sub-plot, or perhaps left over from Ann Hathaway's Les Mis histrionics. Meanwhile Matthew McConaughey croaks away like some Field-of-Dreamsesque sharecropper catapulted into space for no obvious reason like it's a case of mistaken identity or something. Way too long and all but the most hardened space cadets will bale out before re-entry.
3.0~In one word: Boring!! wim-mortelmans2 Sign in Permalink I do not know why anyone likes this movie. I have seen many SF movies and had high expectations when going to the theatre. Such a big disappointment. Clearly the director tries to remake the Stanley Kubrick movie, "2001, a Space Oddessey". A failure however. Yeah some spectacular images of Saturn...but that is not sufficient. Really nothing happens and the characters are not really believable. For me a waste of money and time... I gave it a 3 for the special effects but the storyline is hardly worth a 2/10...
1.0~Worst High-Profile Movie Of Recent Years, Utterly Overrated oliversk7 Sign in Permalink In short: I have watched over a 1000 movies and TV shows and consider this one of the worst high-budget movies of recent years. In fact, it is one of the only movies I walked out on after 30 minutes. If you are interested in a Space opera, watch Defying Gravity instead, a low-budget production that easily outshines this horrible Hollywood production and actually has some believable characters, believable science and raises some deeper questions. Please note a few spoilers ahead. Excuse the mistakes, I wrote it in a rush 1 First Things First: The Unrealistic Science & Plot holes A film that talks about science and attempts to be somewhat believable (and yes the films try to at least appear realistic one some level) should not have to deal with such absurdities: 1) A planet with 70 miles high waves one the one hand and areas where you can walk in 1-feet deep water close by? Absolutely ridiculous. 2) One of the biggest and laughable points for any Sci-Fi fan is the time difference on a planet in a different universe compared to Earth. Landing on a planet cannot magically change time, whereas transitioning through a space-time tunnel aka wormhole might. And if that planet was close to the blackhole then the blackhole would simply tear the planet apart. The movie either got it completely mixed up or failed to properly explain it. Either way, the fact is, the entire plot is flawed and it shows. 3) There are countless more plot holes and problems that I will not address here, you can find countless reviews online that address the many plot holes All of that would have been acceptable to me, but then there's the cast: Both McConaughey and and Anne Hathaway are extremely poor choices for the roles. 2 Worst Cast For A Hollywood Movie Ever? Emotionless McConaughey And Hathaway As A Scientist - Who Are You Kidding Hollywood? McConaughey failed to provoke any emotions in the audience: In one scene Cooper is leaving his family and it's completely emotionless and the scene itself has less than 5-minutes on screen-time. Where the hell is the struggle? A guy leaving his family would struggle for days unless he was a passionate, driven explorer. It did not feel like a struggle at all. And if that character was such an adventurous, passionate explorer then they set this character (Cooper) up completely wrong. Either way, casting a 46-year old McConaughey for this role was just an extremely poor choice and they only made this casting choice to get more viewers!! How do you expect a 46-year old to display that kind of passion? He's an actor sure, but at that age you can't realistically portray a character who's leaving his family to rescue the planet. It should have been a 30-year old guy with some kind of burning fire, not that old worn-out character who's still bearing the visible marks of portraying a half-dead guy in Dallas Buyers Club (respect for going through that). Then there's Ann Hathaway, a women who could be some kind of super model who they are trying to sell as a scientist. Sorry guys, but if you do such a poor job at casting, I can't take this film seriously. 3 Horrible Pacing After the first 30-minutes the movie was dead. No emotion, no struggle. Stupid dialogues that provoked absolutely no feelings at all. Characters I would never care about raised trivial questions. Horrible. The pacing of the beginning was so horrible that it destroyed everything - how are you supposed to take a character serious who's not even struggling to leave his family. Oh god, do they really not know that it takes time to build a bond with the audience? 4 Good Reviews Bought? Tons of plot holes, bad pacing, poor cast, etc... What's more, this movie fails to raise any interesting questions the audience hasn't already asked countless times before. Where's that ground-breaking question you could ponder over for days as was the case with classics like 'The Matrix'? For a movie with a 8.8 rating I was expecting some bigger questions and characters that actually get under my skin and not this emotionless movie with a poor cast, plot holes. Now imagine the budget they had for this movie ($165,000,000) and compare it to similar low-budget productions such as Defying Gravity that excel at provoking emotions and still get canceled. The questions raised in Defying Gravity were so much more interesting and the characters so much more believable. I wouldn't shed a single tear watching this crap. And it's not like I am some emotionless bastard. I have cried watching shows like AMC's excellent "Halt And Catch Fire" or HBO's "Game of Thrones", because the cast is usually outstanding and are simply well chosen for their roles. Anne Hathaway and McConaughey were poor choices and it shows. It shows that this was a money-grab. There will be some people who may be able to connect with the characters. Good for them. They may not have seen many movies before and/or are not familiar with the topic, but as a seasoned Sci-Fi fan you will regret buying this one.
10.0~You will love it or hate it Robert_Escamilla Sign in Permalink OK, I've just seen Interstellar and I can tell it's one of those movies that you either love or hate. Personally I loved it and probably I'm going to watch it again to process it a little bit more. It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film. Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an "Outer Space Film" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to "calibrate" the experience. Which is very cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it.
1.0~Am I missing something? radhrh Sign in Permalink For the life of me I cannot understand how this movie has received an 8.8 rating, nor can I understand Mathew McConaughey, he mumbles his way through the movie in such a thick Texas drawl that English sub tittles are required. Not that he has anything interesting to say, nor do any of the other characters for that matter. So, lets have a look at the plot. The World has become pretty much uninhabitable due to some kind of climate change which has forced everyone to quit their jobs and become farmers. The only solution to this problem is to send a rocket into space to locate a suitable planet for colonisation. However everybody still drives around in massive gas guzzling SUVs, is there something wrong with this picture? In the normal run of events it would be impossible to travel the distances required to find another inhabited planet, however a worm hole has been located somewhere near Saturn which will facilitate interstellar travel. Its explained that this worm hole has not just appeared, but rather it was placed there by some unspecified entity who is watching out for the human race. So, this unspecified entity has watched the human race make a complete horlicks of one perfectly good planet and now wants to give us the opportunity to do the same on another world? Much hokum ensues regarding relativity and the way 1 hour for the astronauts is 10 years back on Earth etc. and it turns out in the end that it all has something to do with love but by the time they come to this conclusion I had lost interest.... The visual effects aren't all that special, seen it all before. In fact I think the effects in "2001, ASO" which this film is so earnestly trying to emulate, were superior if not in their execution than certainly in their creative vision. In conclusion then, a plot holier than a month of Sundays, a leading man to whom English is a second language, nonsense dialogue and rather unimaginative visual effects adds up to 8.8? I don't think so....
1.0~S T A Y ... away from this movie Ketzer Sign in Permalink !Spoilers! I sacrificed myself, by entering a black hole in my spacesuit, endured a LSD trip of love to send you this singular message, not for me but for the good of mankind. This is a movie which literally gets worse by the minute. Should your cinema be graceful and insert a break, USE IT, get out, the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years. You'll probably realized the "heartwarming" end to it already anyway. Apparently mankind was able to master robotics and an AI worthy of Star Trek but still uses current spaceships. Except when they don't somewhat later cause, you know, it just wouldn't have worked with all that landing and launching on other planets. Also it wouldn't have been impossible to send probes to the planets, because ... well, that wasn't in the script either. It was however possible, to think that a planet orbiting a gigantic black hole so close to its event horizon, that one hour stretches to seven years, might be a hospitable place to found a new civilization. Apart from all that nonsense reality like being sucked into it or getting grilled by gamma rays. So I have wasted several hours, and even some minutes more to write this, but if it saves one soul from enduring this ....
1.0~Never get this 3 hours back vick79-556-121134 Sign in Permalink I absolutely hate when people are trying to sell their st@pid ideas as fantastic to the public. This is what happened here in this movie. Not going to list all the fake, unbelievable events and happenings in the movie, you can read it in other 1 reviews. Have to say most of the public who find it amazing are dumb@sses who have no clue about science or even how to put together a good story. Don't even try to understand what's happening because it doesn't make sense and it's obvious the writer doesn't have a monkey about space and stars. Who is this Nolan to write script about this topic? Is he educated in space science? Did he even contact some professors before he put together his dumb ideas? Absolutely not believable, and boring, and annoying, and etc. One of the worst crew I've seen in terms of chemistry or even regarding individual performances. Matthew looked horrible throughout the whole movie AND ORANGE. Looked funny next to Anne with her white pale skin. Anyways Matthew is not a person who is pleasant to look at for 2-3 hours. He aged quite badly, would never believe he had anything to do with science in his life. His square head and orange skin plus the wrinkles were sooo annoying. Not much actor quality either. Anne Hathaway tried to look like a 13 year old boy and she never looked more ugly. Never expected much actress performance from her but she didn't even need it as her role was what? Crying? Haha. Jessica Chastain is usually great, but even her reactions were forced, her face was ugly and just annoying. I could say this about everybody else except maybe for Casey who was the only one believable in his role. Funny enough he played an abusive character. The make up, hair, looks, were horrible for everybody. The space environment.... looked seriously plastic and so so cheap. Obviously very low quality did not believe for 1 sec they were in the space. Or another planet. I could put together these scenes from cutting papers. Ultimately Im really disappointed in the quality of the audience as if this is what they need and what they value as 10, then there's really something horrible happening to our planet and maybe we don't need to be saved! Nolan sold it, good for him, but it does not mean he did a quality job in any way. What a load of BS for 3 hours!
1.0~Best comedy gonzaloetjo Sign in Permalink I can say many things of this movie, but let me just resume one part: An astronaut enters a blackhole in a spaceship from the XXI century, a blackhole, that as all blackholes, has so much gravity that it sucks even light into it compresing it. This spaceship doesn't compress because it must be made of some strange material harder than a blackholes gravity force (a force that far away makes 1 hour relative to 7 years in distance). The astronaut doesn't die, aldo he gets out of his amazingly strong spaceship, but instead, arrives to his multidimensional daughters bethroom. Yes. Apparently because of love and a multydimensional trip. Then he proceds to sends her "cuantum data", this hight tech robot -that also enters the black hole- gives him, via morse code to her watch so she can save humanity. OK.
6.0~How stupid they think we are? gogga1011 Sign in Permalink Thanks to good critics and media hype I've decided to get rid off of 3 hours of my life. Sadly, most of the movie I was bored. Story is so shallow and predictable - in very beginning I concluded that her's father is writing those messages (every average sci-fi reader knows some theories of black-hole), and movie has some serious intellectual and emotional issues. First of all, Matthew McC. is solid actor, but he isn't charismatic as Al Pacino or even Tom Cruise. He is always the same. Same face, same grimaces, same tone. And now... he is flying in a spaceship through the whole space and boarding space station without problems after 10 or 15 years of inactivity... are you serious?? How stupid you think we are? And cryogenic sleep - they are immediately ready to go after it and jumping around like jolly rabbits? All characters aren't written well. They are very plane and somewhat emotionally distracted. At the end - Matthew is coming after the greatest achievement in human history, I repeat: greatest achievement in human history - but nobody even look at him..??? HALLOOOOOO??? All in all, it would be a lot better movie if they cut bullshits, and give us more "space-feeling" (something like those in Space Odyssey or Gravity), sound and vision, and turn actors in real human beings. Purposely, I didn't talk about some scientific imperfections, because we don't know much about anything. Even serious scientists changing their mind every few weeks, from ordinary things to black hole, they aren't sure in almost anything. Maybe it is stupid premise that man from the future is sending coordinates to go in space, although he at first said himself not to go? But hey, this is just a movie. So, I will not bother you with things that may or may not be scientific true and are in writers domain. But sadly, I must recognize that even after FORTYSIX YEARS Hollywood isn't capable of producing so massive, magnificent and intellectually thrilling space-movie as Kubrick's Space Odyssey was! Yeah, good old Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke... made it in 1969, and that masterpiece is still immense! Shame on you, greedy Hollywood bastards. Thumb down.
4.0~Good, but with clear flaws that almost make this movie unwatchable f440221 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a great concept for a movie. Exploring space is a wet dream, and it becomes especially dirty when your race is dying out at the same time, and you don't have enough resources to really be ethical about it. The premise, however, is... quite, how should I say this..? stupid. Somehow, everything that you can eat, except humans, is going extinct because of some super disease(?). They only have corn left. Despite years of scientific advancements, humans have not figured out how to properly manipulate genes. Don't get me wrong, they keep doing it. It just doesn't seem to work as in real life. So the humans figure that they need a new planet. Here's where it gets really dumb. Okay, so you need a new planet? And are you sure this planet has food that you can digest? How likely is it that you're gonna find a planet that has food, that you can eat, and that can be found by one of 10 different shuttles shot off into different directions in space? Answer: Virtually IMPOSSIBLE. Okay sure, let's say that they don't expect to find food, just a habitat that they can live in. Then what are they going to do with the super disease??? How is it not going to murderize all your corn when you bring it to this new planet? So right off the bat, this movie makes no sense. I was about to just walk out and bang my head against a wall for half an hour right before they got into space. Now this is where it starts to get good! They get to a pretty stupid planet, and then right after that there's a moment that simply gets 10/10 from me (I won't go into too much detail here). This is of course ruined by the fact that a couple of minutes later they have an argument. Anne Hathaway wants to go to the planet with the best properties, Matthew McConaughey wants to go the planet with the worst properties. Why? Well, because the guy who went there and recorded the data was the mission leader. So they do what Matthew McConaughey thinks because, hey why not. Of course this all ends in disaster and they blow up their main ship, the black guy dies, and then Anne Hathaway is sent to the planet with the best properties, which of course is habitable, and Matthew McConaughey has the acid trip of his life. Then some stuff happens and it's over. This movie is a roller-coaster. It goes from being the dumbest movie I've ever seen to being one of the best movies I've ever seen multiple times during its screen time. When McConaughey was tripping balls in space, I just felt like they should've given me a heads up to bring a bong to the theater. I have very mixed feelings about this one. It's an extremely flawed masterpiece. So flawed that it doesn't resemble a masterpiece at all.
1.0~Simply Terrible moviesfourall Sign in Permalink After reading some of the reviews, i thought this might be alright to watch. I suppose if you look at what movies has been coming out in the last couple of years it might rate a bit above some. Near the start of the movie you see them get a flat tyre, and sure enough when they get out and check it it is flat. Then they jump back into the truck too follow a drone, and hey presto the tyre is only half flat. I should have turned it off then, but i kept watching in the hope it would get better. Well the only time that i could understand what Matthew McConaughey was saying was when he was speaking out loud, and that wasn't very often. And there was so much in the movie that they could have cut out without being missed, so it just drags along at a snails pace. I really enjoyed the concept, but this one just fails to entertains. I'm glad it only cost me $2 at the rental store too watch.
9.0~Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY george.schmidt Sign in Permalink INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!
2.0~An 8.8 rating? For Garbage? zzyzx000-124-271558 Sign in Permalink I would have given this the 1 it deserves but since it's not based on an actual event I cut them some slack. I'm so glad that Einstein figured out the principals of relativity. Most of the people I meet still think the world revolves around them. Then Einstein played the "what if" game with Physics. What if you could travel near the speed of light and take a trip, blah, blah, blah. You can't. They can't. Here's where the 8.8 rating comes from. People want to believe almost anything that is impossible. This movie is garbage. I'm not humorless. Time travel is garbage too but I enjoyed the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy. It was funny and kinda clever. Not this rag. Save your money and remember: your life clock is ticking and there's no way you're going to recover an of it that you spend, in this case 3 hours.
5.0~Nope, Not Quite Mike_Yike Sign in Permalink I saw this movie at a 2nd run theater so I'm a little behind, but my review is still valid, just late. The best thing about the movie were the special effects. They were really good. The trouble is; these days most special effects are really good. At the risk of dating myself, there isn't much Claymation out there anymore. Right near the beginning, the main character, Cooper, happens along the NASA launch site hidden near his farm. It just so happens that Cooper is the perfect pilot for the space adventure. I mean; what are the odds? The movie features a lot of time travel, black holes etc. There is a part near the end where Cooper is stuck in some kind of time warp or another dimension, and while in his spacesuit he is caught in an odd limbo behind his daughter's book shelf. I'd explain it to you with greater understanding, but I do not have a greater understanding. The film was a little bit of 2001; A Space Odyssey, a dash of Gravity, and a little bit of Apollo 13. One surprise was the obligatory talking robot never turned evil. I was about equal parts entertained, and annoyed by the movie, which does not make it worth recommending.
1.0~Ouch! A painful journey through space, time and love. sean-in-tx Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying, I'm certain I would more than struggle to make a better film. I am humbled by the energy, love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes. I also consider myself a huge fan of the Nolan brothers. Following, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling. For years, Christopher Nolan has worked literal movie magic, telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning, yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded. Interstellar begins no different. Nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise. But unlike previous masterpieces, Interstellar drags the audience on a painful, bumpy ride through space, time, love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder. The rest, simply insulted, wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes. "Stay," a message delivered by Cooper to his daughter across space and time, and yes, we knew it was him all along. "Stay," the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear. "Stay home." It's safe and warm. Revisit Memento, The Prestige or Inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again. Perhaps next time the Nolans will deliver on that hope. Until then, "Stay away" from Interstellar.
1.0~hate rather fan boys hasank Sign in Permalink just hate Nolan; or Nolan-lovers should I say! constant bombardment of science humbug (correspondence to theory is not the point). contrast it with the silence of 2001! contrast it with the film it tries to imitate. Now an average sci-fi story is elevated into the rank of greatest films, without even a solid cinematic base, except those visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise. You science-geniuses all needed this information overload to accept a not-even average story as a cinematic masterpiece. How I hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside Battlefield Earth or Armageddon etc., when the Nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade away.
1.0~watch if your local pharmacy has run out of nytol. ultrapoi Sign in Permalink it seems that most people write their very first review after seeing the worst film of their lives, or after seeing the best. this is my first, driven to review to give a more honest rating and review than a 9.1. if you want to learn about physics, watch a documentary. if you want to be bored out of your mind for hours on end, then go and see interstellar. lead character mumbles 80% of the time (i thought it was just my hearing after being blasted with noise during the film at first). the use of sound is clever the first time, brash and loud, then deadly silent. but then it quickly becomes over used. scenes are so long and drawn out, this seems like a film a director wanted to make for his own viewing and ego. anne hathaway just looks tearful (you know the scene in snow white when she wandering about the forest scared of everything?) all of the time. I've never walked out of a film, and sadly couldn't this time (i didn't want to disturb the sleeping people around me you see...). if id been on an aisle seat, id have been gone after an hour. its not that the film is 'too clever', its just utterly boring.
3.0~Stupidity on a Grand Scale fung0 Sign in Permalink If this movie were set in, say, the Wonderful Land of Oz, it might stand up as a lightweight fantasy. Very lightweight. But dressed in the trappings of science fiction, it's simply appalling. True, it does look purdy, with all that computer graphic stuff slathered all over the screen. And it does tell a story, of sorts: the dad who wants to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter. It actually could have worked. But the story meanders for hours and hours, and any semblance of logic is completely abandoned after the trip through the wormhole, making it very hard to care what happens. Just one example: the takeoff from Earth requires a multi-stage rocket on the scale of the Saturn V. The takeoff from a planet "near the black hole," (!) with "gravity greater than Earth's" is handled effortlessly by a tiny shuttlecraft. The movie is filled with similar lapses in basic logic. The final events near (and inside!) the black hole are so completely lacking in scientific plausibility that they'd seem embarrassing in a ten-cent comic book. In a multi-hundred-million-dollar epic, the complete disregard of all known science borders on criminal. On the positive side, Interstellar is a better film than Gravity. The science is equally implausible, but the story doesn't depend on the science quite so obviously. Nonetheless, the popularity of feeble junk like this makes a sad comment on the state of knowledge and tastes in our 21st-century society.
2.0~Morse codes on a bookshelves the way how a superior intelligence communicates... peci-89549 Sign in Permalink Apart from some nice pictures the whole plot is rubbish. It supposed to be an intelligent SCI-FI, but with that story it is just a dull CGI movie. Yes, you have to travel through a wormhole to reach your bookshelves back to make your loved ones completely frightened during their entire lives in order to send them a very-very urgent message from the future after decades passed by tossing the books down as Morse codes... The post-apocalyptic scene is also dull. Fungus everywhere. No cure, no water all over the world. (Hey, what happened with global melting of ice caps?) So why it is so high rated? I do not understand. It is even not exciting like the Martian.
1.0~overblown/overlong/overrated grumpy-3 Sign in Permalink His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover.
8.0~Not Nolan on his A Game arnieiam Sign in Permalink Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings. His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty. I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time. However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time. I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry.
2.0~Capitalizing on people's crave for stupidity arminhage Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is either stupid or takes advantage of people's crave for stupidity. The movie was so bad that I don't know where to begin. 1. In the beginning of the movie we have a world with frequent sandstorms (or lets say that we see an state in US Midwest). Apparently there is no army anymore, we do not know what year is it exactly, we do not know what has happened to earth, We do not know Cooper's background. We never get any answers but some very vague clues... A clever director could skillfully embed the answers in the screenplay and make the movie more pleasant and engaging. The whole idea is that the climate on parts of earth may escalate to the down side but it can not affect the whole planet which most of its surface is covered with water and even based on what we saw in the movie, the planet was not in such a bad condition to summon extreme measures like leaving it. 2. Cooper is an ex something who is farmer now. Based on strange phenomenon in his daughter's room, he discovers a coordinate. He jumps in his truck and goes there to get arrested, to meet familiar people from his past and to get the job offer!!! Like there was no pilots and they were just making the spaceship without a pilot and now God sent them Cooper! At that moment that Professor Brand asked him to pilot the ship, I felt I was watching Alibaba and Forty thieves of Baghdad! It was that cheesy and unfortunately the cheesiness happened way early in the movie. 3. We assume they made it into the wormhole in. After that in theory, all the communication with earth should cease as no means of wireless communication can follow them into the wormhole. Granted that they emerged out of the wormhole somewhere else in this physical world but it can be millions of light years away from earth. Nothing can travels faster than light, if you are millions of light years away, or even hundreds of light years away, that simply means that you will not get any signal from earth in your lifetime even if 1 minute of your time is a year o earth. It just doesn't make sense. I think they tried to described how they communicate but it was so stupid that I can't even remember. 4. In the beginning of the journey, a huge 3 stages rocket launched the spaceship into earth's orbit but later on, they land on a planet with gravity 1.5 times stronger than earth and they manage to get off the planet without the rocket??? 5. The robot was probably the most stupid. Actually it was so bad that they never really showed any details. The way it was laying in the spaceship reminded me of R2-D2 in star wars but R2-DD2 was making sense... this one? it reminded me of Spongebob at best! 6. They keep talking about starting a human colony by cloning human genes. No one is talking about plant seeds or animal genes as apparently the humans in such colony are supposed to eat rock and sand! 7. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST! THE PLAN A!!!!!!!! Oh my God, this is where i got offended. Plan A means relocating billions of people from earth to a distant planet. Apparently the professor knew it was bullshit but if Cooper was not smart enough to slap him in face for saying such nonsense, I do not know who would trust hims to pilot a spaceship? Nolan tried hard to recreate something like the Space Odyssey 2001 but the closest he got was the music of the movie! Worth watching but very stupid and forgettable.
10.0~A masterpiece... emi8486 Sign in Permalink I admit it took time to open my mind and see this movie knowing that this is a science fiction, contrary to my expectation of a non- fiction depiction of what astronauts and physicists and innovators do to give us a better understanding of what lies out there. That and having Matthew McConaughey as the lead is all I have when I sat down for this movie. And I am so ashamed! I should have known better. I couldn't help being reminded by The Dark Knight upon seeing Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway. The Batman trilogy just happened to be my favorite of movies. And then I thought of Inception. Like those movies, I was completely blown away by this film's every situation, always anticipating even in the slightest action and attentive to every conversation. And, man, my "suspicion" was confirmed at the end of the movie! That explains everything!!! I will never ever regret spending my 2 hours and 45 minutes on this movie which made me feel almost every sort of emotion. Christopher Nolan is no doubt a genius in giving us movies worth our time and money, and emotions. What he did with Interstellar is an achievement and seeing this film is a milestone. Did I mention I am a very big fan of NASA, astronomy, space exploration and Christopher Nolan? Combining them all turned out to be a tremendous success! I'd say Matthew McConaughey's performance is memorable. A father's promise and love knows no space, time or dimension. Anne Hathaway's determination to follow her heart is uncontainable. The screenplay? Fantastic and scientifically accurate as possible! Music? Original. Thank you Hans Zimmer! Visual effects? Very realistic! Satisfaction is guaranteed. Interstellar is a masterpiece and Christopher Nolan is the maestro.
6.0~Pretentious, self-important and void of fun areatw Sign in Permalink 'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment. Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time. Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun. In fact it's void of anything that will make you change your expression. This is just one long, pretentious and self-important film that isn't anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest.
3.0~meh... franzuain Sign in Permalink Is like watching the movie Ghost, but in space... Always disappointing endings.. so much time, money, research and technology to tell a story of a guy who goes to space and can communicate with his daughter trough a wristwatch.. very very disappointed.. Im a big fan of sci fi movies (not talking about xmen, or fantastic four or even star trek..) and this movie together with gravity are the two most disappointing films I've seen in the last years.. I believe that The Signal was a much better movie, with a real story to tell.. Stop making bad movies and start telling real stories.. you have the money to do it.. 9/10 IMDb rating?? I rather watch Two and a Half men with Ashton Kutcher.. no, just kidding...
2.0~Anti-science fiction spukmeyer Sign in Permalink This movie is incorrectly classified as science fiction. It is actually anti-science fiction and, by the way, in all other matters a serious insult to any person's intelligence. The problem with directors these days, even supposedly talented ones like Nolan, is that they try to appeal to everyone and end up appealing to no body. Big money talks louder I guess. Damn you Hollywood. But what pisses me off about this movie is its anti-scientific and anti-technological approach. The subliminal message, that perhaps makes most Nolan fan-boys mentally masturbate about, is that you should not care about rationality, you have to use the power of LOVE and screw logic thinking. OK, so why the pseudo-science mambo-jumbo? If you want to do a Terence Malick trick, don't mess around with science. Being a physicist myself I am of course more sensitive to science fiction plot (worm/black) holes - especially these kind that completely suck any credibility out of it. But even if you are not scientifically literate, and this movie surely is not meant to appeal only to scientists, you should feel insulted. I won't go into any details, just because the "pencil through a paper of sheet" wormhole explanation or the "oyster and pearl" analogy really raised the bar way to low for me to care about it anymore. Sending "quantum data" to solve an "equation"... WTF? Just throw in the "quantum" word and that's it. Sorry to tell you, but "quantum data" means nothing. There is no such thing. No quantum physicist uses that expression for anything meaningful, especially in the lack of any recognizable context. Surviving through a black-hole trip (cough cough); talking to your Minecraft-designed robot (seriously??) while you're in the "3 dimensional box, inside a 5 dimensional universe..." WTF? It's just stupid, childish and downright ridiculous. Pseudo-science rubbish, which pisses off scientists and sends a completely wrong message to everyone else about what science is all about. Science is about rational thought, passion also of course, but mostly about consistent and carefully constructed logical thinking. This movie is the antithesis of any logical thinking. Just because, you know, love. I enjoy a good, deep, emotional story but the crappy pseudo-science completely spoils it. Kids, this is not science fiction. I am deeply disappointed. Thanks for that Mr Nolan!! Comparing this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey is outrageous, both Mr Kubrick and Mr Arthur C Clarke would be deeply embarrassed to find out that their legacy would be turned into this. Save your money and wait for a BR rip, if you really like being intellectually insulted. MR Nolan didn't do anything to deserve getting your money in his bank account.
6.0~A Complete Disappointment Mikeboy0001 Sign in Permalink 2001 is my all time favorite movie Blade Runner is one of my all time favourites too I pretty much loved all Nolan's movies except for the Dark Knight Rises So, theoretically this should have been a great time and great movie... it wasn't The story, the science, the pace where all wrong in so many ways. I even gave the movie a second chance at home, but things just didn't improve I just can't believe this has such a high rating, it just doesn't deserve it
10.0~Second to none! sivathexpandable Sign in Permalink I'm a Huge fan of Christopher! I've been waiting for this movie since I heard about Matthew teaming up with Christopher for their new movie. I don't have words to explain about this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, based on the importance of the humanity. How important our species to us? Whom will you save when you get the edge of your life? Is it the Species or its just your family or you save yourself and leave others?! Do you follow your heart or your mind? These are the questions we face when we watch this movie! Cast is excellent! Christopher explained about a theory, theory which says that we are not alone! There are beings out there who are Superior to us or it's just us(THEY) who will evolve in the future! One thing is for sure, the person who's going to watch this movie should have some imagination skills and a good grip on Physics!!! I got a lot to tell but I don;t want to spoil the Surprise!!!! Go watch it!!!!!!!!! Don't miss it!!!!!!!! One in a Decade Movie!!!!!
9.0~A science fiction movie that is definitely worth watching maryolalov Sign in Permalink A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch. Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic. Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind. Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching.
1.0~black holes plot vkulikov Sign in Permalink so, why 1/10 ... because this one is not Sci-Fi !!! Plot have huge amount of 'black holes' )) This movie is OUT of physics and is NOT even close to Einstein theories. It's fantasy for kids. Funny part about time travel & x5 dimensions is bullshit: - even u can travel in time mentioned with some stupid way using gravity as x5 dimension to change future (holly crap) - U SHOULD REPEATED IT EVERY NANO SECONDS to KEEP expected future not change back - BUT, butterfly effect DOES NOT exists - YOU CAN TRAVEL IN PAST, BUT ONLY FROM TRAVELER POINT OF VIEW. and yes changed it and create NEW ALT FUTURE )) - so, about 5x dimensions - its true and it are X,Y,Z, time and mass (not gravity) gravity is force - not dimension, the same as 3 more, MAGNETISM and Electromagnetic, The Strong Force & Weak Force ))﻿
6.0~Good idea turned wrong ct021976-986-657692 Sign in Permalink I find this film to be overrated by those that are liking it and underrated by those that are hating it, the overall score now is over 8, it is a little bit too much, other movies better than this one (for instance 2001: A space Odyssey) have a lower score and is a bit unfair that this flick is on pair or slightly over in IMDb score over that film. The cast is a mixture of good and bad, Matthew McConaughey acting, for instance, is good, Anne Hathaway so and so, Matt Damon, again, so an so, John Lithgow is OK, Michael Caine is OK (but is too old for his part, the casting is an issue, I will add more on this topic), Jessica Chastain is OK, so is the younger Murphy portrayed by Mackenzie Foy but the older Murphy portrayed by Ellen Burstyn is unconvincing. The supporting cast is, for the most part, forgettable, unidirectional and cartoonish (for instance the robots, the son Tom, the crew etc.). The script/plot is the main issue of the film, from the beginning we are introduced in a future society that has crop/food/drought problems due to climate changes and mildew. But these problems could not be planetary as we know that our planet does not have just a continent and the climate on those five continents differs dramatically, for instance Siberia has a totally different climate that Australia or India. Again if you have climate problems in middle of USA chances are, in the real life, that in northern Canada these problems will turn in advantages on your part, so why not re-settle in more advantageous regions on Earth instead of going directly into deep space with plan A (the whole planetary population towards another galaxy!!), this is the first and the biggest hole in the main plot. The second major issue of the script is the whole NASA business, it is secret, but somehow have huge funding for deep space programs, the government (a Orwellian one, no more or less) denies that space is a priority but secretly invest in it (why? we don't know and the script writers have no idea, too) and finally in the whole world only NASA/USA have deep space programs, the others no, they do not bother with space and the film makers are not bothered with them, too. Finally, the whole gravity/physics/equation/wormhole/black hole thing is again a very big plot hole. Firstly the professor get to the conclusion that Plan A (the whole population in space thing) can't be done (duh!) and secretly arrange Plan B(embryos in Cryostasis) without the knowledge of the space crew. All the pseudo-scientific theories regarding the fabric of time, gravity,black holes etc. are improbable and unbelievable, I know, it is an SF,but this part of this plot is too much especially the ghost part and entering of the black hole thing, with the fabric of time manipulated and equation solved by Coop and Murph in a very bad written scene. On top of this plot holes add a whole lot of bad Hollywood clichés and bad casting choices (for instance professor Brand, a 80 year old Cockney has a 30 year American Jewish daughter, young Tom is a Midwestern boy that turn into an East Coast fellow in his 40s, old Murphy is English, the young and midlife are not etc.) The movie has good potential, some parts are good, with beautiful scenes, but is again a case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as in many big Hollywood movies lately. The idea and script had potential, the cast had too. The CGI effects are OK, do not expect a heavy fight flick with shoot the alien between the eyes at every 30 seconds, as in Edge of Tomorrow for instance, a truly bad, over the top SF, no, it is a more thinking man SF but ultimately it fails due to the bad plot/scenario. This movie was a good idea turned wrong, it is a 6, 6.5 grade at best!
2.0~Dull geoffpyne Sign in Permalink Science: completely implausible Plot: dull, tedious Acting: wooden Best scene: when Cooper is saying goodbye to his daughter and his wristwatch jumps back from 9.02 to 8.20 This film is possible entertainment for the feeble-minded. Overall, overwhelming disappointment considering the lengthy positive reviews written by supposedly intelligent people. Why waste so much energy. A shame it is digital because if the movie was on celluloid at least it would burn well. Not a patch on 2001. This film doesn't deserve 10 lines of review. I have stated my case precisely and it would be pointless to add anything. This movie is about an hour too long.
10.0~The Informed Actor: Films to Study jfebus540 Sign in Permalink Good Day Everyone! Hopefully your having an "Interstellar" day, sorry for the pun! So on with the review! Christopher Nolan takes a huge step against the mega-hits of 2014's summer releases with a sci-fi epic of very BRAVE proportion. Enter "Interstellar". A team of scientists, pitted against a dying and hostile Earth with dust storms reminiscent of the Dust bowl of the 1930's, discern the source of strange happenings within our galaxy that may lead to our salvation. With the advent of suffocation and an eerie force later alluding to a gravitational anomaly, NASA begins operates in secret and dispatches the world's bravest into the stars. Leading the ensemble cast, Matthew McConaughey, stars as Cooper, an ex-pilot-turned-farmer who receives a strange decoded message from his daughter Murph, played by Jessica Chastain and Mackenzie Foy, that eventually leads them to the start of this epic journey to save humanity. Will these scientist achieve the impossible by exploring an unnatural occurrence of a wormhole near Saturn and find the habitants of Earth a new home? Or will all be lost? Packed with visual feasts, a fantastic musical score and an emotional undertone that will shake even the most hardest war veteran to tears, Cooper and team set out to perform the impossible before nature itself threatens to stop them.
5.0~Underwhelming and way, way too long steve-589-662590 Sign in Permalink I am baffled by the near universal praise this movie is receiving here on IMDb. Out of 2 hours and 49 minutes: about a half hour was spent watching people crying - every star got their turn; about a half hour was spent watching people docking spacecraft with their joysticks under great duress. Really? With that AI robot thingie we can't automate the docking? And what oh what does docking add to the story? about another half hour was spent watching Matt Damon in a dead-end downer subplot; and then another half hour was spent watching cornfields burning in the distance - why? Just, why? So right there we could cut the movie down to about an hour, and we will only have about 40 minutes left to go. Leaving maybe 10 minutes or so that were visually interesting... moderately. There were no visual breakthroughs of any kind in this movie - zip. And listen, I am a lifetime sci-fi fan. So the movie had a wormhole, and some time distortion. Please, is that in itself enough to satisfy anybody who cares about this stuff or do you maybe have to elaborate and get creative? There was simply nothing of unusual intelligence or quality in this movie. Not the writing, not the acting, not the directing, not the visuals. In the large theatre where I saw this with hundreds of people, one person starting clapping at the end. And the crowd laughed. If you're a Christopher Nolan fanboy, then by all means go and enjoy yourself and give it a ten. If that's not you, spend the time doing your taxes or something, you will thank me.
10.0~This is my favorite movie of all time isaiahjjohnson Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is my favorite director. His movies are amazing. This movie is spectacular. The music is amazing, the acting is phenomenal and the story bends your brain in ways I didn't know it could. It can be hrs to understand but it's a really good sci-fi movie
10.0~True (interstellar) detective natalija-mamula Sign in Permalink Watch episode 5 (season 1) of true detective... little help 32:24. Matthew is talking about dimensions in space and spheres. Interstellar should be acknowledged as the Sci-Fi movie and the best we had in years. What's wrong with the movie or whats right if you are looking a movie as a "physicist", than you see all sorts of "mistakes". Nolan's imagination is far beyond from all the movies shooting this days. He has a script, music, actors. When you go out from the movies after you seen Nolan's movies you debate with your friends you search through the internet about his theories and that's what Nolan wants for us to be a little bit smarter. My point is this movie is the best Sci-fi from Odyssey. 10/10
6.0~What the Hell is Going On? bsmith5552 Sign in Permalink "Interstellar" is this generation's answer to Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968). As with the earlier film, "Interstellar" requires the viewer to have his/her thinking cap on. The storyline has to do with the earth slowly dying and unable to produce the food it needs to survive due to harsh climatic changes. Under the veil of secrecy, a team of astronauts is sent off into space to go through a "black hole" in space to seek out new worlds on which earthlings can survive and prosper. The film boasts a large cast and an extensive running time. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I had a hard time trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Firstly, I had a hard time understanding what star Matthew McConaughy, who speaks in a low mumbly tone, was saying. Secondly I couldn't figure out what Anne Hathaway's character was doing on the mission except to look pretty. She is supposed to be the daughter of top scientist (Michael Caine) and just is not convincing to me. And it's not explained how McConaughy's character is firstly a farmer and secondly a world famous astronaut. And I'm still trying to figure out what Matt Damon's character was doing, why he was where he was and why he tries to eliminate Coopper (McConaughy). Then Cooper ends up back in an alternate universe where he's peeking through a bookcase in his daughter;s bedroom where he sees events from the past as he tries to communicate with his daughter "Murph" played by Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Fot and Ellen Bustyn at various stages of her life. As in "2001", I became totally confused. Anyway, I have to give the film high marks for it's technical achievements. The special effects are among the best that I have seen. Director Christopher Nolan keeps the story moving along even though he couldn't seem to get McConasughy to speak up. Michael Caine as always gives an excellent performance as the head scientists. At 80 plus he can still act circles around most of the cast. John Lithgow is totally wasted as McConaughy's father as is Anne Hathaway as the token female lead. "Interstellar" is certainly worth a look if not for for it's special effects then for it's storyline, but if you want to understand what McConayughy is saying, turn on the close captioning if watching on TV.
1.0~Get Real tbeneby22 Sign in Permalink Just doing my part to try to keep these ratings real. The movie's really a 7 on first viewing. Pretty sure .5 will be subtracted with each repeated viewing. At just short of 3 hours my a** is starting to go to sleep just thinking about it. This movie's real niche is about a 6.8, NOT the current 8.8. Nowhere near it. Got to keep writing now cause IMDb says so. Do you think the glue people were huffing that compared this movie to "2001 A Space Odyssey" had long chain, or short chain polymers? How much were the early reviewers paid to plant all those bogus, gushing reviews and how can I get my hands on some of that? As long as Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures are shoveling out review payola as part of their marketing scheme they may as well shove some my way.
1.0~America saves the world (again)! thearlofhednesford Sign in Permalink I do not know how many more times that films like this can be made! I really ought to have known better when Michael Caine appeared in the films list of actors! Apart from, 'Get Carter' this iconic 'Landener' (aside from Ray Winstone) has done little of any note. A real definition of a 'one trick pony'. As for Hathaway... The robot! Puh-lees! When McConaughey first encounters it, I wondered exactly who or what he was talking to, then it became apparent to me that he was addressing the jerking slab of metal in front of him. Given that NASA had the technology for interstellar travel, could they have not come up with something a little more, well, 'humanoid'? This badly thought out, wisecracking, over sized 'cereal packet' was annoying to the nth degree and it didn't take much for me to imagine the Chuckle Brothers lying on the floor moving its 'legs' in order to make it 'walk', "To me, to you...", that kind of thing! Wheels, anyone? The space suits. What was all that about? I reckon that my local bargain store could sell something more substantial in appearance! Add to this, the Father In Law who seems permanently bemused, a doofus, idiotic Son and a whining, brattish Daughter and it's really little wonder that I'm taking this film to my local charity shop! Had I have been McConauhey's character, I would have been only too pleased to get on the rocket and once in deep space, murdered the entire crew, taken a sledgehammer to the annoying robot and then jettisoned the entire lot out of the airlock! Peace would reign! This film wasn't so much released as it escaped!
2.0~Makes three hours feel like a lifetime - awful BlokeWithABrainUK Sign in Permalink OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved "Interstellar", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making. I won't even bother with dissecting the "science" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make. The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost. The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior "Contact"). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact. I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to "A Perfect Storm" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden. I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to. So in conclusion, "Contact" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say. Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.
1.0~As Spock would say, this movie is illogical. noymfbah Sign in Permalink Listen "I'm not a smart man", but I have basic reasoning skills and common sense. Now whilst I understand that sci-fiction doesn't follow the rules of reality (suspension of disbelief and all), there still has to be coherency, rules, and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie. This movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewer's intelligence. In one snippet of the three hour non-sense you'll endure and I do mean endure, the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable planet for new earth, but within minutes of their landing on two inches of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer the same fate... but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a few hours of their time (but decades of earth time). Well that sucks but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? Not when you realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the first scout hadn't sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in the first place, after all how could she know that in the mere MINUTES between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?!?! Nice to know that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist would jump to such a rushed conclusion, "hey guys, I just landed here, looks great, come now xoxo." Then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly selflessly brave enough to go on a one-way trip to scout a planet, then chicken shi!s out when he gets there and realizes it's not viable and he's a dead man so selfishly dooms mankind's one chance by having them waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue him, but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers so that he can complete the mission all by himself, holy whiplash with his conflicting moralities/immoralities Batman. I could go on and on but I won't. I conclude by saying it really irks me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when it's really just acid tripping rubbish.
5.0~Hmmm... fil-nik09 Sign in Permalink I did read many reviews here before seen the film and from them and the average stars I thought it was going to be really good, but it was not. Though the story of the film is quite good and acting too, and plus I like those kind of movies, it just was kinda boring most of the time for me. I couldn't even watch it as a whole but I had to pause it because I was bored and then continued only because I do not like to do anything in half. Surely, it is better than Gravity in my opinion which is totally totally boring, since they are kinda similar. I was hesitant between 5 and 6, but 5 is more accurate for me. It is neither good neither bad - just boring.
4.0~not as good as everyone is trying to convince you dragokin Sign in Permalink Judging by the cast of Interstellar there is a seemingly endless roster of movie stars begging for at least a cameo in Christopher Nolan's movies. But this shouldn't come as a surprise after the success of The Dark Knight trilogy. So what did we have here? A lot of great CGI images and some truly heartbreaking moments. They were joined together by scenes that better fit an SF movie of B provenance. I don't want to go into discussing the scientific and "scientific" background, but the characters behave as if they were on a somewhat complicated journey to inner Antarctica and not the boundaries of outer space. The launch of Interstellar is partly a lesson in contemporary communication. Even before it's premiere the media fanfare determined that Interstellar would be a masterpiece. For some reason everyone follows without questioning the sloppy moments.
4.0~Love space flicks...this one not so much... sohmflooring Sign in Permalink I don't get it. This movie annoyed me on so many levels. First of all, the producers should have hired a diction coach for the actors, or they hired the wrong one. If you are going to have dialog, no matter how inconsequential or banal, at least have the actors deliver the lines without sounding like they have a mouth full of marbles. Second, why all the noise? Really, some of it was an overwhelming clatter that added nothing to the film, almost as annoying a cacophony as that in the film Armageddon, a movie I intensely disliked. Third, I do not understand all the hype about the great musical score for this film. What?! Again, like with the noise, the score was heavy-handed and way too loud. Sorry, but modern films that use methods and tools to excess to the point where the attention is drawn to the method or tool and away from the action fail to maintain the viewer's suspension of reality and consequently fail to entertain. The score should enhance the action and not compete with it. Obviously, current moviegoers don't mind having their emotions manipulated in such heavy-handed ways. Fourth, this film would have been much better with better character development and less melodrama. I wish this had been a better film and not a soap opera in space. And, fifth, some of the CGI was truly bad. I can't think of any film that used water in a convincing way. And this one failed at the CGI water scenes also. The editor must have known this, as the CGI water scenes were mercifully short. I refrain from describing examples in the film where the above five items are particularly evident, as anything I might say could be considered a plot spoiler.
1.0~Way, way overrated eichler2 Sign in Permalink OK, first off, the movie clearly doesn't deserve 1 star - I just gave it that to try to counterbalance all the undeserved 10 star reviews that currently give it an vastly over-inflated 8.7 average. I'll try to keep this brief by just listing the good and the bad: Good: 1. Some impressive visuals 2. Some interesting ideas. Kind of. Bad: 1. Bad storytelling - half the time it was near-impossible to figure out what was going on, or why the characters were doing what they were doing. 2. Way too long. Seriously, this movie was easily an hour longer than it needed to be. At least. 3. The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese. Not incorrect scientific facts so much as things just being unrealistic. For example - if the future humans (or whoever set up the whole black hole library thing) had the capability to do that, why couldn't they just send us a clear message from the future to help us out? Why this convoluted plan to get Cooper into the black hole to send ridiculous messages back to himself and his daughter using Morse code, binary code, etc? 4. Way too obvious - why couldn't the characters figure out that the data Matt Damon was sending was fake? One look at the planet made it pretty clear it was uninhabitable, and I saw the whole "he was so lonely he'd do anything to get rescued" plot line coming up. But none of our super-smart heroes could figure that out? I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the rave reviews it got, but in the end I thought it was somewhere between awful and just barely passable. And through the last hour of the movie I kept checking my watch and wondering how much longer until it was over. If you can see it cheap, it's probably worth watching, just keep your expectations really low.
10.0~An awesome experience chalcedonydream Sign in Permalink This was my first trip to the cinema for around 15 years. I wasn't disappointed. I'm not going to go into the details of the plot etc. Just let me say, it was a stunning film with amazing cinematography, brilliant acting (especially from Matthew McConaughey), expertly directed and a score to die for. I can't comment on the physics, because I'm no scientist, but considering the calibre of those who worked on the film and of those who have backed him after seeing the film, I'd rather take their word than a few reviewers here whose actual scientific qualifications I have no evidence of. In any event, I watch a movie to be entertained, enthralled and delighted, not to take every opportunity to pick holes in every aspect of the story. If I wanted absolute verifiable science, I'd go to a physics lecture in college. Where actually most astro-physicists worth their salt would admit that very little about the subject matter here has been verifiably proved. This film entertained, enthralled and delighted me and I can't wait to see it again.
5.0~An expensive mess verna-a Sign in Permalink There are some great moments in this film but fatal flaws in the story and script. It does succeed in building suspense and providing a visual "wow" factor, but only after it has lost viewer conviction by a lot of silliness and implausibility. I went to see it as I do many sci-fi films hoping to have a similar experience to that provided by 2001 : a Space Odyssey in the 1960s. Alas recent attempts all fall short by comparison, by succumbing to the temptation to include a lot of cheap tricks. Instead of relying on the scenario, story and setting to provide the engagement factor, American directors can't resist introducing the macho hero, the improbable baddie and schmaltzy sentimentality. Oh for a bit of discipline! The first part of the film is frankly painful. Matthew McConaughey drawls and postures and has a vapid open-mouthed expression most of the time. It's pretty much impossible to understand what he is saying. The situation on Earth is difficult to understand and doesn't achieve any credibility. The science seems to be gobbledy-gook, which holds for the entire film. Interest improves when they get out into space and some of the situations create considerable tension, enabling the viewer to sit out the film with a better grace. Towards the end the story disintegrates into incomprehensible nonsense. A lot of the sentimental basis of the film rests on Cooper's relationship with his daughter, so it's a significant flaw that the 3 actresses who play her do not resemble each other facially (obviously a problem, but not handled well). Matt Damon can't do much with his admittedly silly part, and doesn't look too interested. Altogether, what a waste of resources. This film needed a guiding genius, as I am assuming the weaknesses reflect "too many cooks". However a really good story followed fairly closely (as was the case in 2001) would have been a good start. The story is one of the weakest elements here and it shows.
1.0~I want my time back! server10 Sign in Permalink This is by far the worst movie of 2014. Character development doesn't exists in this movie, nor any interesting dialogs or any real suspense moments. The plot is dragging way too long and doesn't reach any climax. If the film would have been 90 minutes long instead of 170 it could have been less of a torture. The film score is irritating and dull, which suits the banal script just fine. I don't remember when was the last time I left the theater so angry and bored before watching this movie. Just stay away from this banal piece of nothing.
10.0~Master Piece. cjmikke Sign in Permalink I just love this film. The director took the right way to express all the idea. If you love the science, you will love this master piece. The actors are just beasts, Matthew McConaughey has shown all of us that he is a really good actor and I am so happy that he took this way and this plot in his career, because it's just amazing. The way that the film explains the relativity and the space-time is brilliant, and the end it's just shocking. I just have good words for this film. One of the best things of this master piece is that make us reflex about all the future and if there is a possibility to find another planet to habit. Totally recommended.
4.0~Poor in almost every possible way. marcyys-825-446901 Sign in Permalink Yesterday I watched the movie "Interstellar". A poorly scripted and poorly directed movie with an over-simplified pseudo-science and spoon-fed philosophical implications, basically a typically overrated Hollywood movie which takes no shame in copying from 2001: A Space Odyssey from Kubrick with none of its beauty, simplicity and none of its art. It shows that in 1968 they were able to make a masterpiece and in 2014 they can't even copy it decently. The fact that on IMDb it has an higher rating than the Kubrick masterpiece makes me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation. I will watch 2001: A space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again.
1.0~bad movie zemanel Sign in Permalink I love sci-fi thrillers and all. I hated this one. There is something fundamentally wrong with this movie. The story reads as an excuse. An excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes. The film tried so much that ended up failing in everything. I think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with band-aid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie. I would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working. It is that bad. I sincerely hope I make it. I have been drooling ever since I left the cinema.
3.0~fractured plot, fractured story telling ivancampbellson Sign in Permalink this is the first movie review I have written. I do not understand what is happening to IMDb. I cannot believe how this movie gets a 9! Too many familiar actors playing roles that do not suit. Leave your brain at home when watching this movie. If you think too hard about the probabilities.....pure Hollywood big budget mediocre movie. All the money has gone to CGI. So many incidents are so unbelievable that you give up on caring for the characters. this is a silly movie (eg. a robot that is made of flat panels and is square shape but can move on water!!!!) with very little going for it. do not be fooled into thinking this is a good movie by word of mouth read as many reviews as you can.
9.0~Incredible kunallalitjain Sign in Permalink The movie is a great combination of Adventure,Science and Thrill it is a movie that does no let you blink your eye i.e the one watching will not be willing to miss even a small scene of the movie.The actors have done a great job and of course no one ever complains on a movie by a cinematic genius Christopher Nolan.This movie takes you to an emotional and beautiful journey into the unknown.It's such an incredible movie that no one ever can create a masterpiece similar to this or ever created before this.It is one of the best Sci-fi movie ever and one of the best by Christopher Nolan.It has great visual effects, pretty good environment and one of best written movie.No matter what "Interstellar" is an amazing masterpiece and the best by Nolan till now.
1.0~What absolute garbage! aBslut30 Sign in Permalink I really don't see how everyone is giving such great reviews of this movie!!!! It's one giant plot hole from which no stars can escape. Say what you like about Nolan's film making style, but this movie should have never been made. Throughout the overly long self indulgent piece of crap I said many times that this movie had better end REALLY well... Of course it's just one notch above the worst ending I can think of for it. I think they killed all the consultants off before they started filming too. Just SAVE YOURSELVES!!! RUN, Don't WATCH IT!
7.0~Far too long and self-important neil-476 Sign in Permalink Weather stuff is messing up crops on Earth, and we're all going to suffocate from too much nitrogen. Secret NASA is exploring potentially habitable worlds via a wormhole provided by 5 dimensional aliens, and ace pilot Cooper goes on one such exploratory mission despite the pleas of his daughter for him not to. The mission does not go according to plan. This film, directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother, is going to make Nolan fans cream their jeans They are, after all, a vociferous bunch, and they tend to think of him as a cinematic deity. Me – not so much. I have enjoyed his films, but I also think they are very flawed, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a very derivative film, with so much borrowed from 2001 and 2010 that you are constantly expecting robot TARS to turn against the crew members. The main story is OK (if somewhat familiar) but the resolution, even though decked out with pseudo-science gobbledegook, still reeks of plot expediency rather than scientific verisimilitude. And it is far, far too long – there is an entire sequence featuring an unexpected well-known face which could have been replaced with a 30-second alternative, and nothing of any narrative significance would have been lost. This is not a well-paced film although, on a single viewing, it does hold the interest. However, at nearly 3 hours, it could usefully lose an hour of running time. It contains good performances, visuals which are interesting if somewhat less spectacular than I would have hoped for, silence in space (hooray!), a character played by child and adult performers who actually look like each other and – surprisingly for Nolan – some genuine emotion. This isn't a bad film, but it has far too high an opinion of itself.
9.0~A totally engaging SF tale told with heart. mikbarley Sign in Permalink I found Intestellar a beautiful movie to watch and be enthralled by. After countless low grade science fiction movies parading across the screen over the decades, this one will stay with me. The viewer should watch it for story and not for the science - the cinematography is beautiful without being flashy; the acting is brilliant and musical score works perfectly with the story. I was engrossed by the movie from start to finish, held there by the humanity and feeling portrayed by the director and the actors. Why people feel the need to compare Intestellar to Kubrick's 2001 is puzzling - this is a completely different movie and one that, when I think back to watching 2001, is infinitely more watchable. Why people feel the need to pile in rate the movie '1' is beyond me and, at the time of this writing 570,000 people had averaged the rating out to 8.7 - so, don't listen to the hate, just watch it and enjoy.
9.0~Theory of everything BiiivAL Sign in Permalink How hard it is, probably, not to break under the exorbitant weight of threatening ambitions, especially when it comes to "the most anticipated film of the year" - that's how and in no other way did they call the last work of Christopher Nolan in a cinema environment. The benefits of this hysteria are few. Do not wait for "everything, and immediately, and more", because the blockbuster - the last word that comes to mind when trying to somehow characterize the "Interstellar", because the intellect here clearly outweighs even such a smart exterior design. As it went, it did not sound, but we have a truly multifaceted and complex film that can be adequately perceived in several different planes, and the maximum effect will be achieved only if you are able to look deeper. In the not too distant future, humanity is at a stage of regression: high technologies no longer worry us as much as the primary need for food. The farmer's profession becomes one of the most respected, and the craft is not easy, because for certain reasons nature is no longer our friend - one by one the whole vegetable crops are destroyed, refusing to yield crops. Against this background, the former pilot, and now the farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is invited to join an expedition designed to test potentially life-worthy planets in another Galaxy, the passage into which, in the form of a so-called "wormhole", was recently discovered in our Solar System . While the expedition is busy searching, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) here on Earth will have to complete his research and development, as a result of which he plans to find an effective way to transport the world's population to a new home. But if suddenly he does not find it - on board the interstellar ship there is a sufficient stock of the terrestrial gene pool to start the population "from scratch" - this is not an iridescent version of the development of events called "plan B". As a form in his latest work, Nolan uses a so-so, relatively speaking, "fantastic" plot, in which, however, modern scientific research is much more than some fantasies of the creators. Without the second, however, it was not done either - but more on that later. At the same stage, it should be said that the script is really very tightly based on modern physics and currently existing theories, and uses a lot of scientific terms - so if you do not know, for example, what the "event horizon" is, and why the measure approaching the black hole, time slows down - it makes sense to prepare yourself a little before watching the movie, so you can understand what the heroes are talking about. For all this physics and mathematics, of course, there are real human fates, feelings and experiences. The film is still at the beginning, before the departure of Cooper devotes a long time demonstrating family interactions - but there, in the "ordinary" terrestrial environment, this looks quite ordinary. However, as the story develops, the emotions and factors that generate them gradually take on a completely different form - here Nolan already tangles this tangle consisting of imperfection of our psyche, instincts and feelings towards others much more densely. In the emotional aspect, the film turns out to be very strong - without any conventionality or falseness. It is here that one of the most memorable scenes that produces such an effect is due to the breadth of the talent of the magnificent McConaughey. After it there is no doubt that the viewer will stay with the hero until the end, at whatever cost. Nolan allegedly opposes the cold soulless cosmos to the warmth of real human feelings, emphasizing their significance. In this regard, I would like to note that the culmination and its justification will probably not be understood by all, since here the plot departs from the science trail, it goes, in the literal sense, to the unknown - without spoilers it is difficult to say more, therefore, I just recommend not to take this allusion literally, and focus on what it means. It is also important to read between the lines and see things in perspective - and then you can see where as more logic than it might seem at first glance. But there will also be an ambiguous finale, leaving behind mixed feelings, and infusing a new subtext to where it would seem that everything has already been laid out on the shelves. "Interstellar" amazes with its multitasking and coverage of the topics being raised. To some extent, this is also a minus, because the ideas embedded in the script, would be more than enough for three or four films. From this, it is not always perceived exactly, and at some moments even requires some effort and concentration when viewing. But in a decent way to accumulate so much food for thought in one movie, even three hours, by force of units. Not to mention how effective the picture works on the upper outer level, combining visual and sound images. Visually, the film is completely different from modern digital blockbusters: shot on a film and with real scenery, it generates an absolutely unique atmosphere. The same goes for the sound series - Zimmer clearly caught the mood: the sound is old-fashioned, unorganized and bright. This surprisingly deep, beautiful author's cinema is the long-awaited odyssey of Nolan, which remains in memory for a very, very long time.
1.0~Overrated because it makes people "feel" smart.. thepainkiller-81552 Sign in Permalink A very long film , that can be done in a less time; full of none-sense, that is full of total science fiction ,and unreal theories; i didn't even feel the emotions that people are talking about everywhere because it's artificial emotions; finally the movie hasn't given anything new, pointless . People please !! stop being a fan-boys to a certain director,plus if a movie seems complicated ,doesn't mean it awesome . A movie like this should be simple , and close enough to rationality , the more it's made simple, the more creative the maker is, it is totally none-sense making it complicated, what is worse;it's the Unreal theories that this movies shows made it like this, and please people do not tell me i haven't focused on the main point of this movie , i tired my best, and i found it POINTLESS .
3.0~Inner Ear Cancer remny Sign in Permalink So... many are going to disagree with me: but... Interstellar sucked. 50% of this was due to the soundtrack. It's not that I'm super picky about what amazing tunes should play during my movies. It's just that I don't think they should make me vomit my brain out of my skull. The droning, overbearing-soundtrack featured everyone's favorite instrument: The Dial-tone-xylophone-pipe-organ-flute. This usually hung on one note in a very high pitched whine, or, if you were lucky, it would be featured in a cord that replayed over and over again. Not just replaying though, but getting louder and louder over time, so loud that one might seriously consider burying their face in molten lava, if only to escape the assault on one's ears. So loud that the words the characters are saying can not even remotely be discerned, even in a very high-class theater, with state-of-the-art audio. However, remember, this Soundtrack-for-Masochists was only half the reason the movie was lame. The other half was bad science, overplayed space-movie-tropes and extremely questionable character decisions. First we have the blight, it's killing every plant on earth with dirt. Yes ladies and gentlemen, the final blow to humanity will come in the form of a clingy dust that just won't wash away. Why, or how this came to be is never explained, but it's killing all the plants and getting stuck in our lungs, and for some reason it's going to end humanity because everyone seems to have forgotten how to grow indoor hydroponic food like with already do with a number of crops. Also, the blight is somehow, kinda-maybe a biological plague that feeds off nitrogen... or is it dirt? I don't freakin' know at this point, and the movie doesn't really help you understand if one is causing the other, or if their the same thing, or what. Add to that, some excruciatingly poor, or at best implausibly unvetted decision making, toss in some random space-madness, and after about the halfway point, the movie became a chore to watch. As Interstellar gets closer to the end, it starts to seem like a contest in a game of "wouldn't it be cool if" before it blessingly concludes with, everything is fine now because of black holes and gravity, yaay. Save yourself some money by putting on some headphones and plugging them into a light socket while watching the most contrived and nonsense episodes of Star Trek. If you can't hear half of the dialog because of the painful whirring in your ears, you have succeeded in simulating Interstellar.
10.0~One viewing may not suffice codickerson Sign in Permalink I saw this opening night (Thursday). I wanted the full monty. That means IMAX (I drove across town to get it). Wow! There are only a handful of films that have visually overwhelmed me and required a second go (or more). The first was 2001 A Space Odyssey. Star Wars Empire Strikes Back and Avatar come to mind for now. This was such a spectacle with a very complex script I'll admit I left the theater with a lot of questions. I knew it was a viscerally thrilling experience, I just couldn't fully explain the ending to my inquiring mind. I write this piece having seen this amazing film again four days later (No IMAX). OMG! I loved this movie even more tonight than four days ago. For me at least, it took two viewings for the grandeur of this project to reveal its power and intellectual reach. This is a science fiction film for the ages!
10.0~A film that is already a monument to the art. tim_dearing-1 Sign in Permalink I don't watch film review programs and I don't buy magazines about the movies. Whilst doing the weekly shop, I like many I'm sure, always like to peruse the shelves for new releases as a treat for the weekend. On the shelf was Interstellar. I read the jacket, saw who was in it, and thought it might make for a decent Sunday afternoon movie. I was and indeed remain completely astonished. This film is a true giant. First of all, it's nearly three hours long and I didn't realise until it was over and I looked to see what the time was. It went by so fast and at no time did I think "I wonder how much time it's got to go?" Secondly I didn't want it to end. Without spoiling it, the story in very brief is that the Earth is dying. There is a dirt that sweeps across the globe in dust like storms making growing anything almost impossible with the exception of a number of staple foods. But these are becoming less and less. Society seems to be carrying on, but certainly in a much smaller way than now. I don't believe any explanation was offered as to why this had come about. Most of the World has regressed to a way of life devoted to the growing of food crops to sustain itself. There is a major reason why it is decided to leave the planet to find somewhere else to live, but I do not want to reveal the reasons or how they manage it for the sake of ruining it for viewers who have yet to see it. So what it comes down to is the story, plot line, acting and its ability to seem real. Can I reassure you that the story is first class, things that did not need to be said - for instance as I suggested earlier the reason why the Earth became what it now is - are indeed omitted. It is not necessary to provide that back story. Its inclusion was not required. The plot line with its tension and excitement - and trust me, there is excitement and tension aplenty - are perfectly executed. The acting is of the very highest order. It would be easy to point to Matthew McConaughey and say how incredible his performance was - and it was - but that would be to belittle the others who appear alongside him. It's a team effort. It draws you in, takes you on a ride that bewilders and astonishes whilst remaining deep and thought provoking. Also, credit where credit is due, the Hans Zimmer soundtrack is huge. By huge I mean that when it is required, the music enhances the experience enormously. It is a music befitting this giant of a movie and indeed stands out itself as work of genius. I may seem to be going completely over the top, and perhaps I am, because not everyone will share my sense of wonder of this film. But, as those oh so rare movies that have come before it, it is an instant monument to the art of film making. I give this film my highest accolade.
7.0~Rave at Close of Day ferguson-6 Sign in Permalink Greetings again from the darkness. There are probably three distinct groups that view this as a "must see" movie. First, there are the hardcore science lovers – especially those dedicated to space and time. Next would be the core group of Sci-Fi aficionados (those who quote and debate the specifics of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, The Matrix, etc). And finally, those cinephiles who anxiously await the next ground-breaking film of director Christopher Nolan, whose experimental and pioneering methods are quite unique in today's Hollywood. Given that I would be laughed out of the first two groups – exposed as less than a neophyte, you may assume that my discussion of this film will not be steeped in scientific or astrophysical theorem. Instead, this will provide my reaction to what has been one of my two most anticipated films of the year (Birdman being the other). Simply stated, the look of this film is stunning and breath-taking. Its theatrical release comes in many formats, and I chose 70mm. This made for an incredibly rich look with probably the best sound mix I have ever heard. The physical sets were remarkable and as varied as the scene settings: a farm house, a NASA bunker, multiple spacecrafts, and numerous planets. Beyond that, we experienced the effects of blackholes, wormholes and the tesseract. Mr. Nolan's long time cinematographer and collaborator Wally Pfister was off directing his own film (Transcendence), so the very talented Hoyt Van Hoytema joined the team and contributed sterling camera work, including the first ever hand-held IMAX shots. Top this off with Hans Zimmer's complimentary (though sometimes manipulative) score, and Mr. Nolan has produced a technical marvel of which known adjectives lack justice. Take note of the exceptional cast led by the reigning Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club), and other Oscar winners and nominees Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, and Ellen Burstyn. Beyond these, we also have David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, William Devane, Topher Grace, David Gyasi, Collette Wolfe, Timothy Chalamet, and an exceptionally fine performance from Mackenzie Foy (who will forever be remembered as the Twilight child of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson). On the downside, I found myself shocked at some of the dubious and distracting dialogue. At times, the conversations were contradictory and even seemed out of place for the situation, character and movie. In particular, the entire Matt Damon sequence and the Anne Hathaway monologue on "love" both struck me as disjointed and awkward. These and other minor annoyances can't be discussed here without noting key plot points, so that's where we will leave it. However, it must be mentioned that the words of Dylan Thomas are so oft repeated, that the phrase "Do not go gently into that good night" can now be officially considered fighting words. The works of noted Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne were the inspiration for the story, and even Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has come out in support of much of the science in the film. Be prepared for brain strain on topics such as space-time continuum (Einstein's Relative Study of Time), gravity, and the aforementioned wormholes, blackholes and tesseracts. The blight depicted in the first hour draws its look and even some closed circuit interviews directly from Ken Burns' documentary The Dust Bowl (2012). Beyond all of the science and lessons of human arrogance and survival, I found the story to be focused on loss  loss of home, loss of loved ones, loss of hope  and balanced by the remarkable human survival instinct. Christopher Nolan deserves much respect for addressing these human emotions and desires with the overwhelming vastness of space, and doing so in a time when Hollywood producers would much rather financially back the next superhero or even a sequel to a 20 year old comedy.
7.0~Worth Seeing, but not Spectacular atlasmb Sign in Permalink Great music. An extremely talented cast. Amazing special effects. Captivating issues to contemplate. So why do I think I will not ponder this film long after I have viewed it? The story is convoluted, though interesting. All the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale that tells us what? Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there. I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final "explanation" of the film's phenomena has a "Sixth Sense" feeling to it. I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's "2001" or the atmospherics of "Blade Runner" or the thrilling ride of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind".
10.0~Quite. Michael200409 Sign in Permalink I feel this movie is slightly overrated. I have not seen any trailers for this, I have not heard of this through word of mouth, I just so happened to stumble upon this title while looking for something to fill up my Sunday afternoon. So in other words I didn't really have any expectations for this title to begin with. This is one of those movies I will only be watching once. There were three things that stood out to me that drew my attention, first; the poster looks pretty cool, second; it stars Matthew McConaughey, and third; it's directed by Christopher Nolan. Those are three really good reasons to watch this, right? Wrong. This movie makes 2001; A Space Odyssey look like Bad Boys II. If you have daddy problems and are looking for an intergalactic soap opera in the form of a movie, this might be what you are looking for. I hate to hate but I feel like my time has been wasted watching this. The characters aren't very likable, the plot isn't very compelling, in fact it got rather stale near the end. Don't expect Prometheus. Don't expect Star Wars or Star Trek. Expect something that more or less belongs on the Lifetime channel.
6.0~Why the Hype? pavel-krioukov-213-993906 Sign in Permalink It's not really a good Sci-fi, you take away the wormhole and replace the setting with WW2 Japan, where a father has to go on a suicide mission and there you have it. Melodramatic and not really reflective of humanity as a whole, or our place in the Universe. The film contemplates nothing significant and manages to tell nothing. Basically a cheap tearjerker for USA audience, cashing in on dwindling patriotism. Protip: if you want good Sci-Fi films try either Sunshine or Pandorum. They are infinitely more entertaining and closer to reality without making paradoxes left and right. Or heck even Solaris if you're really that into melodrama. I'm really disappointed in Nolan, after confused and often mind-twisting films like Inception and The Prestige, Nolan seems to be transforming into another side of Michael Bay where all Those millions are more important than integrity.
5.0~Gets better when it abandons science almiva Sign in Permalink In my view there are two types of science fiction. The first type wants to wow us with science and must therefore be faithful to it. The second type wants to tell us one of those universal stories (boy meets girl - who turns out to be his sister, then meets evil guy who turns out to be his dad etc...) and uses 'science' very loosely as a way of isolating and highlighting the story. Some science fiction makes the mistake of trying to do both. This film is one such mistake. The basic story that love conquers all, even space and time is a good one. And to focus on the love between a parent and a child offers an interesting perspective. But first we have to go through a wormhole and skim through an event horizon. Actually that's all OK. The problem is the plot device that Earth is dying and our best hope is colonising one of a selection of planets that appear to be far worse options. How can it make more sense to move to a frozen planet or a desert planet orbiting a black hole than to just fix the Earth? The film spends quite a while setting up the Earth is dying scenario. Unfortunately it's far from convincing. Luscious green corn on a huge mechanised super farm is occasionally lightly coated with a little dust. We are told that corn is all we have left because other crops are succumbing to 'blight', and it's only a matter of time before corn is next. So, instead of using any kind of genetic engineering to try and counter this we opt for a giant space ark and shipping everyone off through that wormhole. It also seems rather odd that a supposed global food crisis hasn't led to conflict, crime or indeed any kind of apparent suffering. The next highly implausible offering is Cooper (Matthew McConaghy) stumbling into a 'secret' NASA base with a giant rocket hidden inside. If we've learnt nothing else from Snowden it is that Americans can't hide anything! Although, to be fair, the film does at least poke fun at American credulity by having schools teach that the moon landings actually were faked. And then to top it all the scientists pick this bloke who's just wandered in to pilot a spaceship he's never seen before. But I will come back to that. So they trundle off into space in what looks like a Saturn 5 before transferring into more Star Wars like spacecraft. There's a bit of cryogenic sleep, some time dilation and some robot stuff which obviously references 2001 and the Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy (that at least is a good thing!). Then there is some ludicrous nonsense as they land on a water world where the sea is 18 inches deep but waves are half a mile high (where does the water come from? - maybe that doesn't stretch the credulity of an American audience 40% of whom think Noah is a documentary). Next is an ice world with solid clouds... Here they meet Mann (Matt Damon). Now, suddenly it gets interesting when he turns out to be a bit unhinged and some genuine tension is developed. You really get a sense of the last part of 2001 here as we feel the loneliness and the characters' reliance on fragile 'rafts' in the vast emptiness of space. That parallel is further explored as Cooper falls into the black hole and things get very weird, multi dimensional and spiritual. Here we see him trapped in a fifth dimension trying to communicate with his daughter in a way that earlier in the film was prefigured as some kind of paranormal activity. Because this doesn't make sense scientifically - it does make sense as a piece of story telling. And if you buy into the idea that Cooper is part of some time looping master plan to save the human race then you might accept his selection to pilot the mission (see above). Unfortunately, for me this is all spoiled because the Nolans keep trying to explain it all instead of just allowing it to be a mystery. Just like the first brilliantly ambivalent Matrix film was subsequently ruined by its sequels that tried to explain it all, so this film is undone by trying to be both kinds of sci-fi.
10.0~Fill the Cinemas! denizagca Sign in Permalink Put hard sci-fi name, is not possible technological developments or action adventure, scientific speculation and work very hard to adapt to the philosophy that uses theater genre. This style may seem boring to the general audience hall to the net fun to movies, science-based entertainment, but also to achieve fascinating and complex visuals "blockbuster" films thrown into the budget needs. That's why even the most hard-budget sci-fi shoot the famous director be a miracle, the result of good times and in bad, though ... If this pushes the boundaries of genre and through the miracle of cinema while still attached to science advancing fearlessly go before extraordinary land of the revolutionary sci-fi movies it is rare enough to be considered a single hand. Previously, these films created by audiences and critics have seen anywhere like the mass of the world, what the brain can detect the true work of art with a defiant courage to do this much surprised, of course. Maybe that's why the average take criticism in that period films fall into this vision, 'ridiculous' and 'unreasonable' are thrown aside given the stamp. Kubrick in 1968 2001: When A Space Adventure for release audience and critics that compels both the cinematic language, they were baffled as well as to what humanity's potential future with a film examining it in detail to do. During this period, the cinema audience by swearing in the middle of the film, it was not hard to find critics of the 2001 hit from place to place. But ten years later, Kubrick's film is not only technically referred to as a masterpiece, in its place in the context of humanity and the universe as a philosophical examining a profound work of art known integrity. In 2001, Kubrick's vision into real / Spielberg masterpiece while pushing the boundaries of complex artificial intelligence, especially because the final was not understood at first, was thrown aside. But just eight years later, when the first vision that badly even critics of the best films of the decade in which they agreed that a. I guess the real artificial intelligence technology progresses, increasingly more and more clear that the value of that film. Now, as plenty of discussion creation, critics and understood by the audience, it was ten or twenty years later, naming as a masterpiece Christopher Nolan's spectacular, daring, complex as it is extremely strongly emotional, and ready for the modern to push the boundaries of cinema In Yıldızlararası hard sci-fi masterpiece. A lot about the interstellar be released in the days of fierce debate to occur. From the first frame to the last frame of both scientific as well so heavy and so full of courage already made certain that divides the audience from the emotional care. And in this case the last twenty, twenty-five minutes to an unprecedented in the history of cinema 'beyond' If we keep in mind diving into interstellar looks like we will talk about for a long time. The final film in the US than even some of the critics of invective about to be released, I and some of them I found the courage to get awed worship to Nolan's revolutionary example of a trance so when normally be met. Yıldızlararası give any details about the story would be unfair to the audience. Even after the first ten minutes of story elements quoted fragment ends expertly avoiding to give important details about the film. In this regard, we know that only Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey is a pilot to save the future of humanity behind them, where the family had to leave his beloved daughter to go into space. Make sure, before entering the hall you satisfied with this close detail than enough. Other than that the scenario is no history Yıldızlararası I do not want to touch compared with other techniques I detail of Nolan cinema. First, before technically more clinical and critically acclaimed Nolan that have cold air in terms of the story, although not perfect, interstellar and also reveals the most emotional movie of his career next to build the most complex construction of maintenance. The width of both the universe and the mysteries of the human being, but also manages to keep together the relationship between the connection with the power of love and faith McConaughey and his daughter Nolan. Yıldızlararası not to impress the audience with cool designs include the sci-fi elements, created with a spacious minimalism to show the world's needs in a realistic manner possible. For example, each space-based film is given the advanced artificial intelligence humanoid appearance. Yıldızlararası huge monolith reminiscent of robots in 2001 are focusing on efficiency rather than visual impressiveness. Nolan, took the story beyond the solar system, although, as in last year's massive gravity space manages to describe in a realistic manner possible scientific care. Disappear sound in outer space than we're staying alone with a tremendous shot and Hans Zimmer music. Ten-twenty years after critics and cinema release a sci-be called fiction masterpiece ahead of its time by fans, will have the future of humanity because of global warming have to face the problems that will jeopardize get a bit of the next generation are not likely to be a film that will instill hope Yıldızlararası's . It's large, complex, and especially compared to big budget productions to talk about a brave, of course, you have a lot of details to be entered. But so early in a boil My only advice to fill the halls at once, especially from hard science fiction, including mental forces are getting ready for the cinematic challenge all senses.
5.0~Interstellar is like the comedian having to explain and dissect the now-magicless joke. diac228 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is like trying to consume a 10-inch slice of pizza in your mouth without chewing: we know the pizza is always good, and we know that the more pizza the better, but then after a point it becomes pure overkill. That is what Interstellar is: cinematic overkill that overstays its welcome, overstays its logic, and lingers around long enough for you to notice the rapidly-thinning plot. The technical aspects were indeed spectacular in every sense of the way, which arguably keeps the movie afloat for as long as it possibly can before the third act weighs everything down with its left field conclusion. What really limits Interstellar more than anything else is the plot and the script. Movies that use a backdrop as vast and expansive as space needs a smaller story to keep the audience and the logic in check. This is what worked for Wall-E, Gravity, and to a lesser extent 2001: A Space Odyssey. With Interstellar however, too much is explained, and the audience is required to make massive leaps of faith that we may not be willing to make---especially after already going through two hours of it. The dialogue is slightly overblown and loses authenticity, and by the climax too much is being discussed and not enough is being shown. The performances and the technical details keep the dialogue and story from disappointing us too much. Matthew McConaughey carries this film well as he becomes simply a man concerned about the future of his family in the midst of the grand space adventure that takes too many twists and turns that requires a second viewing to fully realize it all. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine did a swell job with the minimal material handed to them. They each added a sense of believability to a plot that was quite devoid of them as the movie went on. The cinematography and special effects were top-notch, although they suffered a few setbacks if you compare them to 2013's Gravity. Interstellar hides its space scope with far too many closeups of the crew in the space station, when there was an entire universe to be explored. The other locales themselves were quite lacking in eyecandy and creativity, leading to us longing for more scenes of outer space. Also hurting this film was that too much was happening at the same time, not in plot but in presentation. Sometimes the dialogue audio was battling the musical score and sound effects, resulting in a loud mass that made it tough to hear and comprehend the scene. In the case of Gravity and 2001, it was made sure the music was front and center, toning down just slightly when dialogue was needed to be said. Christopher Nolan is a go-big-or-go-home type of director. Simplicity is not in his resume, he loves his stories and films complex, full of wonder, full of questions, and full of awe-inspiring scenes. However, simplicity is what is definitely lacking in Interstellar. If the film spent more time showing instead of telling, then we would have had a better visual feast ahead of us. A movie of this kind, with so much room to explore, needs to be more like Jurassic Park (simple, yet incredibly thrilling) and less like Contact (psychologically and philosophically inducing). I truly wanted to enjoy this movie, considering the time, effort, and sheer labor put in to this cinematic space opera. But the entire affair was too bloated, too overdone, and just altogether didn't leave much to the imagination. Each of the pieces were good from the acting to the directing to the cinematography to the special effects. But altogether none of it really meshed, even with a running time of over 160 minutes. In space, nobody can hear you. In the movie theater however, every yawn can indeed be heard, now matter how pretty it looked...
4.0~WTF: 9 in IMDb??? natkappa Sign in Permalink This movie was a mediocre compare to other sci-fi movies. The crew: Matthew McConaughey: he was talking like a farmer from Texas (he was first of all a great pilot)... a cowboy hat and a pair of boots were missing from the picture... Anne Hathaway: to sweet for a scientist who works in NASA... Only Michael Caine and the kids were alright (not great). Basics:The plot was OK BUT in some points to "romantic" and too much. I didn't like the END at all. The direction was OK but i think in 3D would have been better. Nice Special Effects! I gave a 4 because of all the fuss about it... (if it wasn't so overrated i would have given a 6)
1.0~Ugh... (looks down at watch for the eleventh time) minimalist07 Sign in Permalink Well, it is interesting for sure to see reviews for this film at the extreme ends, either loving or hating. I like to watch movies but I am not like some who seem to be students of film. I didn't know going in that Interstellar would be nearly three hours or that Nolan had directed the film. I hated Inception. Also, I have a bit of a problem when people always bring up the Science in a Science Fiction film. it is in fact FICTION. However, Interstellar was just dreadful. the first hour they were on a farm in the middle of who knows where. Nothing was established. How long had it been since Cooper had flown. What was his involvement in his previous career? How did the world get to like it was portrayed in this movie? Also, I had a problem with the premise that Mankind was never meant to stay on earth. What? Then Cooper is asked to fly a mission and doesn't even have time to reacquaint with current technology but he can dock a ship while spinning at over 50 miles an hour. Hmmm. Like others said, there is no character development so you don't care about these people. The dialog also had a lot of problems. I was angry when I walked out. I couldn't leave early because I was with someone. Ugh, what a waste of time and money!
1.0~its not a science fiction movie - its , um, vincom Sign in Permalink its not a science fiction movie - its , um, i really don't know how to classify it other than its full of itself. I've watched every science fiction show/movie out there and if you're like me you will be mad after watching this movie. you can make a movie if your premise is right, for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a "chance" at making a half decent science fiction movie. you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible. well w/interstellar they don't even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence. if you like star trek(any of them, TV spin offs or movies), star wars, Babylon 5, battle star, doctor who(old or new), and even 2001 Space Odyssey(boring but well made considering when it was made), take my advice and stay away, you will loose 3hrs of your life. the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no sense.
6.0~Ridiculously far-fetched - even for sci-fi fantasy Inthebiz80 Sign in Permalink What a waste. I'm a sci-fi fan and even I give this movie only a "6." A lot of talented actors, quality sound & cinematography, but the screenplay really doesn't hold up. In addition to being too far-flung in the number of principal characters, it's too long, and becomes almost comical at times in its plot twists. The movie would have been better served to have: - limit principal characters/stories and provide greater depth for remaining ones - Make the earth-related issues more believable Your time is better spent on a lot of other, higher-quality, sci-fi movies.
10.0~Best Movie of this Year! gsvasu2006 Sign in Permalink I knew something about the plot and thought that it may not be anything more than what I knew. But I was wrong! I was amazed at how Nolan unwrapped one surprise after another and by the time the movie completed and end credits started to roll, I was left speechless for 10 minutes or so. Some of the audience started clapping when the movie endedsome just sat on their chairs dumbstruck! Outside, people were busy discussing the movie that they have just seenit is a rare sight! I was trying to analyse and understand what I just saw. I need to see it another two times at least to understand this amazing movie better! I need to understand the science the movie has spoken about before I can try to understand it! Nolan has gone a step beyond what we have expected out of him with this movie. I am amazed at how he can reinvent himself every time! Unlike other Nolan movies, this one is strong on emotions as well..at the core it is father - daughter relationship. We had seen only a glimpse of father -son relationship in 'Inception'this one could bring tears to your eyes seeing the performance of the actors. I don't like to give away much Some pointers by me.. You need to brush up science and know at least the basics like time, black holes, relativity, gravity, etc to understand the science part of this movie. Do not spread spoilers on this movielet everyone go into the theater with no knowledge of this movie to be amazed like me! Watch it 3 times or more times to understand it better!
6.0~Interstellar FLOP and over-rated mess johnptomai Sign in Permalink What a promise of greatness this film posed. In fact, the film seems to deliver on its promise for the first 30-40 minutes. I was enthralled by act One. But, then the film goes off the rails in a truly "Stellar" manner late in Act Two! I mean, WACKO time. The things they ask us to believe are unexplained and implausible. A good film manages to deliver on far fetched plot twists by cluing the audience in on key details, it provides the viewers with the knowledge they need to buy into the big reveal. In the case of Interstellar, I found myself in total disbelief, angry at the writers for taking the movie off in one unexplained implausible tangent after another. In the end, it was a total mess. -Despite all the promise of the idea.
9.0~A Relative Matter aharmas Sign in Permalink Nolan does it again. He gives us a thought-provoking adventure with basis on the past, present, and possible future of humankind. It makes us ponder about how we came about, where and why we are experiencing the current state of affairs, and the possible outcome. Who is responsible for humankind's future? Who do we relate to and why? Are there any "they" out there to guide, help, protect us, or send us to our ultimate fate. "Interstellar" follows the journey of a man who is selected to find a possible solution to our dying environment. He stumbles upon a secret, scientific project that might take him to another galaxy where he can find a suitable answer to our problems. What he is told, what happens, and what the others do is what makes the tale so interesting and exciting. However, this is not "Star Wars" or "Close Encounters". It is a original idea that goes beyond what others have hinted at before. What if we dared crossed that border? What if we pushed ourselves a little more? Where does the spiritual and the scientific intersect? Of course, there will be questions about theology, though we hardly hear the characters make any direct references to such entities, but we have a wonderful score that certainly reminds us of what is not being said. In order to get our interests, the outline is laid out, and Cooper (Matthew) is soon on his way to Saturn and the wormhole that will serve as a conduit to the other galaxy where there will be more choices and answers to our questions. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to deal with the possibilities, and that is where the problem lies. On top of that, there are always surprises along the way, and both nature itself and human nature have a way of coming up with more variables than we care to deal with. Soon the pilot and scientists see themselves in worlds where both gravity, time, and energy take on different manifestations from what we are used to. Some storms are just much bigger and powerful than what we are accustomed to, and there is always hidden agendas, unexpected twists to the story, and our ability to try our hardest when things become really complicated. I truly enjoyed the way some natural events and emotions are explained in very detailed scientific lingo, which might prove fresh to some and too challenging to other members of the audience. What strikes me, too is that though the film appears to slow down for some of these exchanges, it never becomes boring. There is always the lure of mystery, of knowledge, and how the mind is thirsty for some sort of stimulation, and in this film, knowledge is power and salvation, and I found it invigorating and hopeful that books are prominently displayed here. We can see how technology allows Nolan to create a new series of visual and sound effects, which play an important part here, and it is very satisfying to see that space looks "real", and by the time we are taken through the wildest moments of the ride, we are not disappointed. In fact, the climax of the film is even more complex than expected because here is where technology, faith, and the will to survive blend quite nicely. Nolan keeps his characters real, even when it becomes more challenging to believe there is the possibility of another level to the way we understand the word "dimension". All of the performers do excellent work here, with Jessica and Matthew leading the pack. Caine, Burstyn, Hathaway and Damon do very good supporting work, and each one does his/her best to make the story's difficult parts believable and relatable. There is not going to be anyone in the audience who will not believe the way the laws of physics and biology are pushed to the limit because the structure of the film is very intelligent, never going beyond what we understand, and if still a bit incomprehensible, at least it lays the foundations for what might be a more concrete possibility in the future. "Interstellar" will have you thinking, believing, and loving every minute those people are on the screen. We have a little bit of everything, and the balances are just right because even a power emotion like love is somehow explained in a logical way that will have skeptics believing that it is as real anything that scientists can fabricate in a lab. "Interstellar" shows another side of Science Fiction, making it more tangible, more real, more heartfelt, and way different from what we have seen before.
3.0~Interstellar was anything but STELLAR. It was more like Inter...Stupid. stevenfreekin Sign in Permalink After the underwhelming Dark Knight Rises, its director now brings us "Interstellar." Although it's an exceptionally photographed movie, it painfully lacks depth in its story and characters, which were all very forgettable. The only things i enjoyed about this movie were the production design, costume design, and visual effects. The music was one of the worst scores I've ever heard...WOW. Some parts of the movie are over dramatic to the point where its laughable. The characters were not believable. I was not convinced with Matthew McConaughey's performance as a NASA pilot at all. In terms of the story it was really, really, really stupid. Hmmmm....let's see. The world is going to end...What else is new. Let's find the best Nasa Pilot in the world. Great, we found a farmer who also happens to be the greatest NASA pilot in the world. Oh, by the way, it just happens that the spaceship is already built, equipped and ready to go with a crew. Awesome let's Go! Oh while on our mission let's tell the audience everything in exposition terms even the ones they heard about time travel from the past syfy movies again. Great. Let's also use a twilight zone twist with Matt Damon's character too. Awesome. Oh and let's have M. Night Shyamalan direct the ending with his signature twist. Great. Now let's loop it back to the beginning of the movie. WOW. Really, really, really Stupid. Unfortunately Nolan and Zimmer crap the sheets again like they did on the Dark Knight Rises.
1.0~I just don't buy it. rearkell Sign in Permalink I'm guessing that a lot of the people who went to this movie - and wrote reviews - are science fiction buffs. I am not. But I do like a good movie, regardless of it's genre. And this wasn't it. The only thing that held the movie even slightly together is Matthew McConaughey. Otherwise it was totally unbelievable. The weather disturbances that are ruining the planet are unexplained. The protagonist just accidentally running into a secret NASA station is unbelievable. The 5 dimension thing is a cop out. Given the large budget for this movie, I'm surprised that they didn't have the kind of detailed and interesting settings and backdrops that one might expect in a movie that is almost 3 hours long. And don't forget to bring your hearing protectors. I luckily did bring mine since I have tinnitus in my ears. Even my 28db mufflers were barely enough, as the seats were shaking slightly in a few scenes. I think that it is irresponsible for the movie industry to have such dangerously high db levels with no notification or advisory label. Matthew McConaughey is at the peak of his career and has done some really great movies over the past few years. This one, however, is just a throw away.
1.0~why everybody is wrong and this is a really bad movie melkurion Sign in Permalink OK, this is a rant. For perspective: I love movies/see everything in the theater/can enjoy almost all movies/love scifi. But I hated Interstellar! This movie makes nooo sense. Technoscience babble on Star Trek knows is makes no sense, Interstellar tries to make you belief it has a scientific bases, it does not! It rapes hearsay on about a dozen theories, but it's like a five year old read Hawking and then explains it to a retarded dog! I'm not even gonna say spoilers ahead, because spoiling something inherently means ruining something good, no chance of that here! First of, apparently there was a world war, people many died... but somehow with a reduced world population there was still not enough food, so everybody had to become a farmer.... seriously? that alone is a crappy premise that makes no sense. Bcs it's not like they are doing it manually! They have frigging robot harvesters. Also, no MRI scanners, but apparently we still harvest fossil fuels to keep 50 year old trucks going. There is a plague that kills crops....but apparently not tress/grass/bushes/ and other assorted plant life, just the edible ones. A dust bowl you say.... really bad production when in the shot the window still is full of dust, the wall boards 10 cm next to it are clean.... Also, in the car: masks on, in an old wooden rickety house, take them off... Man shows up at secret NASA base...oh what a coincidence, you used to be a NASA pilot , we're your old buddies! By the way TOMORROW! we are launching our only rocket. You can pilot it bcs our crew has only done simulators where as you flew it...once....10 years ago.... WTF!?!? This crew and you will spend 10 years together on a mission, but we don't need to do a medical check, psych profile OR even refresh our memory, just show up tomorrow dude! We launch into space, OK we need to dock with the big ship, switch to manual...uhhm, why would you do that????? Well we've been in technological dark ages for 50 years, but hey look we did happen to invent cryostasis! how convenient! We're on a spaceship with limited room, but your cryochamber for some inexplicable reason has to go down into the floor , why? we'll it looks cool of course! At this point we're only like 45 minutes into the friggin thing! So I'll speed up: Planets orbit a black hole, or only one does? where is the sun that is providing light, why doesn't it get sucked in? It's not OK to have the ship experience 7 years time delay, but the shuttle is OK. Big wave smashes shuttle on rocks, no damage! You were gone for 23 year, I didn't think you were coming back, but instead of continuing the mission I decided to sit on my ass and watch the black hole. Frozen floating clouds. Homicidal Matt Damon. Robots that are absolutely ridiculous.... really really really ridiculous...like lost in space ORIGINAL TV did it better. Robots walk in way that is not possible, take 4 pieces of wood and find out for yourself. Nothing escapes a black hole, not even light, but we can send in the droid and it can send out a signal... Also, black hole does give of light apparently. Somehow girl's part is bad acting both as a kid as well as an adult. CONSISTENCY AT LAST! We don't have enough fuel to visit 2 planets, but now we do, so everything is OK. Many years time delay,wake up on space station. Go back to help new colony, also time delayed, don't worry bcs we didn't bother to send anybody else the the last 100 friggin years. BLLEERGGHHHHH
4.0~Tried and failed spock-386-815174 Sign in Permalink What is it with our directors that they fail to come with a SF movie being renewing,different,special. Nolan might be good for certain aspects but is copying from left and right ideas and puts them in a new movie which is supposed to have us reflect on our being human and respecting our planet. The wormhole equals the monolith of 2001. The binary messages equal the messages in Contact ( moreover with the same actor ). Some of the visuals equal scenes in Gravity...and so on and on. The movie is too long and too cheesy.If I compare this to 2001, 2001 will top it , compare it to Contact , Contact will top it , and even Gravity with a thin-line story will top it. No sorry despite the efforts put in this which I have to aknowledge it does not deliver the goods I want from a SF-movie. I sincerely hope that some day some director will have the guts to take on a Jack Vance novel , now that would be something different . So Steven Spielberg , what are you waiting for ?
10.0~my review bloofygamersnl Sign in Permalink I have to be honest when I saw the trailer I thought the film would be very monotonous so I was wonder if I would watch the film, eventually I am started to watch the movie, right from the first minute I thought it was really a great movie, not only because I am super interested in what plays in space and I love very much adventure films, but also because it's a bit the real life of an astronaut describes, the say goodbye to your family for example, and not being able to promise when you come back and if you come back at all, also I found that the film contained a lot of variety. and by that I mean that there is always a different kind of problem came, or the planet was not viable or the spaceship went piece, I thought it was really super that they have made, almost 3 hours full of excitement at the last 50 minutes it was really kind of mind f*ck because I didn't know how it could be that he was in a 5 dimensional space but good in other words, I found a SUPER movie and I really hope there is a interstellar 2 comes!!!
3.0~Good in parts, terrible in others. Mash up of ideas without a good plot. Fourstrawberries Sign in Permalink I'm going to have to watch my back after this !! I'll start by saying what I didn't like. The ending was dreadful, almost as if the writers were in a rush to finish. I can imagine the conversation, "I can't be bothered anymore, how can we wrap this up?" someone says "Kubrick got away with it" and so a meaningless crappy ending similar to, but worse than, "2001 A Space Odyssey" was shoved in. The ending, quite simply, was drivel and unsatisfying. Secondly, a world devastated by drought and famine, somehow manages to run a sophisticated space programme, in secret. This would really require materials and technology that could only be supplied by prosperous technological civilisation. Actors spouting pseudo-scientific BS and waffle , it's not necessary and just ruins the movie. Star Wars gets it right, the technology just IS and we can enjoy the CGI. I loved the scene where they are on a planet subject to strong tidal gravitation. In summary, a mish-mash of good and bad ideas tipped into a bucket and stirred. Another wasted opportunity. Watch the movie, it's worth at least that, but be prepared to feel that you were cheated out of dessert on a meal out.....
3.0~Wait until Video Rental if you MUST toscajo1103 Sign in Permalink It was..... Okay at BEST! Better wait for the Redbox version than it would be worth the money; I guess! Definitely not worth a Theater viewing; IMAX or NOT. It just wasn't that good. It was just Slow; Intense; Sometimes Predictable. Than the ultimate Book Shelf Stupid scene; REALLY!! Son, in his 20s fell asleep a number of times. I am in my 50s; started to get sleepy. I say again, if you want to see it wait for the video to come out
1.0~Got an account just go give this movie 1/10 berggrent-95739 Sign in Permalink That's right. What an horrible movie. Don't know what's worse, the pathethic acting from almost everyone (Damon won the price tho for insignificant character) or the robots with graphics similar to "Cop" from 1988. HOW can so much people enjoyed this? The first two hours is a total sleepfest, until the twist at the end where at least something happen that's interesting and not pointless.
10.0~Just amazing aslanov634 Sign in Permalink The best film I have ever seen. Visual effects are such good that I can not explain with my words. There were some plot issues but it doesn't mean that this film is not good.The emotional parts also impressed me that I couldn't stop crying. When he sees video messages from different age periods of his children I couldn't stop myself. Also I want to emphasize that Hans Zimmer made one of his best works in this film which I think should won all the Oscars. But it is not a problem you have one :) Christopher Nolan proved that he is the best producer in the Galaxy. Thanks all of you who played role in the making of this film
5.0~Highly Overrated bob-rutzel-239-525430 Sign in Permalink Earth is over populated and is running out of food. All crops fail due to the worldwide blight except for corn and in time the corn will fail too. NASA decides to send a ship into space to look for a planet so mankind can survive. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) a former NASA pilot and now a corn farmer is chosen to pilot the ship. It's been years since he last flew, but hey, it's like riding a bike. They must have seen McConaughey driving that Lincoln in a commercial and said, "you know, he could be our pilot." You need a couple things before sitting down with popcorn to watch this movie: (1) A box of Kleenex, (2) the Remote knowing where the Volume Control is at all times if you watch the DVD as I did. The best part of this movie is the first 45-minutes before blast-off to space. We see the premise which is all about love and family as witnessed between father (Cooper) and daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Yes, it is all about survival too, but love wins out. Here you need the Kleenex at times. On a ride thru the cornfield Cooper and Murph come upon a secret NASA base where the Rocket is. Secret? Didn't the person who planted the corn see the security fences? What were they thinking? Blast-Off: Here you need the Remote because the sound is deafening and not only here but all the way thru the movie. Why the deafening sounds? What were they thinking? And often the music (HA) is loud enough so we cannot really hear all the dialogues among the characters. We get bits and pieces, but there are times we need to know something and cannot. Rewinding the DVD doesn't help all that much. Since we know the movie is about 3-hours long, we cannot waste time doing the rewind bit and we give it a rest. However, most of the conversations are about love, family and survival and we got the jest of all that even though we hear a lot of mumbling. What were they thinking? This is not Star Trek. We cared about the people in that show. Here we do not. There is a lot of Science-speak among the ship's crew, but this loses us most of the time; and how accurate this is cannot be known by us. We are used to a metallic voice from a computer or a soothing voice like we heard by HAL in 2001. Here the computer voice is too human sounding (I looked around thinking this was another crew member) and looks like metallic air vents that can walk. What were they thinking? The acting all around was okay, nothing Oscar Worthy. However, Mackenzie Foy as Murph did stand out. Notables: John Lithgow, Anne Hathaway, William DeVane, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain as the older Murph, Ellen Burstyn as Murph on her death bed, and Matt Damon. Visuals were disappointing for the most part. We see the wings of the ship most of the time. They couldn't help it that the CGI guy had to take a mental health day or was that "days?" The shots inside the ship were very good. The mission is to fly to that Wormhole aliens put there so Earth people would find it and go through to a new planet and people of Earth will be saved. Yes, they go through (shades of the TV show SG-1) but later end up going through the Black Hole thinking they can survive and succeed and find a planet. There are 2-twists that surprised us. When the first one hits the action actually starts and woke us up. The next twist is mind-blowing and you won't like it. Like I said, this is overrated. Does it save itself? Barely. What were they thinking? (5/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only 2 F-bombs
8.0~Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's "Batman"-trilogy, so here is his newest work: "Interstellar". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate. This is like our generation's "Armageddon", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. "Interstellar" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really. Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. that much we know. David Oyelowo, plays a small role here, as one of the teachers. He has "Selma" in the race for an Academy award nomination this year. The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course as that does not really be mentioned for Nolan movies. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit say they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always. This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch it, preferably on the big screen due to it's sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character fittingly was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot.
9.0~If you don't want to scratch your head for 169mins.. READ THIS.! shail_thegreat Sign in Permalink Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!! 'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE. To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as "THEY" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves. In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too. Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty. Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies. Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about. The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions. Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!
4.0~A mess kamcjm Sign in Permalink Interstellar is like physics for idiots. It is a mess of Kubrickian proportions. We are to believe characters like scientists explain simple principles to other scientists? for the sake audience understanding? Insulting. Interstellar is full of big ideas that implode into a black hole of stupidity so dense that not even light can escape it! This movie reminded me a little of the Brian DePalma flick Mission To Mars, which is not a compliment. Mission is worse, but both directors are attempting too large a project for their abilities. Normally exceptional actors like Gary Sinise (Mission) and Matthew McConnaughey (Interstellar) can't reach potential in either film - more than likely because the scripts are so poorly written and the lines so improbable. Character development is weak, and imagery is strange more than fascinating. I like some of the attempts to steal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unfortunately the 1968 art epic still holds up better than Interstellar's science fiction attempt nearly 50 years later.
1.0~What a disappointment! chaney-397-753151 Sign in Permalink I waited with great anticipation for this movie and was sorely and truly disappointed. I don't understand where the 10 reviews came from? What planet were they on! Perhaps they were from viewers from the other side of the worm hole or black hole! I have been a sci fi fan for many years but this movie took a leave from all logical or good sci fi explanations. Plot was ambiguous. Storyline convoluted. Technology was not linear. One sees a 20th century Saturn V lifting the crew up to a 22nd century space craft. Sleep pods with crew jumping into them like they are going for a nap! Exploratory craft that operate like a Star War's movie. Landing on a water world with some silly time dilation theme that doesn't affect craft in orbit? Can't these people survey the world from orbit? Black holes, 5 dimensions with metaphysical connection! Shameless referrals to 2001. It was embarrassing. On and on for way too long. Han Zimmer's music score was good with a few good special effects. But that was it.
1.0~Boring - if this is mankind, why save it? peterjkh Sign in Permalink When I watch a movie, I want to be drawn in, care about the people and their problems, feel the urgency of the situation, experience the awe when exploring new worlds. This movie did not do the for me. I really could not relate to the characters. I did not care what happened to them, how they felt, what they had to go through. None of them seemed very likable either. The father (a redneck with a southern drawl – that strangely disappeared during the movie) did not seem to care a lot about his children. The son grew up to be an asshole who did not seem to care about his wife (a submissive domestic drudge who seemed to be afraid of her husband) and child. And the daughter, Murph, never got over the fact that her father left her to save the world (no less!) and was totally messed up. One moment you see the son and daughter as children, the next time you see them they are grown-ups, at least 25 years older and you do not have a clue what happened to them in between. And quite frankly, you do not give a damn either. The situation: planet Earth is dying and the few people left, are farmers now. Do we see anything of our dying planet? No. Just a farmhouse in a dusty cornfield in the middle of Mid-West Nowhere. Does it look ominous? Not in the least. Does it look like a disaster waiting around the corner? No. All the rednecks still seem to be driving their enormous gas-guzzlers (where do they get the fuel from?) and they do not seem to bother about the world, let alone doing noticeable effort to find a solution. So does it look like a problem that urgently need to be solved. Not really. But wait, dad has dashed off in a space ship to find another world, so probably they spent decades of their time watching the sky for him to return with the good news, rather than assuming that he maybe never will come back and that it maybe would be a good idea to see if they in the mean time could find some solution. But no. They all wait for our hero to come back through the black hole to tell them that there is a paradise waiting at the other side of the hole. Daddy in the mean time, spends his days with two colleagues that he does not really like, exploring outer space. And guess what, after a refreshing 2-year nap, they go through the hole and what do they find? Water World and Ice Age. Really? This is the best they could come up with? Is it stunning? No, I have seen water and ice before. Well, to cut a (very) long story short, after exploring those worlds daddy jumps in the black hole and guess what? He tumbles right into his old house in the cornfields and lands behind the bookshelves in his daughter's bedroom. It all looks like a bad LSD-trip. But somehow he manages to manipulate the hands of a watch, and his daughter immediately understands that that is a message from her father and saves the world. The whole story is wrapped up with some sentiment and our hero flies off to the woman he never liked, but who now suddenly seem to be the love of his life. The end. This all is laced with pseudo-scientific gibberish and endless, endless, endless scenes about people in a spaceship arguing and people in the farmhouse in the dusty cornfield arguing. If a gigantic meteor would have fallen out of the sky and would have destroyed that farmhouse and that darn dusty cornfield to begin with, I could have spent the remaining 3 hours to something more useful. And I couldn't have cared less.
2.0~Too long, inconsistent plot, ambiguous theme shusei-110-830196 Sign in Permalink I saw this film not on screen and I think it was right. The film's plot doesn't justify 169 minutes experience of sitting in darkness of movie theater. For Science Fiction story with such a space-time scale, its' necessary to have more "superhuman", "unworldly" approach to theme. I don't like so much "2001: A Space Odyssey" with its too "unworldly" plot, but it was really on the path of the genre's tradition and norms. Main stream Sci-fi from the beginning has dealt with human being as part of long-term development of the civilization, with the intellectual dominance in it and its limitations (including its conflict with human nature). Such films as "Forbidden Planet", "Roller Ball" and even "The Terminator" belong to this stream. Another stream was such that deals with future world or futuristic technology as convenient gadget to develop rather traditional plot of other genre in a new setting."Alien", "Star Wars" and even "Blade Runner" are in this stream. Probably only a genius like Andrei Tarkovsky could take the third course in this genre. He made "philosophical" Sci-Fi, not so "unworldly" but with emotional warmth, suffering of human being in this world, on the Earth, in "Solaris" and "Stalker". But he didn't like this genre at all. If a filmmaker or a writer want to tell a "human story" in Sci-fi,then it's better to do so joining the second stream. The third one is not the choice of "worldly" hit maker. I think the plot of "Interstellar" can be much shorter to develop the family story. No such strange situation of "World's end" is needed to do so. Today we already know the facts of global warming, possible exhaustion of fossil resources, ecological instability, and the wrong course of our civilization in general. So it would be simple to state the crisis and to start the story of emigration or exploration from the very start(as,for example, in "Stalker" and "Blade Runner"). The film's plot was meaninglessly made prolonged and complicated by adding pseudo-scientific terms and gadgets, like 5th dimension, black hole and wormhole. If you cut all of them, the plot will still work for family story of an astronaut, only by using "cold sleep" technology. In general, sentimental story with "time travel" fit better to "fantasy" than Sci-fi. And there are such films as "Somewhere in Time" and "Portrait of Jennie", both of which were FAR BETTER MADE than "Interstellar" , telling stories with very clear theme.
3.0~How can this be rated so high by IMDb? matthewbnntt Sign in Permalink This film is 2 hours and 49 minutes of slowly bleeding to death. The magnitude of actors is the only one thing that keeps my attention (e.g. when is Matt Damon inserted into this?). Such a disappointment. I'm very pleased that I waited until this was available on streaming services. The beginning, while slow and lacking character development (and somewhat unbelievable), is interesting. The end is completely ridiculous. I had a flashback to "The Fifth Element" where it was declared that love was the 5th element. Too much time spent on irrelevant side stories that added nothing. The ending is difficult to find realistic or plausible. I found myself wondering how this movie could have such high ratings on IMDb after being released over 1 year ago! As a scientist/engineer, I wanted to enjoy this film. I was woefully disappointed. For anyone interested, I'd watch The Martian long before watching this drivel. I'm shocked that this is #29 in IMDb's "Top Rated Movies", how did that happen? Brings into question how reliable IMDb really is with respect to objective movie reviews.
4.0~Wants too much. Achieves almost nothing. davidkvast Sign in Permalink It's not a bad movie, but it's ordinary at best. Dialogue is very clumsy at times. It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself.
1.0~Grand ideas don't make great movies dron_ru Sign in Permalink It is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be 'brainy', 'intelligent', 'well written'... With all the things I read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad. The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions? While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out. And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity saved in the same way. Grand ideas don't make great movies if you can't deliver them properly... It is atrocity to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece...
2.0~Wouldn't recommend. christineewing1337 Sign in Permalink 8.8? I'm just not feeling it. Total "snoregasm", I swear. It's VERY slow to start, then disappointing once it does get going. I'm one of those that has to finish nearly every movie and book I start, no matter how bad. It took me 3 days to finish watching because I could only stand about 40 boring ass minutes at a time. Quasi-science muddled with current theory and overstretched artistic license, and let's face it; McConaughey as "humanities last hope"? Yeah, we'd be screwed. He's not altogether that bad, but in reality the coolest thing about him is his Air-stream. The improbability levels in the "science" and the story make it difficult to get into it.
4.0~Awesome science fiction trapped in an awful script matt_hinnigan-93215 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a visually stunning film containing the most realistic depictions of astronomical objects such as wormholes and black holes ever shown in a film, through in- depth input from Professor Kip Thorne. Most of the acting performances are very strong, and the set design of the spaceships and alien planets are great. For those reasons alone it's worth a look, but there are some problems. Before I get into spoilers, one of the main issues is pace. The film is just too long, and in particular it takes an age to get off Earth and into space. We came here for Sci-fi, the film's called Interstellar, c'mon, how about some rockets 'n stuff? It also feels too long because the film is a checklist of every major astronomical concept ever filmed - black holes, neutron stars, wormholes, time dilation and more besides. Some simplification would have made for a better story. From here on there are spoilers. The entire plot is based on an obvious causality paradox. Matthew McConaughey's character is an astronaut turned farmer who is given the coordinates of a secret NASA base by a future version of himself, enabling him to travel to the base and be accepted into the NASA team. Only the fact that he found the base enabled him to travel into space and ultimately send this message back to his earlier self. That's not the only problem with the plot by a long way, though. While engaged in a race to save humanity, the characters waste 23 years traveling to a planet orbiting a black hole, where the theory of relativity states time is passing much more slowly. The purpose of the trip is to establish whether the planet is a suitable replacement Earth for humanity. At no point do they attempt to assess the planet from orbit (where all of it could be seen, without losing 23 years of Earth-time) but must instead visit the surface (presumably to see what a couple of square miles looks like). This ends in the death of one astronaut and the finding that the planet is no good. It's as if none of the characters have noticed that they are in a spaceship literally covered in windows. Also, the beacon saying "everything's great here" that they went to investigate turned out to be just a series of echoes of the initial signal it sent before being destroyed. So they were unable to predict that possibility despite clearly having a full understanding of relativistic physics, and their beacons aren't programmed to include a time stamp or any form of ID number. People this stupid deserve everything they get... At the next planet they discover that the earlier human explorer sent there (don't worry, the script includes a ridiculous explanation of why a dozen astronauts were sent to their near- certain deaths rather than using unmanned probes) turns out to be falsely sending out "come visit, it's good here" signals because he wants to be rescued. So the mission was designed in complete ignorance of the human instinct for self-preservation and how that could ruin everything. People this stupid deserve everything they get... In a movie that markets itself on how good and realistic its science is, we are put through some cringe making dialogue about how love is quantifiable, conquers all and will save us in the end. Anakin and Padme made me want to vomit less than that scene. Towards the end, the lead character falls into a black hole in an act of self-sacrifice. Then there are a few obvious winks to the audience designed to hint that nobody really knows what laws of physics apply inside a black hole, and then it turns out that inside black holes the last ten minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey are being endlessly ripped off for all eternity, except with more deus ex machina. The small problem with this is that the lead character would be dead long before he got inside the Event Horizon, so... And after that, the black hole spits him out in some new, unexplained, convenient way to a region of space that just happens to be a short hop away from a space station where he can be rescued in time to meet his now-elderly daughter who saved humanity by building space stations that in no way rely on his heroic actions. And when he gets there to meet the daughter he left aged 10, who now has children and grandchildren of her own while he has not aged a year, none of them are interested, and she sends him away. The last ten minutes of the film are both redundant and stupid. All in all, Interstellar is a beautiful, well acted, engaging, interesting film let down by a plot so weak you'll feel like you're watching a moron's idea of an intelligent movie.
4.0~There is a good film in there, but this cut isn't it. peakcrew Sign in Permalink I like Christopher Nolan films, but I actively wish I hadn't spent almost three hours of my life watching this one. There is a good film in there - 15 minutes setting the scene, getting into space, doing things, meeting the mad professor, getting back. All the stuff on Earth once the spacecraft takes off could be lost without anyone noticing, and all the emotional nonsense should have never even been filmed (OK, I like my science fiction "hard", and I suppose I'm describing a cross between "2001"/"2010", "Dark Star" and "The Right Stuff"). The whole "power of love" stuff just slowed the film down, and was frankly boring. In terms of acting, Anne Hathaway carried the whole thing. She was the only one who seemed to believe in her character. Matthew McConaughey was is usual shallow, overacting self, Michael Caine looked sedated in every scene, and the other cast were totally forgettable. For a film that was supposed to be scientifically accurate, there was significant silliness - e.g. spacecraft not significantly technically advance from space-shuttles surviving huge amounts of damage (remember that space shuttles were shut down after a small piece of ice caused sufficient damage to destroy the last mission), ridiculous amounts of fuel apparently being carried on small craft (escape velocity without booster rockets), robots that could not possibly move around in the way they did, some sort of interstellar "ark" that couldn't have held the population of a small state, let alone a significant proportion of the world. The effects were great, the engineering terrible. The thing that stands out for me was the music - the soundtrack was excellent. It isn't often that organs are used so much in a movie. I shall mourn the film this could have been, since I will not revisit the one as released. It is too long, too "touchy-feely", and too directionless.
10.0~Reality is just not found, only search remain nsnobela Sign in Permalink The film is one of the films that gave me ideas on how much powerful it is to tell as well researched story filled with love. For the Director, I have learn so much, from watching his film collection, how He use the word Powerful, from Inception said by Leo and in Interstellar said by Anne. The search to me is like finding who really you are in life, and when you do, always remember you can only stop time from moving when you do what you know love the most. To me Interstellar is like is a movie of all time that help you find yourself. I am proud of Mr. Nolan, and since I am In Tribeca and He is here I will be happy to meet him and learn more from his art. I watched it twice in one day, all I can say is it's a move that needs you to watch over and over and over, to understand the art of telling a story. I rate 10/10 My question for Mr Nolan is will finding the new life on the other planet stop people from harming nature?
3.0~Pretentious charleforum Sign in Permalink Rather disappointed in that movie. As with many new Sci-fi, the viewer in drown in a sea of special effect to cover a poor story line. This movie is crafted in pure scientist hubris, and is a lengthy attempt at explaining how humanity would self explain itself. In front a the great mystery of the meaning and origin of life, some people seems unable to accept that a few things might transcend us and would rather explain everything by our future genius and awesomeness... Because there is no limit to what we will be, right? It is like 2001 Space Odyssey: massively overrated. The intellectual dilemma of the story is whether humanity is to be seen as a collection of individuals, or as a species, and the answer seems to be that we would be maybe our creator and self little helpers. Humanity as a stepping ladder to itself, out of darkness and non existence. Rather sad...
1.0~I Question Humanities Future Based On The Reviews This Movie Is Getting... Not_An_Idiot Sign in Permalink This movie is genius... What? Seriously? First off, possible spoilers, although I'm mostly going to try to avoid them. Second off, SERIOUSLY??? Third, it's not really a one star movie. It's like 5-7ish depending on how you want to weight various factors. I'm just doing this because all the hype, and all the "stellar" (pun intended) reviews are blowing my mind and need to be balanced out. This movie is OK. I'm a sci-fi geek, and an apocalypse movie geek. This was kind of supposed to have both, so how could I go wrong? Easily apparently. If you like movies that actually make sense, this film is not for you. If you have any common sense or a logical brain you'll know what I mean when you see it. For me this film falls into the "big flashy substance free summer blockbuster" category, aside from the fact that it was released in fall. If you like big flashy special effects movies with no substance you'll probably love it, because you're OK with just going for the ride. If you like movies that make sense and have cohesive plots, you will likely be irritated when this strays from those lofty goals... And stray it does. A lot. He TRIED to make a great movie, but ended up with one that doesn't quite get there. This movie, like so many movies with generally promising plots falls down all over the place in the execution... Or more specifically, the script itself. Special effects were killer with lots of great visuals. All the "directing" portions of the movie were well done. So I suppose I can say Nolan did a great job directing the movie. All the actors were just fine... The problem was with what they were told to act out. So Nolan did not do a good job as writer. Perhaps he should stick to directing which he is quite good at. Let me say this, I'm NOT a pompous, arrogant guy in real life. But sometimes I wonder if having a couple dozen IQ points over average just RUINS films for me. So many movies have everything this one does. Good basic premise. Good acting. Great special effects. Horrible scripts that make absolutely no sense for anyone with a brain. So where to begin? In my opinion a huge percentage of movies, especially sci-fi, require that you accept a basic premise. Many of them do not make sense. This can be OK. You just have to roll with it even if it's a little off. Think zombie movies. I love zombies... But really with the setup/explanation of how most zombie viruses spread, and how awesome our military is, and how slow zombies are (or even if they're fast zombies), it's a ridiculous premise. The mess would last about a week, and then get under control. How exactly does a zombie take out an Abrams tank again??? But I roll with it. This movie's basic premise is slightly flawed, but not so much so that it HAS to completely ruin the movie. There are cases where the basic idea is so bad I can't get past it, but this isn't one. Earth is basically overwhelmed by bad weather, and crop killing plagues. It happens in real life. The Dust Bowl was rough, and so was the Irish potato famine. The truth is that we could deal with those easily on Earth, but let us pretend we couldn't and move on. My problem is with the endless series of things that either outright don't make any sense, or things where you have to stretch it pretty far mentally and basically "cover up" for the writing by buying into implausible, silly reasons for things. How exactly does everyone still drive around gas guzzling trucks, and yet are enthralled by a few small solar panels they can pull off of a UAV? How do they have all this infrastructure for pointless things, yet they can't keep control of said UAV, or like make parts for their robotic farm equipment they rig up from scraps? That's the first like 2 seconds of the movie. This movie is a death of a thousand cuts. Going point by point would take way too long. In my opinion this movie didn't have any "deal killer" plot holes. As in no one thing completely made my head instantly explode. But what did happen was by the end of the 2nd hour there were so many little silly things piling up that it just went beyond the pale. There's plenty to be desired in terms of the time dilation stuff making sense, but most of it does if you think it through logically and do the math. Perhaps not 100% though. To me it just had a general vibe of meh with a lot of little stuff. Then there's the non logical portion of the story, AKA the human story, also being meh. It's like they kind of want you to think Cooper and Brand had a love thing maybe? Or at least Cooper does for her... But then no development. But then he rushes off at the end after her... Is that a platonic hero thing, or was that supposed to be the big romance story? You don't even know because it was such a mess. It's not that the actors couldn't have acted it out fine, but it just doesn't happen. I found myself not really caring about any of them much because none of them were developed. Cooper was a pretty cool dude, but other than that I didn't take a lot away. That's it. I'm done typing. In short feel free to watch it, but just be forewarned if you have an analytical mind that you will find many portions of the movie causing minor brain aneurysms.
2.0~Boring And Overrated... Allen-Uncle-Mont-Williams Sign in Permalink This has got to be one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen...I came into this thinking it was going to be as epic as everyone kept saying it was...Boy was I wrong... The performances were alright...Jessica Chastain was the only one who truly stood out as far as good acting...In fact...She's the only reason i even bothered to finish watching the movie... Word is that the special effects were amazing...I disagree...I saw effects that were blatantly stolen from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Mission To Mars... Word is that the movie is quite exciting...Once again...I disagree...With the exception of a scene that has to do with a very big tidal wave...This movie was boring as boring can get... And lastly...I was not at all impressed with the guest appearance by Matt Damon...His character was yet another blatant rip off from a film called Sunshine directed by Danny Boyle...Anybody remember Pinbaker..?? This movie is by far...Christopher Nolan's weakest work ever...Interstellar was boring and extremely overrated...And that's all there is too it...
1.0~Boring Hollywood SOAP OPERA baberchik Sign in Permalink I am wondering if the people who write "intertstellar" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, "complicated" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to "up the ante"... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow. I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara. Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) "LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic "shuttle", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it "just so happens" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The "machine" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!
5.0~What Bothered Me About this Film sndybandy Sign in Permalink I was expecting a great movie especially with an all Star Cast. What ruined the movie for me were WORDS - SPEECH. Before you can enjoy a movie you must be able to understand the dialogue. I found myself and my aunt continually saying to each other "What did he just say". And she couldn't tell me nor could I tell her. Matthew McConaughey especially spoke to low, he seemed to mumble a lot and let his voice drop to a whisper as he was speaking. We left saying "What just happened, what was this movie about". I think if we could have understood everything they said we could have gotten something from the movie. Sometimes the sound effects drowned out the dialogue. The special effects were outstanding but that doesn't make a movie if you don't know what the Characters are saying. I feel like I need a refund.
5.0~Great visual effects, but shallow story Heinzh-102-375695 Sign in Permalink To me, the movie has two major aspects - one being the tremendous visual effects and camera perspectives in space which would make it really worth watching it if it wasn't for - two the very flat character development and the quite shallow dialogs. I do like Science Fiction movies in general but this one really didn't get the balance right. It should've been either less science or less fiction. Several things disturbed me when watching it, e.g. why would you need an entire rocket to leave earth when you can leave bigger planets with a small spaceship with no difficulties? The character development and the dialogs really disappointed me. It is very melodramatic and incomprehensible. Why would a daughter be angry with her dad for 40 years and still react like a 10-year-old? Why would a scientist give a long speech about the multidimensionality of love to convince other scientist to go to one planet or the other. The visual effects, though are outstanding and I would definitely watch a movie of like 30 minutes just of the space footage. But that doesn't get you over three hours. That's another point. Recent movies tend to be longer and longer when they don't have to. It doesn't help neither the story nor the suspense to have it made this long. All in all, in my opinion, the movie is overestimated and if it wasn't for the visual effects I would definitely not recommend watching it.
8.0~One of Nolan's best, but watch out Chris. therocksbarneyreviews Sign in Permalink "Interstellar" is truly an epic, not in the sense of what we initially think of as an epic, for example "Ben Hur" or perhaps even "2001: A Space Odyssey" (a film which it is worth pointing out I haven't seen), but more in the sense of how when I think back to "Interstellar", I think of those visually captivating shots of black, of the unknown and of those desolate landscapes made of water and ice, and how I found myself in awe of them. It is these that come to define "Interstellar". Set in the near future, Earth cannot sustain humanity anymore, and it's worth praising Nolan's subtle view of it, be it seeing the New York Yankees playing on an amateur field or discovering that the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union, which Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) denies. This scene, whilst allowing for a sense of character development in regards to Cooper, in retrospect seems to be Nolan emphasising how he sticks to the traditional elements of film and he does so more than ever in this film, from building several rooms of a spaceship from scratch to using five industrial fans to create a dust storm, thus attributing even more of the credit for the film to him. Yet as I expected, it proves very difficult for members of this all- star cast to break through both the visually stunning shots and the label of Christopher Nolan, and be noticed. Only McConaughey succeeds in doing so, although Mackenzie Foy (playing a young Murphy) and Bill Irwin (voicing the robot, TARS) deserve mentions, as does to an extent Michael Caine (playing Professor Brand) and his recital of Dylan Thomas' "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night", although I still don't entirely understand its inclusion, leaving big names such as Casey Affleck (playing Tom) and even Jessica Chastain (playing Murphy) "down in the dirt". Interstellar is a quintessentially Nolan film, meant to be seen on IMAX, imposing those classic Nolan themes of love and family whilst asking questions that I have not seen asked before, in this case winding up the scientists, although it is interesting to note that Nolan answers them by playing with several theories, instead of just getting the science completely wrong, as is so common. Yet the film is so Nolan that it takes that extra unnecessary step that Nolan always has present in his work, be it taking the audience to Limbo in Inception or by adding the twist of Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard) turning out to be Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises. Before I conclude, I think it is important to make this point in regards to Nolan and his (future) works. He has begun, whether he means it or not, to dwarf his own cast and to an extent his own themes and his commitment to traditional film elements. The amount of hype that goes into his films is widespread and if he isn't careful, his future works could take a turn for the worse. As I have already said, Nolan always takes that extra unnecessary step, one that I don't think I would be so sympathetic with if it was another director, yet the brilliance of what comes before it makes up for it, often leaving me in that No Man's Land of whether the film was worth 9 or 10 stars.
3.0~Oh dear Nolan - too complex and improbable thendoking Sign in Permalink Just simply long - confusing pseudoscience with too many conceptual clichés Most people walked out in silence with a few grumbles --- I love Nolan's body of work - but hated this... And do not sit next to anyone that doesn't get Sci-Fi or this will be two hours of listening to them ask "What does this mean?" "What's a quantum?" So disappointed with Zimmer - a duo tone church organ - Good performances by all - but just ruined by a forced story and tons of plot holes - science gaffs and just bewildering "Whys" Nolan needs to get back to superheroes
1.0~1 point fsmolens Sign in Permalink The Movie doesn't have logic way,its starts somewhere and no logic way for all movie.But there is was couple very dramatic scenes,that probably because this movie got rating 9.1,because people only see the dramatic scenes,and they cry and they put big score for that movie,probably 99.5% its women.This director kris nolan must do melodramas,he will be number one it!!!!.Thats why its got big rating,because people like to cry and remove they emotion somewhere,and that movie is great for it,you don't need to pay to your psycho couple hundred per hour,you just pay $11 for imax and you can cry for 3 hours.Good deal!
1.0~Terrible film trollworkout Sign in Permalink This movie would have been better if it was only about TARS and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue. All that hard science, special effects, scientists working together, making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion. This movie is really a cheeseball Hollywood film with a hard science backdrop. The characters were as flat as a piece of paper. The guy likes the girl, the daughter is mad at dad, dad loves daughter doesn't care about saving mankind. Even TARS had more personality than many of the movie's characters. The daughter was probably most developed but felt so off. Still she holds a grudge 30 years later. Is a movie for average joe blow using the bedazzle tactic of impressing you with confusing story, special effects and hard science when is really no meat and nothing useful TARS gets 10/10 rest of the movie 1/10 I have learned nothing. Made me think about nothing. Wasted my time.
4.0~Another failure from Nolan j-chutlashvili-958-290980 Sign in Permalink Well, this one is another failure movie from Nolan after I saw Inception (which I find totally rubbish). I waited for this movie such a long time, it had 9.0 ratings on IDMB, so I thought it would be as great as Ridley Scott's Prometheus which I like a lot, but this movie is big disappointment, not even close to Prometheus. Both plot & acting are boring. Movie is almost 3 hours & when you watch it, it even seems longer. For the entire movie I was feeling like: "The best part of the movie should come soon now", but it never came. It was so damn boring & with a stupidly unrealistic scenery. Like little girl can read Morse code (seriously? Who's interested in a Morse code in modern time? Especially in children..) & she reads from the ghost who sent her this codes via bookshell & after several years this girl (which is already grown adult) somehow finds out that answers of surviving humanity & disappearance of her father must be in her room where she was reading these Morse code & at that time her father which is in a black hole & which is that ghost by the way, is behind that bookshell sending her a Morse code via clock & his daughter is so damn smart, that she finds out this everything & saves mankind from the doom, lol. What a dumbass scenery. Seriously I don't understand how people give this boring movie 9/10. It seems most of those people are just a Nolan blind fanboys or paid ones. Oh, by the way. we got Hans Zimmer in soundtracks & despite, that he's very good composer, his compositions doesn't fit this movie at all. It makes movie more drama, than SCI-FI & actually movie feels more drama than SCI-FI.
10.0~The best film of all time. stefansperrer Sign in Permalink There is nothing more to say. A masterpiece. Interstellar is by far the best film i have ever seen.
1.0~Why this movie is just a piece of drama lightoothx Sign in Permalink Very simple. Very short. The movie is a complete drama. I saw the trailers and all of them made the movie appear to be scientific, but it is just confusing and filled with speculation. I really am getting annoyed with how new movies are all starting to pretend that Man is something more; like Lucy. All are disappointing movies and the only parts I really enjoyed was when they showed space, like the last few minutes of Lucy, and the few minutes in Interstellar showing the wormhole/blackhole etc... Why do you insist on turning movies into an art? All those who said this movie was great, your reviews are really confusing to me. How can this be a masterpiece, when 95% of the movie was complete drama and a waste of time? If you will make a movie called "Interstellar", I expect to see a 2.5 hour movie filled with speculation and knowledge about things such as a singularity or a blackhole, why waste time talking and docking and other things? Just zoom out and let us stare at the blackhole, that is the sole reason I watched this movie, and the sole reason I created an account here. Next time change it to "Drama/Complete Drama", don't take a name like Interstellar and make it into complete nonsense. We want to see science, we want to see you analyze the blackhole and the wormhole. Completely low budget stuff were put in this film. Docking looked fake by the way. I am extremely outraged at how Fake this movie seemed. Thank you.
7.0~A lot of unexplained things DennisLaursen89 Sign in Permalink ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS*** Christopher Nolan - the man behind one of the greatest sci-fi movies IMO, Inception - wrote this movie. I really like this movie, and the 3 hours went very fast. However, the movie leaves me with some frustrations on some plot holes and unexplained things. On the big water planet our crew went to, it is explained, that the gravity is so powerful, that an hour on that planet is about 7 Earth-years. With so heavy a gravity, the crew should be crushed by the gravity. However, the planets gravity is only 1.4 of the Earths gravity. And furthermore, when the crew return to the base after 15 minutes, the remaining crew-member have waiting 26 years. And how can the main person enter a black hole(!) without being crushed or anything? If this nonsense not where present in the movie, it would easily get 9 or 10 stars from me.
10.0~Is this a movie or a possible future ? kevin-levrone Sign in Permalink I have probably never seen a better movie than this. Plain and simple. It's not only the science fiction of it, which takes everything you see on documentary movies about the Universe (which I am a big fan of) and combines them into something tangible and almost real. But even the emotional side of it was stronger than many movies that concentrate solely on this. What I liked the most about the movie was that everything looked like it could be happening in the near future. The spaceships didn't look like in Star Trek, but almost like the ones you currently see NASA launching. Same with the astronaut costumes, they just looked real. This movie really left marks on my soul. I can't stop thinking about it since I watched it and I am somewhat sad realizing that I may not be here when the human kind will really expand to other planets (hopefully long before Earth becomes inhabitable). Acting was flawless, picture was flawless, the depth of the movie was immense. Even the physics was mostly correct. Go see it as soon as possible.
4.0~I cannot believe the ridiculously hight ratings Interstellar has received p-jonsson Sign in Permalink That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either. Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two. The movie starts of with the usual "I told you so" wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience. The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a "save the human race" mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense! The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie. The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design? The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.
1.0~Godawful dreck tkelly1414 Sign in Permalink I bought the studio hype that this was the most "intelligent" sic-fi film since 2001: Space Odyssey. What an insult to Kubrick. LIke the Dark Knight Rise, Interstellar is 3 long hours of torture, from the moment McCanaughey accidentally stumbles upon NASA's gigantic secret launch operation -- just happens to be in a cornfield a few miles from him, and they never noticed! And by the way, as long as you're here, could you pilot the mission? We just never had any plans for a pilot until you barged in! Christ, this is a plot device from Gilligan's Island. The rest of this turkey might be summed up as "weepy soap opera in outer space." Too many schmaltzy tearjerker scenes for an "intelligent" sic-fi film. Anne Hathaway acts more like a chirpy cheerleader than a seasoned astronaut. And like Dark Knight, the plot is so convoluted that I eventually gave up caring. The final scenes, perhaps somewhat inspired by 2001, are lame and pretentious. I'd rather be waterboarded than suffer through Nolan's dreck again. I'm giving this 1 star to balance the ludicrous spate of 9-10 star reviews. No wonder American film has gone downhill, when the audiences mistake a pretentious, poorly written fruit pie for the "masterpiece of a genius"
5.0~Another Average sci-fi flick................... theromanempire-1 Sign in Permalink I had high hopes for this one but the only thing i really loved in the movie was the awesome....SOUNDTRACK. Unfortunately this had flaws in many parts of the plot and showed us things which were unrealistic in many ways and kinda boring. The movie had it's moments and if u are a sci-fi film fan then u can check it out but it's nothing special. 2001 was much better poetry movie than this. The characters were predictable and the reasons why the professor did what he did were unrealistic and unreasonable. I will not spoil the movie but u have to wait for 3 hours before u get out of the theater. the movie is too long. Get the O.S.T And that's all u need to remember from that movie.
6.0~Three hours of beautiful looking boredom danielsmith-1 Sign in Permalink I initially saw the trailer for Interstellar a few months ago and immediately decided that, as the trailer painted it as a dull, rather uninspiring sci-fi epic that I was not going to part with my cash or time by going to see it. Over the last few weeks, as the promotional machine has turned it's wheels and, following many positive reviews both in the media and by trusted friends of mine, I took the day off work purely to go and see Interstellar. I have to say, partly because so many reviews and friends had said "you've really go to see it in the cinema". So I didn't want to miss out. I started the film, full of anticipation, that I was truly going to see a masterpiece of cinema with a great cast, engaging dialogue, a thought provoking plot and stunning visuals and, well, it had stunning visuals (apart from the external spacecraft shots looking like something from "Star Fleet") and, not much else. To be fair there was a LOT of dialogue. And several of the lines delivered by the robots approached humour. Had it have been around an hour shorter I could possibly have brought myself towards saying it was enjoyable but, in the main I REALLY had to try hard to enjoy this film. It's a strange one as it wasn't bad enough to be terrible but was nowhere near good enough to be enjoyable. At one point I was truly fighting the urge to get up and walk out but didn't as I assumed we were near the end (we weren't, there was still an hour and a half to go) I love Christopher Nolan's films but this smacks of a director being given far too much praise and far too large a budget to play with. Maybe I should have taken more notice of the trailer.
1.0~To the stars - away from the common sense! foxtrot-21 Sign in Permalink This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey? Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of "hard" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why. Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that "love is the most important thing in the world". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences... This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3... The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy... The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word "magic" (interchangeable with "nonsense") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here... The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him. Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all.
1.0~A 3 hour Science Lecture delivered by a Village Idiot charleswilliams98 Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed Christopher Nolan's work in the past; Memento, Insomnia, (parts of) The Batman Trilogy. I find him a very talented film-maker with strong ideas and visual sense. Therefore it makes me very sad to state that, categorically, this is an absolute turkey. In many places, the plot is so full of holes, that you can do little but laugh-out loud. There will be reviewers on here, talking about DEPTH, Intimations of Mortality etc etc. Forget it. This is just a total misfire. Actors used to say, despairingly, that they were playing Johnny Exposition - you know the guy who explains everything to the audience. Note I said Despairingly. This has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the Mystery of Love (oh yeah). After a totally boring, drawn-out beginning which seems to be there to prove that Nolan has watched The Grapes of Wrath many times over, we get the first huge laugh when we meet Sir Michael Caine, with a laughable Posh - Cockney - American accent. He is playing the part that Sam Shephard (in this) or Morgan Freeman (usually) play. He is not up to it; never was never will be. It takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook and make it sound real. Caine's performance - like so many of his performances - screams out "Where's my bleedin' paycheck?" When Coop (Gary Cooper - westerns - get it) agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space, he blasts off like a Cosmic Cowboy, all bravado and charisma - at which point his fellow crew member shows him - with a pen and paper - what a wormhole is. Yes, when he is leading a flight into outer space, a little late doncha think? It gets worse, when poor Anne Hathaway, playing, as my son said - Science Girl, has to recite a monologue about Love and how it can cross all dimensions of space, time, blah blah blah. I really felt for her. I won't expand on the Plot, I couldn't if I wanted to. And the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved. This is NOT one of those films that you see and forget immediately, you will wake up in a few months time, laughing at Michael Caine's last scene or his recital of Dylan Thomas' famous lines - not once but twice...and the End. Oh the end. McConaghey gives it his all, having to cry on more than one occasion - believe me, I know how he felt. Don't believe anyone if they tell you 'you didn't GET it'. That's like saying you didn't GET an episode of Two and a Half Men. Ambitious yes, but a turd is a turd - even if they meant to produce a new hybrid Rose.
8.0~A lost opportunity gurrupurru Sign in Permalink There's no black hole like the script of this film, which seems written by someone without experience who gets into a maze of nonsense and fixes it all with "love". Gosh. It gets me on the nerves because I love stories about space exploration and new worlds and this movie didn't provide me but too few glimpses of that. And they were mostly rehashes of things from the 2001 saga and Contact. CGI were OK, but when they had the chance to imagine alien worlds they provide uninspired, boring settings. It all seems like a poorly written derivative story by someone who is too young and inexperienced to understand that a narrative must have some logic in order to work. If they wanted to tell a love story, well, it isn't good either. And no, I can't do what some "science" blogs say and recommend the movie despite not liking it with the hope that young people will get more interested in science. BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT. I didn't get interested in martial arts when I saw Mortal Kombat as a teenager. This kind of movie only promotes incoherence and irrationality.
4.0~Doesn't deserve to be great. kelvin-konroy1993 Sign in Permalink First of all, I understand Chris Nolan as a new talent and he is an intelligent filmmaker. Since Memento, he has not disappointed me. This movie doesn't have a befitting title. It is hardly about interstellar stuff but more about the movie of so called bonding with father-daughter. I have seen some of the most intriguing movies ever like psycho 1960, Last Year at Marienbad 1962, Dial M for Murder, Strangers on the Train, Dark City and other masterpieces like 2001:Space Odyssey 1968. Also some of best work of past century. I have also seen many cheap, horrible and "not great" movies. I think Christopher Nolan has ripped off many scene from other movies. I have seen many shots already been used in other movies. The originality is not there. What I liked in this movie:- Decent acting, good production, good screenplay, What I didn't like in this movie:- Confused theories, generic soundtrack, OK..visual effects, lengthy as hell, bad attempts to rip off exact same shots as in 2001:Space Odyssey, miserable ending, nonstop funny quips, OK sound mixing and editing and so on. The movie all the time refers to "they" but who is this "they" is not cleared up. Chris Nolan just made up stuff out of his imagination like black hole is supposed to be like this, wormhole is supposed to be like this. As I know, wormholes cannot be seen but they might be created by some future advaced gadgets or machines. There cannot be any disturbance in wormhole.No any"they" can do that(if can explain..how??). The Spaceship they travel into doesn't say a thing about how they travelled to The Saturn without burning any fuel. If the circle structure had solar panels around it, then I could buy it(but sun doesn't heat farther planets like Saturn so I won't). Too much funny quips as I said. Some scenes feel serious with some spooky shots but the next thing, you know, some funny quote. Big dialogs like, "saving millions", "saving the humanity" blah blah but make stupid progress. The world and surrounding is established by dirt clouds and that is it. No profound setup of the world. Matt Damon is "shoehorned" completely to get audience's tension. Other half of the movie is not about the mission anymore. It is confused all in itself. How Matthew got back on earth ? Blackhole could lead him anywhere but earth but he comes back ? Is he hallucinating like Dave was in 2001: Space Odyssey ? Also how did that Murph survived the earth's atmosphere for over a good healthy century(oh she was on Saturn or whatever!!) Time and Gravity were not shown correlated with each other in a deeper way. I admit that Chris Nolan had done some research about gravity and time so he could somehow calculate the time spent two planets or he is clearly bluffing. I loved some great stuff like that 4 or 7 dimensional (don't remember but maybe 5) design but I don't know if it is a exactly or remotely likely. But who put it there? "They"?I reviewed this movie as exactly how I understood so the review is a little messy. I gave a lot much thinking but I could not understand some stuff. This movie could be a great one if they cut some things and added more meaning and story. By the way, that TAR-S(S-TAR) was a refrigerator with a continuous writing on his monitor without matching with what he was speaking and no robot can be like that..ever. It was a good thought though. I just saw a movie months ago called Edge of Tomorrow and that made sense more with a good story. I am mentioning that because I have seen about 2000 movies and based on that experience I can say that this one is not so great. Watch a review by Jeremy Jahns on Youtube, you will get it. Watch Gravity 2013. It was a lot better. If that guy directed Interstellar then it had the potential to be great but Nolan makes Love quantifiable. In my mind, I give 4/10 but as I am not writing this to myself but to general people I give it a 7/10.
1.0~Is this a masterpiece???? lucamazz Sign in Permalink Did I see the same movie that many other people gave a ten vote?? Probably not...... The movie doesn't give any logic explanation to anything. Everything in the movie is treated in the most superficial possible way. To not get completely disappointed all through the movie you would need to switch off your brain completely otherwise you won't get any answers to the questions that necessarily come to your mind. Also great actors like Matthew McConaughey are acting awfully, probably realizing they are acting in a dumb movie. All the Director is trying to do is excite the audience with the soundtrack and special effects, probably realizing himself how poor the plot is. How could so many good actors accept to work in such a poor movie? And how come so many critics are writing that this is a great movie? I would really like to know what great directors like Scorsese, Di Palma, Herzog, Spielberg would think about this movie. In two words: absolutely disappointing.
5.0~Definitely not a new Space Odyssey mail-304-705244 Sign in Permalink I really, really waited this film. I got nothing that I expected from other's reviews and scores. Yes, it has some interesting pictures, it speaks about big issues, it gives you exciting moments, but after I left the cinema, I forgot what it was all about, because the mistakes and fails made me forget it. The biggest issue is that it is slow, and contrary to Space Odyssey, it is slow because it needs time to prove its own false truth. We need to accept that the guys who leave Earth are so stupid and non-professionals, that they can only make bad decisions. Nobody is such crazy to go down on a planet on which time goes so slow that the spacecraft above will burn lot of resources for 23 years while waiting the team to get back. A little boy can do a simple calculation, that going down and up needs more than one hour, so the remaining crew and station will spend a lot of time and resources. Much more than if they go to the other two planets. Still, they go down. And what the lonely guy does up on the station? Instead of putting the station into energy saving mode and going to sleep, he wastes the little resources they have. I see, so the director needed to spend all these resources and time to make the film more dramatic. However, contrary to this intention, from this scene, the film lost me. But there was an other contender earlier in the film which could have made me angry, but I noticed it only after this 23 years nonsense. Anybody can explain why a hibernation tank goes under a strange, dirty, concrete like something which is very much like some Eastern-European communist public bath's floor?! Is this science fiction? Or is this the Hostel? And it just can't stop. You are a scientist,right? You work from data, you trained to do so. There is scientific method, right? So when you get on an other planet and find a robot there in pieces, you just accept everything the man you find there says to you. You land on ice-clouds floating in the sky, but you accept that everything is fine here. You start to land your stuff on the clouds, however the resources to use is not on the clouds, but under. You notice nothing, right? What are you doing? And I should eat this and feel myself OK? The worst part? When love almost becomes law of physics. In the sixties, some kind of stupid philosophy could have been accepted. But now? Really? The girl, who has her own 'field of science', tries to explain to the others that they should go to her favorite planet because perhaps love is more than we see about it? Again: really? What more? Is it the dark matter holding the universe together? This supposed to be science-fiction, right? OK, we found science, and it is fiction, but a 'new Space Odyssey' should give you visions. This film gave me a useless journey and a huge space-station around Saturn at the end. Is this the solution? An old man sent a dozen men through a wormhole only to train a girl who finally understands that a space station is the solution humanity needs?! If you want to see this film, wait until you can watch it home on a boring Sunday afternoon. Don't waste your time otherwise.
10.0~Absolute brilliance (no spoilers) leroyjansen Sign in Permalink Its very difficult to explain the quality of an extremely good movie when you have so much interest in the subject. So I'm just saying: my review is based on the fact that i like space movies that forces us to think about whats out there. Its been 3 days since i watched interstellar and i still think about the amazing visuals, but most likely the storyline. The same as inception, this director creates a visual image that is so extremely close to my own imagination. But he actually puts it on a screen for me to enjoy? Thats just in word: unbelievable. This 3 hour journey takes you from a to z and it doesn't skip anything. Just when you think, they are probably not going to continue on this subject.. They do. You will get all your answers, in sometimes a difficult way. The lead actor shows a extreme amount of passion that really helps with the emotions on some points. I see this movie win more awards because its complete and i do not see that you should have shortened it, made it longer, have another interstellar or so on. Its done and its really good. I have to say that i noticed that a lot of people that review this movie expected things that they claimed was in the trailer or should have been in the movie. Like an alien race? I never got this from the trailer or any storyline. Also if you expect this movie to be fighting and alien wars i would understand you write a bad review, because this movie is not about that. Go to this movie with one simple thought: i have no idea what I'm about the see. I'm just going to enjoy this ride. 10 out 10. I'm not giving this like candy bars.
1.0~Unwatchable, give me the three hours back jonas-ua Sign in Permalink This is a formal request to Matt Damon, Matthew Mccougnehey, Christopher Nolan and the rest of the people behind this movie to give me three hours of my life back. I warn anyone that is considering to watch this movie, Don't. This movie is riddled with plot holes, a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote. If you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie, the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen. There is little room for surprise, and even less room for enjoyment. Adding to this, the visuals in the movie are a huge problem, in watching it I got a headache and motion sickness. So not only was I left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema, I also felt physically ill. I feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones, and the acting feels very forced, and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed "The Room" with Tommy Wiseau, or Gigli with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Because I think we have a new winner in the unwatchable movie hall of fame: Interstellar.
1.0~A huge disappointment chn65 Sign in Permalink It is normal for films to have some plot holes, like driving through a corn field at high speed with a flat tire. I can live with that. It is to some way believable, that the US government should deny having been to the moon and at the same time having NASA running with star-trek-like technology like cryo-sleep, advanced robots etc. But here is a key point, where it failed utterly: The books say STAY. He left Murph, while she was making a big issue about it. I thought at that time, that it meant: Don't try to leave the earth (don't run away from problems) - stay and fix the problems instead. That would have been a very good point. Instead, it is one big contradiction. Cooper himself is - through his daughter - trying to make himself stay and not leave. Of course this is because of love for his daughter. Not hard to find out. But if he had stayed, then there would have been no mission, there would have been no "quantum-message" sent/received from the black hole, and the population on earth would have starved or suffocated to death. Is this what he wanted? By the way - I never figured out if the earth was saved or not in the ending. Murph finds a solution to the magic equation, but what does that yield? Did they leave the earth in a massive space ship, or did they save it? We never know. As others have pointed out, it is not easy to relate to the characters - I personally lost track of how many people were on the Endurance, and frankly, I lost interest too. I liked the robot,though.
5.0~I was not that impressed! petarmatic Sign in Permalink When I saw high grades and glorious reviews for this film I thought I was going to see something really special. Well for some parts I did, but for the others I did not. For example, Prometheus was far better film as far as the sci fi genre goes. The plot for this film was somehow same to what I saw before in other types of these films. I could make a puzzle from different plots and make this one. It was all said and done before. Acting did not impress me either, somehow casting could of been better. I do not know, do you agree with this? Visual effects were excellent, but today they all are since the companies which make these types of films really figured out their trade well. If you like sci fi films you should see this film, otherwise do not loose your sleep over it.
6.0~Nolan You have 2hours and 44 minutes to save the world. clive-moore Sign in Permalink Tooo long Tooo much like 2001 Add a bit of event Horizon Dark star Black hole Armageddon Space 1999 Star trekking.... The one. With god All that was missing was Bruce Willis and batman, sorry Alfred did appeared Enjoyed it trough far to many plagiarism's Expected something better than space, that was really dull Gravity wasn't strong enough Lost in space was more dynamic and scientifically more inaccurate HAL2000 unit. Robbie the robot was missing. Needed a Panama airplane somewhere Kubrick did film The Apollo Moon landings Where was room 237?
1.0~Appallingly badly written for a major serious sci-fi film cmcastl Sign in Permalink The various merits or demerits of Christopher Nolan's style of film-making is beside the point. This was the worst plotted and written major sci-fi film I have ever paid good money to see. Having seen it a few months ago now, that response firmly stays with me. To be sure, it had sumptuous production values and committed performances but this film cannot be considered serious sci-fi for how poorly it was plotted and written. I read that it had been written with serious scientific input from experts on black holes but that didn't show to me. Now I like space opera and I also like sci-fi films with ideas, the bigger the better. Black holes are incredibly complicated phenomena for the eggheads to understand, let alone the average or even the serious film-goer. Black holes also speculatively throw up all sorts of illogical ideas about their nature, which cause headaches for the scientists but which can be fun to work through on the silver screen. I wanted to like this film. I don't need my sci-fi to make perfect sense. I love Kubrick's 2001. I like the mystery and awe engendered by contemplating the cosmos, whether philosophically or dramatically. I just felt as I watched this film how my intelligence was being increasingly insulted by logical non-sequiturs of plot and character - even allowing for a scenario involving black holes where all kinds of paradoxes could and should be thrown at the characters and played around with - which were in my judgement the result of plain bad or lazy writing. This script had it not been written by the Nolans would never in my opinion have been passed in a film school project, let alone made into a big-budget film. I have ticked the box about the spoilers alert but I am not sure I have any spoilers to spill. It was a few months ago that I saw the film and I can now barely remember the plot because it made no sense to me on any level at the time. Even if a plot isn't easy to understand and appears illogical, and once again I re-iterate that with the inherent nature of the subject we are talking about metaphysical paradoxes here big-time, it ought to have an inner logic, make an inner sense. This was just a script-writing mess as far I could judge it. Incidentally, watching his Batman film I thought there was some very lazy plotting in that too, so this wasn't a one off. Does no one in Hollywood care anymore about good writing? Are major films now all about 'never mind the quality feel the width'?
1.0~Distasteful movie. jelstudio Sign in Permalink (This review does contain spoilers) Interstellar is one of the most disgraceful movies I've seen. Everything but the soundtrack is bad. You may of course see this differently, but to me the movie appeared to be nothing but political propaganda. I can see why the rich upper-class would pay to hype this movie as much as it has been. It has nothing to do with film-art at all. Story is that earth can not sustain human life and thus must be evacuated. The supreme leader who makes all the life/death decisions is not a democratically elected government of and by the people, but a single science-professor (a clear exponent of the (WW2 German political establishment, whose name is apparently forbidden to mention on IMDb) ideology of elitist technocracy) Ah yes, the scientist knows best. In fact ONLY the scientist knows. AND: the scientist LIES! (he says so himself at his death-bed, which is such a blatantly obvious attempt of the movie to try and make us like him and sympathize with the whole nasty race-before-person ideology) This president of earth, excuse me, science-professor with supreme decision-making power, has decided that seeds must be planted on a new planet so the race can extend. He has decided that this goal is more important than being honest to his fellow humans. He therefore lies to the astronauts (because clearly technocratic science is better and purer than people-democracy) and basically uses them as expendable pawns, simple cogs, with no importance in themselves, in the big machine of race-before-person (and he is such a like-able heroic grand-dad type... it's really hard not to gag at this whole disgusting piece of badness) That's the movies main agenda; YOU are not important, but the race is. Of course this makes no sense, whatsoever. In fact it's the straight opposite of the good old movie "Metropolis". If you suggest every person is less important than the race, then the paradox should be obvious. And this obviously is where the movies REAL purpose is revealed; what the Interstellar-makers REALLY want to achieve, is for you to believe they have a right to keep you in the lower-class while they abuse the earth's resources in their upper-class. They want you to feel that race is more important than you the person. Because if/when you believe that, when you adhere to that nasty ideology, THEY can keep living in luxury while you live on the bottom, working hard for low wages, paying high taxes, being the mule pulling their load. THAT is what this movie is trying to do, with its subtle hints that you should feel grateful that somebody else, up there on the sky-deck, is having a great life while you don't. Because the RACE is important, not YOU, just the race. This movie is nothing but (WW2 German political establishment, whose name is apparently forbidden to mention on IMDb) propaganda, disguised as benign technocracy (which is not benign at all, but elitist and oppressive), to maintain class-society with your silent consent. It wants you to truly feel lucky you can pay for the rich people's life-style, without getting anything good yourself. If you like this film, you are probably already one of the ('people with wool', the actual word is apparently illegal to say on IMDb) who gets exploited by the 1% all the time. No, this review is not meant as a joke. See the movie again if you think I'm wrong, and notice how the entire film, while trying to be subtle about it, pushes for that race-before-person agenda. Notice the absence of democracy. Notice how the professor is basically playing the role as president of society. He doesn't answer to any people-elected government. And I haven't even touched on the lameness of the plot. How the movie lets you think it's based on sound known physics, while breaking its own rules seconds later. It's really amazing how this film can be liked by anybody. It's like the scene in "Sweeney Todd" where a guy tries to sell urine (the word actually used in the film is apparently illegal to say on IMDb) by faking it: one big hoax to make you love being exploited by the upper-class while they laugh at your stupidity. Follow the money. Those who paid for this piece of political propaganda are not the lower-class trying to improve ordinary people's lives. Rather, it's paid for by those who want to keep the rich getting richer and avoid sharing of wealth. Like this movie, and you play right into their hands.
5.0~Interstellar is fantasy, not science fiction ppilf Sign in Permalink Although the visual effects are good, Interstellar (shouldn't it be "Intergalactic"?) is just too far-fetched. It's nothing like the believable film of human planetary migration that I was led to believe, and was hoping for. I've never been a fantasy fan. I majored in electrical-electronics engineering and physics in my 6 years of college, so I am a bit of a nerd and science stickler. When I view (or read) science fiction, to me the "fiction" should apply to the story, not to the science. In fantasy, the fiction applies to the science. Personally, I wish the film industry would make more realistic dramas about human space exploration. Hollywood's blockbuster profit machine abandons serious science fiction art, and, like Prometheus, made Interstellar into another action-packed CGI thriller crapper that caters to 13 to16 year-olds (the large demographic of movie going audience-$$$). And, of course, no sex, violence, horror, or language to get it an R rating. Interstellar's story is quite crazy. In it we humans, in the very distant future, discover how to communicate backward in time somehow by using gravity. Also, we (or they?) discover how to create crazy things like wormholes anywhere in time and space. Both of these things are quite insane. Anyway, our future humans supposedly use their fantastic smarts to send us (present humans) subtle messages that help in our quest to migrate to another planet, because earth is presently dying. And here's a real clincher, apparently our future selves have a morbid sense of humor, because they don't send us clear-cut messages (like any sensible race would do), they make it a silly game by sending mysterious coded riddles that we have to first solve. Things like coded binary numbers sent by arranging the books on the shelves in a young girl's bedroom; the numbers turn out to be coordinates to a giant secret underground NASA spaceship factory located below cornfields. Another mystery message leads us to a wormhole near the planet Saturn that our future super humans have kindly created for us, and maintained there. This fantastic (and quite absurd) wormhole leads to a cluster of candidate earth-like planets in a distant galaxy. But our future relatives don't want to make the game too easy, so the next step requires us to build numerous spacecraft, fly to and thru the wormhole, and explore the candidate planets to find which one is the jackpot. While doing this our explorers encounter all kinds of treacherous and crazy things, like planets with mile-high waves in 18-inch deep water, entering and exiting a rotating black hole, mentally unstable astronauts, and surviving and navigating fantastic spacecraft thru enormous gravitation fields that cause relativistic time dilation leaving an astronaut younger than his daughter. Typical things that any astronaut would experience over a few years right. I read that physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for this film, and he said he tried to keep it as authentic as possible. Well, he really stretched authentic here. I agree with ASU physicist Lawrence Krauss. I don't think Thorne served physics well working with this film. Oh I don't argue with his gravitational lensing, or other more straight forward aspects like the time dilation and the rotating black hole "gargantua". But things like our future ancestors communicating backward in time via gravity, and creating wormholes? Or like Cooper entering into a singularity, reversing time, fidgeting with the past (multiverses?), and then exiting? I'm not sure what world Thorne is living in to call all that authentic. For example, take the wormhole (..please!). This hypothetical concept is a physics metaphor used in teaching general relativity. Many people may not know that there is absolutely no evidence or accepted scientific theory suggesting that wormholes actually exist in any form anywhere, or, even more fantastic, can be created and traversed by humans. In fact the inconceivable energy, matter, and forces alone involved with such a hypothetical warp would make it impossible for humans to "create" one. Black holes, on the other hand, are not only scientifically known to be possible, but are known to exist. Entering and exiting the event horizon of a rotating black hole is purely hypothetical, and is certainly not considered scientifically possible, partly because literally nothing is known about black hole singularity. Yet all these things are depicted in very silly fantasy in Interstellar. Also, I swore I saw a 2013 Dodge Ram pickup and a cute robot with artificial human intelligence in the movie. Fantasy. It appeals to the target child audience. Not only the wacky science, but the excessive pace of Interstellar made for a poor film. There's no pausing to smell roses in this film. The fast pace hindered character development and made for shallow story development. Frankly, I can't remember being so happy to see a movie end. It became a struggle to watch. Also, a lot of McConaughey's speech seemed to be at whisper level bordering on mumble, which I found irritating. The background music was okay, but not great. I consider the films Gravity, and my favorite, Alien (1979), much better. They aren't perfect realism, but at least they don't have ghosts from the future and manmade wormholes. In closing, I must say that I truly do believe humanity will someday migrate from earth, but it will NEVER be anything like this movie depicts. How sure am I of this? If I'm wrong I hereby promise to pay each living human being in the universe a million dollars. Being able to afford that is more probable than the science in this film.
6.0~Messy movie with both stupid and stellar ideas corrinadylan Sign in Permalink Sound - 1/2 - The score is bombastic, and the dialog is occasionally hard to hear. Acting/Characterization - 1/2 - McConaughey has the rebel cowboy act down pat but is a little less credible as a scientifically-minded father. The other characters are undeveloped and exist to represent specific ideas. Script/Writing - 0/2 - The script is a hodgepodge of corny tag lines and poorly executed themes. Visuals - 2/2 - The fate of humanity apparently rests on the colonization of bleak planets in bleak space, but at least there are cool wormholes, black holes, and baseball fields. Concept (Plot/Theme) - 1/2 - Interstellar deserves at least one point for ambition and creativity, but too many questionable plot developments are thrown together, and the film does not seem to commit to any of its ideas or themes, though some, such as time dilation, are certainly fascinating. When not confounded by possible paradoxes or superficial musings on love, one is left to question the viability of an anti-intellectual society portrayed with such unexplained cynicism, as well as the human imperative to survive on other planets when the species is apparently inclined to destroy its own natural habitat. Total Score - 5/10 Gut Feeling - 6/10 - For a film espousing the virtues of love and exploration, Interstellar has little emotional resonance. Plotwise, it's a memorable mess. Final Average - 5.5/10
10.0~The Greatest movie I've ever seen. Period. ianpuebla-23180 Sign in Permalink That's all I have to say the best movie I've ever seen in my 21 years of living
1.0~Worst sf film in 20 years kretu23-58-109262 Sign in Permalink This film is an anti-intellectual zenith. It is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity. I have never seen such s-f movie full of nonsense. At least in the last 20 years. Every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to Hollywood pulp. Ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago. Medea/Gaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale. Pseudo- philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multi-dimensional time-space is simply ridiculous. Situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon: I can only say: serious case of ignorance. And standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious. Someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldn't be allowed to make a s-f movie. Really bad choice!! I am disappointed. Very disappointed. 1 point is for the robots. Best regards.
1.0~Save your time, this film is awful! elisaforsgren Sign in Permalink I'm on a Redbox binge because I'm limited to only 30gb of internet a month. Therefore, I save gigs by watching films through Redbox though after this horrid experience I might just buy another 30gb plan but I digress. That's how I happened on this supposedly high rated film. Tired of the mediocre crap that you normally get out of Redbox, I cross referenced IMDb in hopes of a better choice. Disappointment is an understatement. Somewhere around an hour, I realized the film would be nearly THREE HOURS LONG! So much unnecessary garbage effects, dialogue, etc. Christopher Nolan WHO CARES? I'm just thankful the trite, clichéd and extremely boring film is over. Thankful that I had it on DVD and could fast-forward through the epically duller parts save yourself the time wasted from your life, since I've already done it for you, forget about this film and move on to something better. I sure wish I had been warned.
1.0~Same huge annoying plot hole as in Man of Steel (2013) neacorp Sign in Permalink "Go colonize Mars instead". What was the point of the mission? To save humanity. How? By evacuating all of Earth on huge space stations to another planet, accessible through a black hole near Saturn... And you need to gather data about the singularity to finish the antigravity equation to do it. 1 direct trip from Earth to Saturn = 8 ROUND trips from Earth to Mars. So... "Go colonize Mars instead". Also, the robot design was very impractical. P.S. Who colonizes/lands on a planet with a "1 hour = 7 years outside" time anomaly?! Pointless suicide!.
10.0~A movie made for me petermail Sign in Permalink The most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit. They look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited. The movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way. Those robots there are amazing as well, complete opposite of Marvin from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I love them. The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. Finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible. It all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the Universe encountering strangest parts of physics.
10.0~Hands down, mind-blowing kyjamie Sign in Permalink This film is just legendary, I do not see why people are hating this film, its unpredictable and well just plain brilliant. A lot of the science in this movie is true (for a science fiction film). I believe this is Nolan's best yet and I believe that its probably the greatest film ever made. Matthew deserves an Oscar for his role (no joke) and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is a masterpiece in it's own right (completely new and different from his previous work, check the dark knight trilogy and inception). The FX are brilliant and their are no complaints from me. The acting is just great and it really asks questions on who we are and our purpose. So overall to conclude this film is just MINDBLOWING!
1.0~Utter utter rubbish Paulh616 Sign in Permalink Don't waste any of your precious time watching this terrible, boring and dull film. The acting was simply harrowing to watch... Anne Hathaway was, as always, akin to balsa wood and completely implausible.. the woman just can't act. The film rumbles along for an hour before anything happens, by which time you don't really care... and you are probably very bored. The plot (and I use the term loosely) is ridiculous and there is more tension in a broken elastic band. By watching this, I feel like I traded brain cells for jellybeans.. I must comment on the special effects which I was led to believe were good... They were not! The script has more holes than a sieve, especially when it comes to the scientific theories related to space travel... Please, please don't watch this trash...
10.0~A Philosophical Revelation with Scientific Rationality makes this my Greatest Film-Watching Experience Ever jaskunwar993 Sign in Permalink It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined. Here's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways. I really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw. Some have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect. Nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about. For those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it. A solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond. ***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT*** Let me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. "Love is the one thing that transcends time and space." It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground. This film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow.
1.0~Don't get sucked into this movie black hole! ademoor Sign in Permalink Feeling very disappointed given all the hype and rave reviews. What a bunch of utter pseudo-scientific crap! The so-called "scientific advisors" must live in a parallel universe with completely different laws of nature. The characters are as flat as two-dimensional entities. The only realistic holes are not wormholes nor black holes but the gaping holes in the storyline. How come Hollywood these days always seems to take fascinating science fiction-themes and mangle them into some commercial junk that is all about fiction and has not the slightest thing to do with science? Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" is still light years ahead of the rest of the pack, almost 50 years since that brilliant film was created. Don't waste your money on this farce but buy a good book instead and create your own space-time adventure on your comfortable couch at home.
1.0~'NO'lan pskalyanarama Sign in Permalink Basically, I am a very big fan of Nolan. But I wonder what has happened to him after watching this movie. No doubt, there is a lot of hard work involved in this film with a lot of science especially physics. But here is the basic-nobody comes to a movie for science.They come to watch movie. Whether it is physics,Mathematics or anything that is involved, it should help elevate the story and not the other way around.Makers used this movie to showcase science. Nothing wrong to show that science is important for better future, but if a movie fails to create interest among audience through good script, they lose patience and don't care about message given in the movie. Too much of melodrama involved with boring scenes in the first half of the movie. Simply put, I don't think there is anything new in the BASIC story.Highly predictable first half has boring moments with snail like pace. Even if a movement occurs now and then, we get 'so what?' due to exhausting plot till that moment. One of the biggest plus points in Nolan's screenplay is too much of plot and it was even a complaint on him. But this movie lacks that. On the whole, being a fan and film school student, I am disappointed that great maker like Nolan is more into science than fiction in this.
1.0~3 Of Us Fell Asleep, 6 Of Us - Out Of 7 - Hated It! interestingfunstuff Sign in Permalink That's the score from a group of 7 friends who went to see Interstellar tonight. I've never been to a film in my entire life so full of DESPAIR. If I hadn't been with friends I would have walked out! I will avoid films by this director in the future like the plague. The only friend who liked it said she enjoys soap operas. That pretty much sums it up! IF YOU LIKE SOAP OPERAS YOU WILL LOVE INTERSTELLAR! There are so many plot holes several of us were cracking jokes by the end of the movie. So many parts of Interstellar are so ridiculous or makes no sense -whatsoever- it borders on camp. Sure the cinematography is magnificent. But in the end it's nothing but pretty wallpaper when the story is drawn out, tedious, annoying, maudlin, nonsensical, irrelevant, dopey and depressing. All I can say is when the only food humanity has left to eat is corn & corn products, then you are going to end up with a very corny movie!
6.0~Yet another sensational and unrealistic plot sold as science fiction newemailforfacebook Sign in Permalink This movie really isn't science fiction so much as fantasy with some mixed up elements of science in it. Sadly the movie lost me in the first 10-20 minutes or so simply because there is no scenario where Earth would have a blight or bad weather which would result in fleeing to wormhole would become a practical solution. On top of that the flight pilot thing is just ridiculous. The likelihood that you pilot through a wormhole based on human skill seems pretty small. So the premise of why people would want to do any of this was 100% flawed. Given X amount of resources the simply reality is that even if Earth is a barren ball of rock, it still has water and it still has the right gravity and better resources. So the solution would clearly be to just work with the Earth, not flee into the unknown in same sensationalized effort to save humanity. It really just makes no sense and when you base the premise and central motivation of your characters in a science fiction movie with a serious overtone like this and that motivation makes no logical sense, it's hard to take anything after that seriously. They may as well have been setting out to look for the Great Flying Spaghetti Monster to grant them the wish that would save humanity. At least that premise would have been honest and not some silly half thought out plot point skimmed over to explain all the uselessly risky decisions the characters would take later in the movie. There is also the whole idea that you'd expect a planet near a black hole to be a better place to live than Earth. It has to been almost infinitely easier to fix the Earth than it could ever be to transport the human population through a wormhole to a planet on the edge of a black hole. Nobody would ever think that was a good idea. As I see it the movie was nothing more than a grand setup to show off the spooky theoretical impacts of relative time differences on humans. The reasoning for their trip was not well thought out and the ending of the movie was total crap. The part most people liked is the spooky sense of how time might pass differently when your near very massive objects. Of course in general it's probably not all that possible to find a habitable planet that close to a black hole. There are many factors beyond the massive gravity that would have either made the planet unlivable or make it simply too risk to call home vs Earth. For the plot to work Earth would have to be about to be vaporized, not merely having bad weather and blight. Those things can be quarantined and engineered around as long as you have water, sunlight, resources and somewhere near the correct gravity. For instance when they are on the planet and the giant tidal bulge that appears out nowhere which would require a very fast planet rotation. Would it not have been immediately apparent that the planet was no in any way a realistic place to move humanity? It would be easier to just terraform Mars or again for that matter to fix Earth. America is currently starved for good science fiction and the high rating of this movie is little more than a result of that. People are so desperate for a good science fiction movie they have overlooked the horrible plot holes. Contact is another example of a horrible movie getting good ratings because people are desperate for science fiction. Even if you say OK, well this movie isn't really science fiction, but it's good. No.. it's just not. It's silly, misleading and completely lacks any kind of well thought out ending. Watching this sad attempt at science fiction is just utterly disappointing. So much money was spent on such a bad plot and instead of instilling the mystery of science in more people it's just a silly mesh of unrealistic scenarios clinging desperately onto science to save the horrible writing. Robots with vacuum cleaner arms from the 1960s are more realistic than the plot holes in this sad movie.
7.0~Mediocre jcw630213 Sign in Permalink I really hoped this would be a good movie but unfortunately it was not even mediocre. I rated it at 7 but now after some consideration 5 would have been more appropriate. The film is far too long, the plot is even for a sci-fi too silly to be believable. Like some others have pointed out, why place the wormhole next to Saturn if it was supposed to help people on earth? Did they do it out of spite? The properties of the black hole are not even remotely close to scientific knowledge.
1.0~Interstellar fails on every level strategytraining Sign in Permalink Despite the hype, I went to see Interstellar hoping for the best. From the dreadful opening, which went on forever featuring insipid dialogue and portentous acting by all involved to the crude miniatures in "space" (clearly an homage to Kubrick's 2001, A Space Odyssey, which accomplished far more with far less technical advantages than today's filmmakers), the movie incredibly got worse and worse until the last 30 minutes with some inspired, redemptive space/time scenes. But oh, that insipid dialogue and McConaughy's western drawl and baleful looks, echoed by a truly wasted Anne Hathaway, who also walked through her lines. The real culprit is the editing, as if Nolan was so in love with his work he could not bear to cut a scene. And the music? So banal that it managed to be predictable and intrusive at the same time. I couldn't wait for the "space scenes" to begin. But from liftoff to deep space, they could have NASA footage instead. I just can't imagine how anyone could call the space scenes "thrilling" or the twists and turns of the plot "gripping". Whether or not you liked Gravity, at least its space scenes were in your face and hard-edged. Watching the Interstellar space station cartwheel through space like a miniature toy out of a Cracker Jacks box was simply embarrassing. The scene of McConaughy and Hathaway begging Mat Damon not to activate the airlock, because it wasn't sealed was just another example of Nolan trying to manufacture excitement. Instead of being a hoped for surprise, the result was not only something we have seen in many sci-fi space movies, but as an experienced astronaut and pilot, Damon's character would absolutely know would happen! There were so many wooden moments, it's hard to count. The best was when McConaughy walks into his sister's hospital room and the reaction from her friends and family is absolutely zero! Not even a cocked head. What a colossal waste of time, talent and money to create something so utterly unforgettable. You just can't create a profound movie by hoping characters can talk their way through it. Nolan may have had a good story in his head, but what a mess--confused, poorly plotted, no editing and a visual treatment and color palette that looks like it was done by amateurs. 1 out of 10 and that's being kind.
5.0~Not Very Stellar sirchristo-447-951030 Sign in Permalink First off I am a big fan of Mr. Nolan, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine. I love epic Sci-Fi stories and was impressed with the 9.1 rating this film had received by IMDb users. Yet this movie is the most over-hyped schlock I have seen in years. I got burned and now I know. This will be the last time I see a film based on the IMDb user reviews and I thought the review scale for Netflix was messed up. So here is where I stand with this one. The Good: Some good visuals, especially the journey through the wormhole. The soundtrack is nice. Love the realism of no sound in space. The A.I. of the robots was cool and one of the most entertaining aspects of all the characters. The Bad: Poor character development. The soundtrack was very over- hyped with many reviewers on here. So were the visuals. Weak story development. Unrealistic references to science. Silly time travel plots. Predictable. Way too long. Boring! And some very cliché plot twists that you could see coming. Mr. Nolan is a fantastic director and he had a great cast to work with here. Yet his latest two efforts (The Dark Knight Rises & Interstelar) are just lazy. Interstellar tries really hard to sound intelligent but like The Big Bang Theory (TV Show) it uses generic "dumbed down" ideas (mostly unrealistic) to fluff it's own silly story. You'd think with a great creative mind such as Nolan that he'd piece together an epic love story told through an awe inspiring space and time back drop but he doesn't. You have no real connection to the characters and could care less if they live, die, complete their mission or save humanity. The heartfelt moments are forced with no real connection to the audience. Once second Cooper is driving in his truck all teary eyed as it cuts briefly to Murph chasing after him, then bam, he is in space. What sorta connection is that? Furthermore why was so much attention focused on the daughter and not balanced with the son. Then you have some serious plot holes like, what made the Earth so doomed? I guess the assumption is we did. It tries to explain "The "Others" but when you learn who they are it just adds the plot holes. I don't wanna give too much away so I won't reveal "The Others" by revealing more plot holes, you should be able to predict it half way through the film. Also why would Mann go through such great lengths to maroon the crew on the crappy Ice Planet? I guess the writers needed another predictable twist. Then you have Tom being a d!ck for no reason other then a failed attempt to build tension. Look I read several reviews talking about this film being Nolan's masterpiece, with great characters, beautiful and realistic space shots, and a perfect score put together by an epic heart wrenching love story. It is none of these things. Plus the comparisons to 2001 A Space Odyssey is misplaced. With so many ten star reviews I am left with the assumption that many of those come from people connected to Nolan's crew, Nolan fanboys, or the McConaughey obsessed. I would advise you to watch at your own risk. As a fan of both drama's and sci-fi this film is a poor excuse for both. More shocking is how so many people ripped Luc Besson's Lucy a "new-one" for it's misrepresentation of "5% of the brain" theory and this film with far more problems gets more praise. At least Lucy was entertaining. My five star is for the few and far between cool visuals and the nicely used audio. Upon looking through some of the reviews it is apparent that this film was a major hit in India. As most of the 10 star reviews are from India, which seems trolled to me.
3.0~Super overrated, tried to be something it's not tjsisson Sign in Permalink This movie tried to be an awe-inspiring sci fi movie that leaves you in wonderment, but in doing so they forgot to make the movie any good. The characters are awful, the story makes weird jumps, I don't care about the characters at all, and they treat science in such a cliche hollywood way. I honestly don't know why so many people enjoy this film.
3.0~I really WANTED to like this movie griffinmusic-373-668189 Sign in Permalink OK, my first IMDb review. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's work and I'm a science fiction fan. Sadly within an hour I was wondering if I could stick out another two hours. The actors are all great, and they get the few stars I'm willing to give it. I will admit that directing a big production like this is not for the faint-hearted and I'll give Nolan points for that. However, the story is so poorly constructed it just piles on frustration after frustration. Other reviewers on here have described the litany of illogical errors. I haven't read all 900 reviews but we have long known that black holes EAT stars and planets, and when they do, they give off titanic bursts of gamma and x-ray radiation that would sterilize entire regions of a galaxy. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in service of just enjoying a movie, but when the entire premise is to find a more suitable home for human life and then you choose a planet apparently orbiting a black hole, well that just goes from suspension to just outright disbelief. If Batman had chosen to just use his magic freeze gun to stop the nuke in Gotham I think most Batman fans would have been groaning. That's the way someone like me feels about lazy plot devices like this. There is also WAY too much unnecessary dialogue in this movie, the superb cast are wasted saying clichéd and hackneyed lines. The whole punchline of the "ghost" you could see coming in the first hour, so you just ended up wondering how they would get there over the next 109 minutes. I'm sorry but I thought the music was intensely annoying and was just designed to jar you awake every half an hour. Then there is the whole "Don't open the airlock! Don't open the airlock!" I was sitting there thinking "Just open the damn airlock and get it over with." Everything was either entirely predictable or completely illogical. Floating frozen clouds? Seriously? The least they could do was have Tinkerbell fly onto the set and explain how that could happen. I guess because Cameron got away with nicking Roger Dean's floating mountains in Avatar, Nolan thought no one would complain. But let's face it Avatar wasn't exactly trying to be clever and that's where this goes over the line. If you're going to delve into the BIG questions like Quantum Mechanics, Relativity and black holes you set yourself up to be measured by a whole new set of rules. Nobody complains about Harry Potter flying on a broomstick but have him try and explain it using Einstein and you're going to be in a mess of trouble. As for the reviews comparing it to 2001, the only things it has that are the same is that it is set in space and there is a wormhole. Absolutely nothing else is the same and frankly it is an insult to compare this to Kubrick's masterpiece. And when people say, "get over it, it's just a movie" they're rewarding someone for being lazy. Just like Gravity this had all the elements to be a masterpiece if they'd just bothered to talk to a few more people in the science community besides Kip Thorne; who apparently understands the workings of the universe all except for the black hole which is Hollywood.
3.0~Kitschy overlong soap opera. Mikelito Sign in Permalink It's embarrassing to think that stories like this are mistaken for SciFi. As for the "Sci" it only helps to drag a long a family story into - probably (who knows) - eternity and back. Whenever the story gets stuck some miracle "scientific fact" appears to help it move along. By the way, that Mathew M. actor ... who can he convince of being in a position to be chosen for all the stuff that role is capable of.... Of course you get the cliché robot and the cliché computer (à la HAL) and all the rest of it. I guess Zimmer is a good composer but this constant barrage of holier- than-holy church music only now and then interspersed with kitsch is only letting you know how you should be on your knees in tears regarding this "universal story of love and family" ... I'm guessing this has to be one of the slogans to market this soap opera over x amount of galaxies ... or one ... who cares. A few stars for the visual stuff but the content ... oh the content ...
9.0~MicroReels Film Review - Interstellar krahl-81949 Sign in Permalink I'm a big fan of anything Sci-Fi and I've always been interested in the boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. While most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often prioritize the "Fi" over the "Sci", Interstellar is one of those rare gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly entertaining movie. Any doubts I had going into the film about a dramatic SciFi being directed by Christopher Nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie and its tremendous score began. While Nolan excelled with The Prestige and Inception, they did leave something to be desired and I was fresh off the Batman trilogy bandwagon. But Nolan excels yet again, directing the film with such confidence and control that it's almost impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Each and every aspect of his signature style is also prominently visible through the film.

4.0~Tries to wrench excitement out of tedium and horribly bad science steve-599 Sign in Permalink The really amazing thing about this movie is that only 1% of the people rate it 4 or lower. Clearly this can only mean that 99% of the viewers just don't care about plots or science or much of anything so long as some kind of emotional drama is brewing with ever louder and more melodramatic music. I'm sorry, but I just can't enjoy a movie that is just a massive confabulation of deus ex machina at every turn without any regard to internal consistency. I like fake science and the occult as much as the next guy, but not when they are completely unlimited. There is only so much disbelief in the world that can be suspended. Just a disconnected train wreck of a movie. Now mind you, I am still giving it 4 out of 10 -- it is not as catastrophic a failure as, say, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. If you just blank out and go with it, there are some redeeming qualities. TORS was cute and it would have been nice if it had some shred of humor or personality, but it never materialized. Overall an unpleasant experience I will no doubt soon forget.
10.0~Best film I've ever seen feudalserfer Sign in Permalink I'm glad I lived long enough to see this film. To me, it's right up there with 2001 A Space Odyssey, It's a Wonderful Life, Schindler's List, The Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane. In the near future, the Earth has fallen prey to a global blight that has killed nearly all crops except corn, which will soon begin to fail. The whole planet is covered in an increasingly large storm of dust and all human activity has reverted to farming in a vain attempt to grow enough food in the failing earth. Nolan doesn't make heavy weather of why it happened, but the blight is breeding in the Earth's nitrogen and is an irreversible extinction event. Coop and his daughter, Murph (the hero and heroine of the film, respectively), study strange poltergeist-like incidents in her room, which leads them to a base which is the remains of NASA, and ultimately leads Coop to his destiny to follow earlier explorers through a stable - and manufactured - wormhole to three possible Earth like planets, encouraged by physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine). The wormhole's benevolent makers are simply referred to as "them", and we must initially assume that they are rather like the anonymous, God-like creatures who created the Monoliths seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey. I say initially, but won't spoil the denouement for you. Coop is the only pilot left in an age when the Moon landings are denied, and farming the only career. He is soon convinced by Brand to lead a final mission to explore the three planets marked as possible new worlds suitable for human habitation. Coop is joined on the "Endurance" by Brand's daughter biologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway), physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley); and two AI robots, TARS (Bill Irwin) and CASE (Josh Stewart). There's a nice humanity about these droids which contrasts with Hal 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey - indeed they provide the very few laughs this movie contains. The three worlds identified are in the vicinity of a Black Home, Gargantua - which plays a similar role in Interstellar to the Monoliths of 2001: A Space Odyssey. After the approach to Saturn, Coop pilots the Endurance through the wormhole, and they decide to explore the world identified by the (now silent) explorer, Miller. In a terrifying episode, Coop and his companions are stranded for mere three hours on the stupendous oceanic tides of Miller's world, which is so close to the Black Hole that one hour on the planet's surface is dilated to seven years of Earth time. When Coop returns he finds over 20 years worth of messages waiting for him, and his son and daughter grown up. This scene is perhaps the pivotal moment of the film, for Coop's promise to his daughter that he will return recedes as the movie progresses. McConaughey and Jessica Chastain play these scenes with such searing intensity that it becomes the emotional anchor around which the rest of the story revolves. None of the above minor spoilers have given away the essentials - or the extraordinary, mind-bending twists that Jonathan Nolan's screenplay provide, by the way. The film grows to a remarkable, moving and mind-bending conclusion that Hans Zimmer's cathedral-like soundtrack resonates to perfectly. I read somewhere that Interstellar is like a three hour crescendo. That's beautifully put. The three hours fly by, rather like the horrific relativistic episodes that strand our hero Coop further and further from his daughter. I felt from the first couple of minutes into the film that I was watching one of those films that stay with you forever. On leaving a movie theatre I normally snap out of movie mode and back into the real world. When leaving Interstellar, I found myself almost too choked to speak. I'm still processing this movie days later. Finally, a hat-tip to young Mackenzie Foy who plays young Murph with such warmth, and believable conviction that she successfully establishes the emotional core of the movie together with McConaughey. It is the bond of these two characters that will ultimately provide an anchor point not just for the story - but the very future of mankind. Don't worry if you've heard a lot of talk about the heavy reliance on quantum physics and so on. Interstellar is about the nature of love, loss, trust, loneliness and the passage of time, across any and all boundaries. These universals transcend any of Kip Thorne's theoretical physics you may have read about.... Mind-bending yes, but also heartwarming.
2.0~A Waste of 3 Hours! lviv_1256 Sign in Permalink I was really looking forward to enjoying the movie. I was sorely disappointed. The only part I enjoyed was a touching father-daughter relationship that was poignantly conveyed through the complexities of time changes and space travel. The rest of the movie is a waste of time; the story line is weak, with no character or idea development. Anne Hathaway as an a scientist and an astronaut felt like a joke. The "scientific" mambo-jumbo did not make sense to sustain my interest for the remainder of the movie, ridden by derivative clichés and time wasters. The movie has not enriched me to justify a 3 hour time waste. BOTTOM LINE: A Totally forgettable 3 hours that can be spent more productively elsewhere.
5.0~Underwhelming and at the best okay. PurePolonium Sign in Permalink I went into this film expecting great things, especially with Christopher Nolan's film Inception being one of the best films put to screen in recent years it's just a shame that it felt like someone filmed a glacier. You watch on in awe of the visuals before you and the way it's been filmed draws you into the people there and you wonder what it would be like to see what they did for yourself. However with the lovely scenery and the brilliant score your friend had made for the home movie you forget that it's just a glacier. It may be huge but it's moving really slowly, at at times you feel like you didn't have to actually watch parts of the film because you know you wouldn't miss anything. Then once it finally pushes its way to where it is heading bits of it begin to fall off, the ending is interesting but eventually the initial feeling just melts away into a large pool of cold and clear water.The closest film that I could possibly compare this to is perhaps 2001:A Space Odyssey, but I feel as though I actually got something out of watching 2001, where as with Interstellar it just felt empty. Despite this, I think it's a must watch for fans of space, science, and scale.
1.0~Junk! oconnorclyde Sign in Permalink Don't waste your money, too long ,wanders too much , c script with B actor. I felt like I aged 50 years watching this garbage. Now I know why Matthew is doing Lincoln commercials. He screwed up so many movies and this is what is left. His only other worse movie was Dumb, oops I mean MUD . What is this guy thinking, whoever wrote this script must have been higher than Robert Plant in the 70's. I cant believe Matt Damon jumped in, probably for beer money. Matt Datmon was the only one worth watching. Wait until someone hands you the DVD for your library, otherwise don't spend a dime on this junk. Michael Caine was in it for the beer money as well.
3.0~Every space cliché you've ever seen for the price of one movie justincward Sign in Permalink Is it my fault Matthew MacHaunecatechity has one of those faces that makes you think he's got haemorhoids, and mumbles half his lines? So do I, but I don't purport to be a space hero. Grizzled, cantankerous old farm boy is apparently the only person suitable to pilot a spaceship through a wormhole in order to save mankind, but the twist is that he doesn't know it's a suicide mission. In the end, he makes it back anyway through extended, overwrought, Matrix-style jiggerypokery. 2001, Event Horizon, Gravity, Contact, any space film you can think of has been recycled and regurgitated to bring Interstellar to your screen. What Interstellar lacks is any ideas of its own. Watch once and forget.
10.0~The best movie I've ever seen santiago_9500 Sign in Permalink I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies, though I enjoyed watching Kubrick's "2001: A space odyssey" I've never been too much into this genre so when I first heard Nolan was going to direct a sci-fi movie I didn't know if I was gonna really like it, how wrong was I. As I left the theater after watching the movie I almost could feel what 68's people should have felt when they leaved the theater after watching the Kubrick's masterpiece I've previously mentioned. I just couldn't think about anything else but the fact that that was the best movie I'd ever seen in my life. The plot, the visuals, the effects, the sounds, the acting... everything in this movie is just perfect there's no other word to describe it.
1.0~I stepped in a pile of Interstellar mmller113 Sign in Permalink I had expectations of an excellent thought provoking scientific drama based on reviews and the overall rating of this film (8.9 stars as of today) but they were dashed minutes into the film. First the audio is horrendous it frequently alternates between the quiet mumbling of Matthew Mcconaughey's character to deafening sound effects and music, usually drowning out more dialog. And Mcconaughey truly does mumble his entire dialog (unless he's crying). I do not know many pilots that mumble unintelligibly let alone the best astronaut in the world as the script implies. The "Science" of the movie is pure fantasy. The original blast off from Earth requires the equivalent of a Saturn V to launch into orbit, yet the ship is able to blast it's way off the water world orbiting deep in the gravity well of a black hole with no booster at all. The water world itself is about 2 feet deep yet has mile high waves which are impossible in only a couple of feet of water. The gravity required for a 7 year/hour time dilation would have crushed Mcconaughey to a fake tan orange spot. There are many more problems with the science but you get the idea. Kip Thorne, an American theoretical physicist, may have consulted on this, but Christopher Nolan had final say on this piece of .... I imagine Thorne was looking to enhance his retirement account because it has surely not helped his reputation in the physics community. Maybe I should not be so hard on Thorne, perhaps he kept a magic beans scene out of the final cut. The story is thin and characters are poorly developed, yet I would estimate 15 minutes of the film is spent with these weak characters crying and sobbing, and babbling a Dylan Thomas poem, yuck. The specials effects are average. The worm hole scene has been done many times yet it is dragged out. The exotic exoplanets are puddle world, rock and ice world, and palm springs sans palms & springs, boring. Finally the robot looks like four or five Lincoln logs nailed together. I think when they got to doing the special effects for the robot they had run out of money. It was probably all spent on the fake tanning spray and hair dye for Mcconaughey. If you want to watch a truly inspiring performance in Space, Google Chris Hadfield's performance of "Space Oddity" on the international space station and skip Interstellar. I can not say enough bad things about this heap of fecal material. Don't waste your time or money. When I am dying on my death bed I will have one regret, that is having spent 3 hours of my life watching Interstellar.
2.0~Worse than meh thejimhale Sign in Permalink I was really looking forward to this movie, loving the genre. Unfortunately it was severely underwhelming. It starts out extremely slow. You are introduced to the family and the conditions on earth. This goes on for way too long with lots of tangential uninteresting side- stories. Finally... a very far-fetched scenario occurs where this "hero" is asked to embark on this adventure. Without going into the details there are so many ridiculous coincidences and interactions that it's immerse yourself in it. In addition it's BORING and way too long. Can't tell you how much I wanted to like this film... but a major disappointment.
9.0~Excellent Movie. Must watch for scifi fans schaible-brian Sign in Permalink I've seen most scifi movies. This one is very easy to watch if you don't mind long movies. I didn't drift at all during the movie. The dialog was good. Some voice was lost a few moments behind the sound of the movie, but I got the general idea. The script was great IMO. The picture and effects were very well done. Classy but not over the top unbelievable. I liked the cast and enjoyed their performances. The movie was a bit metaphysical at some points but it wasn't beyond all belief. You do have to allow a minor bit of flexibility in your state of reality to truly enjoy this one. But that's what SciFi is all about. A bit of futuristic thinking is required. I watch this one with my 12yo son and he was transfixed all the way through. And very animated after the movie ended. We both enjoyed it. Reminded me a lot of the "Odyssey" movies. I've read a lot of the lesser reviews and I can say those reviewers seem rigid and inflexible and unforgiving of a lot of aspects in the movie that don't really stand out as flaws IMO. I highly recommend this one on the big screen or IMAX. I'm a scientist and didn't find any of the effects to ridiculous to imagine. Please watch. Don't be fooled by the Haters. There was no moment in the movie where I was disappointed. I love a long absorbing flick and this was one for the books.
10.0~Greatest event in cinematic history Gage-Allen Sign in Permalink Interstellar... I never thought a single film can be that good, but Interstellar proves it can be. It truly is the greatest film I have seen as of now. Completely taking over the #1 on my movies list. It is my number one movie of all time now. It has affected my perception of our world and space beyond our world. This film is like no other... It'll mess with your head and awe you in exploration like no other. It'll twist your emotional strings like no other. It'll bring you on a journey like no other. It'll make you scared like no other. It'll immerse you like no other. This film is Christopher Nolan's greatest achievement. Thus putting Christopher Nolan as one of the single greatest Film directors of our time. I am honored to have witnessed such a historic event in cinema history.
1.0~Bad acting, bad science, bad movie mike-mikeinbox Sign in Permalink The reviews score here made me look forward to watching this movie, but what a disappointment it was. I am seriously wondering what is wrong with today's audience when a movie like this get such good reviews. Maybe its just a wrong idea of science fiction, maybe people label budget fantasy movies "science fiction" ? Anyway, lets have a quick look at some of the bad point of this movie. First the lead actor, i don't know how he is perceived in the US but looking with an European view, McConaughey is just plain horrible at acting. He has no facial expressions and talks English with a slow slur that is really annoying, then later on in the movie i see a good actor like Topper Grace and wonder what the casting director thought when she/he hired McConaughey. There is just no emotional connection between him and any of the other characters, even when he cries it feels like someone just drop some Vaseline over his face and he just sits there waiting till its lunch. Again McConaughey should be a car salesman, not an actor. Then there is the pace of this slow moving "epic", we spend god knows how many hours in some dust bowl house where people stare outside and drive in pickup trucks with high technology equipment to bring down Indian drones for using their solar panels to probably power an old play station 3. I kid you not. The way the lead manages to find the secret Nasa base is laughable. There is a base with literally hundreds of people working there, in the middle of a field without the huge parking lot for all their pickups trucks. Remember earth is dying so everyone has a V8 pickup to find Indian drones.... Then there is the so called "science" in the movie, apparently they even hired a professor to help them with the science part. Well dear professor, please join McConaughey as a car salesman as you don't have one clue about science and if the audience thinks the movie is using it, i have a bad feeling about the future of our species.. The radiation, the fact that they walk about on a planet with sun light orbiting a black hole, where we have so much gravity that every hour there is 7 years on earth and even the same for the station they left orbiting just 200 miles up... Is just one silly example. Of course McConaughey has no problems with relativity time shifts once he enters the black hole... of course.. How could he otherwise meet up with his dying daughter to make a real American ending to this disaster of a movie. Then there is the robot, made for a budget movie, looking so cheap and probably assembled from cardboard with aluminum foil , as you can see it almost bobbing about in the wind. Two obligatory LCD panels show scrolling text as the robot talks and stumbles about. That robot sets the level for the special effects, they look cheap , badly filmed from the perspective of the space ship most of the time, as if they had some plastic contraption with a go-pro attached to it, handled by a 12 year old going "Bzzzzzzz" as he moves it about. Yes its that bad. There are many bad movies around, and this is just one of them, but what baffles me is why this piece of overlong budget fantasy gets so many good reviews. Did the people here not see other movies, ever ? Did they miss Alien, Gravity or even Star Wars, not that the last one is science fiction but at least its entertaining and this was not. Hoping Hollywood wakes up at some point and starts making movies again with depth and science instead of cheap fantasy aimed at , yeah what IS the target audience for this. And McConaughey please leave the movie industry and join the nearest Chevy dealer.
10.0~Conact was my favourite S-fiction movie about the space until now.!INTERSTELLAR right now is on the top of that and in my opinion Nolans best movie ever ! gimlikos Sign in Permalink INTERSTELLAR right now is on the top of that , and in my opinion Nolans best movie ever !. Space, Story, CGI, Music, Actors and most of all The Magic in this movie.!.Awesome !.This is one of this movies that are much better than the trailer !. So far the best movie of 2014 and one of the best I have ever seen. Bad reviews are from people that always complain because this is what they do best !. Conact was my favourite S-fiction movie about the space until now.!INTERSTELLAR right now is on the top of that and in my opinion Nolans best movie ever !
1.0~Truly, one of the worst, most racist and badly acted films I have ever watched. fustbariclation Sign in Permalink I could not have believed quite how bad Interstellar is. It is truly dreadful. After six months travelling, with just 12 minutes to go to entering the wormhole, the token Blackman speaks to the hero (who has his suntan intact): Massa, Massa, what is going on? The hero then takes a piece of paper and explains to the poor, ignorant black man how space warps in a wormhole. If he didn't know this, WTF was he doing on the trip? Their understanding of relativity is at the level I'd expect from my goldfish. They give plenty of time to grotesque emotional watching of film clips from Earth - for some reason in B&W. The hero goes through, as Dorothy Parker said, all the emotions from A to B. They claim it is a post colonial world, but the space suits all have the US flag on them. The spaceship controls are circia 1960. Poor Michael Cain, is he so short of money that he has to be pare of this shite? To be fair, it is, unconsciously funny from time to time because it is so utterly clueless. Avoid this film if you possibly can.
3.0~The most overrated movie of the year if not years to come... muons Sign in Permalink The movie starts very slowly. There's hardly anything interesting in the first hour. During that time, I almost fell asleep in the theatre. Despite the commendable efforts to make it comply with the predictions of modern physics like time dilation, twin paradox, etc. the plot is still full of gaps and utterly nonsensical actions which defy your logic. The "scientific" references to quantum mechanics, general relativity and string theory (this one is rather implicit...) in the dialogues are very pretentious and most of the time plain silly. The only parts of the movie that would evoke interest and probably keep you awake are as usual about human drama, power struggle and emotional encounters. In this regard, all the efforts to make it compatible with the laws of modern physics become useless and a waste of time. Indeed, I have yet to see any movie that can pull it off since "Contact." In this regard, I'd rather see "dumb" sci-fi movies which concentrate on drama like the first and 2nd gen Star-Trek than this sort of half-ass physics-wanna-be stuff which fail to address your imagination. On the positive side the plot is clear, unobstructed and easily understandable despite the references to theoretical physics. Compared to sheer crap like "Cloud Atlas" that certainly deserves a praise hence my three stars for the rating.
3.0~My God... quinn-cunniff Sign in Permalink Hey Guys It's Quinn C from Youube. Well first off, the visuals in this film are absolutely stunning. I saw this film in a bad theatre, a dome theater if you've ever been in one of those, but even still the visuals were awesome. CAnd the score, although I believe it to be pretty bad and I'll explain in a bit as to why, but the score literally shook the building, so this film really was an experience more than anything else. I truly believe that this film can only be truly viewed in a theatre. But my god, it turned ugly for this film real quick. The first reason was the audio was difficult to hear a lot of the times. Not only was there I guy shouting 'WOW' or 'HES BEHIND THE BOOKCASE' who sat next to me, but the score was so damn loud that you can't hear what people are saying. But then again people argue that this film isn't about the dialogue, but the message. Fair enough, fair enough. My main problem with this film and why I dedicate an entire video to it is because the ending is arguably the most infuriate, devoid of logic, waste of 3 hours of potential that has ever existed on this planet. Heavy spoilers right here, but you've had time for this film so here it is: After narrowly escaping 'Dr Man', ending the most obviously forced message outside of murf saying 'man is corrupted and destroyed the planet', McConaughey goes into a black hole, unharmed, to send morse code message to his daughter through a book case in another dimension to tell her the secrets to the universe. Through love. He then gets to his daughter, who basically tells him to go away. and then the movie ends. I'll just give a moment for that to soak in. OK, what is the purpose of having an entire movie based heavily on science, and I mean heavy, just for a series of bull things to occur for no reason at all. First of all, going to the bottom of a pool hurts your head, so how a black hole wouldn't crush McConaughey immediately is beyond me. But fine I'll let it go. Then, to have him send morse code because love permits him, and then to crush the entire theme of the film by having murf flip him off basically just makes no sense. It also doesn't work cause McConaughey doesn't care about his son the entire time, the crew gets screwed because they love people which bits them in the ass, but after all of this love is the only way for McConaughey to send his message to murf at the end. So what I'm trying to say is that this film is just a bunch of contradictions. It uses science to explain stuff but then uses love to propel the plot, people use love to do stuff but it never benefits them, and love is ultimately how McConaughey gets home, just for him to leave again within 10 minutes. Now there are parts I love. I thought everything on the ocean planet was great, the robot thing was awesome, and the first 2 hours were great, but the ending is so infuriating and borderline paradox like that the film ends up making no sense. Now please don't say I don't get the film. I got the film 100%, it's just this movie literally makes no sense. You can't just go into a black hole and survive, and if your father comes back to you after 100 years, you aren't just gonna push him out of the room. The scientists act on emotion, not logic like most all astronauts, and overall, this film just bothers me then brings any joy. Unlike blade runner which I'd probably like after another viewing, this film will always go down as my biggest disappointment of a film; With a score of 5.6, you should just stop watching as soon as mr man dies, trust me.

I do daily videos reviewing films of old and new, and also give very in depth analysis of the James Bond films.

4.0~On the cusp of something... Jessica-Desmond Sign in Permalink Sigh. I really really wanted to like this movie. It had a lot of potential. Visually it is stunning, art really, the sound-track is glorious and there are moments of true meaty Nolan magic. But ultimately the story falls flat. Whether it was the writing or the editing the whole thing felt disjointed, simultaneously crammed (with subplots that are opened and closed without any emotion making them unsatisfying and, with such a run time, leave you wondering if they were better off left out) and empty (trying to do everything, little was done very well). The actors seem to struggle as the script gives them no scope for development. Often the cast are spewing lines to explain things and move the plot rather than as characters. There is a sense of bridled thoroughbreds with such a stellar cast delivering sporadic moments of emotion so intense - as though trying to compensate - which are jarring at best, and more often cringe-y. The star of the show really is Mackenzie Foy as the sassy young Murph. The science is grating, laden with the use of the words 'relativity' and 'quantum data' every 2 minutes (it feels like). The reason for the ecosystem break down is glossed over (climate change too controversial for the American public?) and the astronaut needs a paper sketch to understand what a worm-hole is. And finally you have to ask, if you go back in time, and get another chance to make yourself stay, why would you send yourself the same message you had already ignored? Surely you try a different tact when you are (at that stage) genuinely trying to change the outcome. "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result." Unfortunately this will not be Nolan film I watch over and over.
2.0~Pseudo-scientific NeoCon bullshit sebastian_goofy Sign in Permalink This movie is plain bad. It's a piece of pseudo-scientific neo-conservative pseudo-religious ideology disguised as science fiction. Why? Let me take one scene that surely is no big spoiler, but that explains pretty much everything of that movie: The daughter (and her friend) need to return to the family home where her brother lives, due to.. no, not science, due to some supernatural inspiration, let us coin that a little bit more clear: faith (in "god"). Let's refer to the daughter and her friend henceforth as "the elite", because that's what they represent. Likewise, let's refer to the brother and his family as the "sheeple", because they represent those: uneducated, inflexible, conservative - although they're uneducated because the "administration" wants them to be that way (incidentally, this is what we actually *can* expect in the very near future, so maybe that's the predictive part of the sci-fi). Since they just dismissed the brother and his family's way of life as morally inferior, they're not really welcome anymore. So what is the smart way to handle this? Ask for forgiveness, maybe refer to "family values"? No, we're talking about the morally superior elite here! Of course they attack the place by putting fire to their crops. So, the brother is distracted and goes to the rescue putting his life at risk (but what a small expense is that compared to the possible success of the elite!). Anyway, now the daughter is in the house and receives a message - no, not from science - from, well, let's put it as what it is: from god. Well, it's her brother, in fact, it's her, so no matter, basically man is god. Not really Christian canon, nor that of any other religion (except Scientology, if I remember correctly). We now see: the elite is represented by the "chosen one". And since also the sheeple understand that all is forgiven, the brother who just returns from risking his life due to the great ideas of the elite (and frankly, pretty much without need, for as what she does then is actually stop him from killing them by referring to family bounds, which she could have done the very first moment) accepts the "truth", which is: the elite may do what they want, including risking the lives of the sheeple if it's "imperative", because they (the elite) know "the truth" and are morally superior. They are the side of the "chosen one". The sheeple are to trust, or better believe, and follow. Into death as needs be. See, this is what this movie is about. It's not about science. Everything that is science in here is just a disguise to "prove" that man is god. It's also not optimistic, because what we see is a dystopian future. The basic message of the whole movie is: Restriction is not needed. Ecology is used to oppress the people (the ominous "administration" who doesn't want to have people educated!). We can spend all the resources we want, because at some point in the future there will be a chosen one to save us. Not science! A chosen one, from the elite. Oh, and while we're at it: it's interesting to see that although obviously the planet went down the gutter due to some ecological catastrophe, all the people still are driving gas guzzlers. The only explanation why this is still allowed by the "oppressive administration" must then be that burning fuel was not what triggered the catastrophe.. think about it. I know, most people won't realize the hidden messages in this movie. Not actively, that is. But they'll *get the point* ("John Carpenter's They Live", anyone?). They are undeniably there. The whole rest of the movie is - simply an action movie. Unluckily not even a good one. The graphics effects may be physically accurate, but they look like a HOM - a texture glitch in a computer game (do game engines send us messages by this?). At least the handiwork is well done, so it's 2 stars out of ten.
5.0~90 minute film stretched to over two hrs with excessive crying. curiosarcana Sign in Permalink Interstellar is the most boring thing I've watched since the last space-drama, "Gravity". This is that movie, crossed with an episode of Doctor Who, and with about an extra hour of absolutely pointless crying and drama included, as far as I can tell, purely to stretch the length of the movie. If it had been an hour and a half, it probably would've been fun to watch. The visual effects are really nice, and the acting is believable. Matthew McConaughey would be good in anything. I like that it's completely unpredictable. And the smart arse robot is a nice touch, (after the protagonist tells it to turn on its 'queue light' when it's joking, it says "You can use it to find your way back after I blast you out of the air lock"). But holy freaking crap all of that long, drawn out, crying gets old fast. I get it. Your character is really broken up about stuff. Can we move on to the next plot point already? Whoever decided that the story needed to be broken into five minute pieces, separated by long periods of grieving and frustration, needs to be kicked in the shins. Repeatedly.
2.0~A Disappointment philipsudron Sign in Permalink As a plot I thought this movie had a lot of potential. I was disappointed however. After 25 minutes I just found it boring. The acting is terrible and you can hardly hear what Matthew McConaughy is saying. He just seems to be mumbling all the time. Also there is very little or no humour, most of the characters seem to argue with each other and the only interesting line was something to do with one hour being equal to 7 earth years, "so let's make every bit of it count." I ejected the DVD before half an hour was up....but maybe I'll return to it at some point. I am just glad I never went to see it at the cinema.
5.0~And once We thought Nolan can be the Kubrick of this generation. sadsaint Sign in Permalink Nolan, Being already handy with the Sci-fi genre showed his potential with his trademark vision in Memento and Inception. he just darkened the story in The dark knight. So with his past performances this movie "Interstellar" definitely had some hypes and high expectations with it. Nolan on a sci-fi about space. Personally i have loved the movies of Nolan, everyone, watched them all. but this one disappointed me. Nolan just couldn't handle the story. he tried to use the effects that he dreamed off. it was like Mark Webb's Amazing spiderman. Interstellar is a movie that tries to teach the Children and Newbies about the theories of Einstein and Hawking in easier way (It's a fiction additionally.) and the working mechanism of Blackhole and other space particles. He demonstrated a good definition of the fourth dimension, "Time", but why didn't he focused much on the Murph at her dying moments, she should have a little more conversation with her father, with whom she met after a life time. other than that, the stranger than fiction demonstration of the imaginative world inside black-hole(that behind the book-self). and the unpresentable love chemistry of Cooper and Brand. I knew that Nolan would leave the story on a loose note, like he had done with Inception(the spinning totem), but i never thought even his ending would be this weak point. This story was like watching a parody of the movies of Kubrick(of some really tricky scenes), Spielberg (the high budget actions and effects) and Cameroon (figure that out yourself) its still watchable though, if its in 3D.
6.0~Ultimately this movie is entertaining brendamay-38740 Sign in Permalink Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to "2001: A Space Odyssey" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in "Interstellar" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.
6.0~Calm down there, fan-boys. sirnaber Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys. Where to start? The overtly obvious and cliché ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The "dramatic" content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do. Some cliché shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The "beings" (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece. "Human nature" is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes. The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie. Music is great too, though sometimes overused, but it's Hans Zimmer for crying out loud. What I enjoyed was the layout of the dystopic future, perhaps a little emphasis on how the world came to be that way would have made for a better and more plausible movie(don't even get me started on the absurd physics of this movie. good luck running from a black-hole). Simply put, this film is by no means a 9, and it simply doesn't qualify for the top250 (though of course there are many titles there which don't qualify even for the top875384).
7.0~Not a Masterpiece by Nolan, but it was good. leonardo_marcelino Sign in Permalink This movie is not his masterpiece. I actually like Nolan's movies such as Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight Trilogy. But this movie is too long and dragging it seems like waste of film to make a movie this long. Why input lots of useless dialogue or scenes? The only part I like is actually the part they're not in space, as the effect on space is not really good and gets a little boring overtime. If I want to watch a movie with space, I prefer and suggest to watch Cosmos: A Space TimeOdyssey (2014), it have more awesome visual stunning effects than this movie and also more clever approach for your brain because it teaches you REAL science. Maybe Nolan is not ready to make a Space Movie. If you think this is the best space movie of all time, I suggest you watch the Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). I prefer Hal 9000 over Tars for an AI.
1.0~Could do better (*Spoiler alert*) mr-96344 Sign in Permalink (Spoiler Alert!) I can't believe that there are so many glowing reviews of this movie. On the plus side: brilliant CG, FX, cinematography. On the negative side: the awful acting, the terrible plot, the script, the hokey comic book physics explained for the lowest common denominator in the audience. I really liked McConaughey in Dallas Buyer's Club - by far the best thing he's done to date. But in this movie? Just another fly-by-the- seat-of-the-pants astronaut, risking everything and everyone, but it all works out in the end. Of course. Way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending, which came as no surprise whatsoever, thanks to the 'ghost'. And then we discover that 'love conquers all'. Including science. Of course. Probably most of the reason I rated this so low is because with a name like 'Interstellar' I was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel, the time relativity concept, et al. Sigh. And the smart-ass, wisecracking robot was the last straw. Just. So. Bad.
1.0~A real stinker and even worse in Imax steven-leibson Sign in Permalink This movie is a darn shame for it's poor ability to tell a story and I am a bona fide SciFi lover. This movie is a pale imitation of "2001: A Space Odyssey" from the 1960s and it will leave people who lack a significant SciFi background scratching their heads and asking themselves "What did I just see? What did it mean?" Plot synopsis: Earth is dying a slow ecological death. The dust bowl is back, bigger and badder than ever. Crops are failing one by one. All we can grow is corn and you know what happened to Ireland when it tried monoculture: the potato famine. Earth's only hope is to send expeditions through a black hole/wormhole that's conveniently appeared near Saturn. In the movie 2001, the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of Jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane, homicidal computer. In "Interstellar," the mission's hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole. To achieve this mission, a NASA gone underground sends the wobbliest, spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot. The space vehicle that's sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole. It takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole. The special effects and CGI are probably very good in this movie, but seeing it in Imax presented two problems. First, the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large. Second, it's impossible to take in the entire screen. You must constantly scan back and forth across the image because the filmmaker's emphasis was sometimes towards the edge of the screen. This appears to be a frequent problem with popular releases shown in Imax and I keep forgetting about this problem. I really wanted to like this film. I didn't.
2.0~What a load of tosh MikesIDhasbeentaken Sign in Permalink Have to agree with others who've been surprised this garbage has got such a high score on IMDb, it's not clever, well written, nor are the special effects great (when the ships 'grab' onto each other it's like watching the grabbing machines at a funfair) It's just a load of nonsense, I'm all for weird sci-fi movies that try and offer something different, but this is silly when it's trying to be serious, and nowhere near clever enough to be pulled off. The whole thing just feels dragged out, the end explanation was just lazy, boring and ridiculous, in line with the rest of the film. with such a budget surely the visuals were going to be good... a masterpiece if you believe the hundreds of reviews... but it was just awful, everything was cringing to watch, was the robot thing meant to be taken seriously?? who wrote this stuff and got hundreds of millions to make it? Looks like the people involved with the film have a few friends tho, all writing good reviews on IMDb it seems,
9.0~lo and behold: interstellar is here to stay! vicky-sharma9889 Sign in Permalink Chris Nolan does it again guys! Inception was a mind-bending film. If you liked it, there's 99% chance that you are gonna LOVE Interstellar. Nolan has the proved ability of turning normal stories into mind-bending cinema. Thank god no other director took up Interstellar, else we'd be looking at a sci-fi potbolier. not a chance with nolan's desire for swimming against the tide. The whole concept of space travel is given a new twist. The warm holes and time dimensions leave us gobsmacked. full credit goes to cinematography. the space scenes are well shot and remind of Kubric's 2001. Whoever says that emotions aren't important in cinema must be sleeping when great films were released. Nolan does a cool mix of sci-fi and drama. it is a tear jerker in many ways but when you walk out of cinema you walk with your head high. I loved the relation between Cooper & his daughter Murph. I felt the son's character was predictable and kinda boring. whenever you think that you've got what's coming, nolan throws a twist. it is a film that must be viewed multiple times. Way to go.
1.0~A sci-fi fan dares to rate this LOW deltaforce7 Sign in Permalink This seemed like a complex, no basic entertainment-sort of a film-kind of experience. Should have been great as far as the concept goes. What I didn't like right away is the overall idea: IF there is a problem, then WALK AWAY. Meaning, the problem is never solved. Also. Complex concepts are displayed in a matter of a few fragmented shots. Even those who are used to the Sci-Fi genre are confused. But the rest are lost. What's nice are the certain technicalities. But the human, physical side is difficult, unexplained, overly politically correct and accompanied by other things that don't get a viewer anywhere near the point of all this. So, this could've been a real nice piece of a more intellectual sci-fi, but the makers of this movie got confused about how to depict such concepts.
4.0~Really bad. timoros Sign in Permalink What annoyed me more about this film is the total ignorance of the laws of physics. Effects are nice, actors are good, there are some nice shots. But it is obvious that the director is trying to copy Stanley Kubrick's style of the epic film "2001: A Space Odyssey 1968" in many different shots. The film could easily be 90 or 100 minutes durations and we would not miss anything. Three hours is way too long. Especially the last hour, when the cosmonauts have supposedly entered the "horizon of events" of the black hole. Come on ... Every film in the world does not have to have a happy ending and not all protagonists must survive. HE felt inside a black hole and he managed to live and RETURN back to our solar system..... Man so disappointing.
10.0~A Love Story Against The Backdrop Of A Grand Interstellar Travel gstards Sign in Permalink Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of "Endurance" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself. The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in "Interstellar" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere. The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the "Space Odyssey" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar. Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: "Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The "Endurance" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's "Odyssey", and they are pleasing to the eye. Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. "Interstellar" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again. "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."
7.0~Already a Director's Cut andrew-sciba Sign in Permalink The epic feel of 'Interstellar' comes from its sheer length and scope of events, but the actual impact of the plot line was lacking, leaving me STILL unsure as to whether or not I even liked the movie. It feels like this is a film that the Nolan brothers wanted to make without creative input from the evil movie executives who usually demand edits based on pacing or story/character complexity. In short, it's a director's cut, through and through. Some scenes or plot points were light or jumbled that I stopped trying to figure out what was going on and just let the movie take me for a ride, in which I became more of a spectator than a moviegoer. The development of the movie itself felt a little like ADHD Netflix; first it's Shyamalan's Signs, then 2001: A Space Odyssey, suddenly Event Horizon (softened by the deadpan humor of Dr. Who-esque robots), ending with Luke Skywalker hopping in a small spacecraft with his trusty droid off to find Leia in the Degoba System or whatever. Though 'Interstellar' brings some new story mechanisms into play, like Einstein's relativity and what it would be like to exist outside of time, these devices have been explored thoroughly outside of film - unlike the 'dream within a dream' concept. At the end of the day, the spectacular feel of 'Interstellar' is handicapped by it's lack of solid delivery and plot disconnectivity. It's worth the price of a normal movie ticket, but don't be surprised if you leave the theater scratching your head.
10.0~Epic in every way! sanjay219 Sign in Permalink Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!
1.0~Very difficult to watch Balcanmaster Sign in Permalink Sometimes the best directors make terribly weak movies. That is the case here. Incredibly chaotic, inharmonious, confused scenario has become a duty, boring and inharmonious film. Neither the best actors nor high budget can save this film. Pretentious, artificial and false thoughtful, at times boring, banal and full of clichés from other movies - in general very difficult to watch. A casual audience, however, would liked similar mishmash, but for true connoisseurs of cinema this film is simply unbearable. I endured it with a huge annoyance and regret for the lost time and vain expectations.
9.0~A familiar journey to the unknown, albeit a grand one aldamayo Sign in Permalink So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take: To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good. Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before. For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time. Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop. One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released. After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown. Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.
10.0~It is not Memento, it is not The Dark Knight, it is not Inception. It is Interstellar. tsatt33 Sign in Permalink A Quantum Leap in Film making. The greatest story ever told. A movie that encompasses all that is and can be Human. Interstellar bravely Transcends into the unknown throughout time and space, leaving no one behind. My persistent craving for unwavering diligence in directing and acting has been satisfied with ample sufficiency. Very few take true pride in what they do, and most never try. But to never give up hope and to reach for the stars is how real greatness is achieved. Thank you Mr. Nolan(s), thank you 'Cooper', for creating a piece that holds such faith in mankind's will to survive, and most of all, Love. 5D 10/10
2.0~Boring and Over-rated and waste of money. moon2senses Sign in Permalink Just watched. first half so bored just want to get out of the theater. both actors acting were weirdly bad and very difficult to engage into the movie. Not even near of Stanley Kubrick 2001: A Space Odyssey. Acceptable rest of half. Some thrills and excitement but far away from good. Bad plot Bad story, bad directing...just big scale of visual effects with big budget with loud sound. many non-sense in the movie one simple example is that scene - after sand storm hit, house and cars are covered by dust/sands but not the lawn and corn field...clean green. I never thought Nolan is good director like the reputation he has, but this is very bad. no entertaining, nothing special - most of thing already shown from many different movies... But, beautiful depicts of black hole and spaces, just for some special effects but nothing wowed. It was horrible experience that Christopher Nolan spent so much money to make this Crap with typical Illuminati theme. For brain wash? I really really regret I spent $20 for this at IMAX.
3.0~3 Hours of Typical Hollywood Formatting edward-smith21 Sign in Permalink Let's face it, science fiction can be mind-blowing in either of two ways: it can be the Star Wars type spaceship overload, light sabres, action and explosion-fest, with millions of different ways to make a humanoid look like an alien (Jar Jar Binks?) - and then there is the 2001 A Space Odyssey type of sci-fi that pushed the boundaries of film-making by concentrating on the challenges that space travel presents to us. Interstellar doesn't fit into either of these categories. Knowing that I was about to sit through a 3 hour science-fiction film about interstellar travellers looking for new worlds for the human species to escape a dying Earth, and with reading so many good reviews in the media, I was dehydrating myself for hours beforehand so I didn't need the toilet. The dehydration was unnecessary. Let's get this straight - the best scene in the film is where Romilly - showing signs of insanity - knocks on a wall panel and points out that beyond the skin of the spaceship there is nothing! This is where I gained faith in the script, but subtle concerns and peculiarities were obviously not on the menu for development. It turned out to be a typical Hollywood attempt at doing something that Hollywood is not qualified to do - serious sci-fi! So, the first alien planet we come across has more gravity than Earth, and the second planet has less gravity. Whilst I accept that the story cannot dwell on how our protagonists would react to such a strange environment, neither should it dwell on how 'love' plays a factor in interstellar travel. Alas, I have watched 3 hours of a film that ultimately attempts to drive home the idea that human spirituality is at the heart of everything. And that is typical Hollywood. Arrogant. Naïve!
1.0~What a Waste of Space theguests-southport Sign in Permalink This truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst sci-fi film I have ever had the misfortune to waste 2.5hrs on. The acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits. The music drowns out a lot of the dialogue, which is probably just as well considering its triteness. The whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after they'd endured an overkill of everything from the Lost in Space TV series of the sixties (though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings), through to 2001 A Space Odyssey, and the innumerable Star Trek programmes and films. Any movie that casts Michael Caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters. He utters, in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene, "I lied". Well he certainly didn't act! Anne Hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that she'd rather be undergoing root-canal work, whilst Matthew McConaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he can't quite believe he is expected to say. The continuity is confusing and the 'special effects' only reach mediocre, adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer. I have watched hundreds of sci-fi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent, which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss - but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever; one develops no empathy for any of the players, and there were a couple I longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline (the child who portrays the ten-year old Murphy to name but one). Sorry, but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on. There again, you are quite entitled to think otherwise....
1.0~Stunningly bad brennn Sign in Permalink This is yet another movie that relies on a soaring soundtrack and pretty visuals to distract you from the fact that it is poorly crafted, with massive plot holes, manipulative story lines that go nowhere and inconsistent, poorly developed characters. It gives us a bunch of garbled scientific babble without explaining what's going on - I guess we are just expected to accept it, even though it makes no sense. If we are to believe "Coop" is desperately needed for this mission to save the planet, why is this former engineer and magnificent pilot not working for NASA? Why is he sent to "discover" their compound through his daughter, who displays very little sign of brilliance, besides being a handful at school and understanding morse code. We are given the vague notion that sandstorms choke everything but corn for some reason, and even that apparently hardy crop will die off soon - the good people at NASA have one guy working on it, choosing instead to concentrate the planet's most brilliant minds on mastering the galaxy and transporting the race to a brand new planet, conveniently through a wormhole. "Coop" is apparently brilliant enough to be the only guy who can save the world, yet he needs tje concept of a wormhole explained to him by having another guy poke a hole in a piece of paper - eureka! The whole movie takes place on a shifting foundation of science! No, love! No, supernatural phenomena! And when "Coop" is able to find the magic library and use amazing technology to communicate in the wormhole with no means of life support, he uses that amazing technology to send his brilliant daughter a message in morse code. If you're advanced enough to have an AI robot helper that functions inside a wormhole, surely that technology can be more believably deployed to save the world than with a father's supernatural love manifesting in a short message of complicated science delivered through a watch. And at the end, after "Coop's" long, improbable, emotional journey to get back to his beloved daughter, he stays with her for all of 30 seconds, not bothering to meet his descendants or inquire about the fate of his son, whom he kind of liked too, I guess. And then he flies off to be with his love Anne Hathaway, even though they showed no apparent signs of romantic connection, and who has apparently been abandoned on a planet by herself, even though the technology existed to rescue her. If only the viewer could master time/space travel to get back nearly three hours of wasted viewing time.
1.0~A painful waste of time gaer-lloyd Sign in Permalink Like quite a few others I'm giving this one star to balance out countless 10 star reviews. My wife and I watched this because of the high average review on this site. I won't bother describing why the movie was so bad. Others have done a great job. It was like watching a three hour train-wreck, or a regular train wreck shown in super slow motion over several hours. Unfortunately I can't just leave it at that, because I have to write at least 10 lines. So I will expand enough to say that the "science" was non-existent, special effects were poor, the pacing slow. Perhaps the most ridiculous thing was that the astronauts had to leave earth with a 20th century three-stage rocket, but later they landed on other planets and took off again with Star Wars type landing craft. That's just one example of insane stupidity, and it just got worse and worse from there.
1.0~The most overrated movie ever aperisic Sign in Permalink It is not easy to specify the general flaw in this movie, but I will try: the script was simply plotted without any technique applied that belongs to artistry. It is all flat, direct, linear, even though it is a fantasy and even though it speaks about time dilatation, wormholes, other galaxies and so on. When decades pass, there are trillion ways of displaying it. In this movie, there is only one - narration, and only after you understand what narration says a few emotionless flashbacks. Emotional background is missing. There is more emotional canvas painted in any Star Trek episode than this movie. It is so bad that there is nothing to act against. I truly think that the director read the script, took a CGI department to present what the script is talking about, and even this is done fairly unconvincing, and... he expected that to be that - a movie. There is zero effort in combining elements with more depth. The movie is still watchable, but there are far more nuances in some episodes of Twilight Zone. In this one, these are nuisances. It just looks the same, but it is a complete 169 minutes long spelling error. What is extremely surprising is critique that finds this movie far above average, some say a masterpiece, the users on IMDb are placing it among top 50 movies ever. It is not among first 1000, let alone 50. I hope nobody is going to claim that the movies like this one are above average or I will stop visiting theaters for good. I give this movie 2, for the sake of sanity, for the sake of art that movie once was. I hope time will speak against the quality of this movie soon enough.
1.0~Horribly Boring.. No Plot.. no story whatsoever v-3-gupta Sign in Permalink I rely on IMDb when it comes to decide what to watch and what not to watch. Rating of 9.2 looks so attractive that I didn't even bother to check the trailer. I went to watch the movie with very high expectations but was very disappointed. As I was watching it I was thinking maybe know it will start to make sense but it didn't even by the last scene. It was a total bollywood drama where hero doesn't die no matter where he is. The most funny part was when he press the eject button in space. It does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination. It was like monkeys had written the script as they has shown in south park. Awful movie, total waste of time and money. Please go if you hate yourself or your life which is one and the same thing.
7.0~The most stupid science fiction of these days khaktus Sign in Permalink To explain my daring title - I'd like this review to be a counterbalance to many over-enthusiast appraisals. Yes, it is a good action/drama. Yes, it is a spectacular science-fiction film. Every genre fan's dream: travelling among different worlds (though, try to watch Europa report!), bending the laws of "common sense" newtonian physics and playing with blackholes and wormholes (the space-bending explanation is just a shameless "borrowing" from much older Event Horizon). Though, this movie betrays the "common sense" in yet another way. its plot. "We have destroyed this Earth, let's find another one." Irresponsibility, anyone? while we may argue - if this is not a premise of every beloved pot-apocalyptic distopia, if "space travel" is not what we want from science-fiction at the end of the day ... this movie dared to start with really hot topic, so boldly that it should be judged by its own "higher standards". So we have an ecosystem collapse in the beginning - It is quite obvious that the reason of it are monocultures stretching towards the horizon - a direct consequence of machist, industrial, technocratic approach to science, progress, planet, life, agriculture, thinking... The root cause is so clearly visible in every picture frame of the down-on-Earth part of the movie - but the only "solution" offered by the writer(s) is again the technocratic one: "Let's build super complex machines to transport us zillion light years away" ... instead of simple (!) cheap (!!) responsible (!!!) fixing of the darned monoculture issue down on our original planet. While many claim that this movie is sophisticated if not even intellectual - it is not - it is actually offensive to the intellect. There might be many of the-good-old space travel operas, whom I would forgive this and spare them the "common sense" critique. But not Interstellar - because it pretends that it is "aware", "eco-conscious", it pretends that it urges us to think about our relationship towards the planet, but it fails exactly in this point. Thinking. Watch Avatar and Home instead.
4.0~Big disappointment. Not black hole but plenty of holes. eduardo-edufern Sign in Permalink Attention: there might be spoilers here, but otherwise it is just not possible to discuss the film, IMHO. So do not read further if you have not seen it yet. Actually it is the first Nolan film I see, and I am open-mouthed at the HUGE hype preceding it. The film does not fulfill the expectations in most ways. The worst is the insufferable dialogue, which forces good actors into ineptness, Matt Damon being a particularly sad example. The whole screenplay needed about twenty (thousand) revisions more. There are characters that are completely superfluous, so much that one gets killed without any repercussions in the plot at all. And they do not seem to have a use for the character Romilly, either, except getting older. The idea of the NASA chief being a villain is preposterous; why send people on a mission you know they are going to fail? And his own daughter? Since it is all secret, which gallery would he be playing to? (and mind you, Caine is one of the very very few convincing characters, the other ones being Ellen Burstyin and the robots). There are huge scientific errors too, in spite of Kip Thorne. To slow time so much in the water planet, the gravity would have to crush the astronauts in essentially the first instant. A solution would have been to have the planet (or the ship) move nearer the speed of light, but apparently nobody thought of that. Points are about as subtle as a kick in the stomach, and I fail to see why anybody would think the science is "dense" and the film is "complex". Special effects are good. of course, but not as much as the hype says. And, sorry, if you get near a black hole, you would be thinned out like spaghetti by the enormous gravity. It is just impossible not only to survive, but to get out. The "They" is just a "Deus ex machina" to save the main plot from its own inepcy, and since this is all supposed to be so scientific, their appearance in the plot is completely arbitrary and illogical. And what, pray, would be these "quantum data"? Since the quantic theory applies only in extremely small dimensions, why go look for it in space?. Somebody thought it sounded cute, I guess. There was no need to be realistic and scientific if we are getting out of the mire by miracle. The ending is maybe the best part, at times moving, but the notion that somebody who has been in hospital and will be let out only in "a couple of days" can rush to a rocket and take off, without space suit, raining, or assistance, as if it was a bicycle, seems ridiculous. My first and last Nolan film, I suspect.
6.0~Storytelling Lacks in a Film Too Long james-willis-154-314064 Sign in Permalink Setting aside the science behind the film (and yes, you really do need to have an advanced degree to understand it), the thing that most takes away from this film is lack of a coherent story. Too many loose ends and questions arise that can't simply be overtaken by the "wow factor" of the visuals. Example: Matthew McConaughey plays a former NASA engineer/pilot who is/was, according to Michael Caine's character (his former boss), the best NASA had ever produced. And yet McConaughey's character didn't know nor had been tapped for a secret project to launch people into a nearby black hole/corridor to another galaxy--a program that had been going on for years while earth was slowly turning into a dust ball. Wouldn't you think NASA would have located their best & brightest to launch him into the black hole? McConaughey's character, a widower, doesn't have to do much agonizing to leave his two young children behind on a multi-year mission to get to the black hole, through it, and come back with news from "the other side" on where humankind can pick up and move to. Eventually his daughter goes to work for NASA (she's just there one day, all grown up, no back story) and the daughter and her brother both become estranged. Again, no back story to speak of, we just have to accept it (the film is already too bloody long so there was no time to develop the characters). Ultimately it is a movie about a father and a daughter and everything else is backdrop to propel that story. The problem is, most of that sweet story is lost in loud special effects and rabbit trails. I'm glad I watched it--once. That's all I'll watch it.
10.0~Masterpiece tilemahoscfu Sign in Permalink Best movie ever. As usual Nolan did a great work along with Hans Zimmer and his amazing soundtracks.
1.0~boring romancadd Sign in Permalink the movie was too long. much to much scientific mumbo jumbo. the special effects were a total let down. saw it in imax not impressed. the story had no speed very draggy!!! performances were OK no Oscars here. the previews were the best part of the lure! the middle was right out of 2001 space odyssey. i have never been to a movie where so many people left (about 25-30) which was most of the crowd. my daughter and i stuck it out hoping for some redemption but none came! i should have seen it at a bargain matinée!! very upset movie goer! i know that this movie has gotten great reviews- but really - take another look please.
1.0~Oh, no! nick_fadely Sign in Permalink It is incomprehensible to me that I watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on IMDb seemed to. Perhaps I was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole, wormhole, or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid. All I know is that my hard-earned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that I am truly regretful. Like a few other commenters, I had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters, even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors. A ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases, very little of this movie makes any sense at all. It amazes me that Nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time, as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel. I should note that on several occasions, I actually couldn't help but laugh out loud at the absurdity, and that fact was truly telling for me. Mr. Nolan, et al - you owe me two hours and forty-nine minutes of my life back!
1.0~I loathed this movie KapnCrunch Sign in Permalink I will take some responsibility and say that perhaps I didn't give it a fair chance, but to be honest, I would have to rewatch this movie six or seven times in order to fully comprehend Matthew McConaughey's irritating, softly-spoken dialog. I couldn't understand a single word this man said in the entire film. To be be blunt, several subtle nuances ruined this film for me. Where can I even begin? 1. Time duration. Every responsible story-teller understands a good plot has an exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Christopher Nolan strikes out here with a three-hour, snoozefest. It takes over two and a half hours to get to the climax, which apparently depicts Matthew McConaughey trapped in a bookshelf in outer-space. How he gets there? I couldn't tell you. Maybe if Matthew McConaughey had a voice-box I would understand how someone falls into a black hole and ends up in some weird book-shelf dimension that somehow has ties to Earth. Whatever. It confused me, and at that point in the movie I had no interest in understanding it anyway. 2. Anne Hathaway cries most of the movie. I wish I could help her and get her off that spaceship just so I could see the nonsensical plot develop. 3. Matt Damon is awesome and I am disappointed he was tossed in a movie without any purpose other than to extend the movie for no particular reason. 4. Matthew McConaughey apparently believes whispering is an acceptable medium throughout this entire movie. Speak up brother. 5. The bookshelf scene. How does someone fall into a blackhole and become his daughter's bookkeeper? Good grief. 6. Anne Hathaway's haircut. 7. This movie was 169 minutes long. Speed it up a little please. 8. The resolution to this movie wasn't much of a resolution. Matthew McConaughey falls through a blackhole, talks to his daughter through a bookshelf and now everyone lives on Saturn's rings? Boo. I think a better resolution would have been scrapping this movie all together. 9. Why does the robot look like a refrigerator? It is just disappointing. I could tell Christopher Nolan tried pretty hard with this movie, but I don't really see any redeeming quality in it. Even Matt Damon couldn't save it. I'm not a Christopher Nolan doubter. He has made some tremendous work with Inception, but perhaps he needs someone by his side to help extend his ideas a little bit, or maybe try and understand what was going through his brain when he decided to stick Matthew McConaughey in a bookshelf. The real winner here is Matthew McConaughey. For some reason or another Lincoln thought his questionable acting could help boost car sales. Save your money folks.
6.0~Pretty Pictures do not make up for the lack of story craig-340-777546 Sign in Permalink You would think the story is adventurous, exciting, beautiful! Its not at all what I had hoped. It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box. The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before. Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all. The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous. I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be.
10.0~- samraj-846-727232 Sign in Permalink PURE GENIUS. Interstellar kind of movies comes out once in a decade! How perfectly science has been evaluated in the movie and with the amount of correctness. Its just a beautiful movie. Initially watching cooper and murph together all you think that its a regular drama going on with couple pf emotional scenes but then suddenly BOOM its a whole new world out there. Its genius like Christopher Nolan who stretch the ability to think on a public level.There have been many other good sci fic movies but interstellar is the best i have seen so far. Watch it if you're a science lover this movie will surely take you on a interstellar journey beyond you're imagination. So I'm giving it 10 out of 10.
5.0~overrated! kiratoushiro Sign in Permalink it's an OK sci-fi movie, feels like an American nation pride overall. I was quite disappointed with the first time seeing it, it generated quite a buzz at first, but after i watched it like almost 75% finished, i felt very disappointed i couldn't find any amazing thing that was supposed to happened, these kind of things has been done before many-many years ago, i don't really get any element that's supposed to be very cool, or dramatic or spectacular or mind-blowing or revolutionary, we've seen these stuffs before. A truly mind-blowing similar movie that i would recommend everybody to watch is 2001: A space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick it was released in 1968, and my God it was so ahead of it's time, not just the story but the attention to details, the rolling set,the suit/costume looks flawless it makes star wars costume materials look like a very cheap knock-off "plasticky" rubbish. So yeah, it is an okay movie, not mind-blowing. 5 out of 10, oh and i would also recommend Alien 1979. ;)
10.0~Best movie I have seen in my life Patterson13 Sign in Permalink This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.
9.0~Family Movies fredroyer Sign in Permalink I am starting to think Christopher Nolan is making movies specifically for his family. "Inception" was a love letter to his wife, and "Interstellar" is a love letter to his children. You have to pay attention to the secret production names and certain scenes to get the clues but the secret production name of this one was "Flora's Letter" I believe - the name of one of his daughters. And of course, the story - a father trying to save his children and also get back to them. I can overlook a lot of contrivances if I buy into the main idea and I bought into it - who would not sacrifice their own life to save their loved ones? But there are hundreds more ideas being presented here to consider: The idea that "time" is not linear, but overlapping The idea that time is a function of gravity (which is true, actually) The idea that gravity can be used as a technology And most importantly, the idea that the universe will move for love This movie has the best movie robots of all time, better than R2D2 even.
1.0~This movie is so murky I stopped watching it before the Texican Gomer got shot into outer space. Don't waste your time/money on this silly piece of crap! cclark-69-152333 Sign in Permalink Most of Mathew's movies I've seen and have enjoyed all of them - with the exception of this one. As I stated in my summary, it's a murky movie and I couldn't get into it. I never understood the bit about the Predator Drone. How did Cooper control it with his laptop? Did he make it crash? Who owned the thing? How was he able to extract the black box from the Drone and drive off with it. Why didn't someone come after it/ him? He even loaded the Drone onto the back of his old pickup and took it to school with him. Still - no one came after it or him. Why not? I dislike a movie I cannot understand because it makes me feel foolish - which I don't like - would you? The so-called Major League Baseball Game was also confusing. Was that supposed to be the New York Yankees in the field? Ridiculous - I was disgusted. So I quit watching the silly thing.
4.0~Inaccurate, Boring, self-contradictory. ali-aminfar Sign in Permalink While the movie was visually great, and despite the fact I saw the movie in Sydney IMAX theater which is one of the greatest screens in the world, the movie was one of the most boring pictures I have ever seen in my life. To me, it seems that the writers (including Nolan) was heard some shallow aspects of modern physics, relativity, and quantum mechanics, without any understanding and tried hopelessly to visualize them. The result is ridiculous especially using so called "Strings" to make a disruption in time-space, or flying fast through a black hole. I am not a physicist but have the school level understanding of black-holes. TARS was the most inefficient and crippled robot one can ever imagine even with today's standards. and why they did send real persons to another galaxy instead of robots?! Even in our galaxy we send robots for decades to live on MARS before we send a real human. The list can go on and on. While I love 'Inspection' and 'The Dark Knight' and watched each of them more than ten times, I will NEVER go back and watch interstellar again. Even the first time was waste of time and money. PS: Guys PLEASE do not compare it to '2001: a space odyssey'. Kubrick creation is and will remain a masterpiece in sci-fi genre and was and is very accurate and consistent to knowledge and based on Arthur C. Clarke novel.
5.0~Sorry but I march to a different drum. merrywood Sign in Permalink It is not just the impossible science in the script, for example; the fact that a gravity sufficient to slow down time by a factor of 60,000 (one hour equals seven years) would make it impossible to land a ship using our known technology. It would instantly crush the vehicle along with its crew. Not major but contributory, the title itself, "Interstellar" is a misnomer since the lead character travels beyond dimensions, not just between stars. The script begins to fall apart when it is actually less than half way through. By the end, it is out of control and wildly bizarre. The intelligence alluded to as "they" is far too nebulous and ranges into incoherence. A murky plot and the use of often-mumbled tech-babble move it all to the realm of the juvenile scenario. As a literary device, the use of babble instead of coherent language is as silly as Bugs Bunny pulling a large hammer from behind his back, out of nowhere. The scene where Coop finally meets his daughter, Murph, as an old woman was touching, but the casting of the highly recognizable Ellen Burstyn, albeit, a wonderful actor was, however, inappropriate since it tends to destroy suspension of disbelief. Those critics that do not wish it revealed that they do not understand it will give it rave reviews in order to convince others that they do understand it. Some of the audience will go the same way. Such is our contemporary Hollywood scenario.
1.0~please avoid being sucked into this pile of nonsense frogscientist Sign in Permalink Where to start? This movie is so flawed, it is difficult to know which aspect deserves more blame. First the music is actually very annoying. Repetitive and grandiloquent, it gets on the nerve of the listener especially after the first two hours. Second, the characters are completely flat and uninteresting. Their emotions feel mechanical, and the 'bad' characters simply act erratically, as a function of the need of the story. Third, the dialogs are full of platitudes ("love cannot be measured", says the astrophysicist) or outright absurdity ("gravity can travel through time"), and become laughable at times. The worst is clearly the scenario. In addition to Marx brother's physics (relativistic effects without relativistic velocity, 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water), goofy space exploration (you land first and then, you start thinking about what kind of planet it is), the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted. Apparently, a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole. It would have been also good to hire a scenarist that can write a story.
4.0~"Interstellar" Is Big-Budget Disaster andy-66447 Sign in Permalink A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called "Cloud Atlas." Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project. Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar" is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a "wormhole" near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another. The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what "Interstellar" is all about. After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend "Interstellar." But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent "Gravity," "Interstellar" is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters. Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity – and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original "Star Trek" series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior "Gravity" last year, "Interstellar" pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in "2001: A Space Odyssey," Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. "Gravity" was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. "Interstellar" is blaring and assiduous – like a semi-serious "Star Wars" crossed with the garbage science of "Star Trek." "Interstellar" is an old-fashioned Saturday matinée, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. "Interstellar" is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two. And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity.
1.0~Have you ever watched Doctor Who? MrRoci Sign in Permalink Then Interstellar won't be anything new to you. Heck, even if you have watched ANY scifi before, Interstellar wont be anything new to you. I was for a long time told how this movie is groundbreaking, something legendary, something instantly classic... When Interstellar finally arrived to Netflix, I was pumped to see what all the fuss was about. oh, the disappointment. As astronomy and scifi enthusiast, Interstellar brings nothing new to the table. It's like average Doctor Who episode that outstayed its welcome with scenes that took way too long. Whole movie is so incredibly corny! so dumb! it was clearly made for those who have never watched scifi before, it was clearly meant to inspire people into astronomy, but is this the right way to inspire people into something? to make it as cheesy and corny of an adventure as possible? ... One person even said it was "life changing" to them... Now I just feel sorry for them, if this truly was enough to change their lives.... Even if I wasn't hyped to high heavens about this movie, I wouldn't give it higher than 3/10. Interstellar brings nothing never seen before to the scifi scene.
1.0~Giglia in Space on Drugs for Stupid People eraser36-1 Sign in Permalink One of the worst movies ever. Painful. For ridiculously drugged out people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever (take your pick) Overacted, and pretentious. Moronic actors using big words with a total lack of understanding of what they mean. I never want to see Anne Hathaway again... ever. I only want to see McConaughey was even worse, if that is possible. I feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie. I formerly had respect for most of them. Some of the pictures were pretty cool. Too bad the dialog didn't rise to the level of the cinematography, but neither did the storyline. The characters were not fully developed in the story. It was silly.
4.0~A complete waste of time PeterRoeder Sign in Permalink I would agree with the haters on this movie. I love Rustin Cohle and Matt Damon but this movie is a waste of time. God, I hate it so much. It is stupid and shallow. Rustin Cohle and Jason Bourne in the same movie yet they are given stupid lines to say. What an absolute bad movie. Movies like this are really a horrible warning of the horrible and terrible times we live in where insane nonsense rubbish like that is considered quality. What is wrong with Christopher Nolan? Memento is a great movie. The first Batman pretty cool (best Batman movie) although a bit shallow perhaps (vague existentialism like "my actions define me"). Other Batman movies not very good. Inception interesting but ultimately failing and Interstellar interesting but ultimately failing. What kind of audience seriously want to see shitty like that? Compare with my generation who grew up with intelligent and suave sci-fi like 2001 and Blade Runner. And the anti-natalist Rustin Cohle is virtually ridiculed by now playing a stupid natalist. Interstellar is quite simply rubbish. It is trash. It reeks of stupidity and failure.
10.0~2014 Interstellar Odyssey ivanmessimilos Sign in Permalink I will not lie. If you had one year ago asked me ,personally, what is the most anticipated movie of 2014, the answer would be this film. About this film we did not know much, which says a lot about trailers that are now recorded as they have revealed almost the entire movie. In short, our planet Earth is dying and we can save it only through special mission that travels far into space. What is interesting is that the film is based on the theory of relativity and black holes and on film worked physicist Kip Thorne as a producer which gives a weight. The film lasts 169 minutes, which is practically three hours, but not a single minute was not boring. With this film Nolan did what Kubrick done with 2001 Odyssey 1968, he was ahead of his time. I know some will say that the problem is a big difference in technology and budget, but I find it incomparably. Clearly, there are numerous references to Odyssey during the movie and I was pleased when I saw the link, however, Nolan brings something new, something of his own and therefore I consider him a genius. Visually, the film is perfect. When watching it, then you do not see the CGI effects, you actually viewing space! Of course, in this film there is a turnover that perhaps many will not like but I am absolutely thrilled with a twist and the end of the film. It's very ambitious, I admit, it causes you to think and use our gray cells, but is it not that the goal of the film (or should be)? Why do we like movies? Why do we go to the cinemas? I am absolutely delighted with all aspects of the film, starting with the lead actor, story, visual effects, music, plot and ending. I'm not even a little bit disappointed despite great anticipation and so pure a ten from me.
5.0~Over-hyped Fairy Tale mastermind3043 Sign in Permalink The opening of the movie was slow, allowing us to relate to the characters well, but the opening of the plot was too rushed. One second we headed towards the hidden nasa base and moments later we take off into space with hardly any clue of what's happening. What ensues is some pointless footage of space drifting with some mumbo- jumbo thrown in now and then with a lot of emotional drama. The matt damon part was utterly ridiculous and it was painful to watch him trying to pull off a psychopath. At some points the movie was so slow, i was forced to look at my watch. All I have to say about the ending was that, the movie must've been in production for too long and ran out of budget and they'd to complete it in 7 days. Conceptually it is ridiculous, (except maybe the earth part), gravity isn't a supernatural element outside space-time, it is a property of space(matter). The rest of the stuff is too geeky to go into. Direction was average and some of the sections were really annoying like who cares if the corn is torched, i just wanna see the grand adventure and don't spoil it by mixing unrelated events. CGI felt bland even in a 70mm Imax. I mean, dude! this is the space we're talking about, there is no limits to imagination, show us some breathtaking panoramas, some dazzling phenomenons of god's playground. Instead we get some helmets bobbing around in a zero- gravity chamber doling out wisdom to each other. Overall verdict : A space Odyssey is a subject that mankind has dreamed, imagined and pursued for generations and there is a rich plethora of source material to pick up from (if you suck at being original) like Jules Verne, Arthur C Clarke, Carl Sagan. With such a subject, when you throw in a name like Christopher Nolan, the bars are raised really really high. I'm utterly disappointed at how the subject has been ridiculed into a cocky drama while nolan's groupies throng the theatres and ooh-aah and pretend to each other that they understand what's going on. Better luck next time
10.0~What's the Perfect movie ? I finally found the answer wagdynaeem Sign in Permalink For years i wondered what's the perfect movie? is this one in the first place? tonight i knew the answer. it's Interstellar. It's the mind blowing story... Acting as Matthew, Anne, Matt, Michael and Jessica simply rocked the screen. creating one of the most incredible joyful to watch motion picture for a long time. Chris gave back the inspiration factor to movies. he created an idea... a movie about Time... Love... Family... and future that makes you all the time wonder and think what could happened. And after leaving the theater you try to comprehend more of what happened... what it was about and I'm sure you will want to. Bring back Hans Zimmer again as from my option the most brilliant musician of all times to take you in with the music and ravel your emotions and at the end thrills you to watch what's next. this is only Hans and no one else. Visuals are brilliant, Imax is a total worth of a watch and the 160+ minutes are worth your time to get smacked once again by a new vision... a new inspiration.
3.0~One of the worst films of 2014 andydavidsonlee-979-266568 Sign in Permalink Went in to see this film this afternoon and had high hopes. After an hour in I realised that I nearly nodded off twice as the music score playing over the beginning quarter of the film was sleep inducing to say the least. It didn't help that not one of the characters was engaging in anyway possible, especially Matthew McConaughey's drawling southern accent. It seem to take an age for anything to happen in the film, and finally when there was some movement, director Nolan slows everything back down to a snail's pace. I'm not saying the film was ridiculous as it is purely science fiction which I normally enjoy, but this was a challenge for me to stay till the end of the film ,-( two gents in the theatre walked out just over an hour in and never came back), I unfortunately didn't have the hindsight to do the same, otherwise I would have got over three hours of my life back to watch two good films. When the film is released on DVD/BR, I hope they have a cut that last's about 1hour and 20m which should make it an entertaining film without the huge unnecessary spongy filling.
4.0~OK but not great akpunch Sign in Permalink as a fan of Mathew Mc, i thought there were times he was forcing the emotions. the movie starts off OK and gets you interested even with the muddled almost monotone dialogue. the special effects are very good from black holes to giant waves. but if your looking for some cool future planets out in space that might support life - go watch some stargate Atlantis dvds they were more interesting and fun. the ideas are good just falls short . seems the movie industry just doesn't really get it. most of the film is in a space craft with a lot of techno garbo. instead we get 2 desolate planets that we have already seen for the most part (spoiler alert) the top scientist in all of earth gets rescued and he tries to kill the main character .... please, ice planets must be easy to film as I've seen them in starwars, startrek and now this . well you leave feeling a bit cheated, its like Hollywood can get never decide how to end a movie. the dimensional bookcase thing is so far out in theories of quantom physics it kills the movie. the ending was rushed and really lost a chance to do some great story telling! why cant they deliver a really cool planet with flowers and streams and yet some dangers simar to avatar but more a sense of reality to it. actually move humans - really start a new world . interstellar doesn't deliver save your cash!
10.0~The best film I have ever seen fontenlabrador Sign in Permalink All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome.
10.0~**Boom.!.Salam Chris.Nolan....Zakkas film. yash0225-155-90822 Sign in Permalink No words to express the splendidness of this plethora logical dream... Every word, every scene has an meaning and message to tell,..each frame as important as other...if you miss a second.,.you miss the logic. But, the movie so tempting to miss a single frame while in theaters. Superbly executed script, just like previous movies like The Dark knight, Rises, Inception...etc...The quality of his films are improving and taking the legend of film making to the next level. This film also depict the dream of any person/child when he used to gaze the skies and think. Must be Avoided, if you keep your minds at home and never taken physics seriously. . . . . Salute to the great master or art...Chris. Nolan.
2.0~No redeeming features. xaxazak Sign in Permalink I have never been more disappointed with a movie, as I had such high hopes. Many others have gone into the flaws with the story, non-sensical science, and poor dialogue and I generally agree with the harshest of those criticisms. But I'd like to add one that isn't being said much: The film is mostly blurry (a few scenes were sharp so it can't've been the cinema), and whoever maintains the lenses forgot to clean them as there's specks and hairs (again, it can't've been the cinema because they varied between the different scenes). If you see it at an IMAX and have good eyes, this might bug you. In my opinion there's no gain in seeing it on a big screen, as it looks like it was shot last century. Nolan's wrong, film-cameras suck (Just compare the image quality of Interstellar to, say, the Hobbit movies and you can see where movie technology should be heading). Also, this is exactly the genre of movie that looks best in 3D. (And to those who don't like 3D: Just see the 2D version).
7.0~Another Nolan ego trip siderite Sign in Permalink If you are one of those people that thought Inception was a really good movie and it made a whole lot of sense, then stop reading this review; you will not agree with it. Interstellar is a movie that I have been waiting for a long time, ever since they released teasers and trailers and a lot of science blogs started talking about it. I held myself away from such discussions, though, because I wanted to have an open mind when I watched it. My verdict: really well done movie that made absolutely no sense, in any number of dimensions. People said that it was inspiring; if it inspires anyone, that's good, but don't come crying to me when they come back disappointed that they cannot hear the symphonic music and the BWAAAAANG in space, like they expected it. I really don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. It took a mere 15 minutes for me to start gritting my teeth and it only became worse as time went by for the entire three hour length of this space sham. Prepare yourselves for Nolan's attempt at a Space Odyssey 2001, only with more special effects and no understanding of science whatsoever. It hits all the right emotional buttons and, indeed, if you have the intelligence of a dog, you will love this film at the level that they are so loving towards their masters. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in his role, all the supporting actors are great, visual effects are good, even if unnecessarily over the top, all the little details are well taken care of... all except a script that makes any sense beyond "Oh, love, boo hoo!". Bottom line: my head hurts with angry disappointment. I am at fault for expecting so much from this movie. Another eye candy ego trip from a director that thinks too highly of himself.
10.0~Mind blowing! firewalk-155-665385 Sign in Permalink I rarely go to the cinema any more since I have such a good entertainment system at home. I went to see this movie anyways since I didn't want to wait until it came out on blueray. I'm glad I did! There is only one thing to say to describe this movie: Mind blowing! Truly mind blowing! I had high hopes for this movie, and usually when you go in there with high expectations you almost always come out disappointed. That's not the case with this movie! It was actually far better than I had dared to dreamed about! I couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterwards. This movie addresses some important questions. Are humanity going to stay on the earth? Is it safe here? This is a movie about the struggle to survive. But it's so much more! It's action, love, hate and even some comedy. This movie has it all! It lasts for 2 hours and 40 minutes, but not for one moment does it get boring. There are lots of plot twists that really get your imagination going. The movie makes you do some hard thinking. Not only is the movie exiting and entertaining, it's also estethicly pleasing! Breathtaking is the word of choise for some of the sceenes. Not to mention the music which complement the visuals so well. I haven't seen a movie so estethlicly well done since 2001 a space odessy. And that movie was famos for just that. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do it now! This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time!
6.0~Hyped to the stars, but never achieves lift-off... jewboyplaya Sign in Permalink mediocre acting overuse of dialog to explain the back-story and fake/contrived science. It's like whoever wrote the script is some "enlightened meta-philosopher" (RE: psychedelic substance user)with an overgeneralized and topical understanding of astrophysics. Most people that have enjoyment studying astrophysics will be horribly annoyed watching a bunch of actors blabbering and playing "experts"...if you know a little about astrophysics you will find it cringe-worthy. Matthew McConaughey was mis-cast; he doesn't have a believable character in this one...same with Hathaway. They both come across as if they don't even believe the sincerity of their own lines - the dialog is very weird and almost forced at times, especially with bizarre out-of-place technical and/or scientific jargon that would never be brought up among expert colleagues (i.e. Nolan overusing dialog to inform the "dumb" audience about the background "science") It's less of a story, and more of a writer trying to force-feed their own gnarly philosophies to whom they must deem a dull and uninformed audience. It could have been a lot more, but Nolan chose to sit on the fence as far as what type of sci-fi it would be, whether fantastical or "realistic". So where's all the hype from? The liberal media that can't help but interject politics into everything...the idea of an Earth uninhabitable conforms with their world-views about climate change, so they completely overlook the actual film itself. Overall very boring... If you're looking for Star Wars, Star Trek, Serenity, etc...look elsewhere...If you're looking for a recent watchable sci-fi; I'm usually not a fan of Tom Cruise's movies, but his last sci-fi, "Edge of Tomorrow" wasn't half bad...at least better than Oblivion.
10.0~Incredible Movie and story danielvista07 Sign in Permalink I went to the theater with high expectations about this movie and I can say that it is incredible. After watching the movie I was thinking a lot of what I saw on the movie and went to YouTube and found that all you see of the movie are actually theories about space and some other things are real. So feel like an explorer out there in the space. It is indeed a good lesson about space and things that we as humans know so far at this point. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes sci-fi movies and space. I will watch this movie again because I probably missed some details. The music you hear throughout the music is very good and makes you feel that you are in the spaceship.
6.0~Sound is terrible qwe_qwe20101 Sign in Permalink We can't hear the dialogue Whenever they speak I barely can hear what they are saying they have spent too much too make it a great movie and I love almost all Nolan's movies but this one I was trying to enjoy.... great graphics and story line but the sound............. this is probably submitted by hundreds before me but I just want to add my voice to them I read this """Audiences have complained about drowned out dialogue and muffled conversations, with an overbearing soundtrack that obscures major plot points. But what they do not appear to have realized is that they were experiencing the 'impressionistic way' sound was mixed in the movie""" I still don't I wanted to hear them speak sorry
1.0~A simple wish..... pedronutjob-164-115118 Sign in Permalink Dear Santa, Could you please, please, please arrange to make it possible that I never have to sit through another execrable pile of utter garbage that has become the standard level of effluvium Nolan seems to regularly pitch out, all dressed up in it's sparkly Emperors New Clothes? Memento was astonishingly brilliant on a budget of several shillings. Insomnia likewise. Batman Begins was a welcome re-invigoration of a franchise which had previously become something to ridicule. And then came the seriously big budgets. Which exponentially reduced the credibility of any plot. Or story. And here we are at a new cinematic low which worryingly garners this level of praise. Presumably because it has big special effects. Empty. Shallow. Bombastic. Unengaging. Risible. Crap. Oh......and a new train set would be tops!!! Thanks..
3.0~I'm Sorry, But This Was just a Horrible Story polygnotus Sign in Permalink Just horrible. An audience can endure a lot of hardship if there's a seed of hope. And that's really this movie's downfall. It's hopeless. Then it gets even more hopeless. And just when you couldn't think it could be any more hopeless, it gets worse - five more times. It's one thing to create conflict for your characters. But this movie is the equivalent of making a movie about a baseball team, and they lose, fail, die off, lose some more, fail some more, continue losing, and then finally, at the end, for reasons unfathomable, they suddenly win. The bottom line is it was just a downer. A long, tedious, depressing downer. For three hours. And then, in the last 10 minutes of the film, everything's all suddenly better. All of that talent, amazing production, amazing performance, just to tell this horrible, depressing story. As always, I study the faces of people in the theaters, and on the way. There's wasn't a 9 out of 10 face in sight. Everyone I saw looked as tired and fatigued as I must have. And yet we have a IMDb rating of 9.1? Sorry. I don't buy it.
10.0~EPIC With a capital lhaladjian Sign in Permalink Interstellar is excellent piece of work by the man Nolan. I will not say much but one thing i agree with a lot of people is you either love it or you hate it. Don't waste time go and see the movie. All the actors were perfect for their character. What can i say about Zimmer. All i can say is that it was full of emotion, so well done to all. Awaiting for the next big project of which I'm sure will rock. My favorite movie of all time was dark knight however Interstellar joins in front together. I waited for a long time for this movie and it did not disappoint me so it was worth waiting for. I shall go and see the movie again
1.0~interstellar m-delahaye91 Sign in Permalink i had high hopes for this film, I am sorry to say Interstellar was the worst film i have seen in a long time. I have seen many terrible films but none have compelled me to ever write a review of what i thought. There is too many things that make this film and i am not going to rant along here i just wanted to say if i could rate this film 0.1 out of 10 I would. plot holes, complete disregard for science, bad acting, better special effects and spacecraft motion physics have been seen in Thunderbird puppets, storyline has no clue where it is going and many more, i would put this film in children's fantasy category rather than science fiction
5.0~Overrated mix of typical American Hollywood hero and sloppy storyline Highlight_1976 Sign in Permalink I really don't understand what everyone's great fascination is with this movie. There are a couple of good scenes, that are funny and have the right emotional level. There are some twists, that are way too predictable or too easily brushed off. While I used to like McConahey's acting, I think he has been way too over the top with his role in this one. I liked Anne Hathaway in a few of the scenes, as well as the daughter though. Character development is basically non-existent and I was pretty bored multiple times during the movie which left me disconnected to the characters and not caring about the end of the story. I really just hoped it would end at some point. While the science behind it is truly fascinating, the movie is neither outstanding nor is the story. It has potential but is just so underdeveloped.
4.0~Nolan saves capitalism... again. tomchabbat Sign in Permalink Is it me or it feels like Nolan's last movies are all the same ? In Batman, after it created creepy marginals, capitalism get rid of them by a cool white dude with very expensive toys. In Inception, after it created monopolistic conglomerates, capitalism gets a new breeze of free market thanks to a cool white dude with very expensive toys. In Interstellar, after it completely ruined the earth, capitalism is exported to ruin other planets by a cool white dude with very expensive toys. The cool white dude eventually gets some help by willingly exploited minorities (a black, an Asian, a smurfette, and all new in Interstellar : a robot, pretty useful when you want a minority you can just throw away without any regrets after exploiting it) working hard to make this capitalist messiah succeed. Without forgetting the words of wisdom of the old patriarchal white man (mostly Michael Caine). The message is always pretty obvious : to save capitalism, buy big toys and exploit others. Yes I put a spoiler warning on this review : capitalism gets saved.
10.0~This movie made me cry for the first time in 20 years Prometheus4096 Sign in Permalink I can say it is a better Gravity. I can nitpick about a lot of details in this movie. I am sure I remember seeing some plot holes, but I kind of forgot them. If I were to do the math on the relativity, I am sure it won't count up. I suspect this is a movie for males and scientists, though. I don't think I can explain why this movie made me cry to 95% of the people out there, so I won't even try here. In the end it is about how this movie touched me, so I can't give it a 9 or lower. I'd give it a 9.5 if I can because I don't believe in 10's. Can't say this movie had me on the tip of my chair all the way through. Never thought I would rate it this high halfway through the movie. I guess the ending did it for me.
1.0~Boring and depressing film mk-111-770522 Sign in Permalink The story was initially promising, but after mission start of the film had unfortunately many lengths, it would have been better to put this place 2h 3h. The whole film has somehow worked very pieced together ... The SciFi ideas were sometimes quite OK, but not consistent. In Star Trek z. B. the makers have previously carefully considered to create a coherent picture to. In this film, here it creates the rocket spaceship with his ridiculous drive to escape the pull of the black hole ... The special effects were on the level of 90 years ... since I've been hoping for much more. I went because of the extremely good reviews on IMDb in this film and am just disappointed ...
1.0~Don't waste three hours on this - It's totally boring! hustler58 Sign in Permalink I must echo the sentiments of many of the other negative reviewers. The movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters. I felt nothing for the characters, and I REALLY wanted to. There were a few moments when I was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements, but nobody/nothing got spaghetta-fied (Neil DeGrasse Tyson's description/term). It is really a love story disguised as a sci-fi fantasy. And not even a very good love story. I was so bored, I fell asleep for about 15 minutes. I felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but I thought maybe if I stayed it would get better. It didn't. I really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better. They tried but it didn't help. Can I get my money back? How many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? They could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this country.
6.0~Gone To Earth writers_reign Sign in Permalink I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.
6.0~Stunning Visuals stephensims53 Sign in Permalink As in the summary I thought the visuals were stunning..but the story was left wanting. I came back this afternoon from watching this movie with more questions than answers erg how can they create a space craft that can go into the depths of space pass through a worm hole and land on different planets etc yet the craft looks like it had just come from Steptoes junk yard.. In the film Michale Caine starts off looking like hes well into his seventies and yet 23yrs later the only change in him is hes in a wheel chair. Most of the films I go and watch at the cinema I watch a second time on DVD because I know I've missed something at my first viewing, But I wont be bothering to rent Intersteller.. On the whole a very disappointing 3 hour viewing, I expected a lot more
4.0~More Mind Than Matter cultfilmfreaksdotcom Sign in Permalink At one point during INTERSTELLAR, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper is being told that a fifth-dimensional being is trying to logically communicate something to three-dimensional humans, and a mindblown Cooper says aloud that he still doesn't get it: So this time around, writer/director Christopher Nolan outsmarts and outfoxes both his audience and main character... Although there is a fair share of down-home simplicity... A tale about a rural farmer, longing for a purpose in life and who ends up in the far reaches of space, might seem a tad familiar... And just as we get to know Cooper and his children – living on an Earth devastated by ferocious dust storms – he alone winds up soaring to the mysterious heavens. For a three-hour film, it's a surprise that any aspect could be "too rushed." Yet the amount of time our potential hero goes from the ground to the sky is as quick as a few instructive paragraphs spouted by the chief NASA scientist (Michael Caine). While super-intelligence is essential in any genuine sci-fi flick, and wormholes and black holes are always an intriguing premise, there's so much explaining and anticipating what needs to be done that surprisingly, very little actually happens. These intrepid voyagers, including Anne Hathaway's straight-laced Amelia and a sarcastic robot, experience some extremely close calls and a tremendous amount of docking and spinning, but no real adventure. And whether in space or back on a future Earth two stories fusing into a M. Night Shyamalan style twist there's no one to completely root for except McConaughey, who can make any character likable. Christopher Nolan's power can't be denied: His DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY created an immense fan base nearly equaling the nostalgic likes of Spielberg, Lucas, Kubrick or any iconic director you choose But his ambitiously epic INTERSTELLAR both overreaches and overwhelms Not just the audience and characters, but the genre itself: With so many complicated instructions we hardly see the damn thing work!
4.0~Wreck of a movie, hard to find anything good about it robybaggio18 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess. His anger actually makes sense, who wouldn't be frustrated with a plot like this? I believe a big portion of estimated 165 million dollar budget went into paid reviews here on IMDb.
2.0~Proof that Nolan is detached from his characters. MikeWrites2020 Sign in Permalink Interstellar, while visually stunning, is one of the most flawed films in recent memory. Flawed, because more time was spent rendering out the special effects than developing a screenplay worthy of the cast and budget. When you're a filmmaker who can make anything you want - on film - there is no excuse for your films to at-least bring something new to the table and work at a basic screenplay level. Interstellar does not ask new questions and with a script that literally feels like a first draft --I'm just shocked that Nolan didn't develop this more. The entire core of this film is the relationship between our lead Cooper and his daughter - but this is so rushed and honestly, extremely cheesy, that we don't care what happens. They spend far too much in time in space - with a ridiculous plot involving Matt Damon - and cut back to Earth is sporadic cuts that pull us into so many directions. This film proves that the Nolan brothers can not handle a couple of things: writing females and writing emotional characters that we're attached to. The dialogue was laughable - over the top in many places - and basically just a ton of one-liners. We cut from Cooper learning he has to go to space - says goodbye - boom on the rocket - NO ATTACHMENT. There is zero development here - just get him to space, which fails to tell the core story well - which bites this movie in its ass in the third act. Forced. Rushed. However you want to put it - I'm sorry folks - it's not a great movie - not even a good one. Everything is spoon fed to the audience - no, not just the science - the twists - I didn't know on the nose screen writing was so acceptable in Hollywood - guess it is. They talk about ghosts so many times within the first act that anyone with half a brain KNEW there was something there - and if you know anything about space travel, black holes - or any of the stuff that is talked about in the trailers - can put two and two together and call the major twist in the FIRST ACT. Come on Nolan, you can do better.
1.0~What happens when you have a fantastic idea and have no idea how to end it? bradly-26268 Sign in Permalink This movie, that's what. For the first 2.5 hours, it's easily a ten star movie. Then it feels like Nolan had no idea how to end it, so he kind of makes something up on the spot, but knowing that it's a load of crap, he makes it as complicated as possible in an attempt to distract the viewer from how awful the ending truly is. Just terrible. I feel robbed of a good ending, and I will go to bed tonight grumpy because of this movie. It had a chance to be one of the best movies ever made (and I do not say that lightly), but instead it flopped harder than any movie I've seen before. Honestly, it's how good it started that makes this so disappointing. Thoroughly, undeniably disappointing. I mean, he really had something here. It could have been so great. In summary, don't get your hopes up, or prepare yourself for nonsensical tomfoolery.
6.0~In space nobody can hear you yawn paulhartley22 Sign in Permalink I went into this movie knowing little about it, no plot details, or even whether christopher nolan was director or just a producer. I have enjoyed nolans previous movies, but i don't care who is behind the camera aslong as the film is serving it's purpose which is to entertain. So half an hour goes by, the tone is set. There is a crisis with the crops,earth is running out of food, a lot of dust, no explanation for any of it, just accept it. the film is pretty humourless and lot of mumbling about nothing interesting in particular from the lead..he's an ex nasa pilot who has a farm...sits on the porch drinking a beer and gets philosophical with john lythgow ...more mumbling. Struggling to stay awake. Okay so the next act things pick up, we have loud launch into space, I'm awake again. Then silence, after all that's whats space is like y'know. Can now hear people munching popcorn. Too quiet. Oh look huge water planet, vast and empty much like this film so far. Huge wave comes.Ah some entertainment at last, clunky robot runs around... then Matt damon ! the last act, blackholes and then there is an semi interesting twist to earlier events. This was a frustrating film, had a lot of potential with the story but on an entertaining and thought provoking level it doesn't get there. It starts and stalls. Did anyone really care about the characters? i certainly didn't invest. Obviously some people love it with the scores on here but i cannot agree. This is not a masterpiece in sci-fi by any means. There are comparisons to 2001 but don't even go there.I actually looked at my watch towards the end of the film to see how long I'd been trapped in this cinematic black hole.
2.0~Disappointed alsdouble Sign in Permalink Way too long, a bizarre story line made worse by a backing track that made me reach for the volume control very very often. Mute even, many many times. Whoever wrote the score, they tortured me for 2 hours plus. I stuck with it, endured it. The inter-dimensional library scenes verged on the ridiculous, and cylinder world at the end was right from Arthur C Clarke and way too small to be convincing.
5.0~Approved by science - not ms-52486 Sign in Permalink This film claims that it was produced with the help of astrophysicist Kip Thorne. Without understanding how a feature film could benefit by being scientifically correct, I became curious. According to an astrophysics website, the event horizon is "A one-way boundary in space-time surrounding a black hole. Any matter or light that falls through the event horizon of a black hole can never leave, and any event inside the event horizon cannot affect an outside observer." So far, so good. Let's see what Nolan and Thorne did with this. After watching the trailer, I expected a family melodrama with a lot of tearful goodbyes, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the clichés are there, including the obnoxious breakfast table scene, but it's all rather low key. The vision of our planet that is morphing into a giant dust ball is gloomy and apocalyptic, the visuals are rather restrained, there is no cheap razzle-dazzle. The movie seems to build up to something quite serious. Unfortunately, the plot is a bit hard to believe at times. Need an example? Here you go: Cooper, the corn farmer, without further ado, is chosen to be the pilot and leader of the space mission that must secure the survival of the human species. It's true: he just stumbles into the base and the head scientist of the decision making committee asks whether he would like to fly their spacecraft. Conveniently, the craft is docked right next to their conference table. The middle part the film develops those central themes that made me watch it in the first place, which is the relativity of time during interstellar travels and the loneliness of man in outer space. According to what we learn from the conversations in the movie, an astronaut can completely miss out on events, because a minute that he spends in his spaceship can equal to an entire month or more on his home planet. Should this ever become a real issue for mankind on it's search for new planets, then it must inevitably lead to stories that would have their match in old Greek tragedies. Together with the stunning visuals, this represented the strongest and most plausible chapter in Interstellar for me. I was ready to go all the way with those explorers. But then they went for the happy ending. The last part of the film ruins everything. It is now confirmed that Hollywood is willing to bend space and time in order to get what they want, which is usually the resurrection from death. In order to understand how little they cared about scientific accuracy, one would have to remember the statement from the astrophysics website I noted above. Not only does Cooper communicate with his daughter from inside the black hole, he also manages to escape it without a scratch and – reunite with his daughter. Astrophysics are turned upside down and our brains go into hibernation. There is no room for interpretation or imagination, because Interstellar spoon feeds us the final scenes. When the movie ended, I felt suffocated and out of touch with reality. Maybe never before have I felt so sharply the contrast between a blockbuster and a film that has enough trust in it's own audience to let them form their own thoughts. 5/10
1.0~Don't waste your time RSpanish Sign in Permalink Earth is overpopulated and plants are dying from drought, dust is everywhere and starting to be a problem. This is all what we were told by a movie, everything that we should know (they think). So instead of trying to solve these problems by inventing new food forms, by ocean water demineralization or just soft decreasing of population to numbers Earth can sustain best minds came up with ingenious plan - go through suddenly discovered wormhole and see what happens. Instead of sending drones they sent bunch of people through to a no-return mission, three having reported of habitable planet each. It is when things started to become interesting. NASA picks up some random guy pilot (McConaughey) to lead mission to these three planets, all of them coincidentally in the same system, orbiting a black hole. COME ON, three planets orbiting a black hole? If you want to live here, you might be insane. However, in a retarded fashion he decides to leave his young daughter on dying earth to pursue his all-life-mission. Some more absurd plot decision happens when he then decide to land planet with such twisted space-time (because it is near blackhole, remember - we are watching movie pretending to make sense scientifically) that it has time accelerated 60000 times comparing to earth. Nothing very interesting happens next, three non-essential persons just die, Matt Damon being one of them by going nuts for absolutely no reason. In the end McConaughey diving into a black hole (finally making sense sequence) leaving only one woman in a mission (Hathaway) to land a planet she wanted first were her supposed lover landed previously. And while soundtrack plays loudly to draw attention from following absurd plot twist, main hero spends 60 years in another dimension translating quantum equations to his daughter on Earth which will solve all problems and allow six billions people to escape. By the way all these years everyone was just waiting, absolutely no one bothered to send more expeditions so busy they were all solving Einstein equations. Why so silly? With so many numerous big and small plot holes this can't be serious movie. Main hero acting like a retard (or actually he is), his daughter soon-big-girl solving biggest scientific problem in history, two absolutely useless crew members with funny robot as a company and a woman supposed to be main-hero's girlfriend, a lier as main scientist and a bunch of another useless people. Even CGI can not save the day. We were told that black hole CGI supposed to be most realistic than ever, but it was pictured in roughly 1.5 scenes at best. Soundtrack is fine, but it is played so loudly, in disharmony with deep space atmosphere and in some scenes being unnecessary as well. So what we have in the end? It just looked like they tried to make big, really BIG move about space travel and physic phenomenons, but somehow missed big picture and not really payed attention to the details, ignoring common sense which eventually led to a failure. Sadly, good opportunity to create such movie in the uncharted territory was wasted
3.0~Stanley Kubrick can rest easy . . . antonydwhitehead Sign in Permalink After a long drawn-out establishing sequence on our trashed home planet Cooper and young Murph (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy) follow a mysterious trail to a secret NASA lab where a last ditch mission to a wormhole to save humankind is revealed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) for which Cooper is implausibly selected to pilot. This section is reasonably authentic: conventional rocket stages and a shuttle-like capsule which then docks with a larger vessel capable of achieving artificial gravity through centrifugal force to take them on the two year mission to Saturn. But from then on the science and the script become increasingly fantastical; whether in the high energy environment near Saturn, or (later) falling into a black hole our plucky astronauts absolutely need not fear radiation. The formula for the rocket fuel must be worth a fortune: after the initial conventional launch the landing and taking off from large Earth sized planets is achieved miraculously with small shuttles, so why the staged launch vehicle was needed is a mystery. The initial two year trajectory from Earth to Saturn and the wormhole does not then restrict the spaceship suddenly changing course and having a quick fly round the wormhole: the laws of celestial mechanics initially adopted are suddenly thrown out the window! Communication (which is essential in the script to move the plot forward) is also maintained somehow through the wormhole and back to Earth. The three planets themselves fall into formulaic categories of water world, ice planet, and (at the end) desert planet, and whilst some have oxygen whether there are plants or living organisms producing the oxygen is not made clear. The sexy black hole Gargantua gets lots of attention, but the star(s) at the heart of the system are forgotten about. Despite data from earlier probes dispatched through the wormhole the astronauts seem to know next to nothing about the planetary conditions (again essential for the script) but somehow arrive exactly where the early expeditions landed (or crashed). It seems the script is as twisty as the wormhole! Throughout this movie there is absolutely no sense of any rudimentary astronomical comprehension and so despite the painfully thin gloss of authenticity we are basically in Star Trek space fantasy land: anyone seeing this movie expecting verisimilitude will feel they have been very cleverly conned. The derivative concept boils down to one part 2001 A Space Odyssey to one part Contact with a liberal dollop of Gravity (space docking / disasters etc). The art design is in itself curious: the clunky robots seem to be wilfully jointed variants of the monoliths from 2001, the cheap and nasty space suits (intentionally?) retro NASA, the hibernation pods that sink dramatically into the floor (why?) part 2001 part Alien. Overlaying the woefully dodgy science is a powered-up emotion plot line that at times is intensely annoying and hugely implausible: for example when one of the astronauts drowns on the water world all the attention is on Cooper missing his family; their dead colleague with whom they have been cooped up in the spaceship for years is immediately forgotten, and when they return to the mother ship the fact the remaining astronaut has been waiting for 20 years gets little plot attention: more wormholes in the aim-to-crowd-please script? This mid-film emphasis on Cooper and his family is massively self indulgent and McConaughey's character becomes very irritating. . Throughout Hans Zimmer's score provides a high decibel level of aural dampening to divert the brain from these trivial inconsistencies or when the plot or painful dialogue starts to sag; whilst Brand (Anne Hathaway) provides cute. Those parts of the script that are discernible through the thundering score are lightweight, tedious, and overworked. So what do we learn if we retrospectively compare the three movies: 2001, Contact, and Interstellar: in hindsight 2001 can now be seen to represent a triumph of direction and cinematography, thoughtful intelligent script, a sound science base bound together in beauty and imagination; in contrast Contact it seems is already exhibiting the growth of emo in science fiction movies (epitomised by the self indulgence offered its star Jodie Foster), though this is contained within a reasonably plausible and scientifically based script, but oh dear when we look at Interstellar doesn't this movie says something rather awful about the sloppy crowd pleasing filmic times we live in, with the massed forces of technical wizardry and editing coupled with that all pervasive score to dull our dissent. Stanley Kubrick can rest easy; despite the hype Interstellar is not going to knock 2001 of its stellar perch. Overblown, over-hyped, corny, unscientific, implausible, Interstellar fails majestically as great cinema. Meanwhile 2001 like the very best sci-fi is subversive, it has edge - even satire, it transcends genres, it asks us the audience to think, and it exposes the brutality of the human condition. Where it is optimistic this optimism is undercut ambiguously, and it has profound things to say about humankind's place in the universe. Interstellar meanwhile, whilst for sure its sugary effect lingers cloyingly in the brain after leaving the cinema, is a mere annoying dust mote in the eye of space cinema.
5.0~Scores on effects, fails on narrative! ssvikas Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is known to experiment, such as the the non-linear narrative of 'Memento' and well written characters in 'The Dark Knight'. A director of his caliber also made the disappointing pseudo- intellectual 'Inception'. Sadly, 'Interstellar' too comes across as a let-down of sorts, despite interesting science. 'Interstellar' has all the ingredients of a typical space sci-fi film: spacecraft, wormholes, stasis, strange planets, time travel, a black hole, robots running on artificial intelligence, father-daughter drama, etc., in the background of a dying Earth. While these concepts aren't new to Hollywood, the big budget allowed for the visual spectacle. Still, it is marred by choppy narrative, clichéd dialog and poorly developed characters that we hardly care about. Set in unspecified future, Earth's capacity to sustain life has diminished; crops are dying and there are dust storms. Agriculture takes precedence over everything. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test pilot turned farmer. A widowed Cooper lives with his father in law and children Tom and Murph. An inquisitive young Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is obsessed with the idea of a ghost in her bedroom and is always trying to decode signs. As it turns out, the signs are coordinates to a hidden space station of NASA, headed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), in search of life sustaining planets so as to evacuate Earth. Predictably, our hero, Cooper is the only man who can pilot the mission to outer space, beyond our galaxy accessed through a wormhole. Damn, a trespasser at a hidden space station is suddenly asked to commandeer a spaceflight without any serious briefing or training! Joining Cooper on the mission are Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and two other scientists that are expendable. Their mission is finding three of the ten manned probes that went through the portal earlier and have reported seemingly positive findings. Again, don't ask why manned missions when they had advanced AI robots like TARS and CASE? That brings us to the existential question: why a manned follow-up mission, huh? The overarching premise behind the mission is that certain benevolent 'beings' have opened up a wormhole and left clues through gravity- based anomalies. The aging professor has been working on a mathematical model to evacuate Earth. The model fails since it needs data from a gravitational singularity, where space and time can be bent. If Plan- A, to evacuate fails, Plan-B to populate extraterrestrial planets with genetic samples humans. Unbeknownst to the fatality of Plan-A, the crew continues to explore planets. One Planet has time distorted to a level where an hour on it equals seven years on earth. The planet doesn't make the cut due to its shallow waters and gigantic waves. The second is an icy planet with ice-clouds (filmed in Iceland) and a crazed explorer (Matt Damon) who tries to kill Cooper so that he can execute plan B at the third planet, Miller; Result: needless drama. As with every movie involving vehicles, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, fuel shortage and damage to the craft and the need for Singularity data are key plot elements towards the climax. Apropos, they need to slingshot past the black hole to the third planet which Amelia bets on, as her loved one went there during the original Lazarus project. Oh, a movie is so incomplete without a love angle! Glad there wasn't any romance between Cooper and Ameila. And then, our hero, Cooper dives into the event horizon of the beautifully depicted super-massive black hole and reaches singularity. But what is this singularity? Just like the limbo being linked to Cobb's dreams in 'Inception', the singularity in 'Interstellar' is actually a four dimensional tesseract presenting a single location to Cooper at various points in time. And the location? You guessed it: Murph's bedroom. How convenient! So, who's the ghost in Murph's life? Cooper! And the 'beings'? Cooper again! He opened up the wormhole near Saturn that took him through the same spot half a century later. Doesn't this create an inconsistent causal loop just like 'Grandfather Paradox' or a chicken going back in time and laying an egg that it is born out of? But then, an average moviegoer doesn't care as long as there are spectacular sights and happy endings! 'Interstellar' is lengthy and tiresome, narrative is patchy and has excessive inter-cuts during crucial scenes. Spoiling experience further is the jarring and ominously heavy background score by Hans Zimmer that muffles out dialog. Acting is just passable: McConaughey is hardly a fit, Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is decent as the scientist and Michel Caine seems to be having his fourth outing with the director. Nolan's fiction works for audiences who believe they enjoy intelligent films, but actually watch them without thought or logic. As contradictory as it sounds, truth is stranger than fiction. Nolan's 'Inception' was full of plot holes, irrespective of whether it was deliberate or inept storytelling. Usually, a good narrative should have a logical end, except that it is Nolan and he likes keeping things ambiguous. I haven't come across anyone who understood 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' fully, despite claiming that they loved it. About the science in 'Interstellar', Nolan found played it safe by bringing a scientist on board, Kip Thore, as a consultant and executive producer. This would've surely had an impact on the depiction of a spinning black hole and other stuff like the four- dimensional tesseract within the event horizon, boxy but versatile AI robots, etc. Nonetheless, I'm still amazed at how an astronaut can dive into a black hole and come out totally unhurt!! If anything, Christopher Nolan must be admired for dreaming big. Sadly, this movie is a waste of a great concept turned into an average movie that sells only the basis of special effects bankrolled by a big budget. While die-hard Nolan fans would rave over this, discerning movie connoisseurs won't appreciate the poor storytelling.
5.0~Finally, Nolan's full potential as a "filmmaker" has been realized... TheTrthHrts Sign in Permalink Contrary to what some other reviewers have stated, I believe that this film has *finally* fully realized *every bit* of Nolan's potential as a filmmaker: it's the ultimate pseudointellectual-targeted hack job (created by he who will be remembered as a "hack," in time--perhaps the most overrated director in all of film's history). Despite Nolan's prior efforts to make the most visually numbing, emotionally devoid, utterly mindless "spectacles" as possible (in the name of box office returns, and in turn, stuffed pockets), there was always something missing: "science." Oh, yes; nothing draws the pseudointellectual like discussion of "science," "physics," and "astronomy." It matters not that the "science," as demonstrated by so many other reviewers here, is totally bogus, in this case; what matters is that the Nolan cultist believes that he finally has a valid defense: the movie is so "scientific" and "intellectual" that the "average person" "couldn't possibly understand the movie." If there's nothing of intellectual value to "understand," in fact, then this is the issue--not an inability to comprehend what simply isn't present. "...but he had Kip Winger (whoever) help write the script--and he's a genius!" That may be true, but the target audience here isn't scientists--it's you. Joe Average. Mr. 100 IQ. Mr. "I think I'm smarter than I am, and must try to convince others of this by stating that Nolan's films are the work of a genius." The film was written, quite simply, to confuse you and your mainstream film-going friends into submission. Let's talk about casting. Matthew Mc-Con-ah-hey (I don't care how his name is spelled)--as an engineer. An engineer--formerly employed by NASA, of all agencies that employ engineers! Throughout the entire duration of the film (not unlike his have-to-be-intentionally-pretentious Lincoln commercials), he plays Matthew Mc-Con-a-hey. To clarify, at no point in this film does he not appear to be under the influence of a certain substance that precludes truly intellectual thought, much less "engineering." No. Caine: his presence, while not unexpected within a Nolan film, wasn't unexpected within a Nolan film. Catwoman: same story (to a lesser, newer, more unwelcome extent). Next, we have has-beens and never-weres like Bentley, Grace, Affleck, in obvious "help me--I'll work for free" supporting roles that do nothing but provide another source of ridicule (and let's not even talk about Damon--"Matt Damon...," who was out of place and nearly ridiculous, here). Kudos for including Oyelowo, though he should have been the star of the film; thus, the engineer (as opposed to a hillbilly well known for gaining fame via rom-coms)--perhaps you could make this happen with your next failed effort to replicate much better films. Tarantino (a true genius, with an Einstonian IQ of ~160--so likely fifty points higher than Nolan's) has the power to turn around dying careers by including them within "worthwhile" films that gain attention and respect because they're "worthwhile" (as opposed to cattle feed designed to rake in dollars using "intellectual" and "class" appeal as just-thick-enough veils to herd in the narcissistic masses). Anyway, it may well be the case that, Mr. Lucidity excluded, these are the only actors whose status has fallen so low that only they are willing to play along with the charade that Nolan's dialogue has become since "Dark Batman, the First (unbelievably, not the worst)?" (Liked Memento and Insomia.) Moderately visually impressive (though a far cry from "2001," the truly spectacular film that this sorry effort tries so desperately, yet clearly fails, to aspire to match on some level), Interstellar is just another vapid "spectacle" that will bore anyone of true intelligence to tears within its first overlong half. There's simply nothing else to say about this failed (or highly successful) effort, most unfortunately, except that it should be avoided at nearly all costs if something truly intellectually stimulating (see: won't put you to sleep) is what you're after. Oh, and please provide Zimmer with a double-dose of Valium during the writing process, going forward.
1.0~I fell asleep... fsxprod Sign in Permalink This is the first time that I went to the cinema and fell asleep. Firtly the trailers presented on TV and internet were very short and almost no images of the real movie. I noticed that it was an uncommon movie with more than 2 hours, but still I could left whenever I want. The first hour of the movie until the cinema break: I see a house, open field, and hear about ghosts. Suddenly after the break, they are on the space. Traveling and traveling, going through things that we can only expeculate about, travel to the 5th dimension and visit some worlds where the time passes differently. They are trying to find a planet to replace earth, but they aren't being so successful and are having trouble getting out. They say they are being called by someone on space (ET?) but at the end we find out its just humans that went to another dimmension and were able to change time to send messages through gravity. When I go to a movie I usually don't care about science, because it is all bogous, but THIS movie tries to use all possible theories to make their history possible. But they failed. Only lovers of Discovery Channel will like this movie because of "theories". Technicall opinnion: -Music: 2/10. Hans Zimmer did this? I can't believe. I just remember a piano playing fast. I would love to be paid to make ambient music like that. Anyone can. -SFX: 3/10. Unbelievable (yes, really Unbelievable), Circles with textures and dots at the background? I worked on 3D animations and I would never do something that bad. -Sound: 9/10. Yes the sound design was good. Very original cuts of sound in space. -Acting: 5/10. Too much emotions for a movie so poor. The result: Don't remember quite, I was sleeping. I just heard the sounds of them trying to get back home. I wook up when the father watches her daughter (+50 years older than him) dying. What I got from the movie: an headache and remeembered how important life is and how good the human race is (really?). This is the second movie from Legendary Pictures I saw and say to myself: I just spend 8$ on this? Yes, I will never see one movie from this director again.
4.0~Starts off well but goes rapidly downhill BigRichAU Sign in Permalink As this movie begins we are asked to contemplate a world in which today's dire warnings of food shortage and unsustainability are proved to be correct. This is a gripping and sobering premise for setting up a post-apocalyptic scenario and engaged me for a while. With hindsight, even at this early stage there were hints of the nonsense that was to follow. The high-speed chase, where a pick-up with a blown-out tire somehow manages to drive at top speed through cornfields without suffering any further damage, while Pop ensnares a semi-autonomous drone with his Dell laptop, is but the most glaring example. As the movie wore on, it became increasingly confused and nonsensical. Getting to Saturn was vaguely within the realm of the credible. The description of why the wormhole was spherical was pure comic genius. The 2-D representation whipped up by our friend has a round hole, we are told, so the 3-D version must be spherical. But what if he had used a pen with a square cross-section to make his point? Would the wormhole have been cuboid? Once they passed the wormhole, most principles of long-distance space travel seemed to be forgotten. The ability to hop from planet to planet, for some reason able to magically take off and leave orbit without the Saturn-V style craft or anti- gravity equations that would be required on earth, was nonsense. The plausibility of a habitable planet so close to a black hole seems dubious to me. And the final quasi-spooky drivel inside the black hole where some future humanity had gone to all that effort just to provide our hero with a totally lame-ass way of communicating... just sheer rubbish. It could have been so much better.
5.0~Chris Nolan impresses with magnificent visuals and a stellar cast, but not the script, in Interstellar quazi-munira Sign in Permalink Chris Nolan impresses with magnificent visuals and a stellar cast, but not the script, in Interstellar Munira Rahman, from Hong Kong Interstellar is about the journey of a group of explorers to find a liveable place beyond our solar system to save the mankind from extinction due to extreme weather conditions and food shortage on earth. Mathew McConaughey plays the role of Cooper, a father of two, who used to be a pilot. He comes across a mission to search for liveable place to set up a human colony in a different solar system, as the earth's resources will be depleted within a generation or two. For the sake of the human race, he agrees to join the mission as a pilot and leaves behind his family, never knowing the exact date of return. His daughter, Murph, grows up to become a scientist too and works with Dr. Brand, the key brain behind this mission. Cooper, along with Dr. Brand's daughter – played by Anne Hathaway - hops from planet to planet to work on their plan. Overall, the film is impressive, in terms of visual effect and background music. The stellar star cast is definitely a strong point of this film. However, the weakest part of the film is its weak and often incoherent script. There are some big loopholes in the plot – something even the average movie buff will not expect from a big name like Christopher Nolan. The ease with which Cooper finds out about the mission and secret Nasa facility is hardly credible – anyone would find it difficult to digest that it was supposed to be the best kept secret of the US government. From then onwards, everything seems very rushed. He quickly leaves his family and joins as the pilot without really getting any training and briefing. And it really isn't comprehensible that why would the US government spend so much money on something where they don't even have any idea if the pilot would be ready to join them or not? Inside the spacecraft, it is kind of funny how Dr. Romilly explains to Miller the wormhole with a piece of paper and pen. You expect the pilot of such an important mission to be more knowledgeable than that for sure. He is on a space mission, and he doesn't understand black-holes? Bemusing. And when Anne Hathaway insists on following the heart when deciding where to land using their limited resources and fast depleting and fuel because "love can transcend all", it really becomes cheesy and mediocre. They land on different planets and have no idea about the conditions out there that is strange given that their spacecraft is powerful enough to pass through a wormhole, but why wouldn't it be equipped with systems to monitor the outside parameters? All's well that ends well, and Nolan does give us a happy ending with Cooper passing the algorithm of gravity-space-time to his daughter through Mors codes, from a multi-dimensional space. The human race is saved. And Cooper wakes up in a space station – a colony of humans – orbiting around the Saturn. And then, not unexpectedly given the rest of the film, we get another baffling scenario. Cooper hops onto a spacecraft to find and save Anne Hathaway. He doesn't need to talk to anyone, doesn't need any authorisation, and he simply flies the craft when the audience wasn't sure how and when he learnt to pilot it. Even funnier is the immediate aftermath when an administrator of the space station discovers a ship missing, and looks surprised. I felt that the director was under some pressure to make another epic and in the process he really didn't pay much attention to the editing. It is almost a three-hour long film with many unnecessary scenes, which could have easily been edited in order to make the film crisper and more compact. The first half is really slow and the film takes a long time to pick up pace. There are many twists and turns, which never really become very captivating. The main cast did a good job in whatever role they were given. Overall, it's a watchable film, but nothing great.
3.0~Interstellar is too long, confusing and has loud music windjammer6644 Sign in Permalink This review is negative. Sorry, but as much as I like sci-fi I could not like this movie except for a little. The back and forth scenes between the farm and space and the concept of the black hole is confusing to me and my wife (who is not a fan of sci-fi but watched it with me anyway). The biggest negative is the loudness of the music which over-rode the actors voices so that neither my wife or I could hardly understand what the actors were saying. Matthew McConaughey seems to speak in a whisper anyway. We did like the actors who played in the movie but again the loudness of the music detracted immensely from the enjoyment of seeing it.
10.0~Simply Brilliant goel1992 Sign in Permalink I am writing this to just say if you love science and space this is the movie to go watch before you die. I am simply enthralled and it is as I always like my entertainment to be, start slowly, gradually build up and bam like an orgasm it ends. It is one of the finest movies made in the history. But as many people who went with me couldn't comprehend the sheer genius of the filmmaker and the space time complexity so if you are one of them that don't want to understand and just want something happening that doesn't utilize your neurons then I guess don't watch it. To say the least, if I were a girl I would let Nolans' brain do it with me any time.
6.0~I aged 23 years watching this movie kingpickle12 Sign in Permalink Interesting in parts, but I aged 23 years watching it. Derivative of many other films including Contact, 2001, Forbidden Planet, Signs and most egregiously North by Northwest. Worst score in recent memory. Also, some of the special effects are pretty lame--all too obvious when models are being used. Gravity was much more visually arresting. Way too many close up horror expressions. The universe is supposed to be filled by interstellar gas, which must be true, given so much gassy dialog. Nolan manages to work in the Do Not Go Gently Into That Good night poem not once, but four times (look for the last time on a plague at the end.
10.0~This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. Christopher Nolan is a genius cosmo_tiger Sign in Permalink "We're still pioneers. We've barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us." Mankind has finally used up all of Earth's resources and it has become a dying planet. When Cooper (McConaughey) and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of NASA they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. Cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. I have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part I have found it easy to talk about every movie. This one I can't seem to find the right words for. The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius. I easily give this an A+
1.0~This is disaster of movie! It does not help that Matthew act in it! draskaddd93 Sign in Permalink Well,where should I start,it's really bad,bad,BAD story. First of all,I have feeling that they didn't invest enough money for movie set,its kinda poor. People who watched this movie with me,are also disappointed because of the story and set. Also they use some science facts that are not truth,that facts are not even combined right,there are lot of holes in their screenplay. I struggled to stay awake. Honestly for me this is the worst movie in history,with no future.The idea of this movie is good,but they didn't achieved that. I don't know,Iam not an expert for commenting but my point is that this movie is not even worth to watch it,honestly I don't give it a chance. So it on you people.
1.0~Worst movie I have ever seen vrhproductions Sign in Permalink Just don't watch it, the movie has plot that has been in some muddle pud for a 3 hours, star trek hologram episodes have more sense than this movie. It's an 3 hour cryfest, no sense, its not even visually good...ugh I want my time back. One of the worst movies ever definitely and anyone who says different is lying himself then you. This movie has more holes than Swiss cheese, even Prometheus has more logic than this. Not to mention those "ghost whisperer" scenes, holy god that is so boring. Drama is expected every 5 minutes...every 5 minutes somebody cries. There is 5 minutes of action, everything else is just explosion noise and crying and crying and crying and crying. Just plain horrible. Mormons have more logic than this movie.
10.0~Experience of a lifetime katherinethewhovian Sign in Permalink I'm slowly losing count of how many times I've seen this movie. It was.....filled with pure emotion. It feels real because this could happen to Earth one day, considering we're not making too much progress on protecting it and it might just turn on us one day. The acting is brilliant, the dialogues are well thought through, the visuals are beyond stunning and LOVE GOES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME. There wasn't a time where this movie didn't make me cry. Even if I know what will happen I simply can't help it. It's just one of those movies. It leaves me in a totally another dimension. Even if you don't like sci-fi this movie cannot leave you emotionless. I can confidently say this is my favourite, and I've watched a lot of movies. A masterpiece. Thank you Nolan, thank you for this.
1.0~The Worst Ever notamoviefan Sign in Permalink Without a doubt this is the worst movie that i have seen in my entire life. Non- existent story, terrible acting, bad direction and a convoluted and meandering plot leads to a deep sense of despair as the movie came to its utterly meaningless conclusion. The garbled scientific content and the many errors that run through the movie are testament to the fact that a juxtaposition of science and Hollywood simply does not work. Science represents the greatest achievement of the human mind while movies by and large pander to the lowest and basest instincts of the human race and actors by definition represent falsehood and meaningless pretense.
6.0~Great up towards the end... paul_haakonsen Sign in Permalink I finally got around to watching "Interstellar" after having been told how good and fantastic this movie was by several people. I will agree with them for the most parts. It is a beautiful movie and it has a captivating storyline. Well, right up to the point where Cooper went into the Black hole. Then it just turned ludicrous. However, from the way I had been told about the story in "Interstellar" I had expected a bit more from it. I found it to be a bit too brisk in getting past most of the events that took place throughout the course of the movie. The effects in the movie were really good and came off as being believable, which really worked in favor of the movie, obviously. And the acting was also quite good, even with Matt Damon in it. There are some interesting elements in the storyline, I just wish that Nolan would have put more emphasis on the science and theoretical aspects of the movie's storyline; in regards of black holes, wormholes, relativity theory, etc. All in all, an enjoyable movie for sure, but for me it just wasn't as grand and epic as most people had made it out to be.
1.0~Non-scientific crock brigitte-johnson Sign in Permalink I love sci-fi. I enjoy envelope-pushing, out-of-this-world plots. But they have to be at least somewhat credible for me to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. This science in this movie was so poorly researched, so incredibly goofy, so downright ridiculous, that I could not enjoy the really good special effects. Come on, author and director, couldn't you have done better than this? It starts with a scientist who still scrawls on blackboards and ends with -- well, I don't want to spoil it for you. The characters in this movie are definitely not scientists or astronauts or researchers; they are unprincipled and overly dramatic caricatures of these professions. The audience who buys the silly concepts in this movie must really be suckers for nonsense. Sorry to be so blunt - I for one will be sure to stay away from movies written by Christopher Nolan.
1.0~sci-fi is dead jmk112233 Sign in Permalink No, not because of this god awful movie. Sometimes, turkeys like this will be shot, it's the nature of movie-making, but it's inconceivable to me how such a turkey garners such high ratings, unless we realize that the public in general has become sci-fi illiterate in particular and movie illiterate in general, as a result of years of being subjected to sappy Bollywood story lines mixed with cheap cgi and pretty faces being passed on as sci-fi. That's why sci-fi is dead - the audience has been lobotomized. It's difficult to criticize this turkey. Where does one start? The premise? That a crop blight, out of all possible end-of-the-world scenarios, is being sold as a reason to abandon our planet? Really? What kind of a planet does one expect to find that is BETTER than the current one EVEN with the worst imaginable or unimaginable crop blight? And the only apparent/conveyed consequence of this blight is DUST, and the grand conspiracy of rewriting moon landing history as faked? Yeah, that makes total sense - farmers need to be told moon landing is faked, or else they would not plant corn. And as always, when our unwilling hero stumbles into a top secret operation, he is welcomed with open arms without so much as a how do you do, and trusted into the driver's seat, which, for some reason, nobody thought of filling during the whole planning phase. I won't go into the details of such random, nonsensical behaviour and motives of characters, or the absurdity of alleged "science", such as controlling a second hand in a mechanical watch with gravity, or the sappiness of using "love" as an explanation for breaking all laws of physics as we know it. Speaking of the much vaunted physics, was that the one line of grade school level descriptions of a black hole and relativity by the otherwise useless character transparently transplanted merely for racial diversity? For to even land a proper criticism, one has to start from a solid foundation in order to identify where something goes south. For this drawn out garbage, I cannot think of a single solid foundation. Even the "inspiration" from Rama and Contact have been so bungled that it doesn't impart any redeeming quality.
10.0~The best movie i ever saw dominikbacinic Sign in Permalink To me it's the best movie ever made in history of cinema so far. I won't go into any details here ,you should watch it and make up your own mind.
1.0~Pure drivel dbsmith975 Sign in Permalink This is my first review, and I am compelled to write it t counter all the 10 star ratings. This is possibly the worst movie ever made. I fell asleep several times, and would have left had I not been sitting in the middle of the row of seats. I wanted to ask for my money back at the end of the film. It's just boring and nonsensical. Why is every actor in the movie crying all the time? Why does MM mumble/whisper all his lines? I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters, and didn't care if they lived or died. I heard this was an amazing movie and was looking forward to seeing it, but the only thing amazing about it is how much money and talent was turned into such a big steaming pile of dog excrement.
5.0~Not That Great a Movie trv-7 Sign in Permalink First of all, the dialog. I don't know if it's Matthew McConaughey's inability to enunciate or an inexperienced audio engineer but numerous times during the movie I had to ask "what did he just say?". I spent more time focusing on what was being said and less on the actual story. That was a real disappointment. Second- and I don't know if this was intentional or not- but there's absolutely no reference to dates, times, or places. From the very beginning of the movie I wasn't sure when- or where- we were. Kansas? Colorado? 2150 AD? It was an unnecessary distraction. Third- continuity and logic. I'm not describing any spoilers for those that haven't seen the film but there are significant lapses in continuity and illogical assumptions or directions that are so unbelievable- even for a science fiction story. It almost felt like there was a lot more to the film that was edited out. Finally, it was just too long and frankly, Matthew McConaughey is not THAT great an actor. Yes, there was one particular scene that was well beyond anything you've likely seen him do before but that wasn't enough to prop up the rest of the film. Anyway...5/10 but mostly for the special effects because those really were the star of the show.
1.0~C. Nolan discovers the 5th dimension tstevenson-155-240252 Sign in Permalink No need for a spoiler here. the ending is so bizarre, unbelievable, and pretentious. it is the type of ending a Hollywood director on LSD might make. That being said, Nolan does make the 5th dimension a reality--stupidity. I can't believe the yawning of 10s and 9s. I guess you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore. if you believe that movies should be believable, coherent, and enjoyable then you fail the test to see this move. period. So my advice to you is simple, read the book first. oh wait, there is no book? that is because there isn't a publishing company that would print it. let me give you a line from the movie, and you tell me if it is worth seeing. "Who are they?" "I dunno, but they are real and wanted us to be here." That is because We are they." oooookaaay.
10.0~Interstellar, above and beyond stellar michaelwiscombe Sign in Permalink After seeing Christopher Nolan's Interstellar it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie had such an impact emotionally on the entire audience. Just as Nolan provided amazing twists and turns in previous films, such as "The Prestige" and "Inception", he delivers at his best in Interstellar. I first saw this movie on my 18th birthday, I thought it was a great surprise and gift. The music for the motion picture, created by Hans Zimmer, was absolutely incredible. At parts in the movie my heart was pounding and it felt as if it was, in some ways, real life. I love the part (spoiler) when Matt Damon's character dies in the spaceship explosion and Cooper docks to the space station as it is spinning in space, the music gave me goosebumps. This is a story that focuses on family. The main character (Cooper) leaves his son and daughter behind on a space expedition to save the human race. He travels through a wormhole and explores different planets to determine if they are capable of sustaining human life. One of my favorite parts in the movie (spoiler) is when relativity comes into play. A huge wave hits their spaceship and they are stuck on this water planet for over an hour. But due to the gravitational pull on this planet, he ends up spending 23 earth years on it. When he returns to the original ship he had received many messages from his son and daughter. (Spoiler) Over the space of a few hours (his time) he had witnessed his son graduate from high school, get married, have his own son, watch that son pass away, and more. In the end, he returns and his daughter is now an old woman. He promised her that he would come back to her, he fulfilled his promise. This is a very intense and inspiring sci-fi film. It is motivational and teaches us of the importance of family and love.

4.0~Detached drivel, just about watchable eadon-com Sign in Permalink This awkward movie felt like Sci Fi produced by a technical, corporate entity. The idea was fairly cute. Much depended on the mourning by the daughter, but the actress didn't make me care about her. The protagonist didn't make me care about him either, for that matter. I thought the female astronaut was quite engaging but the movie was the most interesting, her choices, angst and suffering were the only interesting thing about the movie. The Black Hole stuff was horrible, but even the black hole in this movie is not volume enough for the plot holes and miraculous coincidences that drive the story. He was only able to communicate via a malfunctioning watch, What the...? Nothing in this movie made sense. Every major scene was blatantly impossible. Worst of all, there was no warmth, no compassion, no style, no love.
1.0~Nonsense,Nonsense,Nonsense,Nonsense,In any dimension. b-mcmillan7 Sign in Permalink Don't waste your time. Codswallop of the highest order. Nonsense from start to finish. Overly long at 2hrs 49mins - however I felt as though it lasted years as I was stuck on Earth while they were piecing together a plot that had more holes than the wormhole. Honestly felt like they wrote it as they went along. The basis of the sentimental story does not sit well in the overall story - the sentimental part and "from beyond help" has been done (to death) in other films - and done far better. The acting is awful - Matthew M getting buy on plaudits from recent shows - but acting the same part / vocabulary over and over again - c'mon. Michael Caine - oh dear - had the bewildered look of someone watching the movie. As I say this is nonsense - in any dimension
2.0~Absolutely dreadful stevenuk Sign in Permalink The first movie I've almost walked out of and I've seen many terrible a movie. Full of plot holes. Terrible mix of science and full on fantasy rubbish. The acting isn't great. I really don't understand what people see in this film. Wish I hadn't wasted however many minutes of my life it was on for and the countless hours later having to vent about how terrible it was. Please I implore you, do not waste your life watching this drivel, if you enjoy it then you'd probably also find a balloon on a stick entertaining (bouncy! bouncy!).
9.0~Interstellar WubsTheFadger Sign in Permalink Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger I recently watched this movie on TV for the third time and just had to write a review for it. So here it is. First off, Christopher and Jonathon Nolan has created a complex and inspired story with some very powerful and emotional moments. The story is told slowing but in a way that makes us connect with the genuine and well made characters. The scientific side of the story can be hard to understand but after a second or third viewing everything becomes clear. The amount of foreshadowing and the plot twist are what make the film great. The story is powerful and is Nolan's 3rd best film (The Dark Knight is #1 and Memento is #2). The acting is amazing. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his greatest performances ever. He bring such emotion and raw power to the screen. Jessica Chastain, David Gyasi, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow all perform well. Anne Hathaway performs the worst. She is very bland and I have never been a fan of hers anyway. The pacing can seem slow to some, but the story takes its time to tell the story and introduce us to the science and the characters. The runtime is very long at a staggering 2 hours and 49 minutes long. But like I said, the story takes its time to develop ands keeps you involved. The CGI in the film is amazing. Space looks beautiful yet daunting. It looks peaceful yet terrifying. Pros: Inspired story, great use of foreshadowing and a great plot twist, emotional moments, complex science, amazing acting by Matthew McConaughey, good overall acting, good CGI, slow pacing in order to let the story develop, and a slightly unresolved ending Cons: Anne Hathaway's dry performance, the pacing can be seen as slow and the runtime is very long Overall Rating: 9.2 P.S. Much like Blade Runner 2049, the film takes its time to introduce the world and characters in a deep and complex way. Both films expect the audience to want to be involved in the process of telling the story.
3.0~Not what I expected...... jamgood-842-448084 Sign in Permalink I think I watched the same film as all the others on here that disliked it. I enjoyed the cinematography and the effects but there is really nothing else about this film I can say I liked. I think Matthew McConaughey is a great character actor but in this film he just didn't fit, for me. His voice, stance, mannerisms all seem out of place. Like he just didn't care and wanted the paycheck. Not that all the blame for the bad film can be put on his shoulders. The rest of the cast, all but a small few of them, just weren't entertaining. From the maker of Inception I expected more. What I got was nearly 3 hrs of not a very good film. 3/10 for the visuals. That's all I got. Disappointed.
1.0~Terrible Waste of Time castle-katherine Sign in Permalink This movie was way too long! Scene's were dragged out unnecessarily! Matt Damon's appearance was random to say the least and added nothing to the story..... The plot was weak and made no logical sense. This was such a disappointment. I can't believe I have seen the same movie as those who have given it 9 stars???? All in all I felt this was a wasted 3 hours of my life that I will not get back. This movie was so bad it made Gravity look amazing! And amazing it wasn't......... I felt that the music in the film was so loud at times that this drowned out key points in the plot and it wasn't an enjoyable experience straining your ears to try and figure out what was going on in the movie. I found it hard to connect with any of the characters which was a let down as I love Matthew McConaghey and Anne Hathaway.
9.0~Interesting storyline ak-31680 Sign in Permalink Very interesting storyline and ending. The acting was not although that much as expected.
2.0~So Disappointed hunsletramone Sign in Permalink Think I did well to give this film a 2. Was looking forward to this film after reading the 8.8 it got on IMD. I did well to bat it out to the end of the film , but I do have lots of patience. It did try me to the limit, but once I watch a film I do like to finish watching it.The film was miles too long anyway, you could have cut this film down by half and it would still have been boring, I do like some science fiction films , just not this one.Truth did not like this film at all, but it did inspire me to join IMDb just to say how bad this film is.Been thinking for a while to join IMDb for reviewing films , so at least Interstellar the film did something positive for me.
10.0~Awakening to a New Dream Hotwyre6 Sign in Permalink It's really hard to know where to begin with a film like this, with its attached anticipation of greatness. Few critics can be said to have accused the director of making a bad film, most tend to agree that the vast body of his work is very good, and he draws talented cast members and skilled technicians to his projects. This film also has the advantage of being released when the public, at least in the US, is teetering on the brink of renewing its interest in scientific advancement and exploration of the cosmos, thanks in large part to celebrity scientists such as Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson. And while the idea of a sci fi exploration film is hardly new, one might argue that this is the first of its type for a generation of films- keeping in mind that certain films such as Gravity at least cross into the same genre to some degree. With that in mind, it shouldn't surprise any viewers to find that this territory feels familiar from the start of the film. The rural backdrop contrasted by technology accompanied by an energetic and wistful protagonist, the kids he raises to think freely against the system, a haunted past both in the main character's personal and professional life, mysterious compounds in the middle of nowhere, etc. All these elements are a staple of the explorer's journey, but it is right to say that what is familiar is done right and engages the audience. The film hits its beats right in this regard, and these elements are handled competently. But what makes Interstellar stand out is the authenticity of its fictional narrative. There was a great degree of effort put forth to make certain the physics and engineering reflected current knowledge and leading theoretical science, and it shows. There's even talk that the computer models used to give a more accurate picture of a black hole actually advanced astrophysics by leading to discoveries and insights about the warped curvature of space time in such an environment as a singularity produces. Many films can be said to have advanced film making technology, and credit is due there, but few if any can actually be credited with driving the understanding of science. Going into the movie with this idea in mind definitely augmented my experience with the film, and I can only imagine it did so for others. One thing I can't help but notice is how well handled the hero narrative is in this film, relying not on creating overly stylized alpha males and sassy spark plugs, but instead having them quietly step up with no fanfare, no glory, and no one liners, doing what is necessary or making the required sacrifices. Our heroes are tormented by mistakes, torn by their emotional conflicts, and vulnerable when it comes to what they love. It's high time this archetype was made more common IMO, and I wait to see if this film has the kind of success which encourages such well defined characteristics in a protagonist. Given the effectiveness of the narrative, it gives one hope. Having those aspects combined together with an incredible score, first rate performances, and an intelligent script, Interstellar delivers an amazing cinematic experience. If there were any criticisms I might level at the film, that would be its unmistakable homages to 2001: A Space Odyssey and its somewhat languid pace at times. But these are subjective observations, and should not discourage viewing only for those reasons, which hardly impact the film. I'm giving Interstellar its well deserved 10/10, and recommending it for both imaginative young minds and those adults who never stopped dreaming.
4.0~The emo sci-fi movie of the year lucca-architecture Sign in Permalink Interstellar = Fascist + Simplistic + Pretentious + Predictable + Loose + Underdeveloped characters + Cinematic clichés + Inconsistent + Physics gives way to mysticism + M. Night Shyamalan complex + Posits itself as a film of many big ideas when it doesn't even possess a single decent one + 2001 bad rip-off + Koyanisqaatsi score bad rip-off + Dispensable - 169 minutes of your life. Interstellar is the first 'serious' sci-fi movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time. I try to keep an open mind and approach every movie with high hopes. It would give me enormous satisfaction (and relief) to like this movie but this is not a serious sci-fi movie, it's only a bad case of patchwork.
5.0~Another pessimistic typical American movie alphaprior Sign in Permalink I heard so much about this movie I expected something spectacular and ingenious. Instead it was another pessimistic movie where movie begins in a farm somewhere in US with drought and dust destroying everything. Seems like there has been a world disaster (probably a world war) no explanations given everything is vague you have to guess something. Later in the movie we see the American flag on a base in another world where the humanity looks for a new start, obviously Americans only. An astronaut goes nuts creates a havoc and our hero falls into a black hole and instead becoming a spaghetti man and die he travels in a magical world where he can affect past or future. And of course he survives unspoiled. Movie in general is boring, slow and sulky, the sad future scenario where earth is dying becomes tiresome and the plot sucks. And totally un-scientific.. shame.. Hollywood is going dumber and dumber over the years. Perhaps they should sell the studios to other countries with better cultural background and smarter people..
9.0~Incredible user-858-824050 Sign in Permalink It may very well be the most remarkable film I've ever seen. Interstellar is a film which plays on your emotions more than anything else. Many people get caught up in the plot holes and the scientific inaccuracies, and thus, let these factors detract from what would otherwise be an incredible cinematic experience. Interstellar is a film to completely surrender yourself to - and let the sheer grandiosity and emotionality move you. Forget logic, forget science. This is art in its most fantastical and overwhelming form. A father's heart breaks as he realizes he's broken his daughter's heart - He has left her and does not know when he'll return. Nolan pulls every string in our heart with the emotion of the father- daughter relationship set against the backdrop of interstellar travel to save the human race. Interstellar will, I feel, become more appreciated as time passes, and will, I hope, one day be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.
8.0~Good but a bit long AlsExGal Sign in Permalink This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists. You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out "What's in your safe?" The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors.
10.0~Masterful, intellectual space thriller seadrum Sign in Permalink When one thinks of a space movie, they usually do not envision anything profound or emotional, but rather action paired with over-the-top special effects and unrealistic creatures. Interstellar breaks this mold, presenting an intellectual storyline that revolves around a simple theme: mankind will do whatever it takes to ensure their survival. The first difference about this movie is that it is not simply watched for a cheap thrill. This is a deeply intellectual film that deals with complex ideas in a much more realistic way than other films tend to do. The events that take place in the movie seem plausible. This starts with the creation of a simple, believable dystopian world where water becomes scarce and food cannot be grown. As the film continues on and more and more scientific ideas are presented, there always seems to be a logical explanation for what is occurring, meaning that the audience is rarely left asking why something was the way it was. In addition to the excellent intellectual writing, this film also wows in its production. The visual effects created are truly breathtaking, bringing the seemingly indescribable mysteries of space, and even a different dimension, to life. Furthermore, the sounds that are chosen to represent space are perfect. The movie alternates between high-pitched, eerie notes or, to an even greater effect, no noise at all, capturing the idea of the vast emptiness of space. Though it certainly is thrilling to watch, it is all of these little details below the surface that make "Interstellar" one of the greatest space films to date. It lacks the plot holes that belittle other space movies while passing on a far more profound message. It is absolutely worth a watch...and a second, and a third.
10.0~"Outstanding" hockeypro Sign in Permalink When two of my good friends suggested we go see Interstellar, i must admit that i was not overly excited. I had watched the trailers for the movie and the only thing that appealed to me was that Christopher Nolan was the director, and that's why I agreed to go. We went to see the movie in IMAX and i have to say it was the best movie experience i have EVER had in theatres. My heart was pounding the entire time. Interstellar draws you right in because the movie plays out on a huge scale but also manages to focus intensely on complex family dynamics and in particular, the relationship between the main character, Cooper and his daughter, Murph. Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar dives right into the heart of humanity's wonder of the supernatural. The feeling you get when you look up at the star; the sense of "what is beyond us". As expected in a Nolan movie, the visuals are amazing and are all practical (no green screen). It really is a beautiful movie to watch. And the science is for the most part all valid as it was overseen by Kip Thorne. The cinematography is beautiful and interesting and deserves praise. As well, the overall look, feel and design of the film was great. Visually, a masterpiece. Hans Zimmer's score deserves special attention. I have never heard a soundtrack as powerful as Interstellar's. Not only does Zimmer do the impossible and top his previous scores (including the Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and The Lion King), but he mangoes to beat out The Lord of the Ring's soundtrack. I never thought i would say that. But honestly, you have to hear it to believe it. It's OUTSTANDING. I thought i was going to have a heart attack during the docking scene, mostly because of the music. Without spoiling anything I have to say that Interstellar takes a beautiful, grounded story of a father and daughter and plays it out over the largest of scales and it's so powerful because it keeps the intimacy of the story despite its scale. Reviews of it thus far seem to be mixed; people either hated it or thought it was a life-changing experience. I think the reason some might not enjoy it is because, like all of Nolan's movies, it questions who we are as humans. It challenges our place in the universe and some people don't like those ideas and because they are provoke change of thought. And that's okay. But if you're the type of person that enjoys having your beliefs challenged in a movie then please see this movie, you won't be disappointed. To conclude its an amazing movie, and its clear that a lot of time was put into it, from every angle. One of my favourites of all time.
4.0~danielaccountingsource@msn.com danielaccountingsource Sign in Permalink My wife and myself are big Sci-Fi fans and were anxiously anticipating the release of this movie. After a disappointing first half-hour, we obviously hung in there and stayed in order to give the movie a chance thinking it would pick up around Lift Off and the subsequent Outer Space journey. Unfortunately, we nearly headed for the nearest exit around the mid point of the movie. Instead, we demanded a refund and the Theatre Manager gave us passes for another movie. We both found the acting and dialog flat and somewhat cliché and found the AI machine to be the most intriguing of the characters. I am shocked to see a fine cast fall flat due to the material given to work with. Nolan should have let the Actors Ad Lib. We were quite comfortable with missing the ending, which one member stated it was "disappointing" as well. The editing was horrible. How this movie did not have more scenes cut is mind boggling. As one reviewer mentioned: What was the purpose of the scene with the drone. The entire first hour, which told the story of the earth's problems creating the need to find a new home could have been condensed to just a few minutes. I realize it is important to develop the characters, but in this case there was only one member of the family going on the Outer Space Mission. We also found some of the special effects laughable since the Space Craft and Saturn looked like the miniature models that they obviously are. I am rating this movie 4 out of 10 and I sincerely feel that this is overly generous. Hopefully, Nolans' next movie will have better qualities since this motion picture was a disaster.
10.0~Interstellar - the best HotCakeX Sign in Permalink The movie deserves more than 1 Oscar. I was looking at people's reviews and i was SHOCKED. how can a Great Movie have so much different impact on its watchers!! Interstellar is a movie that makes you fall in love with it. the sound tracks, the score, the emotions, the Love, every second of the movie is great. though the movie couldn't be this great without the sound tracks made by Hans Zimmer. most of the work done for the movie was real, the Nolan's style. The most obvious thing that you'll notice when watching the movie is the fact that none of the things would have happened if LOVE hadn't existed. Matthew Mcconaughey's act was marvelous. the emotions make you cry multiple times throughout the movie even if you're watching it for 101st time. Interstellar was really more SCI- than FI, that's why it's so much different and better than any other outer-space movies. The Interstellar doesn't deserve less than 7 out of 10 if you wanna rate it.
9.0~A Space Movie Actually Made Interesting egesahin-73638 Sign in Permalink I am not going to go into spoilers but just know that in the horde of uninspired and generic space movies, Interstellar shines brightly. It is a masterpiece of subversions and it just keeps on building and building its plot and raising the stakes higher with each second and it keeps you at the edge of your seat constantly as you are wondering how it will all end. One of the most satisfying movies that I have ever watched and it will blow your mind.
10.0~Touching and just a absolute masterpiece. james_gregory-78048 Sign in Permalink This film gave me so many feelings it was unreal. By far the best film I have seen. I have watched this film like 13 times and it still never stops impressing me. I really wish they make another film to explain what happens next, I think this is on everyones minds. The soundtrack is truly beautiful as well, I love to listen to it sometimes and it gives me hope and the means to explore. Nolan did a great job with this. 10/10 Every time I watch it.
5.0~Intergalactical overrated cliché movie, with excellent graphics. cannibalcryfficial Sign in Permalink Unfortunately, Interstellar in another Sci-Fi movie that failed to make a consistent clever scenario with good scientific related dialogues that make sense and do not try to impress the audience with wambly bubbly magical solutions and unreal metaphysics. The dialogues are stupid as hell, the events are complete unrealistic and unclever (and unoriginal). The idea and the graphic are very good but as I pointed before this movie suffers from the Pop Sci-Fi syndrome plus the need of Hollywood to have a protagonist-hero style-ultra soldier patriot who stupidly takes the solution to himself (like the scene who rides the spaceship without the auto-pilot or the fact the NASA put his hope into a guy who just showed up in his secret door etc...). Everything around Matthew McConaughey it's so boring cliché and shallow for such a budget movie. The 5/10 is a reflection of a nice idea plus the work of the CGI and the physicists who worked to make the simulations for the ultra-realist black holes.
2.0~If this is how humanity is to be saved, we are doomed db-beurylaw Sign in Permalink This is stupid. Stupid, stupid stupid!!! And boring. I want to congratulate reviewer melkurion and incorporate his or her well written review. I wish he or she had written the script. If you like stupid movies that make no sense, I suggest you get a copy of "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" another amazing insult to your intelligence. At least "Voyage" was fun to watch for the mere stupidity. This one is simply extremely boring. The first 45 minutes is Mathew McConaughey as a single father talking to his daughter? You can go to any park on Saturday afternoon and see the single fathers talking to their kids and it will be far more entertaining. Then Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles into a super-secret NASA installation, not in Florida mind you, but apparently in a corn field in Iowa. He is immediately snapped up to pilot the last remaining space ship on a dying planet. He has to save the earth from a dust storm. The angst is that he has to leave his daughter and it might be a few hundred years before he gets back. Here's the reason I write: NASA is sending its last space ship, its only hope to save our species, with a pilot they just met, two other guys and one woman. Huh? If you're going out to find another habitable planet, and chances are the people sent are never coming back, and you send one woman? The writers do know where babies come from, don't they? Anne Hathaway plays "Brand" and is the only woman on board. What if she gets killed? What if she is infertile or not very good at getting pregnant? The entire future of the human race is riding on her. She is 32 years old and looks older. They would have been better off leaving Cooper at home and sending his daughter. Any reasonable effort to save the human race would have been to send three young women, one viral young man and a whole lot of frozen sperm. The reason that there is just Hathaway is because of the movie convention that we must always have more dudes. Always. Even if the situation calls for women, even if it only makes sense that the participants be female, there must be mostly men. And director here fell back on the cliché from SI-Fi movies of the 50s: Why is there a chick in the space ship at all? Because she is the daughter of the Professor who is masterminding the project. If the professor didn't have a daughter, they would be all dudes in the space ship. Brand couldn't be accomplished on her own? She gets to be in the space ship because she's the daughter. The science may have come a long way from the 50s, but the male dominated film industry has not. As I said the whole movie made no sense and is an insult to your intelligence. Add in the chauvinism and you got a fun night out.
9.0~Familiar Adventure, Awesome Graphics and Lots of Complexity rgkarim Sign in Permalink When you think of Christopher Nolan, you probably think of the Dark Knight trilogy that ended a few years ago. However you may recall a little number called Inception that had a little less caped crusader, and a little more mind twisting. Now that the dark knight has hung up his cape, Nolan and his brother may have produced another epic tale in the form of a space adventure called Interstellar. This genre has been absent in the movies lately, so I was excited to see what the director had in store. Was it good or did it flop? As always I'm happy to share my opinions. Interstellar's story is like most space exploration tales. The earth is dying and the future of humans is once again at stake. Pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is a farmer/engineer is drafted into the rocket program to find other worlds to start colonizing on. Of course this involves leaving his two kids behind, possibly never seeing them again. And just like most space stories, things start to go wrong. Interstellar's plot follows the formula of other space dramas in which things go well at first, but then quickly take a turn for the worse. Yes, like Apollo 13 and other space classics, the crew of this movie faces their fair number of challenges in the unknown. Fans will find themselves gripping the seats, or holding their breath as the drama unfolds, each scene filled with the spectacular orchestra work of Hans Zimmer. Most of the incidents you can see coming, but I'll admit there were a few twists thrown in that surprised even me. Interspersed with the action of the movie, is an intense dialogue that holds a lot in its well-written words. First off is character development, the backstories gradually being revealed as the group progressed on their journey. While some of the traumatic past seemed to be swept under the rug, fans will get plenty of material to help get attached to the characters. For this reviewer, I found that each of the characters got a fair amount of involvement in the movie, and the stories meshed well together to bring a good dynamic amidst the group. However, this reviewer also got a little annoyed about the constant complaining about saving the ones they loved versus completing the mission. WE knew the issues at hand, but Nolan's writing wanted to make sure that we knew how hard it was. This did allow for some good moral testing in the dialog, seeing how far Cooper and the gang would go before diverging from their goals. In addition to these qualities, the writing is also filled with a plethora of scientific jargon that will have the audience either impressed, laughing, or completely stumped. Theoretical physics and quantum mechanics are the backbone of the journey, explaining the principles to how this journey works and why it is such a challenge. I was able to follow most of the dialogue, but determining how accurate and realistic it is, lie beyond my skills. Also there were some well time comedy moments as well, in particular from the robots, that were clever and witty. However, the biggest strength of this movie is the phenomenal effects it has to offer. Interstellar is beautifully crafted to bring the exploration into the unknown to life, with high definition graphics and amazing sound. Planet surfaces are incredibly detailed, from the shimmer of light off the water, to the jagged crags of the icy wasteland. The spaceships themselves have a fair amount of realism to it, though at times things are a bit to blocky or bright to maintain the realism. Even the journey through the wormhole will impress fans as the dazzling lights and whooshing sounds put you right into the fray. Regardless of what part of the movie, rests assure that the visuals are impressive and a big part of what brings the excitement to the movie. Yet for all the good this movie has, including the fantastic acting, Interstellar did have a few weaknesses for me. For one it was a very morbid movie, with so much focus on the negative. This movie has you questioning a lot about the limited time span called life, and may be a bit too depressing for some people. A second weakness was some of the overstretching they did in this movie. I get that the genre is called science fiction, but some of the things they did in this movie were a bit too out there for me. Specific examples can't be shared, but you'll get what I mean when you get further into the movie. If it was meant to be ridiculous, I could accept it, but for the serious tone in this movie, it didn't fit well with me. I'm sure you can guess my next weakness is time length of the movie. Well three hours is a bit much for me these days, and with a slow beginning to set the situation up, it can really drag. However, most of the movie is very interesting and the situations are set up to an extent that most of the movie passes by quickly, though there are still some slow parts. There are a few other things to mention, but let's wrap this up. Interstellar is an awesome movie on so many levels. Yes many will see many similarities to the movie contact, and it does lack some originality. However, this movie is a welcome treat that stands out from the monotonous mess movies have become. I have no doubt this movie will be up for some Oscar awards, especially with the editing involved. This reviewer strongly recommends catching this movie in theaters, though be warned of the length when planning your day. The scores are: Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0
1.0~Very Poor Storyline, no depth kumsym Sign in Permalink The Goods: Visuals were good. But if you really think about it, other than the scenes where they showed "Outside" it was all in studio in front of gadgets which we have seen ages from Star trek days. So Few scenes visuals were good. Cooper & Merf (Kid & adult) acting was good. Bad: Too many to list. Story was very thin Screenplay which is usually Nolan's forte is really weak. Too many things he was trying to say but too little conveyed. Unfortunately it is like Modern Art, that you have to say it is good, if not your creativity will be questioned. Simiarly it is NOLAN's movie, if you say it is not good, you will be questioned. But I dare!!! It is BAD.
4.0~the movie for the small brained "thinking man" alon-dar1 Sign in Permalink I appreciate Nolan, all in all he made great films, but "Interstellar" and "Avatar" were kind of fakes, small stories with old ideas that are very common in science fiction literature and sf movies for decades, wrapped nicely in cg and dramatic music, creating a feeling of enlightenment in any idiot who never read a book or knows not what real imagination is. I never thought of Matthew McConaughey as a real actor, but in this film he does a wonderful job, no one can play the idiotic role of the genius farmer as he does, dramatically suffering just as Nolan directed him, any other actor would have burst in a crazed laughter at the idiotic script, but Matthew, a "thinking actor" did exactly what was expected from him. must respect him for that. few words about the music, there were all the right notes and volume to make this flick seem like a "serious" one. but the music itself was created on a very cheap emotional theme. Feels like the budget for this movie was about 10 million $, i cannot see any extra dollar that was spent as giving any result.
4.0~A rocket to nowhere jpt-154-298566 Sign in Permalink Let me preface this by stating that I am a big Christopher Nolan fan. Following the success of his "Dark Knight" trilogy, plus standalone movies "Inception" and "The Prestige", we have something of a one-man franchise. Warner Bros signed off on the biggest pre-approved budget in movie history to make "Interstellar" without even seeing a script. Going into the movie, I knew that with this kind of creative freedom, there were always going to be a couple of self-indulgent bits and perhaps a few ideas and sequences that the producers would have viciously vetoed with a less powerful director at the helm. But I didn't mind. In today's remake and reboot happy Hollywood, I sat back to enjoy what might be the last movie in a quite a while with an A-list director, completely original story, and a money-no-object budget. Which is why I'm sorry to report that this movie just didn't work for me at all. The problem is that it's not really a movie. It's about three different kinds of movie mixed together, into one very complex but rather indigestible dish. This same approach worked for "The Dark Knight", where Nolan threw everything but the kitchen sink into the screenplay and somehow made it all work. Unfortunately, lightning hasn't struck twice for Interstellar. Nolan's intergalactic juggernaut struggles to get off the ground, and when it's finally up there, doesn't really know what to do with itself. Sort of similar to the real space programme. The film opens fairly slowly, mostly in a dusty Midwestern farming community. No problem, in theory - "Star Wars" and "Superman" both openedlike this, and both were great movies. Then lots of talking heads pop up, like in a documentary. Then, they vanish, and we find ourselves in the middle of what feels like a Depression-era movie with a single father struggling to raise two wayward children on his own. We get a little background on this dystopian world. Big food shortages have created wars, crises, and the government can't afford frivolities such as a space program. Apparently, the Earth is dying, with the atmosphere rapidly becoming unbreathable. Also, there is a drone aircraft flying around - from India, of all places. Then, a ghost, which is actually gravity, communicates with Cooper's daughter by speaking to her by arranging books into barcodes and tells them to go to a secret (fully funded and operational) NASA base which has been hidden from society for decades behind a wire fence in a cornfield. I guess that must be some wire. Space wire. NASA wire. If none of this sounds like it makes any sense, it's because it doesn't. Without a clear direction, Interstellar falls apart. It continues to throw the most disjointed, jarring plot elements lifted from every epoch of space movie our way for the next two and a half hours in what could loosely be called a 'story'. There are bits that feel like "Gravity" with super-realistic spaceflight sequences. There are bits that feel like 1960s Star Trek where the famously doomed "redshirts" are sent down to random planets to die in slightly comical accidents. If you're detecting a bit of a clash of tone here, then congratulations: Nolan didn't. The unexpectedly mad, undisciplined screenplay continues to ricochet around until the very end, which plays like a cross between "Inception" and "2001: A Space Odyssey." It's not just the plot which has developed mild schizophrenia either: the feeling extends to the characters. Brand (Anne Hathaway) is introduced as a scientific, hard-nosed foil to Coopers' wild, seat-of- the pants pilot. The movie has a nasty habit of forgetting about her, and she wanders in and out of proceedings to no avail. Then it's revealed that she's in love with an offscreen character who we have never met. All throughout this, we are flicking back and forth between equally weird and random plot developments on Earth. Cooper has left a son and daughter behind. We spend quite a lot of time with the younger daughter (Mackenzie Foy) but then she grows up, becomes a quantum physicist - not bad for a farm hand - and is basically a completely different character, which means all the time the movie spent on the young version is ultimately wasted. Cooper seems to completely forget he has a son as well - we only see him pining for the daughter. It's very important for a film to do is establish its tone and what kind of movie it is within its first ten minutes. Interstellar couldn't do this for two hours. It could have ended in a musical number and it wouldn't have made any more or less sense. I also found myself wondering what they managed to spend the enormous budget on. Take away the A-list actors and there's no reason that this couldn't have been done for $30m. Some of the effects (example: when Mann tries to dock with the Endurance) are actually pretty flimsy. They didn't look or move like real spacecraft at all. For me, the ultimate irony with Insterstellar is that it had two or three ideas which could have been developed into good movies on their own: for example, the idea of an former astronaut having to convince skeptical authorities on an impoverished future Earth that their only chance of survival is a wildly risky space expedition. For better or worse, there is no way Inception would ever have been made without Nolan's involvement. This is the great two-edged sword of creative freedom. I just hope Nolan doesn't become the last ever director to wield it.
5.0~Big, loud, and overloaded with a lot of emotional baggage . . . The_Film_Cricket Sign in Permalink If we learned anything last year from Gravity it is that when dealing with movies based on science fact, less is more. Christopher Nolan might have taken some of that to heart with his new space adventure Interstellar. Here is a movie with infinite science and infinite filmmaking skill, but it weighs so heavily on an over-melodramatic bid for the soul of humanity that after three hours we find ourselves too exhausted to care. The story, at its core, is a good one. We're sometime in the near-future when the planet Earth is essentially on life-support (Al Gore will love this movie), suffering a resurgence of the dustbowl as our crops are drying up and humanity has regressed into an agrarian state. Amid this breakdown we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a good-hearted former aeronautical engineer-turned-farmer who is raising a son named Tom, and a daughter named Murphy (if you forget that name, rest assured that Cooper will repeat it at least 300 times before the movie is over). During a massive dust storm, Cooper and Murphy find themselves the recipients of a sign in binary that is either a message from ghosts, God or space aliens. In doing the math, Cooper finds himself among officials at the remains of NASA, and quickly assigned to travel into space, navigate through a worm hole and find another habitable planet to sustain mankind. His crew includes a mournful co-pilot named Brand (Anne Hathaway), a physicist named Romilly (David Dyasi); and a geographer named Doyle (Wes Bentley). Also, two robots named CASE and TARS, who look like monoliths and move like spiders. Actually CASE and TARS are the best things in the movie. They look like the kiosk that you buy your movie tickets from, but they break into smaller parts to perform rudimentary functions –they're really quite impressive. Through a plot that gets way too complicated, the crew find themselves on the other side of the galaxy where they realize that one hour on the new planet equals seven years on Earth. That leads to emotional crises on Cooper's part because he's the one member of the crew with kids back home. Time and relative space begin to spin and bend and twist until neither the crew nor the audience can figure what the heck is going on. This is a very complex story, one that I admit I struggled to follow (and I was able to follow Inception). You find yourself having to look amid large chunks of story to find the main narrative. When you get there you find that through all the gargantuan special effects, music and sound effects, Intersteller is really the story of the disconnection between Cooper and Murphy. Cooper knows that when he gets back home that his daughter will be all grown up (and played by Jessica Chastain) so his mission is really just an effort to make things right. That leads to a long, VERY long scenes in which Cooper mourns the fact that he'll never get to watch his little girl grow up. That would be fine except that the movie belabors the point for nearly three hours, playing the same overemotional notes over and over. Not to be heartless, but when traveling to the other side of the universe, I really could care less about a weepy little girl back home. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He is the one director working right now who really wants to put his vision on screen rather than pander to popular taste. We've seen in Inception , and the Batman pictures that he knows how to tell a grand story using logic and good screen writing. He has a grand vision for what he wants to put on screen, but in Intersteller he goes over the edge. His overbearing emotional output becomes too much for the audience to carry.
10.0~Masterpiece niyasrahman-92000 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movie experience ever,..and well its one of the masterpiece of Christopher Nolan...
4.0~What The Hell Did I Just Watch! ggmcheartagram Sign in Permalink I'm actually really angry right now, a few people recommended this film to me and i just don't understand why?! Maybe i'm just not that smart. I barely understood it and most of it went over my head. I pretty much relied on the synopsis to understand what was going on, and if a film is that hard for me to follow, then it obviously just isn't for me. I can't fault the visuals, music or the majority of the acting - just the story, and in particular the turn it took at the end...what was that? why? there was no need! I was bored at the start. Then the film peaked my interest once they were in space and then the turn it took just made me fed up and annoyed. I don't seem to love Christopher Nolan as much as everyone else does, i enjoyed his earlier films and two of the Batman films but most of his films just end up boring me. It's disappointing because i usually always love his casting choices and i want to like his films but most of them just don't engage me. Maybe he just isn't for me. Jon enjoyed this more than me and gave it 7/10 but even he admitted that he didn't understand the majority of it and he also enlisted the help of the synopsis. I guess if you haven't watched it give it a go, you may enjoy it or like me you might wish that you'd spent the past three hours doing something else...
10.0~Engaging modern masterpiece InevitableSingularity Sign in Permalink I am well aware of comparisons to various films such as the obvious "2001: A space odyssey, Solaris, Gravity(in some respects)" but this picture is, in my opinion of such importance to the ongoing evolution of film that I would prefer to look at it based on its own merits. (other than a single reference below....) It has taken me a few months and more than a couple viewings of this film to form what I HOPE is a well rounded personal opinion. Upon my first viewing I must admit I had completely and wholeheartedly given into the hype, as much as I tried not to, I could not wait to see it, and fully expected to be let down. It did not disappoint but in many ways surprised me with its subtlety. The start of this movie is very gentle in areas, setting out a family scene. Emotional entanglements which run throughout the film are deep, heart wrenching but at times heart warming. It becomes clear very quickly that this is not a film looking to mollycoddle the future, things are bleak, but in a personal way. The world is not what it once was, and we are running out of time. This film is not a crowd pleaser in the same way as many blockbuster superhero movies and the like are. The imagery in this picture is literally out of this world, everything just looks so tangible, the techniques employed during production of this film though not ground breaking in some cases were definitely unique and I would direct any accusations of overuse of CGI etc to look a little deeper. I feel that the techniques used are blatantly obvious and give a feeling of realness which is so often absent from what is essentially a scifi flick. The interaction between actors and the outside world (while in space) is fantastic, the acting overall in my opinion is first class. I must mention however that Michael Caine's performance was a little forgetful, though perhaps that was down to his character and my thoughts on him being one of the greats. A Nolanite? I certainly am not, however I do think he is a massively talented person. The soundtrack is still a bit(cure all Hans Zimmerish) in that it couldn't have come from anyone else, but does enough to separate itself from previous outings (Inception,TDK etc.) and is, in a word, Sublime. A tad over emotional but it helps you connect with the characters and the unfolding story. When paired with Hans Zimmer, their success might get a bit repetitive but since when is that a bad thing. They are both successful for a reason, because when paired, or alone, they deliver. I do understand that to some people this really just isn't their bag, and I applaud them for this. However I must say that I don't entirely understand some of the criticism this film received regarding, specifically, its science. Yes some of it goes against common sense, but history has put paid to a lot of things which once made no sense and are now commonplace. Yes there are oversights, such as the massive wave which doesn't suck the water which precedes it, (like a tsunami) and the underdevelopment of Coopers Son's character, but with regard the bigger ideas, at the end of the day this is a film heavily based on theoretical physics which has had a lot of work by various people far smarter than I, to establish our best guesstimate at what all of those theories would look and feel like if we were to interact with them. Its still a film, this is not a documentary, though it bases itself heavily on well thought out theories, I don't see anything wrong with taking some artistic license. I don't suspect a ship entering a black hole would stay intact but I am quite glad that the film didn't end there. I realise it may annoy some people to say this but with respect, is it really being suggested that what is an all time classic "2001: A space odyssey" is more deeply rooted in science than Interstellar? I guess what I don't get, is how we can rubbish a film based on theory when the very nature of theory is that we aren't really sure to begin with. However even if it all turned out to be a load of junk, I still love this film for its marriage of Theoretical science and what I very personally see as art. I do think that Christopher Nolan is in some ways challenging us as humans, there are things we don't understand and furthermore concepts which are hinted at, which even the smartest of us simply cant really comprehend. The soul of this film for me is to be found in accepting there are things we don't know and allowing the concepts, emotions and visuals which we do understand, to come all at once and enjoy, remember and learn from the experience. This film poses some uncomfortable questions as regards where we are heading, it cant be looked past that the possibilities of natural disasters occurring goes up minute by minute. The resilience of human nature, our capacity to love and always at least attempt to overcome is showcased here within a mix for theoretical science and amazing imagery/writing delivered by top class actors, yes there are mistakes and holes but there is so much that is overwhelmingly brilliant that I simply do no care.. Overall, I must say, this is just about the best film I have ever seen. Definitely not my favourite Nolan film, but as a technical/artistic achievement, it will take some beating.
10.0~"Interstellar" is everything you can expect from a motion picture and beyond 851222 Sign in Permalink Greetings from Lithuania. "Interstellar" to simply put, is a magnificent motion picture. It is a close call masterpiece (surely a classic). The whole hype wasn't just a hype, it's true, and you have to witness it on the big screen to truly appreciate it. It has everything a true sci- fi movie should have and everything that a truly great motion picture must have. Everything here works on the highest level. The music (without doubts, a locked Oscar nomination), sound / sound effects (two possible Oscar winners), acting, directing, script special effects (a sure nominee) are a top notch, and combined with realistic sci-fi ideas, this movie is must see. It has to go down as one of (if not THE) very best science fiction movies off all times. Overall, "Interstellar" is as good as movies goes. It has everything to held you glued to the screen for almost 3 hours, but trust me, watching "Interstellar" you will be delivered to a movie magic without a wormhole help.
10.0~time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece 2karl- Sign in Permalink chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a Renascence First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronaut Matthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us. whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light."
1.0~Yaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn for nearly 3 hours. the_integrator-43961 Sign in Permalink Yaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn for nearly 3 hours. I put this on in the background and found lot's of other interesting things to do. (Call my daughter), tidy up my emails, cut my nails, Facebook. After a lot of fast forwarding, I gave up 90 minutes into it. Chasing a drone that is nothing like a drone and taking control of it (like that was realistic) what looks like an Atlas rocket on the outside is extremely spacious on the inside. Robbie the robot is made of boxes covered in mirrored fablon (look up seventies material for reviving old furniture). This film is disappointing in every aspect. Unrealistic, poor visualisations, drawn out subject, don't waste 3 hours of your valuable time on it. I've taken 15 minutes out of mine to save you.
3.0~Did I miss something? kamp102 Sign in Permalink I read all the great reviews about this movie and went to see it on my day off and was really excited. I ended up bored and disappointed. Maybe it's my short attention span but I felt like I spent the whole movie waiting for something to happen. I gave it 3 stars based on the special effects but I am not with the masses in anointing this film as a masterpiece. Too little action, too many meaningless story lines. If you are hellbent on seeing for yourself, I would recommend the IMAX experience. The special effects are enhanced in that environment. Maybe I am not smart enough to follow a movie like this. If you're a fan of intense action movies, stay away from this one.
1.0~Over Hyped ecg-155-532832 Sign in Permalink Marketing gets a 10, paid promo reviews get a 10, and the film itself gets a 1. Once Matt Damon rears his ugly head you can now confirm your suspicions that this film has been compromised by illogical tripe. Damon delivers his usual trade mark wince and grimace to let the moviegoer know this script has changed yet again. The big lie is that this film is being hyped as a better science fiction movie than 2001, NOT. Anne Hathaway looks like a clueless deer in the headlights when she is supposedly a top astrophysicist. Matthew McConaughey plays a top mechanical engineer that is now a farmer due to a world filled with way too many people. The typical message from the Marxist Hollywood crowd is ever so present, the earth is turning into a dust bowel from global warming, kids can't follow their dreams as grade school will determine their careers (Outcome based Education), but it gets better when the Karl Marx penned phrase "For the greater good" is the basis of this long drawn out ball of crap called Interstellar. The IMAX presentation did nothing for this movie other than a soundtrack that made it difficult to listen to the actual dribble. Do yourself a favor and wait until this movie is released on DVD-BRay, the duality of your conscience demands it.
10.0~A visual and auditory marvel Jared_Andrews Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us. Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans. Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, "we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it." For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning. The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie. Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything. I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.
10.0~Christopher Nolan has done it again!! gianlucamarzano16 Sign in Permalink Intersellar. What Christopher Nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simple,but we know that it's Christopher Nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. It's not. The overall plot is that the earth is dying so cooper(Matthew mcconaughey) and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. The acting is great,what makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. Every time they were together it was WOW. The visuals were on another level. If you can,see it on the biggest screen possible. Some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that, you will have a blast with this.Overall interstellar is a must see. I think it was Nolan's best film.
10.0~a true masterpiece from Nolan eashwar2906 Sign in Permalink If Memento was ambiguous, if The Prestige was smart, if Inception was deceiving, if The Batman Trilogy was a revelation, then Interstellar is hope-giving, inspiring, levitating, flabbergasting and more... It's a roller-coaster ride of transcendental thought process. Time as a relative theory, astrology as a whole, time-travel and lot other high level thinking is mandatory to go about the narration of this movie when our very little brain cells have a tough time differentiating between just a movie being watched in a cinema hall or being part of a galactic expedition. Interstellar is a science-fiction movie about a group of space travelers on a picaresque journey across the wormhole to find a habitable planet other than earth. Sounds familiar? We've had Blade Runner, A Space Odyssey, Contact or the recent Gravity along with numerous other ambitious takes on such top level prophecies, but what makes Interstellar a suffocating, impactive film? The amount of study that has gone into the making of the film is equivalent to a new find. Be it the concept of dimensions, futuristic world, or the unexplainable topics to the laymen, this story from the Nolan brothers is rather simple than all their previous outings. Interstellar in simple words, is a film about a father-daughter relationship. Taking the 'Dust bowl' as a primary setting for the story to have a beginning, Mr. Cooper is a farmer by choice but a trained pilot and engineer by profession. He is a single father who still believes the plight of their blight filled earth can be taken over by inhabiting another planet. His bright daughter Murphy doesn't want him to go on a NASA powered voyage fearing his return. Let's stop it there on making a futile attempt of describing the story. Interstellar has propelled itself to the pinnacle by an undeniably superior story, astute screenplay and stellar performances from the uncanny yet stubborn Mathew McConaughey as Cooper the pilot, Anne Hathaway as Amelia a committed scientist, Micheal Caine as Dr. Brand the chief and Jessica Chaistan as Murphy the abandoned daughter. Double Negative has taken up the herculean task of doing the visual effects for a Nolan film and has re-created unseen visuals of the wormhole, the outer space, inhabited planets of the other galaxy and of course the beautiful earth. The graphics and other digitally composited elements in the film are pretty much the life-line for the film, making the unseen portions of outer space look so convincing to us and not a compromised, make-believe platform. How will the engines of a space shuttle sound, how is sound transmitted in a planet that has only 80% gravity, how does a button sound when it is pressed by a finger that has astronaut's gloves on it? Hans Zimmer can never get tired of writing top-class music scores. Be it the nail-biting sequence of the shuttle docking into the mother-ship or the take-off into the space or the scene where Cooper gets to watch a video sent from his family, the musical support in the film is a parachute like life-saver for such a hard-hitting story. He elevates the film and positions it to an unreachable height of excellence and creativity. Interstellar has been filmed with anamorphic 35mm and IMAX 70 mm to give a different visage for the story. Hoyte Van Hoytema's (what word could you think of to describe his skill) cinematography will become a standard procedure on how science-fictions are to be shot. Made on a whopping budget of 165 million dollars, Nolan almost returned 10 million after filming from the original allocated budget. Private corn fields were bought and cultivated to be used as a major backdrop. Special IMAX cameras were made to shoot the interiors of the cockpit. Exclusively Robots were made for the film. 100 hours for rendering a single CG powered frame and what not first-timer for a film. Interstellar has started a race of its own for generation of film-makers to follow. Einstein's general relativity, Morse code, rotating black-hole and lot other complexities are dealt in Interstellar, but it is an emotional tale about the cosmos of survival. This piece of writing has no spoilers and talks nothing about, how great the film is. It is just an immediate response
3.0~An arrogant, cheap satisfaction movie rpa-queiroz Sign in Permalink I will start saying that the movie is an OK watch. You get involved, maybe even cry a bit, you get amazed about nice images a good pictures, but this does not define a great movie, not even close. The plot is so cheaply made it kind of makes you furious to have spent the time watching it at all. Let's start by the use of physics. He might even had had scientific advisors, but he certainly did not listen to a word they said. The whole thing lacks coherence and breaks some of the fundamental concepts the movie claims to address. (1) When you get into a black hole you are turned into a little spaghetti without even noticing, your light cone (what you see) becomes so tiny that you can only see things that are falling on the black whole behind you (so no see all that fancy crap that he does), and most certainly you will hear no sound, since the speed of sound is so much smaller that the speed of light, so the communication with the robot, pretty much impossible. (2) All the 5 dimensions thing is very much based on string theory, which is a theory to unify quantum mechanics and gravity, the very same thing that the professor claims is not possible to unify. (3) only with a worm hole you "can go" to another point in space-time, but certainly not in a black hole -- which is in the end the big solution for the movie, so they got a bit confused there. (4) The fuel you would need to get away from the gravitational field of a BH when you can see it, certainly will not fit in their little ship. (many more, i will not extend much more) Plot. It looks like those bright heads have fuel to visit all the three planets, but the order is carefully chosen to make you feel really bad about all the time has passed in the first visit and emotionally connect in the cheapest of the ways, see the kids grow up have babies and such. Then there is a very confusing second visit to a planet, where the guy there seems to have an evil plan which involves living the others behind for no particular reason (what was his plan actually?). But we need this, because this leads them into finally falling in the big black hole and communicating back to earth (hm...) some idea that is not transmitted to the audience, even though pretending that everything is making absolute sense. So, a series of accidents that lead into a solution to save humankind that could be reach in a gazillion of other ways. Because, in the end, we do not see any of the important things, like, for example, how did they get up there, how did they convince the population, what made it safe... Acting. McConaughey just makes himself, and Hathaway cannot be more boring. I did not find a message in this film, any thesis or elaboration on human nature, any coherent and exciting humanity crisis story with an epic solution, and for a film so scientifically based, any good accurate description of the state of the art in astrophysics. This is why I called it arrogant, it transmits itself so much bigger that it is actually grounded on. So, for good sci-fi, go see 2001-Space Odyssey or Solaris instead.
2.0~"2001: A Space Odyssey" meets "The Waltons." UGH! elmerflp Sign in Permalink The hype was monumental, so I just had to go see it. Oh the humanity! Oh the Humanism! Oh the special effects! My boy and I left the theater blinking and scratching our heads over the loose ends and the heavy slathering of deep inner meaning which, unfortunately, proved largely incomprehensible for our plebeian minds. Oh well. The similarities to Stanley Kubrick's "2001" were embarrassing at some points, although I assume most current movie goers have not seen this 46-year-old film. Throughout Interstellar, there was a lot of weepy overacting in various attempts to dramatize the effects of relativity on time and the resulting differences in human aging. Then there was the subtle, underlying message that humans are the gods who will rescue humanity. I prefer the capital-g God as my rescuer, thank you. This film was a special-effects extravaganza, but, ultimately, pretty lame.
3.0~Tedious mishmash of very loud boredom cfloordave Sign in Permalink Interstellar is like watching a slide show of landscapes to very loud music, interrupted occasionally by stupidly bright lights, while a stranger whispers a rather tedious hard to catch story about a dream they had in one ear and another stranger just occasionally screams as violently and obnoxiously as possible in the other ear. I have to expand my article to get it submitted so I'll labour on - like the film. The film jumps across two or three stories which in their own right would have been able to contain their own film. The effects and the space travel sequences seem borrowed from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The characters don't work together and their motives make little to no sense. There are two funny lines from a robot though it you're willing to sit through two hours forty minutes for that....
6.0~Inter-not quite-stellar Fluke_Skywalker Sign in Permalink Unlike, say, Michael Bay, Christopher Nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. It's an admirable trait, and the results certainly speak for themselves. Unfortunately with 'Interstellar' his grasp on that rung is often tenuous, and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war. Technically the film is brilliant. The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. The cast do what they can, but there's just nothing here for them to gain purchase, and as a result I experienced a total emotional detachment throughout.
5.0~Awful reknob Sign in Permalink I'm supposed to detail my thoughts on the movie here but frankly, I don't know where to begin. There's just so much wrong here that I can't prioritise it all but here goes: Sound: Horrible, horrible noise throughout the film rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible. What on earth were they thinking? Acting: I love McConaughey and he does his best to instil some emotion in here to make up for the total "care?" engendered by the pitiful script but he can't do it all on his own and the female lead with the I'm-so-cute big eyes was dreadful throughout. Writing/screenplay: Well, again, I don't know where to begin but as with most poor movies, this is the real culprit here. I'm just not sure at which point I was supposed to actually give a toss about any of the characters or get caught up in what was happening on screen. For a film set in inter-galactic travel, the suggestion is that the sum total of wild and whacky differences between worlds other than ours is that they may have big waves in their seas or it may be really cold. OK, colour my imagination fully filled lol, Jesus wept, that's it? That's the grand vision of the other side of the universe fulfilled is it? Again, this is supposed to be a story of big ideas and concepts so why do we have to sit through half an hour plus of setting up an utterly superfluous bad guy replete with pointless (and hysterically funny - to me at least) fight between guys in space suits? What, if any, was the point of all of that? True or false, this would be a better film with all of the Matt Damon stuff taken out and indeed that entire planet's involvement - mindboggling. I'm not even going to go there on the pseudo-science. I'm a sci-fi fan and I'm happy to let my imagination run to keep myself in the story but you've got to make at least some effort. The complete cr*p coming out of the actor's mouths in much of this film was just embarrassing, so bloody low brow, I imagine the more intelligent amongst them must have had trouble keeping a straight face at times. I haven't had the misfortune to suffer through such atrocious writing since Prometheus and clearly, Nolan is well on the way to becoming the new Ridley Scott. Good with smaller budget films where he may actually put a shift in but appalling when larging it around with big budget "blockbusters" sh*te like these - what a complete and utter waste of time, money and talent on films that nobody is ever going to watch again ... Dreadful.
9.0~Best and knowledge blending movie adarsh-dk24012 Sign in Permalink This is the best movie, which blends the time travel and lot of information into a single script, it takes me 3 times to get the story completely. The director have moved the story in a nice way which makes the people to think before they can watch the movie. This also made me to think of "Is there really a 5th dimension??". Sure if you watch it deeply you can never get out of the concept unless you are fully aware of the story before you see. The screenplay was really outstanding and provided the best visual. Sound - nothing to mention, it was really awesome. And about the cast, they were excellent and blend nicely into the character. Lets hope there is a sequel to this movie which suggest how she solved the equation with her fathers help and it may help me to get the story to full end. This is really challenging story and I will be waiting for its sequel.
6.0~A visually epic film trublu215 Sign in Permalink Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.
1.0~Boring and cliché - the nice art of Hollywood trailers bogdanrc Sign in Permalink I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Big fan of Nolan's work, except Inception. The movie is a soup of physics and personalities clichés, overstretched over 3 hours of beautiful visuals braided with a childish plot and stupid characters. A similar movie which comes to mind is Prometheus. There is absolutely no connection with the people involved, and each and every one of them became unlikeable at some point in time. The attempts to define the way people behave are as childish as the plot that reverts into itself. Worse than the worst episode from the Star Trek saga. Apparently Hollywood must stick with the trailers, as they are brilliant. The movies that follow are trash. Nolan should come down from the sky ego he's in, and start making good intelligent movies again. Such a pity... IMDb of 9.3?! How many paid people are there to score 10s?!
10.0~A movie like this only comes around every so often. petricor Sign in Permalink So you've come here to read what all the hype is about? Wonderful! I won't go into too much detail about the actual film, because this one's enjoyed best if you don't spoil things for yourself. Seriously, don't do that. Let me preface this by saying I watched Interstellar twice in the movie theatre last November (and a few times since then). It's just that good of a journey. First off, I want to address this, "So, how complicated is this movie? Do I need to know a lot about astrophysics?" Well, that depends. I went with a couple of friends and none of them are interested in black holes, wormholes, space travel AT ALL. Some were confused throughout the movie, some weren't. I think it depends on how well you personally pay attention. This is not a movie for you to munch your popcorn throughout the dialogue scenes, because you WILL miss important things, especially with the much talked about sound editing (the music overpowers dialogue at times -- this has been explained as being intentional for showing the character's emotional reactions instead, take of that what you will). It doesn't hurt to brush up on concepts like general relativity, wormholes, and black holes, but it's really unnecessary. A lay-person will get this movie if they pay attention. After all, Christopher Nolan is known for cerebral films for a reason. If you need a comparison, Inception is way more convoluted than Interstellar is. I'm not even exaggerating. Interstellar just deals with trickier physics concepts, but it's actually straight-forward. So what is Interstellar? Interstellar is family drama dressed up in space sci-fi clothes. The key here is the fiction part of sci-FI. If people can suspend their disbelief when watching the latest X-Men movie, they can suspend their disbelief watching Interstellar. This movie doesn't deserve the flack it gets for being "unreal." It takes physics knowledge (which are mostly theories to this day anyway) and uses it in a realistic manner. If you need 100% truth, you should not be watching sci-fi films. There are documentaries and actual textbooks for that sort of stuff! The more important question is is Interstellar logical? By far, its plot is grounded and knows what it is. Everything here is top-notch. The acting. The plot. The cinematography. The music. Both times at the cinema, I was surrounded by a mostly male audience. Let me tell you what happened both times when the credits began to roll. Silence. Utter silence as people just sat there either brushing the tears from their eyes or holding them back. Yes, I saw grown men getting emotional, and no, it's not wrong. In fact, it was really great to see how it wasn't just me clearly affected by Interstellar. I'm not a parent. I don't even want kids in the future, yet the family drama deeply moved me in a way I didn't think possible. I don't cry during movies. When a movie's over, I can reflect on how much I enjoyed the ride, but I don't really contemplate on any matters. That wasn't the case with Interstellar. Interstellar's message was highly ambitious. It wanted to tell us something about not only ourselves as individuals, but ourselves, as a species. I don't want to spoil anything more, so I won't, but suffice to say, I can't believe simple tripe (in both actual plot and scope of its message) like Gravity can get so much praise or how a movie like American Sniper can get nominated for Best Picture when Interstellar had so much more to offer to all of us as human beings. I know I sound rather grandiose right now. Maybe some will call it pretentious. I don't care. Interstellar took itself dead seriously and more importantly it earnestly sought to tell each moviegoer its message. I don't know about you, but when we're constantly bombarded by crappy, brain-dead movies, I think that's very honorable. We should all thank Christopher Nolan for being amongst the directors who actually still care about making aesthetic films which make us think a little harder. There's not many of them still left in town. tl;dr - Interstellar is a treasure. A movie with both heart and science. Christopher Nolan's emotional tour de force. Simply, a must-watch for anyone.
1.0~169 minutes I will never get back tstudstrup Sign in Permalink Complete crap!! Christopher Nolan is the most over-rated director in Hollywood!!! I only watched it because I have just seen Matthew Mcconaughey in Dallas Buyers Club where he was fantastic. He was good in this too.... But the movie sucks ass and balls!!It is no masterpiece!! Strap in for 2 hours and 49 minutes where nothing happens. "SPOILER AHEAD" Farmer and some astronauts goes into space to save his kids and the people on earth because our planet is dying and people are starving. Because of hyper-sleep and a black hole and some other nonsense they spend 84 years in another galaxy, looking for a new planet that the human race can populate. They don't age at all because of hyper-sleep and because time is different. Then they find Matt Damon, who was send out there to find a new home for humans. For no reason at all Damon's character is a bad-guy, because maybe Nolan at this point realized something had to happen after 90 minutes of boredom. Damon tries to kill Matthew the farmer and escape in their spaceship but accidentally kills himself. Oh and two of the other good guy astronauts are killed. More boring crap happens and Matthew wakes up at a space-station, now 124 years old, but physically only 40, like when he left. He sees his daughter on her death bed and goes back into the black hole or whatever to find the always annoying Anne Hathaway (the only other surviving astronaut) who found the planet the human race needs to survive. The end. Save yourself the torture and avoid this stinking turd. It makes the boring Inception seem like a good movie. Apart from nice visual effects, some taken directly from Inception, this is Nolans worst movie so far. I just hope Hollywood will wake up and realize Nolan had ONE good movie in him: "The Dark Knight" and stop green-lighting his pretentious over-bloated crap. I quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park 1 to sum up this movie: That is one big pile of sh*t!!
2.0~For SiFi Fans I guess jdonalds-5 Sign in Permalink The theater sound was somehow screwed up for this movie. The dialog was very difficult to hear and the "background" music was way too loud. In spite of that just enough dialog got through to follow the story, but the sound problems weren't the real problem. I guess if you're a serious SiFi fan you might like this movie. I am not a big SiFi fan (other than the plausible Star Trek sort). I didn't enjoy this movie. There was no real foundation for why the earth was failing; you're supposed to guess. There was no background to suggest power sources for space vehicles that would last so long. There was no explanation for how the sleep modules worked. In fact there was no foundation or explanation for pretty much anything in the movie. You were just supposed to believe. There is no preparation for the flight. Cooper is an experienced pilot but the crew doesn't seem to know each other so they spent no time together before the multi-year flight. You're just supposed to accept all of that and look past it. Near the end Cooper ejects himself from his space craft out into space in his space suit. He's in a distant galaxy accessible through a worm hole but the last we knew he seems to have gotten trapped in a black hole. There is nothing but hocus pocus that has him land in a hospital on a space station at the end of the movie; no rescue attempt, nothing. You're just supposed to believe. I don't mind wild scenarios but they have to be plausible at least. Maybe even 50% plausible? I truly had a difficult time sitting through the movie and was glad when it was over. I wish I had stayed home and watched reruns of The Big Bang Theory. The movie was a waste of time and money.
1.0~Dumb, dumber, dumbest! max_tout Sign in Permalink This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway ..... Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around. There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then. A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy. They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible. So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it. No, no, noooo. They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there. And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes? Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan? By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh! And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh! And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned. Not Nolan. NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans. Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing. And I loved Inception!
4.0~One of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched milicatadic-64328 Sign in Permalink Everyone was praising this movie but honestly the ending was really bad for me. Maybe it's because I don't know much about that stuff about dimensions and other things mentioned. But honestly it really disappointed me. And in the whole movie there was too much physics so if you don't know it well you probaby wouldn't understand most of the things. The other thing that was useless was the whole thing about love. It didn't fit well into the theme of the movie and it was unnecessary.
1.0~waste of time m-dybdal Sign in Permalink i have no clue why so many like this movie .. its insane SLOW and nothing happened and when something do happened they make it feel like ... nothing happened.. the actors is good but to call this a adventure or a sci-fi movie is a joke and a bad one ... this is a drama and a bad one at the top of it ... the story line feels flat like a pancake for close to 3 Danm hours ... I WANT MY MONEY AND THE 3 HOURES BACK GOD DANM IT !!! hated it .. and never gonna read any of IMDb's reviews again ...and why do i need to have 10 lines about crap i can say in one work " CRAP " yup that was insane hard -.- and what really pisses me off about this crap is that they call it a adventure / sci-fi ... 1 this movie is NOT a adventure at all .. 2 this movie is NOT a sci-fi at all and to even say that it is ... is bullshitt this movie is a crappy space drama and thats not the same as a sci-fi
4.0~Despite great visuals a disappointment guruprasad-368-587925 Sign in Permalink I watched this on IMAX, but could have as well watched it on a normal screen. Many so called Sci-fi nuts will not like my review here, but I have to be honest. In the movie, a combination of bad acting, cliché situations and melodrama masks, the otherwise beautiful representation of the cosmos. There is no doubt behind the effort put in representing the wormhole or the Gargantua or the sequence of the spacecraft traveling through the cosmos, but it was not supported with good acting and strong science fiction script (even fiction can have nice theories made into beautiful script). Some of the scenes were laughable (like "that will work" - about the so called novel white-board plan by Cooper or Cooper saying "Love is quantifiable" or smth like that) The attempt at philosophy , human values or thought, was at the best mediocre. Also Christopher Nolan could not resist bringing in the cliché 'Hero saving the day' part. Interstellar is being often compared with 2001:A Space Odyssey, but other than using 'Organ music' during some scenes it does not come any closer (I am aware that 2001:A Space Odyssey uses Classical and Orchestra pieces of the classic masters, not just Organ music) In the end I am very relieved that, all the 'They' in the movie did not lead to 'God', to that extent Mr. Nolan has kept it within the bounds of Science and reason. That said; here are some of the good parts: TARS the robot, Wormhole, Gargantuan, Space travel, representation of cosmos and black-hole, alien planets and some of the background music. In conclusion: Interstellar could have been a pure Sci-fi movie or an action Blockbuster or a philosophical one or just even a mega budget tech show, but it tried to be all of this at once and ended being none.
10.0~a little review about the movie demirseda Sign in Permalink Although this movie is in theaters since the beginning of November, there are no tickets left to watch it in Istanbul, Turkey. I had the chance to watch it finally. It was a great experience for me to watch this movie with all those excited people, who thrilled by the effects and emotional things in the movie. Maybe the visual effects are not sufficient in a few things. But in general, our eyes and brains had the most pleasant moments during the movie. For the Turkish audiences, I suggest them to read this info after you saw the movie. It included some facts and scientific reviews about the movie. :http://www.evrimagaci.org/fotograf/71/6710 You may say I'm a dreamer but, I'm looking forward to see the second Interstellar movie.
10.0~My respect for Nolan has become ten-folded harish_reddy Sign in Permalink I have really no words to say. I must say I had one of the best experiences of my life. Mathew and Anne Hathaway's performances were brilliant. Traversing through black hole with the gravity, the way it was shown and scenes where time is shown as a physical dimension were simply breathtaking. Nolan is at his best like always. Hans Zimmer was appropriate. The story is not as complex as inception. The special effects are too good. The film is very emotional in the middle after the relativity concept is shown where time slows down and the kids get older. I've studied the relativity and black holes in theory a bit in my schooling and my engineering. But it was never so interesting until I watched Interstellar . it really proves Nolan is an excellent storyteller . I didn't had a single dull moment. It basically shook my senses just like all of Chris's old movies. Lot of Science Fictions in the past have shown that the world is ending and someone does a supernatural feet and the world is saved. Interstellar is different. Although they completely do not find the solution for the problem, they are in the right direction trying to solve it which did not feel incomplete. It was not doubtful to believe that this will be the future. The problem on earth was shown more naturally and straightforward without too much of drama. In the end, Interstellar is thought provoking, emotional, thrilling and has everything you expect in a great movie.
3.0~The Grapes of Wrath meets 2001 dmaboyer Sign in Permalink I am being generous by giving it 3 stars. First it is way, way too long. Second, I was given to understand that it was a movie about going to space to hunt for a new planet. Most of the story takes place on Earth. It is almost an hour in before they even leave the Earth. Third I am getting really tired of "the earth is dying because of what we have done to it, poor poor us". I am not a flaming non-global warming person, but I think that this environmental disaster stuff in every movie is getting a bit much. The first half was taken directly from Grapes of Wrath. The pickup trucks loaded with a families' possession heading off to a better life. If you want to see this done properly go watch the Grapes of Wrath. It is much better done. And at least it was based on a true story. The ending is ripped from 2001. Also done better than this movie. I know some people say there is not comparison but I don't buy it. I hate to say it but even the space visuals were done better in Gravity. I hated the story in Gravity but the visuals were stunning. Interstellar is just standard space disaster stuff with a bad story. I could spend hours talk about the plot holes but others have done that better. The only one thing I will mention. They need a rocket to boost their shuttle into escape velocity from the earth then when the were leaving a planet with more gravity then earth the small engines on their were just fine.
7.0~A good sci-fi drama, but needed more action and adventure! gavinp9 Sign in Permalink 'Interstellar' was a film I'd been waiting to see all year, and it certainly is a huge sci-fi film - $165 million budget - from one of the best filmmakers going round. Basically, we spend 40min on Earth in the not-too-distant-future, where all the crops are failing and Homo sapiens are about to be wiped from the planet. Cooper (McConaughey), Romilly (Gyasi) & Dr Brand (Hathaway) are then sent to another galaxy - via a wormhole - as a last grasp attempt to find another habitable planet. The film does really well of asking those big picture themes - what's more important, family of the entire species, love or exploration, why do we matter? However, as a sci-fi/action film, it sometimes lets itself down - the characters aren't that well developed, beside Cooper & his two kids (Chastain & Affleck when they're older) and there's too much maths/physics/relativity and not enough excitement and wonder. Sure, the special effects you do get to see of the black hole and the planets they visit are great, but there's just not enough of them - it's a lot of them in a space suit/ship with an overbearing Hans Zimmer's score making it hard to hear actual dialogue. It's probably slightly longer than necessary also - 2 hours 50min, with the last 30min being a less-than-ideal conclusion to the film. Hopefully Damon playing an astronaut prepares him for next year's 'The Martian', which should be more exciting than 'Interstellar'. Nolan - who will arguably one day go down as a directorial legend like Kubrick - owes a lot to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and essentially 'Interstellar' doesn't do anything better than that film 46 years ago. But it's not all bad - I think my expectations were too high, especially after 'Gravity' last year - with Caine & Lithgow being solid on Earth and the robots, TARS & CASE (very similar voices/roles to HAL in '2001' & GERTY in 'Moon') providing some humour (and a very unique form/function!).
4.0~One of the dumbest sci-fi films ever made salewow2008 Sign in Permalink The production values are A+ but the writing is that of a class B picture. Filled with ridiculous, spacious claims and assumptions. The premise itself is the weakest link, but then there is a ton of little mistakes like driving through a sandstorm or placement of the conference room, that can really strain ones suspension of disbelief. It's akin to presenting Cinderella as a re-imagining of what life was like in medieval times. what was amazing was that there was no sound in space scenes (other than music) e.g. on thrusters. Usually I would appreciate that but it was doubly distracting as they seem to have left a few dozen more obvious, glaring oversights in. Then there is the horrendous acting by Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain to a lesser extent. Those two ladies make Matthew McConaughey look like Alec Guinness. And McConaughey, with his annoying way of speech, like he's got his mouth full of peanut butter or some other brown substance, playing what has got to be one of the dumbest smart-guys in film history. In all fairness, they were probably going for tough but sensitive and smart just got lost in the cracks. It gets better as they get to the wormhole and some of the scenes located outside of earth are entertaining, it does not however save the viewer from a fate worse than Contact.
10.0~Interstellar: One of the best movies I've ever seen. WoutSelosse Sign in Permalink OK, so I am not the type of guy that says that every movie is good but with Interstellar it is really hard not to. This is really a great movie. The story has been put together very careful and is extremely hard to follow but when you understand it, you realize that it is a good movie. Interstellar made me think about the science of the universe. And since a lot of information is correct in the movie (the content witch is used in the movie is what we are seeing in class right now) it can be in some way educational. But a lot of content they use is based on possible things. for example: I think is is a real possibility that there is a 4th dimension bus for us humans it is very hard to imagine that. But they make that unimaginable 4th dimension accessible for people. But since we and some scientists are not sure that the unknown information is true, is it awesome how the movie sticks together. Interstellar: Great plot, it is awesome how the people who made interstellar take our imagination for a spin, and make the possibility that the content of the movie is reality so realistically possible. That is what makes this movie so great Wout Selosse, Sunday the 9th of November at 11am, Belgium.
2.0~bad review connormacleod84 Sign in Permalink quick and simple review. i gave it 2 out of 10. it started out great i was sucked in. but then for some reason the writers seemed to mix it up with a twist at the end that wasn't needed. and completely trashed the film. on another note it was hard to get past the fact that i feel it was matt damons worst performance i have seen. and i am a matt damon fan. so in a summary. the first half of the movies was great, but its hard to hold onto that first half when i came to vote due to how bad the 2nd half got. on a personal note. if mat damon reads his bad reviews like some do. then sorry but as a fan of yours. i have to say. you was in my top 3 actors that you could always count on being a great movie when you see they are in it. but intersellar,Elysium i found to be bad movies. plus The Monuments Men i stopped watching half way in when i realized its just boring and not getting any better.
3.0~Plot holes and dead-ends, virtually no character development. kylemcewen12 Sign in Permalink I went to see Interstellar excited to see both a sci-fi film and the new Christopher Nolan film; I left feeling as though I hadn't seen a film at all but nearly three hours worth of undeveloped characters stumbling from one inexplicable and unnecessary plot twist to the next. Nolan intentionally keeps many of the details of his future world hidden, however, is so clumsy with the details that he does provide that by the end of the film the plot comes together to seem like an utter farce. None of the characters are developed enough for the audience to identify with them and as a result the numerous and lengthy close-ups of teary eyed individuals is tedious and tiresome. Many capable actors are kept to only a few relatively insignificant lines but then later reveal massive plot shifts only moments before being killed off. This drastically reduces the emotional impact of the film despite how clearly Nolan is trying to tug at the audience's heart strings. Even the pace of the film (typically a strength of Nolan's) is way off. Much like Inception and the Batman series, Nolan whisks the story along inviting you to forget one or two potential plot holes in order to keep the audience engaged. However, in Interstellar, the plot holes are far too big to ignore and the fast pace often ends with a dead-end plot development. It feels as though Nolan is rushing through individual sequences just to land his plot right back where it started. By the third act, the audience is left wondering what was really accomplished by the first two. The greatest let-down of the film comes at the crescendo, with the audience eagerly awaiting at least some explanation of the numerous confusing plot twists. No such catharsis is offered because it was never intended. The film ends much as it began, disjointed and seemingly without direction. I realize that this review will seem quite vague to most readers who have not seen the film: I have tried hard to avoid spoiling any plot details. But let me be clear about one thing. The mysteries contained in this film are not well calculated omissions to keep the audience wondering, (as in Kubrick, Lynch or even Nolan's Inception) but clear inconsistencies that the director hopes he can distract the audience from through pacing and special effects. What he misses is that good pacing comes from good acting as much as directing. And good special effects only work when the audience isn't preoccupied with wondering why this particular sequence is happening in the first place. Nolan would do better to cut out many of the unnecessary plot twist sand spend more time letting the many capable actors tell his story and draw the audience in. In Kurick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the most compelling, emotional performance of the film was given by a Robot named HAL. Nolan achieves the same feat in Interstellar with the robot TARS. However, in Interstellar, this is not so much a testament to the director's ability to get the audience to empathize with a machine (as Kubrick did) but a statement about how poorly Nolan was able to tell the story through any of the human characters.
10.0~Gravity wins seven Oscars and this wins one? timberlinetoast Sign in Permalink Interstellar is simply on another level. It doesn't pretend to be an accurate representation like Gravity, because it knows it's a fantasy. With that out of the way, the director was able to flesh out a brilliant storyline, instead of trying to portray itself as some sort of documentary like Gravity does. Gravity is a fun roller coaster ride no doubt, but it's woefully overrated.
2.0~Farcical drudge delivered by a man that cannot even talk properly. uchihajax Sign in Permalink The trend that a hero talks in a gravelly drawl reaches its climax in this film as Matthew McConaughey spends the entire film trying his best to speak without using his mouth and pretty much fails to complete a single sentence. Whereas most people are able to send words flying from their maw Matthew just lets them slither from his lips whereupon they plummet to the floor and their meaning is lost the audience. So prepare to spend your time with this film constantly twiddling the volume so you have a chance of catching the dialogue.... So the film itself? About as exciting as a brisk walk around an industrial estate. Painfully slow to start and once it does finally begin it generates pretty much a single spot of excitement before becoming desperately dull again. The science as well as most of the social interactions within this film are full of plot holes which I'll spare you due to the spoilers but if you think about the film after watching it a lot of it doesn't really make any sense. The climax of the film is somewhat boring combined with fanciful and a painfully tiring family tie in. No idea why everyone else thought this film was any good. I thought it was drivel.
3.0~No spoilers, but the movie was a big spoiler for me slipstreamknight Sign in Permalink I feel like I am on a different planet due to the ratings on this site. I feel that a lot of reviewers are really confused, that they really could not put a description of what the whole movie was about but they pinned it on two factors 1. the special effects (and is why i gave it a three rating.) I would have given a more fair review on the effects if the plot and story was better. But I am being unfair because in my opinion the story was pretty bad. 2. most of the ratings are based on the oh ah moment near the end during the communication thing between dad and daughter. That was just not enough in my opinion. All the descriptions the director tried to explain during the movie failed failed and then failed again. If they would have shortened the movie to 1.5 hours, It would not have been a little less disappointing. But this director ended up making it so long because it appears, he was pretty confused himself. I really need to contact Scotty to beam me out of this planet if this movie is really going to get an 8.9 rating. SCOTTY! PLEASE!
10.0~Thought-provoking, mind-enriching, and heart wrenching sci-fi drama. prospectus_capricornium Sign in Permalink 'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars. To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced. At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver. Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through. Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive. 'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise. This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)
10.0~Interstellar: How Film Can Make you Feel Adventure Again PostingandToasting Sign in Permalink Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, "Interstellar". I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an "event". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception. It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of "Interstellar" because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come. McConaughey has always had that "movie star" potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. "Interstellar" was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Jaws", puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in "Close Encounters" or Roy Schneider in "Jaws". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be. The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like "Gravity" last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for "the science isn't accurate". Those comments are nonsense because no matter what "science" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of "what can be". It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like "Interstellar" In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds. People will remember "Interstellar" for either being a truly great film experience or "not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey". This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to "2001" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as "Interstellar" come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility. In the end, "Interstellar" is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it.
10.0~Very very excellent movie mhkamalinezhad Sign in Permalink I can not believe!!! What an amazing movie!!!! It makes me crazy!!! I must see it again!!!Wowwww...
2.0~Boring, clichés, plot holes hgl-616-10001 Sign in Permalink Lots of beautiful visuals to look at, but a completely unbelievable story line including just about every cliché you can think of: - Just before the film started, we were talking about how many movies started with a hero that has some kids in a distressed situation as it seems like this is a must nowadays to add emotional depth to the hero. Within minutes, this film starts with the hero whose wife died of cancer so he now has to raise the kids. - A drone from India flies over, hero grabs his laptop and takes over command of the drone in seconds. Sure. - All of this while driving full speed straight through a corn field, without the slightest bump. Sure. - The wind blows some dust into a room. Hero stares at is, understands it is a binary code of the coordinates of a top secret Nasa base. - Upon entering the base, he meets the beautiful and smart daughter of the professor. Of course that becomes the predictable love affair, but of course she is first difficult to get and of course the hero first has to save her life at least once. - They blow up half of their space station with an enormous explosion, but no problem, just continue flying with the other half. - Earth needs to manipulate gravity to save humanity. No problem, just fly through a black hole and you will automatically gain any knowledge needed. - But wait, they still have to transfer that knowledge to Earth. The only way to do that is to have the hands of an old watch sway up and down in a Morse code because that watch has a love connection to hero's daughter. And with love you can do what all your technology cannot. (Here goes all your respect for this film using believable technology.) - After years in space, the hero is saved with just a few minutes oxygen left. Altogether it seems that Nolan fans have pumped up the score of this film far beyond a reasonable score.
10.0~Absolutely Brilliant! mistapitts Sign in Permalink The theoretical physics involved were astounding. Don't know how else to describe it. The futuristic "Dust Bowl." The dictation of education. The dimensional transitions. It couldn't be any more logical. Yes it's all "Sci-Fi", but every scientific theory was considered "Sci-Fi" at some point in time. This movie nails the scenario it portrays. This will probably remain as my favorite Matthew McConaughey movie forever. I have to say, it may beat Inception on my scale of favorites if any of the theoretical science comes to fruition. Inception is incredibly fictional, however not impossible and was, hands down, my favorite Sci-Fi movie ever. Interstellar is now in a shoving match with it between my top 2.
3.0~A new genre is born: un-sci-fi or vague philosophical drivel for the masses AAAAAMovieFan Sign in Permalink Initially, this movie was an interesting approach to a well-worn plot... Environmental disaster causes colonization in space... The dust bowl setting was convincing and we wanted to sympathize with the engineer turned farmer and his family. A series of bizarre occurrences lead to a dash to save the world as we know it... And all science from the sci fi deserts us about halfway in... Apparently it's now sufficient to use a few familiar phrases... Relativity, wormhole, Gravity, space time continuum... Without actually tying any of it to a remotely possible set of scenarios... Where psychic connections, love conquers all and a little morse code suspend all science or reality and the good guys miraculously survive and conquer.
1.0~Super Disappointing and Boring wethreesims Sign in Permalink This was a 3 hour movie with no character development!!! For a Christopher Nolan film I was expecting a lot from it. Some of the acting was mediocre, but most of it was really staged and bad. The graphics could have been much better as well. The movie was too long and I felt like nothing happened the whole time. I considered walking out in the middle, and the only reason I didn't is because I was with someone else. There was so much room for improvement and I really didn't feel like it accomplished anything. I hated all of the characters and it was super confusing. I didn't understand what was going on for the first half of the film and the majority of it felt like unnecessary filler. I really like and respect Christopher Nolan as a director/writer, but this film was one of his worst. I heard that a lot of people liked it, but it seems like they just liked it because it's Christopher Nolan. It also seemed like it was trying too hard to win an Oscar by copying the idea of award winning movie Gravity.
6.0~science or fantasy? tekiradige Sign in Permalink nolan tries to tell that humanity will evolve another type of existence is not limited by four dimensions. this theory involves gods of new age actually. i didn't hear any religious reference about existence or universe itself in the movie. even the characters never say a simple reflective reactive expression like "Jesus Christ" at any scenes. (i'm a Muslim by the way) that can be not coincident enough to stay in limits of reality i think. it's not a proper way to bring a new point of view to universe. you can't deny some basic humanitarian reactions or tendencies. nolan is so assertive to make a breakthrough for the perception of science but he does that by giving too much speculative and manipulative information and fiction to audience. the only thing he does in movie is to use metaphysical obscurity of being beyond time and space. so he can serve any claim with so many scientific terms even the claim seems so fantastic. anyway no one can imagine this claim by using physical senses and perceptions. i think there is no difference between to direct a movie about angels or demons who are claimed being beyond dimensions and to direct a movie about "they" who are claimed being beyond dimensions evolved from human being. so, too much fascinating musics and dramatic relationship between a father and a daughter can only be an eye wash for me.
1.0~Trump in space: America First santasa99 Sign in Permalink Little bit too late ? No, it's always advisable to squash the garbage if and when it falls into your path. Nolan brothers promised, as James Rocchi put it, "outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". Interstellar, as absolute "A"production, is one of the worst films ever made by Hollywood ! It fails in every department, both science & fiction (fantasy) in "SciFi" are ridiculous, but that was never good enough reason for failure: many "SciFi" films failed in science- fiction but excelled as films in story telling, acting, plot, details, dialogues, etc. This one is so awful that I can't decide where to begin. If I could, most obvious starting point would be it's infantile plot and dialogues (love "transcends the limits of time and space", ),... no, it would be idea of faux all-American heroism, patriotism masked as faux concern for "human race", faux American superior technology, and mythological unshakable will to go forward in the face of ultimate, apocalyptic adversity - who is better suited for "riding" NASA's rocket through the "wormhole" so that he can save the world, then white-Christian farmer-engineer-pilot from Texas !? As David Edelstein writes, "Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, clearly wants Interstellar to be a great American epic — The Grapes of Wrath II: The New Vintage". Eh, the amount of pathos: patriotism, family, American mythology & heroics - I was, I am, all cowed ! Only great act of entire movie is Michael Caine's dying scene, but you have to try really hard to remove his Dylan Thomas reciting from your mind first. Ehhhh... Cooouuupeh, take us to the starsssssseh ! Deus Ex McConaughey
10.0~A cinematic masterpiece. tateantonorsi-16723 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan wrote and directed a movie that has merged the fields of art and science in a manner never done before. The film is beautiful and the cast does incredible job and capturing your emotions. Easily my favorite movie of all time.
10.0~Just the music alone makes it great. Westeire Sign in Permalink The Hans Zimmer music is spectacular in this movie. Without a doubt this will be a classic movie for years and years. Not going to ruin the story, its science fiction. there is not an over use of CGI. I thought it was better than inception, which I also liked. Both movies had a play on the perception of time, other worlds. Unlike inception, this movie had a strong tug at the heart with a lot of emotion. The very fact so many people are talking about this movie will make you want to go and see it. Also its really a movie you have to watch on the big screen. Its well done. the nearly 3 hours was good, it did it justice. f
10.0~Perfect ayhanozyazici Sign in Permalink The best film I've ever seen in my life. I don't think it would be better.
5.0~Take away the visuals and the soundtrack and the feelings of grandeur - and you get utter nonsense Diptoman Sign in Permalink DISCLAIMER: I'm in general, a huge Nolan fan. There are times when you can ignore plot holes in films, and times when you can't. You can overlook some when the pacing is fast, or when the film doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, Interstellar does neither - it's unnecessarily slow and takes itself really, really seriously. And it's full of plot holes, fallacies, paradoxes, and logic taking a beating in general, to fulfill some emotional quotient - which, I must say, worked on most people. Let's start with the whole premise the film is based on - in the future, earth's resources have been drained, and everyone has turned into farmers - with conscious efforts to eradicate science education in general to force people to go into farming. Let's take a moment here to realize just how ridiculous that premise is. Moving on - our protagonist is a genius NASA astronaut/engineer turned farmer (because, y'know, everyone's a farmer) - and the first half mostly shows him bonding with his family, with completely unnecessary scenes to prolong the film - like taking down a lost drone (by pointing things towards it), which had no relation to the story later whatsoever. Then our hero stumbles onto a NASA facility (if you aren't a farmer, you're with NASA) after decoding things which occurred due to... uhh, gravitational anomalies. This NASA facility, as claimed by uberscientist Michael Caine, was humanity's best kept secret, though 5 minutes into that - all our hero's family members were informed about it. So anyways, since our hero stumbled into the facility anyway, uberscientist decides to send him into space to save humanity because, well, just like that. We get to see our hero saying goodbye to his family and immediate fast forward - he's in space! No training, no nothing! Economic storytelling, certainly, and it would've worked, had the other "scientists" on board later didn't have to explain things and plans to him on the fly (which, for all intents and purposes, should've been explained before leaving) - and having conversations that were mostly like what college freshmen studying physics would have. (Oh, and discussions about love! Love transcending all dimensions - when humanity is at stake!) Anyway, so future earth has the technology to do all this, and build robot A.I.s which were more human than most humans, but it doesn't have doctors any more, or any other visible technological advancements for that matter. All efforts to save humanity were concentrated on ONE and just ONE uberscientist, who'd been working on his cure-all formula for years. And every other scientist have just been waiting for him to solve it all himself! (And what's this? Other nations you ask? Well there ain't no other nation apart from the USA to do earth saving, is there?) This is something I particularly take offense to, scientists don't work that way. So, Nolan throws more science at us on the fly, which everyone dodges. But in the end, everything is explained by, yep, five dimensional space! Somehow our hero gets into such a space, goes back in time (opening up a ton of paradoxes), behind a bookshelf in 5D space, and uses vague messages to communicate with his daughter back in time, instead of giving clear messages like "I'm your father back in time". His daughter, when all grown up - suddenly realizes that it was his father all along and we get no clue as to how she got to that conclusion - but hey, PLOT TWIST! And with that new information, she becomes the new uberscientist, saving everyone. How? By making an orbiting space station around Saturn (for which you somehow required "quantum data" from other galaxies and black holes?). So okay uhh... it's complicated. There are however, some great visuals (3D would've done justice) and soundtrack in this, and hence the 5 - but ultimately nothing we haven't seen before. Beyond all that glitter, there's no gold - just a forgettable movie.
2.0~Uh.....I Just Don't Get This At All. velocity-smythe Sign in Permalink How this travesty of a "sci-fi" movie has garnered so many gilded reviews is proof that either A) I am way out of step with the great, unwashed movie-going masses or B) the aforesaid masses have never seen a truly great "sci-fi" flick. This movie was interminable; I almost walked out 38 minutes into the run, when Mathew was still just a former test pilot trapped in the body of a corn-huskin' farmer. Which leads me to my first problem with Interstellar: would you "hire" a corn-huskin' farmer and devoted Dad of 2 to be the pilot of an intergalactic space mission? Aside from 1 or 2 very brief allusions, there is ZERO explanation / justification for Matt to be selected for this mission. And strangely enough, Michael Caine ages not 1 day in the 23 years since Matt blasts off for "strange new worlds". He is still in the same pants and shirt as he was when Matt blasted off (23 years before); the directors did give Mike a wheelchair for good measure. Before I proceed, there were 2 or 3 somewhat interesting plot twists, and the CGI / special FX were very good (just like "Gravity", another recent "sci-fi" disappointment); although the robot was utterly ridiculous; more like a walkin', talking' 21st century soda machine or a "Gen 12" Robbie the Robot. Of course, CGI and special FX alone do not a classic "sci-fi" film make. I cannot disclose 2 major plot disappointments due to the "spoiler" clause but suffice it to say the powers behind this film have tried to fuse an entry level class in quantum physics with an action film; and it just didn't work. I have now accepted, grudgingly, that for enough money you can get the finest actors to play in the most ludicrous films. Read the cast list; scratch your heads in disbelief, along with me. And if you want a classic "sci-fi" movie? Try 2001, Blade Runner, and Alien.
5.0~Not stellar Ar_Pharazon_the_golden Sign in Permalink The Earth is dying. Wormhole appears leading to potential new planets to colonise. Ex-pilot farmer finds secret facility and is immediately put in charge of the mission. Now, the obvious but not primary complaint revolves around the fact there are (already viable) options to escape a dying Earth that are much easier to accomplish. Terraforming Mars? Yes! It would even take less time to set up an initial colony than this. Actually fighting the (never ever explained) crops' blight? We have genetic engineering, you know. We don't get to go extinct because of drought. More importantly, the entire plot of the movie leads to the launching of a space station. Already built, but on the ground, so it couldn't be launched - now, call me crazy, but building a space station, even a colossal, much bigger than this one, is an infinitely better option than crossing galaxies to find out how to get this one off the ground. I think the film tries to explain this away with "we are working in secret, people wouldn't support the space programme". This is wrong in a million ways, from the fact that secretly building habitable space stations can't be harder than sending secret missions to travel through a wormhole around Saturn, to "people should have probably realised the world is ending so hey, THEY JUST MIGHT SEE THE LOGIC HERE", with a stop in "who cares what they think, we never intend to save them anyway". Not to mention I can't quite get how and why they sent the initial missions without the potential of returning - it would save a lot of time to just send them through, check the planets and return. And yes, that would be a better option even if you only consider "Plan B". HOWEVER, this isn't the main problem. These are passable holes that can be accepted in favour of a compelling story. And that kind of happens, until the final part of the movie where our protagonist enters a black hole in another galaxy and voila, just like we feared from the beginning of the film, gets back home without reason, explanation, or a semblance of logic. We actually hear something like "love will help us transmit data from inside the event horizon to earth". There are limits to what you can get away with, and Nolan crosses the event horizon right about there. Add to that the fact that visiting the planet close to the black hole first instead of leaving it as a last option is by all accounts a ridiculous decision, although I do understand that it's dramatically very useful and actually helps plot and character development. Visually, the film has its moments - but they are less than I had hoped. The journey through the wormhole and in the black hole are superb. So is the visual representation of the 5-D (?) library - if you can look past how Cooper gets there. But the planets visited are not particularly memorable. The dying Earth is just a sad rural landscape. The new human society is a suburban torus where you look outside the window to see the surviving human race (a couple of thousand Americans by the look of it)...playing baseball. The main idea of the film isn't bad. The execution is severely lacking. The expectation-result equilibrium isn't great. I do give a point for the use of Dylan Thomas, a fabulous poem that fits into the story wonderfully. Let's remember this, if anything, from Interstellar, for when our species faces great adversity: We must not go gentle into that good night.
1.0~I resent this film inframan Sign in Permalink I resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism, its artistic laziness & its technical sloppiness. I resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. By virtue of its sheer popularity on IMDb it's a testament to the colossal, continuing dumbing down of movie audiences. Where to start on specifics? The premise of a world-wide drought (a major blooper mentioned on this site) with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. Okra grown as a major food crop (or was that supposed to be a joke)? Cut & paste interviews from a Ken Burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. The tiresome cheapie "homages" to Kubrick's 2001. The pedantic Astrophysics for Dummies lectures.The soap opera characters. The one dimensional acting. The utter predictability of every single plot twist. I'd get more specific, but then I'd be blacklisted for including spoilers. You want to see imaginative mind-blowing science-fiction/fantasy film making? Let me make 2 suggestions: Stalker and Solaris. Both Russian films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Far lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar. In summary the sheer numbing dullness & stupidity of Interstellar (& its concomitant popularity) managed to knock me into the worst state of depression I've experienced from a movie in years.
10.0~complete out performer. sandipraychaudhury Sign in Permalink I had the golden opportunity to watch this life time movie Interstellar,twice. A complete out performer. I vehemently and personally believe that this spectacular creation of Mr. Christopher Nolan can certainly replace Mr. Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption as the best movie,in the IMDb top movies list. The art of story telling with camera has certainly been personified to its zenith by Mr. Nolan. Keeping Physics as the pivotal ingredient. Movies like Interstellar needs to be watched time and again. Over the years, generation after generation. There are certain questions which would certainly come to one's mind after coming out of the theatre. As the question's answer can be understood only after repeated views.No matter how much one pays to watch this movie or no matter how much one apreciates, it will always be to little for such a massive human creation.
2.0~Interstellar Missed by a Galaxy - 2/10 - *** SPOILERS *** onick-papazian Sign in Permalink This is my first review on here but I had to say something. I just left the theater and I haven't felt like this in 15 years. Yes, that's right, not since 1999, not since, dare I say it, "Star Wars - Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace". And I've only been waiting for this movie for a little over a year! All I have to say is the following; Interstellar was an incoherent, implausible, unscientific, misandrist mess. *** SPOILERS BEGIN HERE *** 1. The protagonist in this film, Cooper, is denied the prize of his journey and sacrifice only to give it to the female characters of the movie. His daughter inherits the knowledge of both her father and Caine's scientist character and mysteriously solves the gravity equation which inexplicably saves the world. Anne Hathaway's character is saved by Cooper's sacrifice so she can become some galactic 'Eve' on a new planet. Ridiculous. What is she going to do, make an appointment at the IVF clinic on planet X? Is she going to give birth to ten daughters and artificially inseminate them in turn? Nonsense. 2. The antagonist, Matt Damon's character, is nothing but a caricatured villain whose motivations are never explained. He is shown as being weak and a coward. No one with these qualities would ever volunteer for a mission like this or last this long on a desert planet without killing themselves. They even called him Dr. Mann which makes him come across as representing all men as weak and evil. Ugh! 3. The old and wise scientist turns out to be a liar. Michael Caine's character is shown to have duped everyone on the mission because he knew somehow that plan A would never work? He's just and @#$#? WTF! 4. The brother, who for some reason Cooper doesn't give two @#$% about turns into an insane madman. 5. The mission which takes them on a journey for thousands of light years of space travel only to circle back to a little girl's bedroom to show that a girl's intuition and love trumps science on any day of the week! Absolute nonsense!!! THE ONLY MEN IN THIS MOVIE THAT ARE GIVEN ANY REDEEMING QUALITIES IS THE BLACK MAN AND THE ROBOT. Mr. Nolan, and I'm sure you read this garbage, please take this advice for your next film: You don't need to water down your male heroes with emotional drivel and juvenile female sentiment to get women to watch your movies. You did this in Inception and TDKR when you jammed in Marion Cotillard's awful emotional subplots into an otherwise brilliant story. Take the example of 2010: Odyssey Two. A forgotten sci-fi gem of the eighties. This movie had a very strong female lead played brilliantly by Hellen Mirren. Her character was most believable because she was in balance with her equally strong, intelligent male counterparts which included Roy Scheider and John Lithgow (anyone catch the hot dog reference?). If you modeled this movie after 2010 instead of 2001, I think you could have reached your biggest audience. Unfortunately, I will not be part of this one. I gave this movie two stars for some original ideas the movie tried to do. The story, the score and some god-awful performance by Matt Damon made it impossible to keep this movie together. Etc, etc, etc... DSMan
1.0~Poorly written with a terribly weak Plot hoodshowmanager Sign in Permalink This has to be the most abysmal piece of science fiction writing of the decade. The science was absolutely pathetic - planets orbiting "Gargantua", a black hole, and not one, but two planets. Time dilation from being on a black hole planet. A water world with ankle deep oceans and two mile high waves. A wormhole near Saturn put in place by aliens. Earth's ecosystem collapsing because of a nitrogen-fueled "blight". The list goes on and on. This writing puts the "stink" in STINKS BIG TIME, and the authors, the Nolan brothers, are clearly intellectual midgets who appear to have spent a fair amount of time watching the Discovery Channel and understanding almost none of it. Moreover, it's completely derivative, a mimicry medley of dozens of Sci-fi themes - Black holes, worm holes, astronauts going nutty in isolation, time dilation, Earth as an eco-dystopia . . there's not one original thought or theme in any of it. It's dark and hopeless until the bitter end, when some weird trans- dimensional "oasis" in the middle of a black hole allows Matthew McConaughey to communicate the big secret about "gravity" to his scientist-daughter, who proceeds to then save all of mankind. Only we're not really sure how she accomplishes that salvation. Then the fiction itself was awful - not a good story, with a choppy, discontinuous plot like that keeps you reaching for the remote to back- step a scene or two, thinking you missed something. Only you didn't. Bad directing. Characters that mumble. Cryptic messages sent by the families to the astronauts gone on a 20 . . .50 . . . .(we're never sure how long) mission. Even a star-studded cast with McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, William Devane and more couldn't save this massive stink bomb. I come away with three very strong convictions: One, I'm glad I paid a $1.50 RedBox fee to view this dragging, nearly 3 hour marathon candidate for Sci-Fi stinker of the 2010s decade. Two, I'm bitter I wasted an evening on this roach instead of doing something that is more fun, like having extended dental work done. Three, I'm going to remember the Nolan name and make certain I never pay to watch or read anything penned by either of these two benumbed, intellectually vacant nebbishes, ever again.
2.0~Stunning visuals cannot make up for storyline that woefully overreaches foghorn_clj Sign in Permalink Full disclosure: I had ZERO interest in seeing this movie in the first place. But I got dragged along by my friends to see it... and I wish I could get my 3 hours back. There are 4 fundamental issues I have with this movie: 1. The length Nolan could've easily gotten 2 or 3 movies out of the script for this movie. In it's own right each "acts" of the story could've stood alone & been amazing. Instead Nolan condenses them together in a narrative that is flat and feels never ending. 2. You never connect to any of the characters on an emotional level. McConaughey's performance as the protagonist Cooper, whilst complex enough to keep you mildly interested, fails to hit any emotional notes. Even when he leaves his kids (possibly forever) I didn't care. And hathaway's character was mostly boring/annoying and her speech about love was painfully cliché. 3. The science fiction elements Now I'm no physicist but despite all the study previously completed about black holes we're just supposed to believe that a guy in a ship can fly into a black hole and not be pulled apart & magically escape???? Light can't escape a black hole but this guy can!! Now there's suspending disbelief and there's flagrantly ignoring years of scientific research. Oh and don't even get me started on the inception-style ridiculousness at the end and the magic revelations drawn by cooper and his daughter from thin air. The science makes NO SENSE. 4. TARS the robot As much as I can appreciate Nolan going away from the conventional android-type robot for the film, a robot that rolls across the water in the shape of an asterisk and picks someone up and rolls back??? Come on. On the plus side the robot was the funniest part of the movie (again probably got a great thing). In conclusion: The special effects were amazing but the story was a horrible mis-match of several ideas (some that worked and a lot that didn't).
10.0~a Sci-Fi masterpiece mnemon07 Sign in Permalink It doesn't matter if this is rated as Christopher Nolan's best or worst work. What matters is, this movie, though it is a sci-fi movie, is a movie about love. Its up there with Space Odyssey 2001 and Solaris (the original, not the remake). Its a Sci-fi movie that made me wipe my eyes. This is a true Nolan movie so there are unexpected plot twists and physics explanations that is confusing at times. They did hire theoretical physicist to make this movie and sci-fi events are based on his theories. For non physicists, just take things at face value and enjoy the movie. For those who are expecting this movie to be similar to: Armageddon, Transformers, Edge of Tomorrow, etc, you will be very much disappointed. Its not that kind of a sci-fi movie. Its more of a Cloud Atlas (not only because its almost 3 hours long) sci-fi than Guardians of the Galaxy action pack mindless entertainment. I am sure this movie will make it to top 20 movies on IMDb, despite a large portion of people who will hate it, because they expected to see something similar to Startrek, and didn't count on this movie to be so sentimental and didn't bring tissues.
10.0~Masterpiece from THE MASTER ! roysoumya76 Sign in Permalink Whether it is audacious or not, Whether it outdoes Kubrick's Odyssey or not,Whether it would get Oscar or not, That wont concern ! What matter is did I get the goosebumps or not while seeing ! And there it scores. You don't need to know General theory of Relativity. The Morse code, Wormholes, Spacetime can wait. you don't need to know physics at all. You just go to watch it and see the beauty of IMAX. Great performance from all those brilliant actors and actresses. And then the score by none other but the great Hans Zimmer ! But last, The Nolan brothers. Christopher Nolan delivers again. An epic voyage with lot of emotions. The astonishing cinematography is a pleasure to our eyes. Mankind is saved from destruction but it needs a great deal of courage and conviction. you get this here. Entering wormhole without violating physics is yet another milestone in the genre of science fiction. A monumental film with every aspects of life and science is depicted by Nolan.
8.0~Subpar compared to Inception & gravity hp-303-973831 Sign in Permalink Tries to be smart and gets it 70% of the time but movie is all over the place. Couldn't hear dialogs half the time because music soundtrack was too loud. Another movie where the USA saves the world, but get this -- Not only does the daughter solve the whole world's problems by solving complex issues unsolvable by the world's smartest people, but her dad saves Earth. Give them a double Nobel peace prize! Somehow father and daughter communicate thru space time via (gravity). Yes folks, next time your feet tickles, it could be your great grandparents communicating via the 5th dimension by Morse code.
5.0~What? No storm of asteroids? PointyTailofSatan Sign in Permalink I know it's a movie. And I know they have to include both science and "human interaction" elements to try and appeal to the widest audience. But I can't stand all the emotional baggage writers and directors seem to think is needed in a sci-fi movie. It's his refusal to reach for the lowest common denominator, and his uncanny realization of what travel in space is about, that made Kubrick and 2001 the peak of the sci-fi movie pyramid. Gravity? Oh ya, we almost got that figured out. By the time you get back, we will have flying cars. Wormholes that magically follow the orbital mechanics of the Sun and Saturn. How? Wormholes are bound in universal spacetime, not by a star's or planet's gravity. Meh, it's aliens. Done. We need a farmer/pilot as a lead character. But wouldn't the pilot or a ship like this really be a mathematician or physicist using celestial mechanics? Too boring. And personal conflict on board? Kubrick again shows his genius. IN 2001, Bowman and Poole would have been hand picked for their intellect, but also for their non-confrontational, all business (read "dull") personalities. The kind of personality that could be trapped in a cave for 5 months, get rescued, and say "well, that was interesting..." Maybe, just maybe, someday a director making a new sci-fi movie will say "forget the formula" and show us realistic tech, realistic acting, and realistic plots. But I doubt it. Movies are rarely art any more (V for Vendetta excepted!). It's all about the money.
10.0~As beautiful as a sunset prashanth-rp Sign in Permalink I am not sure if we fully understand the movie or if we should or if we can. Its just like watching a beautiful sunset. Slow, Beautiful, Inspiring and Philosophical. The sound and especially some times the lack of it in the space scenarios is amazing. The movie was used as a great canvas for Hans Zimer to unleash his raging musical art. I recommend watching the movie with an open mind and in an uninterrupted, high-definition format. Keep your questions to the end and then look into the IMDb forums if still unanswered. Some of the earlier scenes in the movie may not be as gripping to an extent that I wanted to take 1 or 2 stars off my review score , but they are necessary in building the characters and an in-depth plot.
6.0~a bit boring antoniotierno Sign in Permalink The word I'd use to define this story is contorted..Nolan's intelligence is out of discussion but the problem here is the difficulty of finding a key. All of this effort, all these questions, all of this movie and for what? There is no answer there. Nolan's mind has conceived Memento, The Prestige, Inception, and now Interstellar, always exploring relevant existential questions but there's always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of proportions. The movies are about love, they're spiritually generic and require a lot of production.. But the overall idea is that the viewer doesn't know where the story is going.. Again the previous question, what for..?!
10.0~Amazing Film! 10/10 Stars! shockproofx Sign in Permalink This is one of those very few films that stays in your mind even after you left the theater. I enjoy movies like this that makes you think. I think, this film deserves a Sequel or it can be a Trilogy...there's more stories to tell. They all did a great job. Good acting, well written story and well directed! The editing and the CG are fantastic, too! It made me feel I'm part of the movie. It's very long, but it felt short, because every scene makes you want to now what will happen next or why is it happening. My advice to those who are planning to watch this film...watch it on iMAX or at least 4K Digital...it's totally worth it!
1.0~#11 All-Time. . .Seriously? vinceb-3 Sign in Permalink The universe is full of fascinating facts. It's mind-bending to contemplate, for example, the awesome size of our galaxy. Light travels 186,000 miles per second and yet it takes 100,000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire Milky Way Galaxy. And our galaxy, to quote Carl Sagan, is only one among billions and billions. The vastness of space truly is stunning. But thanks to a "worm hole" the folks in Interstellar leave the Milky Way in a cosmic snap of the fingers. And yet, having just achieved this most amazing of all feats, our heroes are pretty much bored to tears. Instead, everybody is more concerned with some father/daughter relationship that wasn't developed in the first place. Look, if you're going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe, then do it! Have some wonderment in the story. Dazzle me not only with visuals, but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe. And why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics, or at least some theories thereof? This movie takes something that would dwarf the Apollo lunar missions and turns it into some ridiculous "Plan A/Plan B" tediousness. I suggest instead watching "Through the Wormhole" with Morgan Freeman or re- watching "2001: A Space Odyssey." Heck, even "Contact" with Jodie Foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than Interstellar. And yet. . .9.2 stars! I'm not saying 10-star reviews on this site are phony; after all, major film critics also are raving about Interstellar. Unfortunately, I find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie. Frankly, Interstellar is a boring movie! And if that puts me in the vast minority of reviewers, fine, I can live with that. Because I have minimum standards when I pay $11 for admission and $8.50 for large popcorn. Stay home and read a good book instead, or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universe.
1.0~Utter Rubbish tonyhancock28 Sign in Permalink I was really looking forward to this, being a Science fiction fan and looking forward to seeing an excellent cast deliver. I was utterly disappointing. In 30 years time, people will look back at this movie and laugh and just how wrong it really is. I have no problem with the latest scientific theories and this does try to relate to what you might call the pinnacle of modern physics. It gets it horribly wrong. I just cant stand how it introduces this science like we are all physicists and in an instant are expected to accept it as fact. Its a Science Fiction movie trying to be Science fact and ultimately this is why it fails. NO doubt it will receive rave reviews on here from Nolan fanboys who are all to eager to make intelligent remarks about how clever it really is. It really is not clever at all. Its bloated, ponderous and completely ludicrous. How on earth does it get 8.9??? pun intended.
1.0~Almost cried. Sad movie. Operation without anesthesia . anujgolu Sign in Permalink I was so hopeful about this movie. S[ace travel! Imagine all graphics and visual treat. What did I get? Weird accented cowboy masquerading as some both scientist and philosopher. 5-10% at best were the eye-catching scenes. rest is ultra low-IQ claptrap. After first 1 hour, I nearly cried, I couldn't take the torture. Maybe this is how it feels to undergo pancreatic tumour operation without anesthesia. Maybe that would be more benign and pleasant! Bad movie. For sheer disappointment and considering the pedigree of the director, I give it a generous 1/10.
1.0~A boring, badly written, try to be Sci-fi movie batiste-bieler Sign in Permalink I like Sci-fi movies. I loved the Prestige from Nolan. In the the other end I didn't care for Inception which I found really boring. This movie is a disappointment and I was not expecting anything. The story line is the main problem. Many things don't make sense and/or are magically happening. You can buy into the premise the earth is dying. But then you also have to buy that the main character has been guided to NASA by a himself using gravity trough a black hole created by Aliens... All of that to send a message to his daughter so she can find whatever truth about gravity and lift humanity into space so they can have farms there.. What? WTF? It feels like the Nolans tried to hide the stupidity of their script by piling up a lot of BS together so we feel overflowed with information and give up. Also, all the suspense and the drama feels fake and constructed and I didn't care about any of the characters, not even the main one. A character has to die, whatever I don't care. Die already. The side plot with the brother. I don't give a damn. There is many other holes and illogical things in this movie that are annoying and really difficult to buy. Like the evil Dr. Mann. Can't the NASA screen out cowards psychopaths when choosing a hero to save humanity? I guess not when they choose the to send a farmer that used to be in NASA 10 years ago on their last chance mission because he happened to try to break in their complex yesterday night. It makes perfect sense. Well there is many other comments here explaining the inconsistencies and plot holes so I will not go in more details.
10.0~Visually stunning sci-fi thrill ride Screen_Blitz Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has made big impressions on us with his visual effects, in summer blockbusters like The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. However, Nolan takes his visual style and narrative talent up to the next level in this complex science-fiction thriller. Matthew McConaughey (Oscar winner from last year's Dallas Buyers Club) stars as Joseph Cooper, a Texas-native father of two children: daughter Murphy and teenager son Tom, living in the not-too-distant future where the world is running scarce on food supply, crops have declined dangerously low and humanity's day are numbered. He is soon called by NASA to take on a mission to travel through the Galaxy in search of a wormhole that could lead to a new home for humanity. Joining Dr. Amelia Brand (played by Anna Hathaway), he struggles against the complexities and perils of the intergalatic environments as well as the decision between saving humanity and the possibility of seeing his family again. This is one of the most visually striking films I've seen in a long time. Christopher Nolan pushes the boundaries of both visual effects and imagination, and brings some eye-popping visuals taking place in outer space you would never forget. The film succeeds not only with ravaging a stunning visual beauty, but also with plenty of scientific food for thought that leaves viewers curious about the nature of astrophysics. The way the film depicts the wormholes and the black holes comes be a cerebral eye-catcher. Now I am not a science guy so I don't how scientific accurate the film is, but it gives a realistic depiction of reality in space. And the plot, though slow at times, manages to associate well with its powerful and scientifically complex story while abandoning its emotional resonance. Some may argue that the plot doesn't quite sustain its 169-minute runtime. Those numbed by the scientific complexity or slow moving storyline may not stay through beginning to end, but there is plenty of strong elements dotted throughout the duration to captivate viewers Let's not forget the incredible performance by Matthew McConaughey. He did a great job on making his character and the bond with his children in the emotional scenes so believable, just by his emotionally driven acting. Anna Hathaway also delivers a performance that stands strong and honorable. Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally powerful sci-fi flick full of surprises and thought-provoking elements that could possibly lead this film to stand as a classic within the next decade. This film is an amazing and striking achievement by Christopher Nolan.
2.0~If I could travel back in time i would Alanjackd Sign in Permalink I'm not a sci fi fan and having watched this to be honest I don't think I will ever be.Wasn't impressed at all. Mathew Mc thingy could not act to save his life and Michael Caine seems totally out of place. Very too long and not enough to hold attention. All that about the moon landings?? what was that all about?? Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a story of family life or about some bloke going off in a space ship for a bit and doing not much. There was so much going on I lost interest. If there was such a thing as time travel then the 1st thing I would do is get the money back for my ticket and stay at home...or maybe I could go further back in time and teach Matthew Mcthingy how to act. Not good....not good at all.
4.0~What is with these Nolan Fans? Seriously? benrobbinswolf Sign in Permalink I am not going to lie, Christopher Nolan's newest science fiction film is brilliantly well acted with spectacular special effects. But, the countless Nolan fans out there have gone ahead and given this film a 10/10. It deserves half that. Other then the qualities I just mentioned, this is a hilariously bad movie. It is way to long and way to fed up in theoretical science. The sequence inside the black hole and Cooper (Matthew Mcconaughey) being Murph's ghost the entire time is ridiculous. The fact that the ship did not stretch when it was approaching the black hole, says something about a movie that tries to be scientifically accurate. If you want to see a quality movie that has been released this year, check out "Nightcrawler", "Birdman" or "Whiplash".
3.0~Pedestrian and languishing redvirgo-04033 Sign in Permalink There are a lot of people raving about this film but I think Nolan was out of his comfort zone here, it's mostly tedious and adolescent. It just goes to show that once you've made it big you will garner fans that think everything you do is big. I'm also pretty sure they called the hole both a worm hole and a black hole, later preferring "black" which is inaccurate for the anomaly they encountered; a black hole absorbs things and is impassable while a worm hole is a bend in the time continuum and is survivable. And wth was that ending? They couldn't figure out a better way to dispense this information to the audience? I want to like this film and find reasons that I'm evaluating it unfairly, maybe I'm just not getting what Nolan was trying to impart. There are a few wow moments and some interesting ideas that make us go "oooh", but overall it felt like it just lacked personality and pop.
4.0~Barely a four! paulmatthew22 Sign in Permalink Yeah,.I wanted to like it,.I thought while I was watching the movie maybe they were talking too fast,.But no,.Now it's obvious that EVERYONE was totally lost,.I wish this movie wouldn't have taken itself so seriously,.I felt like I was supposed to be crying during alott of parts in the movie,.Ambitious it is,.A tough watch for smart Sci Fi fans,.People that just wanna Sukk Nolan's dikk seem to love it,. Look past that,.And it's a REALLY ridiculous movie,.Watched NightCrawler(Jake Gyllenhall) on the same day,.It was much more fun and funny,.and action packed,.A BETTER MOVIE,.This one is a LABOR,.I work hard,.Don't need to work so hard at watching a movie
6.0~Not a film to trick the intelligent community but nice to watch all the same christopherRclarke Sign in Permalink It might sound arrogant, what i wrote in the summary field, but unfortunately this film misses many aspects of common sense. Given it was a Nolan film I did expect more than this but I think he may be slipping somewhat (the bat bike in Dark Knight Rises flipping over with its magical 360 deg wheel comes to mind). Im not going to get into a full review about what this film is about but I will say that if you are dealing with time paradoxes, make sure you know how to address them and not say 'ah what the hell, the audience won't know...' The film has a wormhole. One that is placed aaaaalllllll the way out near Saturn by someone we don't know (but lead to believe its evolved humans). I say, why not have the wormhole next to Earth? who knows. Did evolved humans make the wormhole? if so, how did they get off Earth to evolve and put it there? To watch the film is nice, the space scenes are stunning and film stock nice. But, no 2001 competitor this time round.
4.0~Where physics takes a death spiral through a giant narrative blackhole RJBurke1942 Sign in Permalink If you deplore negative reviews of movies featuring your favorite director or actor, read no further. Okay, then ... I like science-fiction stories and movies, provided they both stick to the categorical facts and maxims of physics and quantum mechanics. Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001:A Space Odyssey (1967), in the main, is the quintessential example which sticks to those requirements. But if a story, such as this Interstellar, allows itself to fall into outrageous speculation, then it's not science: it's simple fantasy. Hence, in this movie, fiction is truly stranger than basic truth. Although it does have it's interesting moments.... For example, the settings and special effects are simply outstanding; the artwork and CGI are also standout features. The acting, at times, is excellent, especially from McConaughey, Hathaway and Chastain. The supporting cast is generally up to par; and it was a pleasant surprise to briefly see William Devane once again - as an aging nasty, again. The best actors, for my money though, are the robots: TARS and the sort-of-eponymous CASE - both not only highly innovative and imaginative in form and behaviour, but also the best humour in the whole movie (of which there is very little). Regarding the physics aspect, the one thing the writers almost got right (about relativity and time dilation) was a well presented and excellent visual statement when Cooper (McConaughey) finally meets his grown-up daughter, Murph (Chastain). However, the remainder of the dialogue centering upon space travel, worm holes, black holes, gravity, time travel and so on is just full of ... well, holes. And, downright misinformation. Aaah, but it all sounds so cool.... While I fully understand why it has a high (but undeserved) score, other inferior movies - The Abyss (1989), Close Encounters (1977), Titanic (1997) - achieve similar levels of approval. Still, this story is well structured without being unduly confusing. Direction, photography and editing are well up to Nolan standard of excellence, as you would expect. The sound track, however, is a tad loud for my liking; and, overall, the pacing is too slow and the overall length too long. Finally, as to the story itself - our dying planet, our need to survive, what can we do? - well, it's topical, important and now, an increasingly urgent issue. But this movie, deliberately or unintentionally, subverts viewers with its blatantly, saccharine banality that: Love conquers all. Meh! To nail things in perspective, this is not nearly as entertaining or imaginative as Inception, even though that one also classed itself wrongly as sci-fi. Overall, Interstellar is a movie only worth seeing if you have around three hours you don't mind using up, for better or worse. Give it four out of ten. Barely.

2.0~ALMOST great but ultimately awful jessejec Sign in Permalink People who are defending this movie clearly don't care about plot and have no grasp on theme or what makes a film objectively good or bad. The problems with this film have nothing to do with people not getting the twist (which wasn't complicated in the slightest if you're familiar with any sci fi other than star wars.) They have nothing to do with whether it gets the science right (which it mostly does.) This film is bad because the plot is doesn't work, characters have little to no character, and most of all the emotional moments fall flat its that simple. Even if every part of the machine works individually it doesn't come together to create something worth watching. Interstellar has neither the heart or balls to achieve what it sets out to and despite moments of "brilliance" its a film with the ambition of Kubrick but the execution of Shyamalan. I was really excited for this movie. I'm a big fan of Chris Nolan (though hes not my favorite) but this movie is a 3 hour waste of time if you care at all about experiencing a well told story. The twist is obvious and the movement towards it is clumsy. The plot holes are larger than the black hole around which the movie centers. As a result, I'm not at all surprised to hear that Interstellar was made up of two separate scripts that individually may have been great. I will say I enjoyed the 1st act to an extent and there are some good lines throughout. A few of the actors (specifically Mcconaughey and Caine) give awesome performances. Maybe a great editor could have saved this film but ultimately it comes off too cold and sterile for the emotions to hold any weight. Do yourself a favor. See something else
4.0~Waste of time, though not exempt of production values. Ricardo-Lopez-inAlbany Sign in Permalink Production OK. Cast acting OK, given what they were given. Music is also good. Script and plot development suck to high heavens and in all dimensions: a collection of science BS, psyco-Babel and cheap, inconsistent emotional one shots. Reeking with ignorance in all disciplines and dimensions. Save yourself some time, go and watch something else. Better yet, go and read some good sci-fi, not this distopian diarrhea.
3.0~A cinematic mess! antonie4 Sign in Permalink This film is an example of having to many irons in the fire and not knowing what to do with them, which results in an over sentimental mess that is called Interstellar. Nolan finally shows clearly his hubris in that he thinks of himself as a cinematic mastermind, in fact he's just a Hollywood pet with cheap tricks. There is nothing wrong in getting the science incorrect, a competent filmmaker manages to work around the incoherence and still create a unified whole, Nolan on the other hand wants us to think that he understands the science behind Interstellar, but he also shows clearly that he doesn't put much trust in the audiences' intellect. This results in an over abundance of exposition which is there just to inform us of how stupid we are. The sentimentality, which is most of the time laughable, doesn't go along with the overall structure of the film because the plot is disorganized. The problem comes from the inability to transform a concept into a film without allowing the audience to interpret what they are seeing - instead Nolan tries to overwhelm us with his elitist vision and it comes out as a mess because he doesn't trust his audience, he's lack of vision doesn't come from him not having a concept but from the inability to mediate that concept through a film, in other words: he is a bad filmmaker.
3.0~1 out of 3 acts worth seeing dandebs Sign in Permalink Sooo, finally watched this. And, um, underwhelmed. The first act was way too long. It tipped over from hmm, interesting to okay, boring. Way too much exposition dump and set up for no reason (like the drone thing - no point. AI combines. No point.). Technology flip-flopped between 1950s and 2040 with no explanation or logic. Him leaving his daughter was complete crap. Why the sudden rush to leave? The wormhole was closing? No. Umm. Hmm. There was no reason for him to leave so suddenly AT ALL. Except plot. Then we were treated to a 2001 homage as we watched the ship take off, then dock. Wow. We've seen it before. It's not cool now. It's boooring. Why not show a truck backing up. Beep. Beep. Beep. The middle section (2nd act) was really well done. Great visuals. Great premise with the time dilation. The strongest part was his sons life unfolding in minutes. But the third act (THe end) - what a train-smash. LOVE TRANSCENDS DIMENSIONS. Why? Umm, because. 5D beings just happen to lock onto Murphs room and just happen to provide him a space to affect her room - but not anything smart like a pen or something. Oh, and not to forget the humanist gospel HUMANITY SAVES ITSELF! We've trashed this planet and screwed things royally and even if there's like 4 of us and the future of the human race is in our hands we'll try to kill each other.. but add time and we'll become these amazing supernatural beings who will conquer the universe and manipulate spacetime and benignly save our own asses. well, here's hoping! Oh, and why did he launch off into the black hole for no reason whatsoever, since they still had another robot? Gaah. And the old Murph reunion was weird. Hi Dad. Hi Murph. It was you - I figured it out. The old watch was jumping so I knew you were my ghost because .... love? Yes, love sounds good. LOOOOOOOOVE! Ha. Now bugger off Dad, I've got my own family here. Hey, Brand was hot, go find her (and never mind about the time distortion affects of slingshotting around the black hole while you went through it. I'm sure she'll be the same hot young thing as when you left her.... (I also really disliked the overused score, particularly in the first act. It droned on and on and on and on and on and on and.. well you get the idea.) Anyway, those were my thoughts upon viewing INTERSTELLAR (aka Nolans homage to 2001 and soap operas). I rated it a 5/10 because VFX was good, some good ideas, and some great acting. Oh, and that docking scene with the damaged spacecraft. Alright alright alright.
4.0~Seemed Like a Poor Attempt at Creating a Modern 2001: A Space Odyssey RbDeraj Sign in Permalink I'll start off by saying that this is the first Christopher Nolan movie that I did not thoroughly enjoy. The whole film seemed like an attempt to create a modern 2001: A Space Odyssey with a little mix of Mr. Nobody and Inception-like-structures at the end. It had robots with similar intelligence, voice, and aesthetics to HAL 9000, a bookshelf time warp zone that reminded me a lot of the server room in 2001, and they even went right down to the organ music playing the entire time (which really grinds on your nerves after 3 hours). Their efforts pointed towards trying to make something that will one day become a classic in the realm of Sci-Fi rather than making a good movie. It had a lot of lights and flash but not enough tangible substance. The script and material tried to be all scientific, but couldn't convey the theories (whether valid or not) to the audience. It all seemed like unexplainable "scientific" bull crap and was not made believable. They liked to throw around the word data a lot, I guess to make it sound smart. I am not an astrophysicist or anything but it just seemed like a bash on all of the viewers' intelligence. Yes I know that it is "Science Fiction," but it is hard to see it that way when there is no fantasy element and it is all presented as realistic fact. Even the littlest things that most people probably missed bothered me. The poor understanding of agriculture ex: green corn in a drought and dust bowl? green corn burning? and other things like the convenience of an ankle deep ocean covering a entire planet. The makers seemed to know it was far fetched and nonsensical so they even went to the point of just adding explanations like "the power of love saved them" or whatever that was. I guess for the mass populous the graphics or something (which I must have missed) covered up all of its flaws well enough for them to still consider it a good movie. But the visuals were not even that appealing to me. Some of it was cool and trippy (once again trying to be like 2001) but much of it was just like Gravity all over again. We had some seen before actors who have collaborated with Nolan in the past and some new faces like Matthew McConaughey who was quite exceptional. The acting was generally good and all passable, nothing too bad, but that is not what made the movie lacking. It was the storyline which is usually Nolan's strongest feature in his films. Even with all of its good characteristics, it is hard to like a movie that just doesn't make any sense. At one point in the film I believe that Cooper said something like: "I want to know where we are and where we are going." That was the question that I desperately wanted answered throughout the entire viewing.
10.0~A Masterpiece Sasha01 Sign in Permalink Science Fiction can definitely lead to a bad film... I have names... But this film is the total opposite: it's simply a masterpiece. The storyline is excellent, the actors are amazing (McConaughey is amazing), they brilliantly play their part. It's incredibly moving... please thing about having a Kleenex with you. It's the story of a man who would die to save his children, but as well for whom this life is not enough. His an explorer, an adventurer, a courageous man and a father. Put all this is your shaker and you get one of the most moving film I have ever watched. .. to be watched.. and watched....
2.0~Don't believe the hype... mike-499-205871 Sign in Permalink OK, first off, this is a truly dull story. What has clearly happened is that a roomful of executives have set out to make a 'Great Sci-fi Movie' and failed dismally. Why? Well, it probably went like this: Exec 1: What other great sci fi films have there been? Exec 2: Silent Running? Exec 1: Oh yeah, great. Let's use the friendly robot helpers they had in that. Exec 3: What about the earth running out of resources? Exec 1: You mean like in Soylent Green? OK, put that in.. Exec 4: Time travel is always good - Can we have a sequence where it goes all ethereal and a character experiences another dimension? Exec 1: What. Like in 2001? OK. We also need some kind of strong female character.. Exec 2: Can she be like Sigourney Weaver in Alien? Exec 1: OK. Right, what about Star Trek? I think a few phrases from that would come in handy.. Exec 3: Wormhole? Singularity? Exec 1: Yep, and throw in a few good old American things too.. Exec 2: Baseball? Twice enough? Exec 3: And what about an untrustworthy villain - like Doctor Smith in Lost in Space? Exec 1: OK! All we need now is to make it fashionable enough to suck in the crowds. Exec 4: Well we're going to need a long running time. All the best films seem to be over 2 hours now. Exec 1: Make ours over 3 then. And get that bloke who did Inception to direct. Everyone thought that was very clever. In short, Interstellar has stolen little bits from all the classic space and sci-fi films and stitched them together to form something that is very much less than the sum of it's parts. Emotional scenes have been ladled on thicker than a sea of treacle too - Two parent dying scenes, endless relationships with children issues, the pain of being away from home... I really cannot see why so many people have chosen to rate this film so highly. The Emporer's New Clothes perhaps?
10.0~Wonderful Emad020 Sign in Permalink Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful
3.0~An okay film at best, stunk of America been falsely humble! andythedarkone Sign in Permalink Spoiler - I am highly sarcastic Okay, just like many people I fell for the hype, the use of actual science, going places where no science fiction film has ever gone before, ermmm - no, not really! Far too many plot points or general criticisms which do not make sense or are just bad! 1: Cooper - Who was the best pilot they ever had (and desperately need as it turns out) is left to his own devices running a farm with his family. So let me get this straight, you have a pilot who is said to be the best available, the best chance for humanity's survival, would have cost millions to train, and just leave him to farm away growing corn, Yea, right! 2: The U.S.A. decides to dismantle there armed forces when the food supplies start getting low, let the false Humility of that sink in for a moment, that would never happen in the next 100 years regardless of food or fuel shortages, having a massive army would ensure food and fuel for all or your citizens whilst other countries suffered. 3: Surely a mission to save humanity would be a global collective project, combining the best people from around the world to solve this extinction level problem, Nope, all Americans born and bred. 4: Only a handful of food producing plants remain, with no reasonable explanation as to why, it just feels like a crude plot point as if there were only a handful of food groups left to eat out of the literal THOUSANDS available on this planet, we as a species would rapidly start suffering from restricted dietary illnesses, but everyone in this film seems to get just corn and suffer no ill health problems at all, you know, Just like in the hunger games where none of them appear to be very hungry at any point, just a minor point. 5: The old and sadly not original "we sent one group out and we don't know what happened to them" plot line, this has been done a few times and often produces the same outcome, only one remains and he is mad (sunshine by Danny Boyle, almost exactly the same way too). 6: When an air surveillance drone is captured, it is of Indian origin, not American, the country that currently uses them with questionable morals and would have made much more sense logically, Indian, well I suppose labelling the British as an enemy is so predictable that everyone sees that coming these days so let's pick on India for a change, great, throw the plausibility straight out of the window too. 7: Murph (the ten year old girl) does not look like a regular girl, she look likes a model who has been taught how to pout for a living, oh, wait, she is a model, seriously check out her IMDb profile. When they picked a little girl to play Newt for Aliens, they deliberately went for a child actor that did not smile on queue or was tainted by the child acting system, making for a far more believable performance which still holds up today. Murph sitting on a bed looking like she is trying to sell kids designer clothing towards the end of the film just felt weird, not the best casting choice. 8: When on the water planet (where one hour is seven years on earth due to the laws of relativity), they spends ages just talking inside the craft after losing Doyle to the massive tidal wave, seriously this scene lasts for a few minutes, the sense of urgency previously discussed on the ship seems to have just gone, the excuse given is they have to wait for the engine to dry out but Cooper knows how to 'spark start' them when another wave approaches, why didn't he do this earlier? I could go on and on until I am bored like I was with the film which ends on a sequel bait ending (huge shock) and tear jerker which doesn't really work (feels forced). This feels like a film made by Americans to suit and please an American audience, little consideration for anyone outside of the U.S.A. was given when this film was made and you can tell, sure it would have made the story a little more complex (which wouldn't have killed it to be frank) but it would not have felt like a 'we Americans are the best at everything' propaganda film which it does in the foreground. This film is much like Pacific Rim, providing you don't take it too seriously then it can be enjoyed, but if you start taking it too seriously such as I did then you begin to pick apart the film's often big flaws very quickly!
9.0~"It's not about science, it's about emotions." Ayman_Refaat Sign in Permalink I know that Interstellar is a sci-fi movie, not just that, but it's also based on theories made by scientist Kip Thorne, actually that's what makes this movie special to many people. Also, the movie shows the most accurate simulation of wormholes and black holes. But the real reason why people feel touched by this movie is the emotions represented by the Cooper-Murph relationship, Brand-Edmunds relationship and Dr.Mann's courage turned into cowardliness. All of these complicated emotions are the foundation of this movie. People may forget all about relativity, wormholes and black holes, but they will never forget the touchy moments through the movie when their tears silently came out. When I compare Interstellar with Inception, I find that the idea of Inception is more original and more creative, while the emotions in Interstellar are far more effective. Both are masterpieces from the great filmmaker, Christopher Nolan, whom I thank for all of his original and unforgettable movies.
1.0~My mind is permanently stuck in an 5th dimensional - delusional state david-689-296408 Sign in Permalink This film sucked on every level imaginable from the script, the acting, the sound track, the physics, the cinematography, the directing, the editing, the flow, the lack of transition, the script, the acting, the sound track, the physics, the cinematography . . . oops - my keyboard momentarily slipped into a trans-dimensional, time altering state of flux that actually made more sense than anything about the film, "Interstellar." Actually, the film sucked with a force far greater than any gravitational pull exerted by a black hole that it literally pulled any intelligence out of the minds of the film's viewers, thereby destroying any rational or true cognitive ability to make a sound review of this really, really, really, great film. I want my mommy . . .
1.0~Long, dull and WAY overpraised preppy-3 Sign in Permalink A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right. WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick ("2001") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious "logic" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.
1.0~Watch ANYTHING else linda-vichouse Sign in Permalink Slow, boring but mostly just a really, really poor film. It loses the storyline about 2/3 of the way through and then just gets sillier & sillier. What a complete waste of time. Completely agree with the reviewer who also gave it a score of 1 who referred to 'Mud'. McConaughey is completely incoherent for at least half of the film. Very sad waste of some respected actors. Sorry about the double review but really nothing more to add. Slow, boring but mostly just a really, really poor film.

4.0~overrated imdbhobbyuser Sign in Permalink the film is imho about decisions, or better the lack of the latter by the guys who conceived it. Whats this film about: some end-of-mankind future (in detail not very convincing). some drama, an idea of redefining 'love'. some serious plot holes, some special relativity trivia. And some nice-to-look-at-transformations from 4d to 2d without any use of riemannian geometry. Its by far a or *the* reference for a top-scifi-movie. but go ahead and see it. Judge for yourself. maybe in our days, scifi-movies can only be achieved by scientists themselves. Examples i would recommend: "the elegance of the universe" and "the fabrics of cosmos"
2.0~Worst science in a serious movie ever jncressman Sign in Permalink This movie attempts to be serious and it has good believable science in it but then they do things that just make you want to scream at the writers. If you are going to ask me for suspension of disbelief please be a little consistent. A space ship takes off from earth boosted with a three stage rocket about the size of a Saturn 5 rocket. That same ship can then take off and reach orbit from two alien worlds with out any boosters, including one planet so far down a gravity well that there is a time dilation of one hour to 7 years. At one point three ships are moving away from a black hole with no thrust but when the smaller ships separate from the larger one they immediately fall back into the black hole. There is a 300 foot ocean swell on a planet where the ocean is only 1 foot deep. It seems like every time the writers wanted to add some plot device into the story they added a new convenient constraint to their universe. For example you can communicate normally in one direction through their worm hole but only a few bits per day in the other direction. Our hero is an ex-NASA pilot who even though hasn't been in contact with NASA for 20 years is given the task of piloting their latest ship. I hope anyone who took high school physics would feel insulted by this movie.
8.0~"We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it." classicsoncall Sign in Permalink Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story. I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if you're name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises. Case in point - "Interstellar". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate. Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt. It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were "That was a piece of excrement", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.
1.0~vastly overrated pontificator Sign in Permalink reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that I watched the same movie everyone is gushing about. the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome i.e. after trashing this planet lets go trash some others. the black hole visualizations were quite lame. this is not a great sci-fi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking non-sci-fi buff. a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story. these are yet to be made such as ringworld, dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts. to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange, although it is somewhat understandable as the afore-mentioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece.
1.0~INCREDIBLY Atrocious! evie-mctague Sign in Permalink 3 hours of senseless drivel... That is what I sat through when I watched Interstellar. The acting wasn't anything special, but the SCREENPLAY... It had to be among the worst three that I have ever sat through. In fact, I was close to walking out of it, had it not been for the laughing! In a sci-fi film like this, the expected reaction was far from the real one. Instead of a gripping, edge-of-your-seat effect, the screenplay and plot holes were so ridiculously bad, that myself and a few other cinema-goers were in stitches laughing! Like Prometheus (but somehow worse), this film had the adverse effect of inducing laughter in anybody who wasn't blinded by the interplanetary special effects. In almost all sci-fi films, there is an enormous twist in the plot or story that will strive to inspire a gasp in viewers. Some rare films have this effect with an excellently crafted twist... Not this time. The 'twist' in this film was, again, so extraordinarily awful, badly thought-out and far-fetched (don't get me wrong- these films have the right to go more far-fetched than any film has travelled before, but this one was just plain BAD), I had to shout out 'come ON!' when the credits began to roll (inspiring a few more laughs there from viewers in agreement). Even here, at at the end, there were still unanswered questions that were TO BE SOLVED at some point in the course of the film. With its mediocre acting, awful plot, vexingly atrocious 'twist', underdeveloped characters (entrusting a save-the-human-race mission to a semi-random trespasser - hellooo???) and boring disposition throughout, save your money and head to something - anything - else!
4.0~Boring and dreary andrew-huggett Sign in Permalink Boring, long soap-opera mishmash of a couple of ideas from '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) and 'Contact' (1997). I was extremely disappointed with this film as I had very high expectations for it. I expected advanced aliens and a new beginning for mankind – what I got was human relationships (including a lie told in the best overall interests of humanity) complicated by the time dilation effect of travelling vast distances in space plus the effect of gravity near black holes. The inexplicable and constant switching from IMAX format to Panavision made no logical sense and was just plain irritating. Even the visuals in this film were not all that impressive considering the budget it must have had. 'Contact' is three times over a better film than this dreary mess and '2001: A Space Odyssey' is ten times better. I think the director of this film was too wrapped-up in trying (and failing) to keep the science authentic and the scope of the film epic-like – at the expense of entertaining the audience.
2.0~Mostly Bad...I don't Understand the Hype xxmelmothx Sign in Permalink OK, I am far from a critic. I generally have an open mind about films. I watch a lot of them. I don't even take the time to review many. But I just don't understand how everyone thinks this is a good film. First, let me point out the good things. The soundtrack was amazing. Maybe it didn't work with every scene but it was nice to listen to. The production value was almost flawless. The space scenes were very believable. The acting was generally good. I like most of the actors in general. BUT....the story..plot....I am not going to get into too many details. It just didn't work. You are fed so many physics/science concepts with no explanations. It's like taking one sentence from every science article on the net from the past 20 years and saying "just believe what I am telling you", even though it's impossible to understand from such simple dialog. Then you are expected to believe......well MANY ridiculous things that somehow just happen. I'll leave it at that. I am going to bed.
6.0~Pretentious and Overrated Trip claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. "Interstellar" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Interestelar" ("Interstellar")
4.0~Its by far one of the most abstruse and absurd sci-fi film from an acclaimed director. braddugg Sign in Permalink Its by far one of the most abstruse and absurd sci-fi film from an acclaimed director. Christopher Nolan, is a director of great potential. His body of work speaks volumes of what he has done and what he has capable of. After all he is also a human being, and I suppose he has forgotten that humans have limitations. This film is illustrious of the limitation, which is that the director does not have an audience that thoroughly understands quantum physics. I am a big lover of physics and was a faculty of the same for 4 years of my life. Yet, the dialogs were incomprehensible by me. I must admit my in-competencies here as quantum physics, time travel are something not in my sphere of thorough understanding. Yet, I must also admit that this is the first Nolan film, I felt bored. I dozed off briefly after 20 minutes in the film and it never ever happened in a Nolan film for me. Now, there are few comparisons I would like to draw with an earlier film of Nolan, that is INCEPTION. If Inception, was also equally incomprehensible in the first go, it made me rush to the theater to decipher what it was all about. While INTERSTELLAR is also incomprehensible in the first viewing, it lacked the drive to push me to see it once again. Indeed, I felt exhausted after a near 170 minutes. The performances were superb and Matthew McConaughey has given a terrific performance. He is more a father than an astronomer. Others were all appreciable too. The technicalities were brilliant but those were all on the expected lines, considering the scale of the film. What I am only disappointed is, the screenplay lacked Nolan's magic. Yet, there are moment of awe and the climax, indeed the final shot was surely my pick as it triggers some thoughts in the brain. As per me, this is a lackluster film form a genius of a director. More than anything else, I am just disappointed. If you want to watch a great sci-fi film, there are many ranging from the 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY to the most recent GRAVITY. If you see this and feel this is great then I would congratulate your feeling. For me this is an exhausting lesson in quantum physics. Also, a word about the IMAX where I saw this. The IMAX in Hong Kong is way below the quality I admired in Hyderabad, India. The screen seems much smaller, the audio is not up to the quality, the acoustics are not updated as per technology. I miss the IMAX at Hyderabad in these aspects. A 2/5 for this film, For sure, you may neither love it, nor hate it but surely you cannot ignore it.
10.0~Great Sci-fi, Amazing Acting chris-martinez-131-82434 Sign in Permalink Loved this movie the special effects were amazing and the acting was excellent especially Matthew Mcconaughey and Jessica Chastain. Hanz Zimmer also did a tremendous job as always, the score was mesmerizing.I really enjoyed this movie and if your a sci-fi you will enjoy on some level. This is a good movie I thought it was great but that is just my opinion some may say it is good or just okay but if you love movies and enjoy good stories that connect on an emotional level this is one such movie. All I have left to say is don't listen to other reviewers go make your own opinions about the film please. Lastly I saw it in regular format and it was still impressive and I'm sure it is beautiful in Imax but if you don't want to see it in Imax you wont miss out on anything.
4.0~Mediocre karelva Sign in Permalink Interstellar is mediocre. The story is chock full of cheap clichés ("Love is the 5th dimension!"), over-layered with arcane science for believability and story points that are never explained. The movie makes sense until Matt Damon. Up to that point, the quantum mechanics and astrophysics hold up, more or less. Although If you know you're going to age by 5 to 15 years on the water planet, why leave that one poor guy on his own? It's kind of heartless and that's when I started doubting the movie. But OK, fine. I can live with that. Then they head for the ice planet. And, all of a sudden, "gravity is the force that transcends time" and "your mind fights death so you can see your children". All downhill from there, way into deep space 9. The movie takes a turn for the worse: A nonsensical allegory about how humanity can be saved thanks to the power of love between a father and his daughter. It's endearing, but incomprehensible. Granted, the movie's pretty. So I gave it two stars. The actors? Love all of them. That's another 2. But I simply cannot live with a script that's nonsensical and full of stuff we're supposed to take at face-value, because it's Christopher Nolan, and he's an otherwise brilliant director: What was Michael Caine trying to not solve? What is all the research about? And, sci-fi directors: Please, drop the blackboard and chalk cliché. We technology people use computers now. Blackboards were useful when Newton was running things. Now? Not so much. It sounded like (but I'm not really sure) the five dimension bookcase, which lost me completely, was invented by humanity in a very distant future as a communications device. But then I also have to assume that that future humanity has really awesome technology if it can pull that kind of prowess. Then, why not simply invent a cellphone that can bridge time? Why not just send an email with the data component that's missing? Why would anyone have to take a chance taking a dive into a black hole to get it? And how is that future humanity saved anyway? And: How does the robot, whose location in space is never explained, come in possession of that data? And do 21st century communications really work in a black hole? Going back to the Michael Caine thing: What's the precious data component that he was missing? What does the ghost send in binary format to his daughter? (sounds to me like a lot of zeros and ones). And how does humanity get saved? Do they invent some sort of galactic Noah's ark to get people off the smoking pile of carcinogenic garbage that Earth has become? Could they not do that before? I'm sure they could. How does a human being in a space suit even survive flying into a black hole? Or maybe that's not what happened. I'm just not sure. The list goes on and on. the movie is a confusing hodge-podge of pseudo-philosophical-pseudo-scientific mess full of circular logic and loose ends. It's intended for (1) sci-fi dorks who tend to not over-think things (2) Nolan worshipers and lovers of all things shiny (3) movie "buffs" who enjoyed Cloud Atlas, which was more boring and more bizarre than Interstellar, but only slightly.
1.0~Bloody Awful... Space has never been so dull... csmottram Sign in Permalink I went in with low expectations... but nothing can prepare you for such a dreadfully uninspiring, convoluted, ass numbing experience. Matthew McConaughey is totally miscast..hardly audible at times..terrible southern droll. There is so much crying in this film, he cries, his daughter cries, the scientist cries, the (insert) villain cries. This film treats dangerous black holes like an elevator journey..their dangerous magnitude and awe is lost and ignored in a few short scenes. The colour pallet for this film is washed out greys, dull and lifeless. The 2 planets they visit are so badly realised and uninteresting you can hear several astronomers and physicists weeping in their homes and hanging up their lab coats. Christopher Nolan is on a mission to devolve the human race with total nonsense. Its just awful, another space film ruined by a weird crazy 'space odyssey' ending..to be honest the film lost me long before that. The robot is terrible..like something clunked together from Lego by a 4 year old. Every scene with it in made the audience cringe or laugh. 165 million dollar film with some of the worst effects I've seen on the big screen in years. The camera angles were baffling, especially following the shuttles in and out of orbit. They were filmed so close..it was like the director knew they were s@@t and said "its OK guys...I'll pan to a member of the crew crying". I didn't care about any of the characters....Nolan is just awful at conveying human relationships, awful script writer with his brother...nepotism at its finest. Im still recovering..shocked..I'm done with Nolan...the dark knight rises was awful, inception was awful..this is just the icing on the cake...this should have been a space exploration film... wowing the hard paying audience with its gripping story and dazzling effects...in the end it's just total tosh...lifeless, boring and self indulgent.
9.0~not a masterpiece, but quiet stefanoperoni22 Sign in Permalink I was very interested in this movie, my expectations were very high, luckily I have been satisfied! I can't say it's a masterpiece because I found something that could have been better ( there's an apparent hole plot and some characters could have been realized better) The plot is very difficult and articulated, science is really complicated! Besides movie is very long, but it can not bore, rhythm grows up to the end. The photography is breakthaking, scenes are spectacular and do you not fell the long-duration! screenplay is fantastic, music is fundamental for the movie ( Hans Zimmer composed a fabulous soundtrack ). The special effects are perfect, worthy of an Oscar! Unfortunately, in my opinion, Interstellar has not had the attentions it deserves it's a film you have to see! 9/10 absolutely! not to be missed!
10.0~The most beautiful science fiction epic in decades. Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Sign in Permalink Interstellar was an absolutely breathtaking experience for me. I thought the writing, the direction, the score and especially the acting (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy both gave equally phenomenal performances) were all top notch. The film had the feeling of space films from the past, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (as many have said before), but I thought it also had elements of other space adventures, namely Apollo 13 and Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 film). Another thing that truly resonated with me was Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score, that I swear he took (musical) notes on what made John Williams film music so moving, and he gave an equally immersive soundtrack to the film that adds another emotional dimension to Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster epic. Never was the music out of place; it always fit in perfectly with what was going on. It can be its own thing from the film, and it truly tells its own story through sound, something that not many movies have accomplished in quite sometime. The space scenes in particular, have music played to that shows it very much is, and feels like this great expanse of the unknown, an infinite vacuum of an ocean that is full of many beauties and terrors. Hans Zimmer basically added to the already sweeping story of space and time, with an equally overwhelming score that I did not expect to be impacted by it in such a way. Christopher Nolan takes the audience to where they've never truly gone to before until now, through wormholes and the time distortion that black holes can make to nearby planets. It is a big yet beautifully done self-contained adventure. It is not only a fully fledged space epic, but also a cautionary environmental warning for what will happen if we don't leave the Earth when it is a desolate, dust-coated wasteland. I don't know for sure if Interstellar will get the Oscar glory like some were predicting before, but either way, I'm happy that I saw such an ambitious film that has left an impact on quite a lot of people already. It would be nice if it got a Best Picture, Best Actor or Best Screenplay nomination but I don't know for sure; however its music, cinematography and special effects will surely get rightful Academy Awards recognition in 2015. If you want a true space opera that encompasses the wonders of the galaxy, time travel and completely believable characters that need to save humanity, Interstellar is the film for you. Thank you Christopher Nolan. You are such a wonderfully talented filmmaker. Interstellar was such a wonderful gift. P.S. See the film in IMAX 70mm whenever you can, or at the usual cineplex; just see it when you can, folks!
5.0~Seriously people?? mvider82 Sign in Permalink I do not know what kind of PR team the production team has hired to promote this film, but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than Inception... Seriously guys??? This film has 5/10 stars at best, and even that for just potential. Rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it. Stupid, illogical and at times really boring and long. Even though I am no scientist, it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that I have no comments to this.... Set your expectations low- no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here....
6.0~Disappointing on several fronts trangolin Sign in Permalink Got to watch it on in IMAX format last night and found the IMAX experience disappointing, still trying to understand if the effort to shoot in 70mm was worth it. Same low def, blurry type of delivery as watching Gravity on a plane. Mentioned Gravity at the outset, as it comes to mind more often while watching Interstellar than Kubrick's 2001, I guess not what Nolan brothers were shooting for... So, a 2nd display of spinning debris in the cosmic emptiness in 12 months, while trying to make this cinematically thrilling and engaging denotes some sort of gumption, not that Hollywood haven't seen that kind of FX sequeling so many times. Let's say that making movies in 2014 about stuff in space is not easy, in a space where sound waves don't travel and silent movies are long extinct for a reason. Interstellar however is not a very quiet movie at all, lot of vibrating spacecraft and gripping soundtrack as fillers. Kubrick got that right back in 68 using the Blue Danube to keep us connected to the scenes that everyone ever since used as textbook on any extraterrestrial imagery. Nolan is telling a very simple story in a not very precise and confident rendering, adding several disjointed mini-stories in the main one, and ending it with the grand reunion of all characters that have not died explicitly on screen after 2 and a half hours and basically telling the world that time travel is possible and it will be soon available at a farm near you. I will be brief on my rating of the main cast: Matt McCon is looking more and more like Peter Newman in the 70s and getting pretty good, followed by Jess Chastain with solid delivery, the rest are a mess: Anne Hathaway is 3/10 and Matt Damon, boy ... what happened to him ? Michael Caine is OK, but no cigar. The plot is pretty shabby when looked from above (pun intended)and the mini new age anecdotes are kept in check until the last half hour when we are subjected to full blown loss of control over what/when/how/where.. anything goes, keep calm and wait until everyone's standing up. Wait for the video.
10.0~Interstellar succeeds where Transcendence failed. DarkVulcan29 Sign in Permalink It manages to be a science fiction tale, and at the same time stay grounded in realism, Is what Transcendence tried to do, but didn't quite get there. The performances where very Oscar worthy, and none the characters never for once seemed annoyingly one noted, when anybody was happy or sad in the film you where feeling it with them. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) a widowed farmer, and former air force pilot, raising two kids, is chosen by NASA to help another place to live for human race, cause the earth is slowly dying. With the heartbreak of having to leave his family. Will Cooper and his launch team succeed before it's too late? I'm sure the filmmakers did there homework on space travel, cause I don't think there just trying to make another sci-fi adventure, they wanted this to feel grounded in reality has possible. Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze me as a director, with all his films so far, I'm hoping he never slips up. There are some nods to 2001 a Space Odyssey, but this really stands on its own. This effects are beyond incredible. And great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain.
10.0~Do not go gently into that good night freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink Since completing the Dark Knight Trilogy writer/director/God-to-Nerds Christopher Nolan was free to make any project he wanted and chose to work with his brother to make his sci-fi epic and his own version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bold and fantasy film. In the future Earth is dying, the best and brightest have to become farmers. Most crops are failing and the only thing people can grow is corn. Dust storms are constant and Earth is slowing becoming uninhabitable. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a widowed astronaut turned farmer with two children who ends up being asked by NASA to pilot a mission to save mankind by going into a wormhole on Saturn and find a habitable: but doing this meaning leaving his family and possibly never seeing them again. Interstellar is a highly ambitious film and like Inception Nolan threats his audience with the intelligence they deserve. Interstellar is a very complex films with its look at quantum physics, space travel, wormholes and black holes and time and it will require several viewings to truly understand it all. But on a basic level Interstellar story is easy to follow as it is both a story of astronauts going into the unknown to find a way to rescue humanity, the personal story about the relationship of Cooper and his daughter and the important choices people would face in this scenario. The story elements borrowed from 2001: A Space Odyssey as humanity explore an phenomenon left by an mysterious force and a man having to comprehend something beyond human understanding. There is also a similar premise to Danny Boyle's Sunshine as one last crew are sent to save humanity and the Matthew McConaughey sci-fi film Contact. The special effects are fantastic as you would expect and looks glorious, particularly the ice planet. The look of Earth is very much like Looper as Earth as fallen into a state of regression, society looking just to survive and scientific advancement and questions are discouraged. Environmental issues are also touched on as humanity has over used Earth's resources and forced into austerity because of it, people being forced to make do and with the government not investing in research. Interstellar could also been see as a criticism of certain interest groups in America that want to tell children a inaccurate world view and stop scientific research that they see as an offend to their viewpoints. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey Interstellar has themes about human discovery and need for advancement. There are also plot ideas from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Sunshine, Contact and even the Lost in Space film. As well as the sci-fi story there is the human, Earthbound story about the relationship between Cooper and Murph, Cooper's desire to return to Earth and the love the characters share, turning into the love into something quantifiable. The relationship between the two is where the film is most like Contact, as well as its themes about science on Earth. One of my favourite scenes in the film is when Cooper watches a series of videos and he is slowly overcome with emotion, with the camera focused mostly on McConaughey while as he comes overwhelmed. A criticism that has been laid onto Interstellar is that the film sound mixing, with Hans Zimmer's score being very overpowering. But it is fantastic music and Zimmer does some of his best work with Nolan. The music is organ based, being unique and influenced by Bach. And there are times where the film uses silence in space, a homage to Kubrick's sci-fi classic. Interstellar is an ambitious, complex sci-fi film that is rewarding. It is complicated with its scientific theories about space travel and time, yet its story and themes are still accessible for most audiences. A must see for any sci-fi fan.
4.0~Overrated. Total waste of idea. marbl-1 Sign in Permalink Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic. It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's "Baron Munchausen", the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the "serious" movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word "fractal". And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops... A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized. A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A "ghost" communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could. Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan). Please, stop the stupid "expert's presentation how it works" (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in "The Martian" explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the "expert" addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot. ...and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on... and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help. To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on? My "4" rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating.
1.0~Why oh why did I not listen to reason? gem_frog Sign in Permalink Was almost not going to give this movie a pass, having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess. And oh my what a bloated, drawn out, rudderless and boring bloated mess it was! I have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted, it was that bad. The story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and cliché dross thrown in for good measure. It didn't feel like a sci-fi, more like a soppy drama with a few sci-fi elements thrown in and the special FX where nothing special, a few OK scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland. I thought it was going to be an innovative, trippy Kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes, aliens, strange technologies, Otherwordly Gods! Instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members. Avoid.
1.0~So wrong/bad on so many levels! anthony-296 Sign in Permalink where to start??? Mumbling lead actors, emotionally not engaging for the audience, wasted use of a good cast, weak script, clichéd soundtrack, far too long, and don't start me on those silly robots! A waste of both time and money spent on this movie - I kept thinking how better spent the money could have been. Like watching a train wreck in progress. If I was alone at the screening I would have thought about walking-out, however, I saw the film with a couple of friends at the time. We had a coffee afterward and talked for at least an hour about what we thought was wrong with the movies. One of the group actually did not mind the robots! Some people at the screening I attended actually walked out. I would only give it one star since it did not contain any gratuitous violence or overt sexism.
10.0~Incredible cinema jjanerney Sign in Permalink Lets start by saying that i was astonished by Nolan's vision, mesmerized by the visual, captivated by the plot and touched by the characters. Having waited 11 months for this film and being a huge fan of Nolan perhaps i am not able to provide an objective opinion about this film, but all i can say is that delivered what i wanted and far more. It was astonishing. So lets start with the cinematography, and as usual with Nolan's films it looks pristine. There was no shot misplaced, the tone presented by the camera movements was perfect. Every movement had a purpose and there was no unnecessary 'fluff,' hand-held cameras are used extensively and this gave the film a very pure feel. That being said there were certain scenes were our jaw will just drop. This is partly because of Nolan's genius use of the camera and also partly because he only uses practical effects which made the entire film feel far more real and tangible. The acting in this film is fantastic, the entire sequence between Coop and his daughter at the start of the film is genuinely heart wrenching and incredibly well done by both actors, and throughout the film the acting never once becomes wooden. A quick mention to Hans Zimmer for the most incredible score that held together the film and added so much to the feeling of uncertainty, not once has Zimmer made a bad score and i feel that this is his best score yet. Onto the point of Nolan's films the core focus and what drives the plot is family. Throughout the film i feel Nolan is saying that through this journey mankind is 'evolving'(too say any more would spoil the film) and throughout the film there is a sense that every misstep makes the characters better and smarter. Throughout the entire film some characters constantly say 'we did this i theory but it is completely different in reality' which i feel shows that as the movie progress so do the characters in terms of knowledge and understanding and by the end of the film some even seem like they are a 'higher being.' However throughout the film none of these high concepts feel like they are out of reach or that the film is impossible to relate to because throughout the film the one thing that holds it together is love and family and unbreakable relationships and this remains a touchstone throughout the film that everyone can relate to and understand the film. Let me say this now, although it appears to resemble 2001 I do not believe that it does. 2001 is a very clinical detached film which in my opinion is the greatest film ever, this film is very different. It may be an incredible space Odyssey but unlike 2001 it has 'blood in its veins' and perhaps Interstellar becomes too sentimental at points and it compromises the plot because of it but i feel like this is the point of the film. Nolan wanted to make an epic journey that could be related to(I would argue that 2001 is the greatest film ever but that it is difficult to grasp because of the clinical nature of it). Nolan definitely did this with Interstellar, it is a film that can be grasped and interpreted and related to, but he also made a tremendously epic film that i not simple and tackles subject matter that many directors before have struggled to even get a grasp on themselves never mind convey it in a film so grand. Is this the greatest film ever, o, but it is definitely up there and the fact that a film so complex is the largest film event of the year shows that the audiences that go in their droves to see this film aren't that stupid either. To conclude I salute Christopher Nolan for this film, it was pure incredible film making the lime of which i haven't seen in years, the fact that all i have thought about since the screening is this film and that even after 3 hours I still felt like there should be more shows in my opinion just how great a film this is. This is the best film i have seen in many years and it is my opinion Nolan's crowning work, there has not been a film this ambitious and with this complex a vision made so well since 2001. I will end as I started, incredible cinema.
3.0~Just a bad film lee-baker19 Sign in Permalink Let me say for a start this contains spoilers but then that is my main concern. A man Leaves his children alone on a planet for no reason. LOL as a parent i can tell u this in never going to happen. I stopped caring after that moment so effectively the rest of the film was wasted. I really didn't care, all i cared about was the children he dumped. This seems to be typical at the moment of the disposible kid culture we have but I can tell you if i me this guy in real life I would smack the hell out of him. There was novel spin with the time lapse changes but its a cheap trick we have seen before to make girls cry when they meet again. Sorry this was a total load of rubbish and the lead was horribly scripted. The director should be ashamed of this rubbish.
1.0~Never want to say something bad about a movie..but this one just doesn't deserve this high score... rma1 Sign in Permalink OK, I was fooled by both some of the reviews and the high score, and I wasted about 3 hours of my life sitting in the cinema... I can't say I'm a sci-fi lover, but if films like Blade Runner only get 8.2, then this one should get 4-5... I watched Gone Girl the other day which is so much better than this one, both in pacing and plot and that film only get 8.4...how can this one get 9?! Another thing is, the ending is too predictable and too sweet!!! Happy ending is good, people love things that make them happy, but in reality there never has a perfect ending like that....the ending seems too sweet for me and some people are spoiled by these good endings. Also don't understand why made the brother a completely fool?! He seems has nothing to do with everything?! A contrast? To what? and the film never mentioned him after the girl (sorry I even don't remember their names) find out the secret, which doesn't make sense to me... Anyway, I'm disappointed and I don't want t say more about this film, I fell asleep several times due to that horrible pacing...I can't believe a film could be sooooo long which almost becomes a torture for me...
1.0~This movie is all hype and not worth it. rpgmcspider Sign in Permalink I truly believe that all these giant user reviews with 10 stars are just paid to review it. This movie is a massive disappointment. Seeing it again will not change anything. It's just down right boring. It is over hyped to no end. Do not waste your time and money seeing this in the theater. This movie has a rating up near the Shawshank redemption. IT does not even come close to being that good of a movie. When the Shawshank redemption is on TV you don't turn it off. No one does. Because that is an example of a great movie. If I never hear about this movie again that is all that will salvage it in my mind. Some of the visuals were nice but that is about it. They weren't GREAT! It was few and far between and honestly I don't know how you can even try to bank on the visuals because it was basically like any other space movie. There was nothing that set it apart in my mind. I couldn't even consider being impressed by any aspect of this movie. It should be put on a shelf and forgotten. Christopher Nolan should go back to making Batman movies.
10.0~Perfect onlyforsteamuse Sign in Permalink Usually, when i say a movie is good aafter watching it in the theaters, i don't actually think it was good, i mean it's ok, but i won't watch it again. After watching this movie tho, i felt so many diefferent feelings when it was over. I got so many ideas of what life actually is. i got curious about space and life and all of that. There aren't many movies that makes me cry either, i think i've cried after watching 3 or 4 movies, and this is at least 2 of them. I think it's just perfect. you don't just go and do something else after watching this movie, you will think and wonder. It says that the movie lasts almost 3 hours, but if they count how long the movie lasts in peoples minds, the thoughts and wonders can last for hours or even days
7.0~Wasn't Nolan's best garrisons-78907 Sign in Permalink I don't know....maybe the lead casting was wrong but the pacing of the film was slow (which is typical of Nolan films) but there wasn't enough to keep my attention as his previous films. Again, cinematography and soundtrack are where his films excel and Interstellar is no different.
10.0~Possibly the greatest film of this decade, maybe even century (so far). Stephen_Klein Sign in Permalink Similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers, this is my first review. If it happens to be my last as well, I wouldn't mind. This movie warrants a review. The night before seeing "Interstellar", I had watched Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," which may have been the best movie of its decade/century as well. I was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of Kubrick's masterpiece, and I was worried that seeing it so soon before "Interstellar" would lead me to great disappointment in Nolan's film. Fortunately, this is NOT the case. "Interstellar" lived up to Kubrick's "Odyssey" and will be one of my favorite movies of all time. Nolan's movie certainly didn't surpass "Odyssey"; the two occupy a very different space (no pun intended) in my mind and in the annals of cinema. I can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a sci-fi film, and they cause all others to pale in comparison. Even the recently- released and acclaimed "Gravity" has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces (another great pun). Without spoiling any of the film, I would like to discuss some details that impressed me. The score is phenomenal, the acting is powerful, and the special effects are superb. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to Kubrick's "Odyssey" which made the dual-experience even more significant. Certain elements of the film reminded me of Kubrick's "Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite" sequence, the mysterious monoliths, even the legendary HAL-9000. Even with these slight similarities, so much of the movie was different, and in enough ways bolder, such that "Interstellar" feels incredibly fresh and original. Christopher Nolan co-wrote AND directed this film, which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation. Even with his hard-to-match lineup of prior successes, this movie is a phenomenal standout. The run-time felt very appropriate, and just like "Odyssey," I was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points. Please treat yourself to a theater experience of "Interstellar." If you love sci-fi, if you love the realities of space and astronomy, even if you only love great film making, you will love this movie.
10.0~A Sure Classic, One of the Greatest Films Ever to Written and Portrayed patiakleonard Sign in Permalink The most original story I have ever seen and the most realistic view of space ever depicted of film. The complicated plot points in this one is sky high even surpassing the imagination made that based Inception. The plot made this movie just makes it harder to direct for Christopher Nolan. It is not a question that the screenplay of this film isn't the best work of Nolan but who the hell cares, no one could do it any better than Nolan himself with this unbelievable script. I was literally mind blown from the dialogue and script. The movie itself made me question my very existence. This life changing film creates possibilities and new theories on space and time. How gravity and love could help you communicate with the past physically and the concept of the 5th dimension in the black hole that let's you communicate with the 3rd dimension just boggled my mind. It creates goosebumps on what could happen if interstellar travel is possible and if gravity and time relativity could really do equate. The concept of love in this movie as a feeling that even surpasses time, galaxy, and existence made my eyes tear, making it also a great drama. People say that great ideas alone does not make great movies but just the mere fact that this really big idea was portrayed in film is unbelievable and should be given credit for. People compare it to Kubrick's work, but it isn't just a typical 2001 Space Odyssey clone like most people say it is. It borrowed the same elements but injected in new ones. The truth is I don't want to recommend this movie to any typical moviegoer. The dialogue could be as boring as hell and the movie won't be appreciated on what it really is. This 3 hour long film is for the people who want a new story, who wants to widen their imagination, who wants to know the value of love. Yes it is full of flaws in directing as I explained because of the plot, but understanding its urge, its ambition, you could understand this movie's sense and value. This movie is a movie that you can both love and hate, whether you choose to see its flaws or see its value is up to a viewer.
5.0~An unviable home for popular science fiction scribblesvurt Sign in Permalink Where to start. For a movie which has a running theme of relativity and its effect on time the first point i should make is that its far too long. It feels like three movements joined together. The second of which will leave you checking your watch and pondering if you yourself are travelling beyond the speed of light and experiencing the slowdown of time. Visually its lovely, but the wonderful scenery doesn't make up for the often heavy scientific concepts that hold the story together. We are not talking Gravity level eye candy here but its still pretty nice. I also find it frustrating that in order to help us understand the difficult concepts, the characters feel the need to explain them to each other. One would think a team of hand picked experts for a super important mission that had been sat together in a tin can for years wouldn't have had to wait to the point of seeing a worm hole to have to explain its makeup to one another. Surly there is a better delivery method for hand holding? There is a bit of action in various parts which is genuinely suspenseful and enjoyable, but like space there are vast voids of emptiness. Lets break this down. This is not a movie for Joe Blogs. If cinematography and all that shtick is your bag, you'll probably dig it. If your looking for a bit of Sci-Fi escapism, this is not the new home your looking for......
1.0~NASA's version of Sophie's Choice. arfdawg-1 Sign in Permalink The Plot: In the near future, Earth has been devastated by drought and famine, causing a scarcity in food and extreme changes in climate. When humanity is facing extinction, a mysterious rip in the space-time continuum is discovered, giving mankind the opportunity to widen its lifespan. A group of explorers must travel beyond our solar system in search of a planet that can sustain life. The crew of the Endurance are required to think bigger and go further than any human in history as they embark on an interstellar voyage into the unknown. Coop, the pilot of the Endurance, must decide between seeing his children again and the future of the human race. NASA's version of Sophie's Choice. It's a horrible movie and I am shocked anyone likes it. Firstly, it doesn't get moving until nearly an hour into this crapola. By then most us us have checked out and have no interest. The plot is idiotic and not even marginally based in the realm of scientific possibility. I genuinely hated this movie.
4.0~Interstellar was the first film for me in which the need of pen and paper arose. Disappointed by Chris Nolan this time. sam-wankaner Sign in Permalink In theater we typically sit back, relax and then watch movie, but this time rather, it looks like we are in a class to understand complex science lessons such as Schrödinger equation or Quantum physics. Interstellar was the first film for me in which the need of pen and paper arose. Regarding knowledge and entertainment: Little bit of education but 0 for entertainment. One must watch movies like Pirates or Avenger to neutralize hang over of the movie like this. During the starting credit the film should show Disclaimer like: "Only for science people". We are aware of the astronomy terminology used in the film like event horizon, time dilation, black hole, Einstein theory of relativity etc. but not all. Movie fails to entertain many of the viewers.
5.0~True Mixed Bag matthewssilverhammer Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a mixed bag, one that makes my emotions flip-flop more than a campaigning politician. On the positive side, the scifi technology, sound design, and score are all initially arresting, with the balletic space visuals and effects greying the line between reality and movie-magic. It's undeniably gorgeous and (at times) speechlessly engrossingso why I am struggling? Maybe it's because my love for the positives is only outmatched by my disdain for the negatives: the ponderous dialogue, the Shyamalan-like "what-a-twist!" moments, the bulky length, the dishonest ending. Nolan shot for the moon, got distracted by the stars, and missed his target. Interstellar follows a small band of renegade explorers (led by a nicely grounded performance by McConaughey) who, through a wormhole in space, travel to the furthest parts of the universe to find a new planet for humanity to inhabit. The plot is a science/space enthusiast's dream that combines the terror of Kubrick's 2001 and the awe Spielberg's Close Encounters, only Interstellar is more contrived or melodramatic than either. It's a fascinating study of time and the lengths we go for those we love, but the ponderous, self-aware and weepy nature of the heavily thematic discourse softens the impact, most apparently in the unbearably doe-eyed Hathaway. Every Nolan film is an event, and each is worth grappling with. They are filled with big ideas and big visuals in big worlds. If he could self-edit better, Interstellar could easily be a 5 star film that goes down in the annals of scifi movies. Unfortunately, much of the 169 minutes is too gloriously flawed to be fully recommendable.
7.0~Science fact meets science theory meets science fiction thedukeofmovietown Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolen rides again with this massive scale sci-if journey story that braids cutting edge special effects, amazing performances and a supremely inventive story together to make what is sure to be one of the year's landmark films. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a NASA astronaut forced to become a farmer in a world where earth's natural resources have dwindled down to nearly nil. As Cooper struggles to raise his children during what seems to be humanity's final throws, a team of scientists, headed by Nolen favorites Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway and David Gyasi, put together a daring plan to save humanity by searching for new inhabitable world's beyond our galaxy and require Cooper's skill to get them there. I really dug the hell out of this movie. As a fan of space travel myself, I really have to say that they did a great job at capturing a lot of the real math and science theory behind space travel, relativity theory and even some of the more edgy ideas about the characteristics of black holes. It's clear that the Nolen brothers Christopher and Jonathen did their homework while writing this script. The performances are also quite good here and Jessica Chastaine, who plays Cooper's grownup daughter, is especially impressive. These things married with the IMAX scope and the bigger than life special effects make this movie an absolute joy to watch. Everything is not all aces here as the film is not without its faults. Perhaps the thing I had the most problem with was the film's third act. The movie spends a long time setting up a very real and for the most part, a scientifically sound universe that is on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey and even to some degree it makes fun of a tropish, nonsensical and dumb way that the story could end as if to say, "we're smarter than that, c'mon, what do you take us for?" only to give in and end it that way anyway. At first I was OK with it but the more that I look at the film, the less the ending makes sense and the more the film starts to eat itself which was needless to say, really disappointing. Overall, I still liked the movie and despite my issues with the third act, I recommend it, and if you can, spring for the IMAX because the scope and scale of the visuals are ridiculous! No television could ever do it justice. This film is for sure to be in talks to win an award of some kind for special effects in the coming months and it's well deserved. If you love liked Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13, you are sure to like this too. Interstellar gets a 3.5...out of 5.
1.0~A bag of poo olasnah-97-475221 Sign in Permalink The dustbowl...I didn't understand the usage of old interview footage from survivors of the early dustbowls... made no sense. Corn is the only viable crop? Okay.... I didn't get the whole anti-science Apollo faked landings schtick. It was irrelevant to the plot. In fact, the plot points out that science is man's only hope here...... Why indeed have our future selves placed a wormhole next to Saturn and not the Moon where it's more convenient? Why can't our future selves, if they are so advanced, simply contact us directly, or 'show up'? Why can't they appear in the past when it wasn't too late to save the planet? What was the deal with the barely habitable planets of ice and water and rocks? Earth is a jewel, yet these places wouldn't support any human populations, and indeed they even pale to the dustbowl earth depicted in the movie. How is it that we've got advanced enough technologies for AI robots and blackhole venturing spacecraft, but we can't save the earth? Enters a black hole, enters a tesseract of space time, and the best he can do is ping a watch's second hand? (back to my comment about our future selves). Right. There's only ONE thing that's rewarding in this movie, and it's the rather recycled but still fun to watch aspects of the various launches and spacecraft operation. Yay. Unfortunately, this is a grand total of about 5 minutes of footage. The sound in this movie is impressive, but at several points, it overwhelms the (lame) dialogue.
10.0~Fans of Space Should Watch This whizzer-68866 Sign in Permalink I have seen this film about 4 times, I'm also thinking of buying a special edition of this film because not only an actors masters class, mind melt, theory provoking and an amazing cast. It's a film you need to watch again and again. That's why I gave it 10/10.
5.0~Sensation is the key BlueRoseNya Sign in Permalink I'm not a Nolan fan but I always want to give his movies a try because mostly I do like the general ideas for the stories that are told. I really tried to watch this one without prejudice. And after it was done, I sat there with the same feeling that I had after Inception: it's interesting but there is so much unnecessary "action" and plot holes that it loses so much of its potential. And that's sad! The first 40 minutes or so are really slow. After that the tempo goes up but so many details are overlooked that it becomes a bit hard to watch. This makes me very cynical and looking at the clock to see when the movie will be over. Also, playing with time is such an interesting idea but it has to be done right and you can't just be sloppy with details like I've seen more than a few times in this film. I wasn't crazy about McConaughey's performance, I kinda liked Hathaway. The visuals are good but I put on 2001: A Space Odyssey right after I finished Interstellar and to me these graphics are just as good, even though they're almost 50 years old. And the mood and eerie atmosphere are loads better! Besides, Interstellar seemed like a bit of a remake of 2001, and as is usually the case with remakes, not better than the original. I gave Interstellar a 5 star rating because of the concept and the effects.
1.0~Massively overrated (or over-retarded) madint9000 Sign in Permalink I liked Inception a lot and was expecting something similar from Nolan brothers, but Interstellar turned out to be massively disappointing. It's too long, too boring, too sloppy and too hard to believe what all fuss is about. Earth is overpopulated and plants are dying from drought, dust is everywhere and starting to be a problem. This is all what we were told by a movie, everything that we should know (they think). So instead of trying to solve these problems by inventing new food forms, by ocean water demineralization or just soft decreasing of population to numbers Earth can sustain best minds came up with ingenious plan - go through suddenly discovered wormhole and see what happens. Instead of sending drones they sent bunch of people through to a no-return mission, three having reported of habitable planet each. It is when things started to become interesting. NASA picks up some random guy pilot (McConaughey) to lead mission to these three planets, all of them coincidentally in the same system, orbiting a black hole. COME ON, three planets orbiting a black hole? If you want to live here, you might be insane. However, in a retarded fashion he decides to leave his young daughter on dying earth to pursue his all-life-mission. Some more absurd plot decision happens when he then decide to land planet with such twisted space-time (because it is near blackhole, remember - we are watching movie pretending to make sense scientifically) that it has time accelerated 60000 times comparing to earth. Nothing very interesting happens next, three non-essential persons just die, Matt Damon being one of them by going nuts for absolutely no reason. In the end McConaughey diving into a black hole (finally making sense sequence) leaving only one woman in a mission (Hathaway) to land a planet she wanted first were her supposed lover landed previously. And while soundtrack plays loudly to draw attention from following absurd plot twist, main hero spends 60 years in another dimension translating quantum equations to his daughter on Earth which will solve all problems and allow six billions people to escape. By the way all these years everyone was just waiting, absolutely no one bothered to send more expeditions so busy they were all solving Einstein equations. Why so silly? With so many numerous big and small plot holes this can't be serious movie. Main hero acting like a retard (or actually he is), his daughter soon-big-girl solving biggest scientific problem in history, two absolutely useless crew members with funny robot as a company and a woman supposed to be main-hero's girlfriend, a lier as main scientist and a bunch of another useless people. Even CGI can not save the day. We were told that black hole CGI supposed to be most realistic than ever, but it was pictured in roughly 1.5 scenes at best. Soundtrack is fine, but it is played so loudly, in disharmony with deep space atmosphere and in some scenes being unnecessary as well. So what we have in the end? It just looked like they tried to make big, really BIG move about space travel and physic phenomenons, but somehow missed big picture and not really payed attention to the details, ignoring common sense which eventually led to a failure. Sadly, good opportunity to create such movie in the uncharted territory was wasted.
4.0~A paradoxical movie in many ways jassenjj Sign in Permalink The movie delivers some remarkable achievements in cinematography but it cannot be saved. It's naive, boring, silly, tearful and brings the irksome feeling that a decent filming and acting were wasted on a messy story that can be digested only if one leaves aside all their critical thinking. I'm still wondering what is the big flaw of the storyline: is it the fact that it's made out of air, so thin that it resembles vacuum, or is it the super-fast delivery of the space-time-anomaly-behind-the-library explanation of the whole point, right after the ridiculous safe-exit-from-a-spacecraft-inside-a-black-hole drama. Given the overall score here and the reaction of people around me, this movie is a paradox... It provokes contrasting opinions, so inexplicable to the opponent, that it reminds me of #thedress.
10.0~It's one of those movies dagamingpeople Sign in Permalink The ones that you still think of weeks even months later. The ones that make you think and leave you breathless. The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours. I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far. Bravo Nolan what a great human bean
7.0~Mixed feelings spocktom Sign in Permalink There's a lot to like in this film. The way it uses real and theoretical science, the way it doesn't pander to the Star Wars fans by showing space as it is, a soundless void. There's a great deal of thought surrounding communication across time. Ultimately though the film is flawed in many ways. Let me list them: 1/ The idea that food crops are failing across the world and yet people are shown still eating wholesome meals...there is still gas for the cars and power stations still work is somewhat incongruous to me. 2/ Matthew McConaughey is just not the right person to have played the lead role. He seems too laconic and the way he mumbled his dialogue at times was downright annoying. 3/ I don't think the US would allow school books to be printed saying that the moon landings were a hoax designed to bankrupt Russia. Political correctness, I suppose, will probably become more intrusive in the future...but THAT intrusive? 4/ The "incident" with Matt Damon ("Dr. Mann") is just ridiculous and muddies the storyline and the pace of the film. 5/ The robot design is so impractical as to be laughable. Even the B9 robot from the old TV show "Lost in Space" would have worked better. 6/ Will Hollywood PLEASE pension off Mr. Zimmer and his theme-less exercises in going up and down the music scales to generate tension. Much of the "music" was loud and not appropriate to scene and there really was no memorable theme at all. Goldsmith would be turning in his grave! I congratulate the Nolans for trying to make an intelligent SciFi film in these times of dross. They have succeeded in many ways but the film is not the masterpiece 2001 is.
10.0~beautiful journey dhruvbehl24 Sign in Permalink One of the best sci-fi movies.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater. Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him "X". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say "we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade. Just go for it, without a second thought.
1.0~3 hours stolen cm-french Sign in Permalink Seriously? Some people are rating this 10? I'm no physicist but I do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility. Firstly, the first line of the synopsis of this film on IMDb. Scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? What? Sorry,but no. On our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world. Even North Korea. They're being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature. Also, we can grow vegetation without sunlight. There are many people doing this today. So why, if for any reason, would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? This is just the first problem I have with this film. At no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was. I want to know, and I waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came. Secondly, forgoing the wormhole, if gravity is that strong to slow down time, you'd be crushed, and waves wouldn't even exist. Let alone 100 foot waves. Thirdly, the robot. Why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? Throughout the film the same joke. Humour level at 75%? Sarcasm rating at 80%? Oh yes these "jokes" came thick and fast. The only joke I could see is that this film was actually made and I wasted 3 hours of my life. If you want to watch a brilliant sci fi, with Matthew Maconaghy, watch Contact. It was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist, Carl Sagan. Now that's worthy of a 10. The only good point about Interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack. If you want that, then go to a light show or concert. Sad to say, I'm greatly disappointed. Nolan should stick with Bat man.
10.0~10/10 And Beyond Rambage-The-Ruthless Sign in Permalink Best Movie I Have Ever Seen .And Probably The Best Will Ever See
10.0~Not Just A Class Apart...One of the Best 'Sci-Fi' flicks of all time! sohylejain Sign in Permalink Bad-ass... is the adjective which I choose to type the first word of this review. As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended. The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure. Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level. I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!
10.0~A graceful duet of Sci-Fi and Reality jackfull Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a masterpiece of both visuals, science fiction, reality, and story. What makes this movie so good to people, is the fact of how everything is executed. The camera work and visuals in Interstellar use both CGI and real word environments. The water planet was not a stage, but actually a glacier in Iceland. The combination of visuals with the props, costumes, etc. are what make this film look so breathtaking. The Sci Fi aspect of Interstellar comes mostly into affect when Joesph Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) enters a black hole in the final minutes of the movie. This sends him to what can only be described as a different dimension, that has the ability to bridge both space and time. The nickname for this dimension (but only because it appears in a way Coop can understand and use it) is the space bookcase. The bookcase is the one in his daughter Murph's bedroom. It's here that he can see that the coordinates and things that were laid out for him on Murph's floor to get him into space in the first place was laid out for him, by him. This would constitute as a time loop, but while Interstellar does involve theoretical time physics in its plot, it does not dabble with time travel as a whole concept. This part of the movie is what falls into the Sci Fi genre, in that we don't know if something like this could actually happen. The Reality aspect of Interstellar actually involves most of the film as a whole. Most of the science and equations used in it are in fact, real world science. Lastly, the story. The story is well written, the dialogue is great, and it defines each character so that each person has their own traits and quirks. All in all, everything in this movie gets wrapped up into the beautiful work that is Interstellar. I would strongly suggest this movie, in that it makes you think just a little bit more.
1.0~Mr Nolan Snr -you should not have taken your son to see '2001' badajoz-1 Sign in Permalink This really is an extremely poor film by any standards. Obviously paid contributors have boosted its score to ridiculous levels! 'Memento, was absolutely brilliant, but Christopher Nolan's films from then on have got worse and worse -a distinct case of the Emperor,s New Clothes! 'Inception' was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation, but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever. For a start it is obvious that Nolan went to see '2001 - A Space Odyssey' when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further. Um, well messrs Clarke and Kubrick made a better job of it! That,s the end of the film written off - don,t pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the 'Star Wars' imagery. The main plot is mankind is doomed, and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us. A few films have done this better. There is no money for space exploration apparently, but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space! Please! When the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble 'Total Recall!' And it does not get any better as we rerun 'Gravity' and '2001' before the Starchild repeat. Plot goes even more haywire then. There is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely. The space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by 'Gravity' so the spectacle is empty and ungripping. The actors try but who cares about such an over-hyped, unbelievable piece of twaddle and s.....! A note to mr Nolan jnr - go and watch 'Shane' if you want to make a movie about love and family. Otherwise, give us all a rest from your ill-conceived so-called masterpieces!
1.0~Dumb and dumber egasulla Sign in Permalink Great movies make you think. "Think" as in truly ponder over issues -love, hate, science, whatever- and coming up with your own findings. Usually this kind of movie is subdued, restrained, small in scale -gives you the space you need to think. They present us with a conundrum and let us solve it -if it can be solved at all. This movie is the exact opposite of that. Nolan movies are not known for subtlety and restraint -and this one might be the loudest, biggest, and I'm afraid dumbest of them all. The movie grabs you by the throat and slap you in the face a million times, yelling "we have serious problems here and this is the solution, and if there is a later twist I'll just give you a louder new solution, but don't you dare objecting to what you're given". Even the supposedly intimate scenes feel like instructions: when we see Dr. Cooper crying over his daughter's cruel recorded message, we almost see a cue card in the background "... and now, dear audience... cry!". To worry about the future of mankind is absolutely valid. To make room for human emotions in scientific problems is even more valid. But to spend three hours of dazzling visual effects and loud background music to tell us what we should think about all that is cheap and worthless.
1.0~Ghastly. Worse than Heaven's Gate mkharkins Sign in Permalink I love movies. And space. And NASA. This movie was just awful. Not entertaining. Good movies are entertaining and make you think. Great movies are REALLY entertaining and motivate you to do something. After watching this movie last night I couldn't wait to see the reviews on IMDb. Shocked that it garnered a decent rating from anyone. My husband and I lost 2+ hours of our lives and we want them back. I guess through the black hole (and that's the spoiler alert.) I took film classes in college (as a Computer Science major). Heaven's Gate was one of the films we were forced to see with our professor explaining how "important" the movie was. Perhaps, but the bottom line is that it was self-important and boring - not entertaining. Interstellar is the same.
1.0~Worst Nolan Film !!! roblew Sign in Permalink I really like Nolan and like all of its films until I saw Interstellar. The movie has its moments but in between those moments there is lot of time waste. This is one movie that I really wanted to see but in between the movie I was thinking when is this going to get over. I think Nolan could not decide between making a sci-fi movie and an emotional movie. He has given an average movie and because its a Nolan movie I have given it a 1star. I know it doesn't really deserve 1star but then I am angry with IMDb. There is no way it should be rated 9. I think, lately IMDb has become a hub where marketing people raise the rating through any means available. Disappointed in Nolan and IMDb too !!!
2.0~2001 for idiots by an idiot white_water Sign in Permalink Honestly, I'm shocked. I had absolutely zero expectations for Interstellar, I wasn't super hyped for it like everybody else and I wasn't already hating on it before it came out like the Nolan haters. I'm shocked. Nolan made a movie worse than The Dark Knight Rises. The Dark Knight Rises was bad but it was also kinda enjoyable to watch in the theaters. It was a giant mess but it was not boring. Interstellar is boring. Oh and don't tell me "you just didn't get it!!", yes I did get it. I got it the first time they explained it. I got it and it was dumb. Interstellar is a very dumb movie that pretends to be smart. Interstellar has some pretty shots here and there. Few pretty shots that bring nothing new to the table. Few little shots that show us things we've already seen executed better. The scenes in Earth with Jessica Chastain should have been cut, they added nothing but minutes to the movie. Seriously they served no purpose, the cutting back between Earth and space was useless. The pacing is ridiculous, this didn't need to be 3 hours long. The movie has like 5 different endings and the final 30 minutes are like 15 different movie ideas crammed into very little time. I think at this point Nolan has gotten so big that there isn't anybody saying to him "You know, we should cut this part" or "this line of dialog doesn't work" or "Christopher, you can't shoot a movie with just a first draft of a script, you know that don't you?" The writing is laughable. I actually laughed out loud when Nolan explained the already dumb story to me for the 5th time. The dialog is nothing but exposition and Michael Caine reciting poems. Seriously I thought this was just plain bad. Pretty visuals don't make a good movie. Interstellar is big, loud and dumb. Is it this generations 2001? Maybe. Cause if it is, this generation is dumb. Hint: Interstellar is not this generations 2001. That's Under the Skin As I'm writing this it also sits #11 at the IMDb top 250. Yeah yeah IMDb is bullshit but really? What's wrong with you people?
1.0~Over-hyped Raabsberry Sign in Permalink the reason I'm writing this review is because I was told it an amazing movie etc etc. however, I would advise you all to not waste your time. Mathew McConeghey is an excellent actor (no doubt) but in this movie I find him mumbling and it's hard to understand what he's saying. The storyline is completely unbelievable. It does not make sense in the least. It's a really big stretch of the imagination. And let's not forget Matt Damon's role. I'm still trying to figure out why he would play such an insignificant and antagonistic role opposite Mathew McConeghey. As far as the graphics go, I watched it in imax, and though the special effects are cool in imax, it's not worth the 2 hrs of your time. Basically,you'll walk out of there googling almost every phrase you heard. Don't say no one warned you ...!
10.0~Excellent hkhk608 Sign in Permalink This Movie is Excellent This Movie is Unique This Movie is Excellent
1.0~Worst of the year kmcanerney_2016 Sign in Permalink Once in a blue moon a movie like this comes along. This is the sort of film that makes me question the intelligence of those who like it. The only rational explanation that I can think of is that they know that it is allegedly scientifically sound (that is until the last half hour of the movie) and they don't want to come off as stupid when they say it was bad. I consider my self an intelligent person and it isn't that I didn't understand this film, it's that this film sucked. The entire movie relies first of all on this ludicrous concept that if a man appears outside a military base saying he was sent by space aliens that they would let him man the most important mission in the history of mankind. I know that Michael Caine addressed the issue of them knowing about the strange gravity patterns but they could not possibly know enough to justify such an extreme action. Besides, he was supposed to be the best pilot in recent memory, why didn't they go to him. The lunacy does calm down a bit. It is a film with a lot of flash and it is handled by Nolan well. It really is visually stunning and for the next ninety minutes or so we can look beyond the stiff dialogue or the cheesy plot jumps that dot the film but then comes the final thirty minutes when it all goes to HELL!!! What was up with that five dimensional time bookcase tunnel! What was up with that god awful line delivery (no tars, they aren't beings, they're us.) How does he instinctively know how to play with gravity in this tunnel. He heard the message already in the past so why does he think it will work now? And if the beings don't exist, who created this time tunnel, who took it apart, and when it does come apart how do they find him? Does the ship just move into the black hole and see him floating there? And about that black hole, I'm no physiologist but I did go to High School and isn't there a universally accepted phenomenon call spagetification? In short, this is a beautiful film marred by the absolute worst script of the twenty first century. If you don't speak English go see it, it's awfully pretty to look at, but if you do AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE. Rarely do I see a movie that I want to forget. Even the bad ones are nice to be able to check off your list but this film makes me want to take a dust buster to my brain.
2.0~A bunch of badly recycled sci-fi concepts malchugan Sign in Permalink Oh, my (future)self, why didn't you tell me to STAY, when I was leaving for the cinema tonight! Or maybe you tried to, but I was deaf and blind... I promise I will start listening to you, instead of all this people, that create the impression that this movie is a 'must see'! Shame on you, people! Totally IMAGINATIONLESS! I can't believe that almost 50 years after "2001: A space odyssey" you could be impressed by this?! Now I actually realize how far ahead of his time Kubrik was, and he still is... Or maybe his "future self" from the fifth dimension helped him with the movie, to ensure his place as the best sci-fi director until technology is so developed to bring him back to life so he could OWN ETERNITY! Until then we shall watch badly recycled sci-fi concepts and walking ATMs. I'd rather start creating a 3D reality, than watching another sci-fi movie. Yes, that's what this movie was good at - construction of 3D space looks a lot more easier than interstellar flying. Seriously, people, if we ever have to leave Earth with such technology we are definitely lost! Shame on you, Mr. Nolan! Oh, well... I'll give you +1 for Matthew McConaughey, but that's all...
10.0~Emotional Puzzle andy-r-harris Sign in Permalink the sixth sense meets inception. makes you cry, sweat, and question your own actions in the face of these scenarios, if you approach the film wholeheartedly and ready for the ride then it will take you on quite a journey, and you'll only want to see it again and again. the music really does the job of keeping you suspended, Anne Hathaway and Jessica chastain do fine work, as does Matthew McConaughey, and the little girl playing a younger Jessica Chastain pulls at your heartstrings. i was really really pleased with this and wish it was getting as much attention and praise as it deserves, i think the writing was genius and it really had my brain working hard. you walk out of the theater and everyone around you is talking about it from the sidewalk to the subway ride home, everyone, it was really funny to see.
9.0~Absolutely thrilling! A can't miss movie! michaelRokeefe Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program. Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp. No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!
10.0~Best picture? bryden2000 Sign in Permalink With the Oscar nominations out yesterday, I was almost certain that interstellar would be nominated for best picture, best director and maybe best screenplay, but no. 2014 brought some great films to the screen, birdman, imitation game, boyhood,grand Budapest hotel and that's where I draw the line, other than interstellar, they were some of the best films of the year, not the best. Without doubt interstellar is the best movie made in 2014 and showcases some of Nolan a best work to date. From the visionary director of the dark knight, memento, the prestige and inception, 4 of the greatest films ever made and he is yet to be nominated for best director, even though he is, the best director, constantly achieving phenomenal films that overshadow all nominated films of the year. This wouldn't be the first Nolan film to be snubbed of best picture (I'm looking at you slum dog millionaire). I wasn't surprised that it didn't get the praise from academy members than it deserves as they are all pigheaded 60 year old men. Wouldn't be the first sci-fi film to be left out of major categories. With the exception of avatar, lord of the ring trilogy and Star Wars and inception no science fiction films have ever been nominated for best picture (gravity was science fact rather than fiction) avatar was closest to winning best picture (and should have. But they wanted to include female directors out of pity) . Let's face it, inception should have beat the kings speech, avatar should have beat the hurt locker and likewise the dark knight and et. As I was saying plenty of great sci-fi movies didn't make the Oscar cut, 2001: a space odyssey, empire strikes back, return of the Jedi, close encounters of the third kind, blade runner, Jurassic park and back to the future, while district 9 was nominated it wasn't a generic sci-fi movie. Get your act together academy and give Nolan his long awaited Oscar. In 10 years people aren't going to remember any movie of 2014 (except birdman, mainly for the cinematography), but what they will remember is interstellar, for its technical plot and accuracy toward fact rather than a bunch of cgi vomited onto a screen. Godfather good
1.0~The Second Worst Movie Of All Time? sethart-1 Sign in Permalink In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made 2001, in which incredible technical obstacles are solved to send a man though a worm-hole to meet aliens, but he meets his older and younger selves instead and learns ... something, etc. In 1997, Lynda Obst made Contact, co-starring Matthew McConaughey, in which incredible technical obstacles are solved to send a woman though a worm-hole to meet aliens, but she meets her younger father instead and learns that Love is Stronger than ... something, etc. In 2014, Lynda Obst made Insterstellar, starring Matthew McConaughey, in which incredible technical obstacles are solved to send a man though a worm-hole to meet aliens, but he meets his grown-up and then elderly daughter instead, and learns that Love is Stronger than ... the gravity of a black hole, or something, etc. I believe the incredibly loud music was deliberately mixed to cover up lots of dialogue because the filmmakers listened to the dialogue in the rough cut and realized what they had on their hands.
2.0~A Cosmic Letdown shaft9000 Sign in Permalink This gets a couple stars for at least trying to be an unusual and ambitious sci-fi film. Around 20 various minutes out of the film are pretty great, but the other 2 hours are like a black hole that sucks you towards it's (rather fluffy) mass of awful. The script is full of clutter and handy gotchas, and McConaughey is out to freaking lunch. I should have learned my lesson after the inevitable misfortune of seeing Inception, which was nevertheless a somehow more sensible and interesting film than Interstellar. Nolan tries to get his Kubrick on here, but the results are a film not even half as good as, say, Event Horizon - a nearly 20-year old flick that probably used a tenth of the budget that this one did. TL,DR: rent Moon or even Pandorum before this.
10.0~Epic, emotional, shocking and just plain awesome. Mr_researcher Sign in Permalink This is my first review ever on IMDb. I have been on IMDb for over 5 years, but never felt the need to write a review for a movie. Why do I write one now? - Because I had an amazing experience at the cinema last night and I want people to know how good this movie is. I will be short and just list why I think this movie is so good: Very emotional father/daughter relationship - Exceptional action scenes - Many shocking/surprising moments - Visually exceptional - MAJESTIC music! To sum up, I feel I was drawn onto a story for three hours forgetting everything else. Go see it :-)
10.0~Speechless masterpiece! aleksandra-yakubenko Sign in Permalink I have never in my life experienced such an emotional brake as I did today watching Interstellar! I left theatre shaking violently, crying and having I think 150 BPM. Every single piece of the movie from the story itself, visuals, music and acting is a perfect combination and perfection. I even can't find right word to give you proper review (partly because English is not my native)and summarization won't give the movie justice. The only thing I regret that I watched it dubbed (though in my country dubbing is really good) I advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as I did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey! P.S. Oscars to Nolan and the movie right away!
2.0~We were very very disappointed senseandsense Sign in Permalink We watched as a family yesterday. Were as bored as bored can be. I have always been a fan of Chris Nolan, from his first two films. I think the film seemed slow, and the actors seemed to have over acted in many scenes. I think the director did not let the actors show their craft, their range and directed them to be black and white in all instances. A waste of talent. Should have used character actors if he did not want them to work their talent. Its a serious subject and science fiction films tend to be pretentious and wooden to prove a point but the best ones like Close Encounters and The Fifth Element mix it up a lot more, not to mention Star Wars which have humor. There was some range and humor in Gravity last year as well. Could not wait for this film to end.
10.0~Another Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. That's it! shahaberry72 Sign in Permalink All thing you really need to know this film are: 1- It is the latest film of Nolan 2- Hans Zimmer composed the soundtrack of this film That's It!!! Interstellar, like others Nolan's movies, is a great combination of thriller and interesting story, perfect directing, good looking cinematography and awesome background music! You may say that I am a blind-fan of Nolan! But to understand and feel what i am saying you should see the dark knight and inception and generally previous films of Nolan, the you will get what I am saying! The casting is great too! Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway did a good performance and impress you sometimes during the movie. Other stars are also good. totally it may be not the best casting but you cannot spot any moment with bad playing! Interstellar is a sci-fiction BUT it may be not! It shows us the latest theory that proved in our science. So all things are not completely fictional except it is a Simplified version of quantum and relativity theories for viewers! The story is thriller enough that sometimes you cant even blink and also don't know what will be next! At the end, I think it's the movie of the year and best movie in the recent decade in sci-fiction genre, maybe best sci-fiction movie of all times!
7.0~Overrated. Mess. mill_8 Sign in Permalink Even though I'm a big fan of Christofer Nolan, I find this movie pretty boring. Respect for tackling such a complex subject and for making generally smart blockbusters. Unfortunately, movie is a big mess. Wrong pace, melodramatic acting, terrible music and mumbling i'm-a-badass-cowboy Matthew McConaughey speech just didn't work for me. One of the most miscast movies I have ever seen. I'm familiar with Solaris and 2001 Odyssey, but this one just didn't work for me. I gave it 7 after all, since I don't think movie is terrible, I just think it's not great, and people got brainwashed by marketing tools into loving this film and giving it such high grade.
1.0~ABSOLUTE Over-hyped TOSH markhaazen Sign in Permalink AM I THE ONLY ONE ON PLANET EARTH WHO THINKS THAT THIS FILM IS ABSOLUTE TOSH? Perhaps I'm being unkind because I could only handle an hour before walking out. I thought the acting in particular was very poor. The storyline is twaddle - a farmer with flight experience finds NASA in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save Earth - a typecast Michael Caine (thank goodness it wasn't Morgan Freeman) opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket!. It seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off this film. I did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that I walked ................ very quickly out of the cinema. Ps I love Matthew McConaughey in true detective and I can't believe I was looking at the same actor
6.0~Disappointing room102 Sign in Permalink Just saw it at the cinema. Let's start at the bottom line: I'm disappointed. #12 on IMDb with 217k votes and 9.0/10 rating and comparing it to movies such as 2001 is more than overrated - it's almost a joke. This movie reminded me of Contact (also with Matthew McConaughey), Moon, Sunshine and Gravity, but all of these are in magnitude better than this movie. There is also an influence of 2001 and a wink or two to it (TARS' joke about releasing a person out of the airlock and its features which make it look like the Monolith). But on the whole, this movie isn't deep at all. Like many other Nolan movies (Inception in particular), it has a very simple idea that is extended and stretched in the movie, making it looks complex and/or epic, but it's actually pretty simple. In this movie, in particular, the writing is quite simplistic and isn't very thought-provoking. Like I said before, I think Nolan is a very capable director, but he's extremely overrated (like David Fincher). What disturbed me the most was the lack of emotion that I felt throughout most of the movie. I think I can blame Hans Zimmer for most of it. Zimmer is a fantastic composer and all his scores for Nolan movies are excellent, but in this movie he totally failed IMO. Again, it may be a combination of writing and direction, but mainly the score was lacking. There are quite a few emotional scenes that are almost stolen from Moon - but while Clint Mansell's brilliant score to Moon lift the emotion to extreme heights and can make me cry almost instantly (no matter how many times I watch Moon), Zimmer's score to this movie did almost nothing to me. Matthew McConaughey gives a solid performance, especially during the emotional scenes. Ellen Burstyn is good in her tiny guest role. Jessica Chastain, which I absolutely hated in Zero Dark Thirty, isn't that great in this movie either, except for one short emotional scene which is brilliantly performed by her (I'm referring to her recorded message). While there are a few good visuals in this movie, even this aspect was quite a letdown. Gravity was MUCH more impressive in that respect. Even TARS the robot seems like it's taken from a B-movie. While I came to like some of its abilities (the running scene is my favorite), it doesn't come close to any of the qualities presented by GERTY the robot from Moon. All in all, this is an entertaining film, but really nothing more than that. 5.5/10 So-so
7.0~Stellar movie MovieBinger Sign in Permalink The vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. This movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. Open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.
10.0~Brainy, Ballsy, and Beautiful to Behold DareDevilKid Sign in Permalink Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 5/5 stars Christopher Nolan has reached deep into the stars to tell a story about mankind's demise and refusal to go quietly into the night. Here is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With "Interstellar", Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the regularity of mathematics homework but spliced with the fantastic. The film charts a course in the latest theories in quantum physics and other space-related sciences to tell a story that engages and entertains viewers. It also goes to exacting lengths to meticulously depict the theory of relativity — vetted by executive producer and renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne. Opening, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near- future setting sees humanity starving and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post-millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children lead a life of agrarian survivalism. But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth - an all-American hero. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide-eyed wonder of the Director's youth; a man for whom we are "explorers and pioneers, not caretakers", who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope. With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. According to "Interstellar's" on-board astrophysicist, Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three- dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modeled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerizing visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light; this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity. Nolan grounds his epic tale through the relationship between humans. There is a scene in the movie that shifts from deep space back to Earth, from a father (McConaughey) who hasn't aged much physically to a daughter(Chastain) all grown up. The difference captured in this moment was everything Cooper feared about leaving his heartland farm, son and daughter, for a last-gasp mission to find an inhabitable planet for Earth's population. Thankfully, Nolan's helped no end by his lead, the charismatic McConaughey cementing his A-list comeback with a powerful performance that helps ground the grand proceedings and provides the film with its emotional core. Among all the space phenomena and alien terrains, it's his quieter moments that provides the film's small-scale highlights. It's also his back-and-forth banter with TARS – a former military droid with a fiercely caustic artificial intelligence (voiced by comedian Bill Irwin) – that lends the film some much needed humor amidst the solemnity of the mission at hand. Meanwhile, Nolan newbie, Chastain, and regular collaborator, Caine, provide solid Earthbound support with only fairly limited screen- time, and Hathaway adds a refreshingly down-to-earth presence to the outer-space adventure. For Nolan faithfuls, all his signature notes are also present: Michael Caine imparts wisdom in front of a blackboard, the story skips through time without a fade to black, Hans Zimmer provides a haunting score, and multiple action sequences are cut together in a frenetic crescendo. If there's one area that Nolan is visibly more comfortable with, it's tense, super-sized set pieces – and he more than delivers here. From a race against a giant, skyscraper-sized wave to some frosty fisticuffs atop a herculean glacier (meticulously shot to frame the combatants as tiny ants compared to the enormity of the icy mass they're traversing), "Interstellar" contains its fair share of heart-in-mouth moments. The production design is more "Alien" than "Star Trek", with a grimy, functional spacecraft reaching murky, yet beautifully conceived new worlds. New cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytemer, more than ably replaces Nolan's regular DOP, Wally Pfister. The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of "Interstellar" admirably and charmingly low-key. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes, while the film's tech – taking cues from films like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Alien" – has a tangible, old-school quality to it, from the embryonic, sous-vide-style hyper-sleep chambers to McConaughey's clunky, faceless robot sidekick TARS. Even in the depths of new galaxies, characters still write out their trajectories on white boards and explain scientific theories using pen and paper. Ditto the movie itself, shot on film in good old- fashioned 2D. It's to Nolan and his visual effects team's credit, though, that he's still able to push boundaries despite this traditional approach: "Interstellar" contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive, and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. "Interstellar" poses all the right questions and provides some highly cerebral answers to most of them, while leaving the others rightfully unanswered. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. For the first time, Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never hitherto a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. "Interstellar" is a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking. As a light-year-spanning quest to save the human race, this is the director's broadest canvas by far, but also his most intimate. And against the alien backdrop of black holes, wormholes, and strange new worlds, "Interstellar" stands as Nolan's most human film to date.
1.0~Ghastly rhja Sign in Permalink Without question the most ghastly movie I've ever attended. There should be a sign posted warning of doom by boredom At one point early, I yearned that it would turn out to be a joke. No suchl uck! I hear the sound track has been praised. It was muddy for me. The actors often seemed to be just as lost as I was. The music is a din. The film drags for its entire run. I felt like I had been sentenced. Things might have been better if everyone spoke in a foreign tongue. The film cost millions. For what? Dull. Dull. Dull without end. Pretentious. They couldn't even get Dylan Thomas right! Avoid at all cost!
2.0~In what universe is this a good movie?? gvf Sign in Permalink Honestly, I have no idea why other people, and everybody really, has been giving this movie such high ratings and rave reviews. To me, the entire film is poorly thought out, contrived drivel. It starts with the beginning of the story, where Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) more or less by accident tries to break and enter into government property by applying a bolt cutter to the gate of the secret government complex where the mission is being planned, and is subsequently enlisted as the mission head pilot, of all things. I don't care if we're told that he used to be an Air Force pilot and apparently a notable one at that with old acquaintances in high places; that was a big letdown in storytelling, erm, right out the gate for me. Just too lazy for a film of its (attempted) magnitude. With all the good reviews in mind, I thought I was at least going to be wowed by the rest of the film's plot and the imagery. Well, with the cheap availability (in film studio terms) of pretty much even the grandest CGI effects these days, there was nothing about the imagery that "Elysium", "Oblivion" and particularly "Gravity" haven't already done in recent times, and better, and the whole plot not only disappointed with half-hearted but self-indulgently attempted forays into philosophy and some semi-spooky abnormal phenomena, but also by its ignorance of some quite basic natural laws. While the idea of time dilation within the gravitational field of a black hole was actually somewhat well explained, you just scratch you head at 500-foot monster waves on the water planet which suddenly rush across a vast expanse of otherwise knee-deep water that looks about as agitated as a reflecting pool (think Tsunamis back here on Earth). Also, there is no such thing as a more gentle black hole which won't spaghettify you as you approach it and therefore kill you dead. The list of errors goes on far beyond this. And finally, the last 20 minutes or so sucked worse than the black hole whose (imagined) innermost we get to see. It felt like a bad rehash on acid of the scene in the first "Matrix" sequel where Neo meets the Architect. A culmination of all the things that make the plot of this movie so dreadfully banal. Again, like I said, I just can't understand why people would think that this is a good or even an outstanding movie. Yes, I know that this is a film which would like to get you to think more deeply about the issues it raises, and pick up on its whole philosophical angle. And I generally really like movies like that. But sorry, there are many films which have done a much better job at this, without falling flat on their face in the process. Long story short, after close to three hours, I felt about as robbed of my time as Cooper when he watched the video transmissions of his ageing kids from back on Earth.
4.0~disaster hellenicpride1 Sign in Permalink Writing reviews is not my profession or purpose..i prefer to enjoy a movie than to criticize it.. its my second time here after snowpiercer...but i had to write again because its pretty obvious, that some movies are patronised for some reasons although they don't worth it..interstellar is at this category...u know, i m a big fan of sci-fi movie, novels, books, theories of all kind..my entire life is dedicated in searching for answers ...i have watched ridiculous movies , low badget productions or with childish scenarios and i didn't mind, i always find a good spot in any movie..because i have a thurst to solve some of the mysteries that surround us..so , after all the promotion about this movie, i was looking forward to watch it..i thought it would be spectacular ..the promises were fine, the director famous, the actors, the plot...well , i was so wrong!!! first time in my life i slept during a movie...the beginning was awful...the plot was childish and impossible ...the scientific explanations ridiculous..the acting was pseudodramatic and weak..the philosophical and poetical references not convincing, the music terrible... at least i was expected, to see some spectacular special effects in space , in planets...instead , i was watching the side and the wings of the spacecraft and 2 empty planets with no interest...i am still disappointed and angry,cos i was expected a spectacular movie, and instead i watched crap..if a sci-fi movie manages to make me sleep, the biggest fan of sci-fi, its crap...if i have to send an advice to all of u, is this one..don't believe the reviews here and elsewhere with enthusiastic words or votes from 9-10..the movie is below 5 and very weak...in comparison with CONTACT, is like day with night...PROMETHEUS was a masterpiece compare to this, even all the ALIEN series , all the TERMINATOR series, the 2 TOTAL RECALL films, and even even LOST IN SPACE..i do not recommend this film to any sci-fi lover..thanks
2.0~Not the one for me ravenmcarthur Sign in Permalink After months and months listening about this movie and how great it is, I decided I have to watch it. And honestly I didn't find it that fascinating. I apologize to every one of you guys that find the movie interesting and this sounds like offense of some kind to you. Maybe all of the drama ruined it for me. I agree with everybody that will say that the special effects were amazing, the story of how the people on Earth will die if they don't find a new planet was interesting. I still didn't liked the idea of the "ignorant" brother and the "weeping" sister,even though she grew as a strong independent woman.Or maybe what ruined it for me was the crew they picked ? Not a big fan of any of the actors and I think they could've picked better ones.
6.0~An attempt at epic story telling that does not quite make it. PWNYCNY Sign in Permalink A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.
10.0~Spellbinding MrDHWong Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor. The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth. The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself. I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen.
1.0~Science Fiction Fan Hated this Movie Ketzel Sign in Permalink This movie was so boring I literally had to leave the theater before I fell asleep sitting upright. I gave Interstellar a full hour to get more interesting, considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it. But I couldn't wait any longer. The film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that I could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value. The character development was weak, the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb. The dialog was predictable, unimaginative and flat. While it did not affect the quality of the film, I was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space, so people don't have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet Earth right now. But it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me Interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film. The first stupid moment was during the life-threatening giant dust storm scene, complete with large chunks of flying debris. After the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter, the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house. Huh? Another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan state-of-the-art space craft (apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget) less than an hour after he first surprises NASA with his first arrival. This pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone, no matter how experienced he once was, could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed (evidenced by no change in the age of the pilot's children) between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so. He almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission. This sequence of events had no credibility. It felt like some adolescent boy's fantasy come true. The last-straw final stupid moment was when I realized that the female astronaut played by Anne Hathaway is wearing fresh make-up everyday including false eyelashes. Not a big deal considering the major problems with this film, but it nevertheless annoyed me. What competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? How would several years worth of cosmetics (along with false eyelashes) even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? How are we supposed to find this astronaut credible? That's when I realized it really was time to abandon the film. I was getting downright irritable.
1.0~Waste of time and money Cjs410 Sign in Permalink Do not believe the reviews... This does not come close to an all time great movie. I really question someone that gives this movie a good review it's completely too long and filled with holes, in noway does it come close to connecting any dots. The only reason I went to see this movie is because of the 9.1 rating at the time but my first instinct was correct this movie is not worth watching ever.... Maybe if they shaved 1 hour off but as is... Stay away After watching this movie I felt compelled to open an IMDb account and review my first movie ever because of these reviews that are complete nonsense.
10.0~Through the 4D Magellan strait to reach the promised land a century later Eleanor_Arroway Sign in Permalink 1st November 1520 Ferdinand Magellan crossed the border of the Earth through what will be named the strait of Magellan. This day the reality of the earth being a 3D sphere was touched with men's blood and sweat. This is a sort of recursive path : Magellan crossed the horizon of earth through the Magellan strait. In the same way, Nolan bring us to cross the 4D horizon of this universe through the strait of a gravitational hole in 4D space. This is also a mad recursive way of salvation. The travel is fantastic for the eyes and for the brain. Before this day I clearly understood the relativist twin paradox (which isn't a paradox at all). Interstellar is my first time... I had such a deep feeling to witness what the twin paradox means in real life. One scene stayed within my brain for many days: Cooper seeing Murph for the last time, after so long, and having to go ahead with this same vision... Nolan pay with Interstellar a large tribute to Kubrick and Zemeckis, and at the same time exceed their visions. He inseminate our brain with a few new problems :  We have to look in the eyes the end of humanity on earth. The pressure is increasing we see and feel the climate roaring at us, we will have to all convert to work in the agricultural field and we will have to rewrite history to make our children love this fate.  Facing such an hard fate, which « love » will lead us to hear a non existing message and walk to cross the horizon of the universe ? Is it the love of: - ourself, - our beloved, - our children, - the condemned part of humanity (we will probably not be able to move 20 billions human being, with a magic plan A), - the future humans (plan B) ?  A lot of path toward the unknown are fundamentally recursive. This may look like a fundamental problem: how to pass through a strait which will be conceived (understood) in the future. Look at what Magellan did. This is simple trust to enter this recursive loop. To make this trust spring, we need physicists but also great writers and artists which will make us see and cross the horizon. Nolan is one of these magicians. 13² = 169
10.0~Interstellar fearthebeast360 Sign in Permalink This films amazing. sure its not everyones cup of tea but the visual effects is incredible and the science and time put into the film is beyond me. Its unique, original, fun and emotional. The score to this film is flawless. This film is so ambitious i wouldn't think any other director could pull it of. ( maybe Spielberg)The acting is really good and you can feel the bond between Cooper and Murph. The dialogue was okay and the ending was excellent, very beautiful and strong but very Hollywood. This is a film that can be enjoyed by anyone 13+ and may be confusing for anyone younger. This review was made by my friend Ethan. Follow him on instagram @tyler_durden_is_me_666.

1.0~Possibly the worst movie ever made neildonovan Sign in Permalink STAY - away from this movie. If you really want to scare yourself, watch it, and realize how many people gave this bizarre rubbish a 10. It scares me to wonder what is going on inside their heads - if they aren't paid to pump the film. I am a sci fi fan, and watch many, sometimes multiple times. I also enjoy many types of movies, and try to find something decent in a film. The best I can say of this movie is that those responsible must have some sort of brain damage. The plot is ridiculous, the science is ridiculous, the acting and script are ridiculous, etc. The movie itself is untrue to itself - is it scifi? Is it action adventure? Is it moralizing? Is it a love story, or a daddy daughter flick? What the heck? the technical references are all over the place. Zero consistency. Scenes in the movie for no plausible reason - why did the truck get a flat tire? Just so the kid could say "that is the spare"? But then - next scene - a 5 minute high speed chase through cornfields - on the same flat tire? HELLO!!!!!!! Then the girl pilots a drone with daddies homebrew laptop? And lands it safely on a sloped hill - first try!? HELLO!!!!!! If the crops are dieing from "blight" - what the heck are the dust storms for? One could write pages and pages on what is wrong with this movie. It is disturbingly horrible. Scene after disconnected scene of just silliness. This movie should be used as s study case for how mot to make a movie.
4.0~Interstellar's Less Than Stellar Performance originalballoon Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan seems to draw a buzzing mass of Nolan-fanatics wherever he goes. These little buzzers swarm around The Light That Is Nolan and in His light, nothing can ever go wrong. Who cares if Bane's death in The Dark Knight Rises was ridiculous? It's Nolan, he's amazing, God sent his cute little pout to earth to bless our sorry asses, and have you seen his (Aaaaand here we wander into dangerous territory.) Okay I get it, Memento was ingenious, The Dark Knight set new standards for the superhero-scope of the cinema-verse, but Nolan sure doesn't have the Midas hand of movie-making. He's a man, he makes mistakes, and not all of the stuff he makes turns out so fabulous. Hence the reason for the lame pun of this post: Nolan's latest film, Interstellar, wasn't as stellar as the name suggests. Sure, Interstellar has fancy technology, as its Oscar for Best Visual Effects will demonstrate. The most accurate portrayal of a wormhole, precision of orbital physics and astrophysics, (insert fancy jargon here) All that's great, except that there's more to a movie than just technical splendor. Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't considered one of the greatest sci-fi films ever created only for its revolutionary techniques in portraying space and spaceships; its profound ruminations of the nature of man and the questions it raises on the divide between natural and artificial intelligence are what has put the film on the pinnacle of cinema. Of course, the movie's amazing sequences of spaceships moving slowly in harmony with Strauss's majestic pieces cannot be overlooked, but that does not mean they are the sole reason behind A Space Odyssey's critical acclaim. Interstellar tries valiantly to mimic both the technical and philosophical marvels of historical sci-fi films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, yet it fails by a long shot in delivering a significant, poignant message. The early scenes between Murph and Cooper fall flat in emotion; neither the acting nor the dialog carry through the fragile emotions that should have been exchanged in such a scene. Nolan's efforts to raise questions on the "human identity" are easily spotted in scenes that seem almost forced, with little contextual connection to the sequence of events that move the story forward. The best example would be Anne Hathaway's excruciatingly cringe-worthy scene in which she claims love is worth jeopardizing their whole mission and the future of humanity for. Seriously, this comes out of nowhere—when did Hathaway's character become so irrational and obsessed with her probably long-dead lover? "Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space," she cries. Sound like something from one of those turn-your-life-around-through-these-10-steps books? It's unbelievably sloppy and unrealistic dialogue, and something I'm not at all surprised to find in a Nolan movie. Self-important, philosophic textbook quotes may work in a superhero movie where the hero is expected to be somewhat presumptuous, but not so much for a supposedly realistic science fiction flick. What I've concluded is that Interstellar is neither unique nor special; its ideas of travel through wormholes and warped time in different areas of the galaxy have already been entertained in science fiction films of an earlier age such as Star Trek. The only factor that Interstellar can show off above all other is the accuracy to which it incorporated modern theories of space and time— the wormhole's curved surface is supposedly the most accurate representation of such a thing ever put on screen. Perhaps the supposed scientific genius of the movie becomes more real to its audience because of the background of the movie, or the way the subject of space travel is treated. Science fiction movies like Star Trek seem far off from reality—such movies portray themselves as fiction, a made up world, a world that is usually beyond the parameters of a "what if" world that diverges from our own. Interstellar, however, tries to make itself seem like an extension of the reality we live in—our future very well may have in store for us a dry, bleak land that has forsaken the human race. Dying potato fields and giant dust storm seem less childlike, less like a figment of our imagination than do light sabers and evil warlords waging war on the galaxy. We are led to empathize with the world of Interstellar as if it were our own and not a created fantasy land, which is why some of the things that happen in the movie seem less absurd than what happens in other films of the same genre (of course, these "things" exclude the infamous bookshelf and Morse code scene, the absolute bane of the movie and the epitome of Christopher Nolan's over-ambition with his newest project). So if you thought Interstellar was an absolute blast, good for you. Congratulations for spending those extra dollars on watching IMAX 3D or whatever it is they have these days. Next time though, you might want to consider crashing on your couch with a nice, homemade bowl of buttery popcorn and let Netflix lead you through the world of true, time-proved science fiction. (Of course, Interstellar re-runs are always available. Respect personal preference I must.)
2.0~A Turd of Collossal Proportions memphisjim Sign in Permalink Piranha is to Jaws as _____ is to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazingly, the best answer to this fun analogy is NOT Gravity. Sure, I'll agree that Bullock and Clooney are the karaoke singers of the acting world, but at least Gravity had some cool visuals. Like Bullock's butt in those tight stretch pants. No, Interstellar is the correct answer to this puzzle. Find this hard to believe? Then make the same mistake I did and spend your hard earned cash on another unbelievably well-marketed Hollywood pile. Just be sure to get some chocolate covered almonds at the concession stand. Those delicious morsels offered some redemption and kept me from rating the film lower than a 2.
1.0~Rubbish johnnys Sign in Permalink I found this pretentious crap. After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. "2001"" the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish.
4.0~A once promising director assaults his audience with a seemingly never-ending barrage of bafflement davideo-2 Sign in Permalink STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the future, Earth has become a pretty sad, desolate place, where resources have run scarce and machines have taken over much. A space time continuum in outer space is discovered, around the planet of Saturn, that humanity can ascend to in order to begin a new life away from the rapidly diminishing Earth. Cooper (a continually, frustratingly mumbling Matthew McConaughey) a simple farmer, is chosen to man the space craft that will save Earth, along with co pilots Romilly (David Gyasi) and Brand (Anne Hathaway) and a talking robot thing that looks like a fridge, by the name of TARS (Bill Irwin.) But as the mission unfolds, they discover secrets and lies that threaten to plunge them into conflict amongst each other, I guess. They're possibly meant to do something else, and something else happens, but by the end (which, given the length, I'm surprised I stuck around till), the whole film had just so gone over my head I might have missed it. At the start of the new century, a young, promising director called Christopher Nolan emerged, an eager and hungry young mind that delivered Memento, an intelligent and original thriller that took a far flung concept and played with your mind and demanded your full attention to the end. He followed this with Insomnia, not only one of my all time favourite thrillers, but also one of my favourite films, that I still love to this day. After these two relatively independent offerings, he established himself as one of the top new names, and possibly Hollywood was happy to throw a lot of cash at him, and let him run wild and indulge his darkest, most inner most relentless cerebral musings, and from here on in, he went and delivered increasingly lengthy productions that bombarded the minds of his audience with so much anomaly and detail, even turning Batman into a challenging and complex ride three times. Even his comparatively short 2006 effort The Prestige seemed lost in it's own mystery and aggrandisement. But with Interstellar, he's just completely surpassed himself. Clocking up at nearly three hours, the film, in the time you spend with it (and you really do have to make quite a commitment) truly rakes up every last second of it's stated running time, and that would mean there's a lot to be taken in, and much you might have to describe and re-live about it afterwards. It could be quite difficult, but actually you can sum the film Interstellar up with one word: over. It's over ambitious, over indulgent, over bloody long!, over bearing, over cerebral over complicated and, just over whelming. And by the end, after grudging with it for so long, you'll be glad it's 'over.' Seriously, if you manage to get through it with out getting up to stretch your legs at least once while it's still on, you should get a telegram from the queen! I can't believe it took me so long to see it, but I'm certainly glad I missed it in the cinema. An intelligent concept is fine, but it can't give the audience no room to breathe like this. It's a shame, because if Nolan had delivered something a little more condensed, the intricate plot the film had to explore and any intelligent message it had to deliver could have been better absorbed by the viewer, instead of being lost in a sea of bafflement. Sadly, the best praise I can end up giving it is some fabulous cinematography, in space and at sea that sticks in the mind. Inception was too much, really, but I took it as the most intellectual film ever made and kind of have a soft spot for it, but this is just too much. Nolan can be thankful his films haven['t lost their spark and edge like fellow contemporary M Night Shyamalan, but he really needs to stop being so ruthlessly anti-mainstream and pelting his audience with such lengthy, cerebral exposition, or he might lose them forever. And stop least stop making them so dour and humourless to boot. In terms of a modern, space bound adventure, it goes without saying Alfonso Couran's much trimmer Gravity does a better job of being smart and in orbit. **
1.0~Something between disappointing and insulting marcfussbahn Sign in Permalink Advertized as one of the greatest ever, yet this movie is recycling quite a mix of ideas from other movies incl. 2001, 2010 and somehow Prometheus. Clearly, the producer deserves credit for trying to combine all the features and for taking a shot at the concept of 5 dimensions and black holes. Also, the main character was convincing and special effects were great. However, was the producer serious about the main figure ending up in a black hole and thanks to higher beings experiencing his daughter's 5-dimensional bed room, which allows to send scientific data on black holes through a wristwatch sitting on her book shelf? Really??? Also, perhaps I didn't get it, but with full access to time, why did he leave mixed signals incl. coordinates of the NASA area vs. 'STAY'? Also great, for points on the political correctness scale, that daughter, as a woman in a modern Hollywood production of course is the Physician that in no time deciphers the data, completes the formulas and enables mankind to leave earth to live on full-fledged orbiting space stations a la Elysium. Big time happy end in 10 minutes! Almost silly, the father is found floating somewhere in space after his black hole epiphany; because one hour for him was decades on earth allowing to develop technology? Right! Then he is taken to a space station incl. a museum replica of his home with 'no touch' signs all over, but for no reason the broken robot is stored right there. For him to repair because it's his buddy? Right! I could go on forever. With high expectations, while watching the movie I got more and more disappointed, not to say insulted by several childish attempts to fix an unfix-able disconnection in the plot. It almost seemed as if a 5-year old mandated the producer to strike a story incl. gigantic Happy End from a list of random components at all cost and regardless as to how incompatible they are.
8.0~Why tack on an ending where everything works out perfectly?! MartinHafer Sign in Permalink The first 80-90% of "Interstellar" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?! As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful "Gravity", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.
1.0~Pretty disappointing... jmcf1594 Sign in Permalink Like many other reviewers, I'm giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s I keep seeing, even though I really think it deserves a 5, or maybe a 6. I actually created an account just to do this, so I figured I might as well include a review along with my rating. Many will say try to tell you that you shouldn't attempt to compare this movie to 2001, that they are two totally different movies, etc. This is ridiculous; they are quite similar on multiple levels, with Interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from Kubrick's masterpiece. I feel that if we compare the two, we can get a good idea of where Nolan's film went wrong. The main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesn't try to explain and rationalize everything that happens. We see the events of the movie unfold, but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion, we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on. Has he entered another dimension? An alternate universe? An alien spacecraft? Is he just dead? The mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual, something scientifically quantifiable, or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if Kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time. Interstellar answers far too many questions, which, as is often the case, ends up raising infinitely more. Nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one. Then why even bother have the film "fact checked" by a astrophysicist? Why create this confusing mixture of real- and pseudo- science in the first place? To me, in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism Nolan seemed to be going for. The "floating bookcase in a black hole" sequence, for instance, seemed really magical until Cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans, not aliens, that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5D and communicate with his daughter, and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity. BOOM. There goes all the mystery. And lets assume his theory is correct, and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future. Hmmm, guess it turns out that we didn't perish from constant dust storms after all—instead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mind-blowing, interdimensional space technology. Then what exactly is future us so worried about? They seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past. This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions you'll find in this movie. If you have a very analytical mind, steer clear of it—I am not a mathy or science-y person by any stretch, yet even I struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride. That's what I'd advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie: DON'T OVERTHINK IT. If you can just do that, you'll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects, a great (if maybe a LITTLE too over the top) score from HZ, and very convincing performances from the actors. I found some scenes very moving. I liked the concept of a future that, as a result of a technological lull, doesn't look very different from our present. There are a lot of positive things to say about this film, and yet the end result is, sadly, maybe just a couple pegs above mediocre.
1.0~Miserable inter human nonsense alfa-624-376688 Sign in Permalink Interstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage (2014) as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space. It let me so down! Instead of a true vision for the future Interstellar works out an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship. Sorry Christopher Nolan but this is not what I payed for! Why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? The unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless. Austronauts don't go into space without a strict course. So not in Interstellar, in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take. This is supposed to be science? Don't make laugh! What a drivel!
2.0~Falling flat! moviesmq Sign in Permalink A lot of great actors in this movie. Unfortunately, the overall acting is not what was expected. This movie did not impress and it was at least 1h30 too long. The base theme is interesting but it was painful to stay seated and watch it all. It is sometimes very hard to understand what is being said and it contains also very noisy scenes. We go to watch movies to be entertained and moved. We didn't get any of that in this movie, reason for the title of this comment: falling flat! The only positive point: Anne Hathaway. She is definitely a gorgeous actress with the most beautiful eyes in Hollywood. If only we could claim our money back after watching a movie and being very disappointed with it...
6.0~Not great donnamae-32782 Sign in Permalink This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3... The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy... The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word "magic" (interchangeable with "nonsense") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here... The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.
1.0~Not quite the Worst Movie of All Time bruce_joffe Sign in Permalink Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's big, BigBudget homage to Kubrick's 2001. Except it is not. Where 2001, Robert Zemeckis' Contact (which also cast Matthew McConaughey), and Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity used solid science as a launch for deeper philosophical musings, Interstellar begins with ersatz science and degenerates from there. The premise that a planet orbiting a black hole would be a suitable place to relocate Earth's population (after Earth's environmental collapse) is a fatal flaw. Black holes radiate powerful, deadly radiation, and everything circling around them are inevitably sucked closer and closer into the black hole's crushing gravity. Somehow, the hero ("Cooper") gets himself inside the black hole unharmed, where he sees myriad display screens of himself at various times in his life. And somehow he sends his past self a message. The illogic of that circular logic (ignores first cause) breaks the entire arc of the storyline, such as it is. Then there are illogical subplots like the crew rescues an abandoned astronaut, "Dr. Mann," from death and he repays them by trying to kill all of them for no expressed reason. The fight scene between Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) and Cooper (McConaughey) is intercut with something happening back on Earth (setting fire to a cornfield) that doesn't have any apparent connection. The sound balance raises sappy music, designed to portray emotions like heroism, way above the volume of the actors' voices. The audience can't hear much of what they are saying. I thought at first this was a flaw because I assumed that what they were saying would clarify some of the meaningless actions. But now I believe that it was just as it was supposed to be: gibberish. Although Nolan spent many, many millions, and some reviewers think this movie rates their highest number of stars, I say it is close, but not quite the Worst Movie of All Time. Giving it the title of Worst would confer too much attention to this sorry waste.
6.0~Unmatched visuals and writing, yet sentimentalist and most definitely not Nolan's best directorial work gonzaloltovilla Sign in Permalink I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything. Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to "2001: A Space Odyssey" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in "Interstellar" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.
1.0~Nolan, stick to Batman or go away! YouCanDoBetterHollywood Sign in Permalink I'll try to be as objective as possible here, but unlike the premise of this film, you won't be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours. First, I'm not a SciFi fan, but rather (was) a Nolan fan, so I did want to give this film a chance. I don't claim to be a film expert by any stretch, but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with The Thin Red Line (1998) in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance. Further, the visuals in this film were extremely boring! It's outer space, throw in something to look at, even if outside of textbook physics. With the exception of the black holes, it's literally black the entire time (or a Saturn backdrop)! They also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects (or lack thereof). So Earth is dying, but they really never get into the why's and how's in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on. Life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission, which only exemplifies my point. Unless Einstein himself wrote this script, the dialogue in this film is meant to be so over-the-top that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it, nor question it. I had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion. At no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hula-hoop. Good actors can't make up for their own lack of character development. Sure, Cooper cries when leaving his daughter, but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away. I think what bothered me most, and fits the theme for lack of visual effort, were the stupid robots!!! They are basically chrome ATM machines with block appendages! If I was going to cram a bunch of people, and adequate supplies, into a spaceship, I wouldn't design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit! Pure visual laziness...R2-D2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago. The more I write and think about this movie, the more I'm reminded of how awful it was. This to me was Hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goer's time and money!
10.0~It is just Incredible hareshmaher Sign in Permalink I bought a big Popcorn, didn't eat because it was making noise , I bought a big Coca Cola , didn't drink it, Because didn't want to go to make Pee, I breath from my open mouth , because I had cold and didn't want to be disturb by that, This is my first review of a Great Movie,From my above words ,one can really understand how excited I was during this space Epic of Nolan and a great Contagious and poisonous soundtrack of Hans Zimmer , this movie made me forget about everything I had in my mind for almost 3 hours and at the End of the movie I was getting upset that this is going to be soon over and I just don't want it, from beginning to the End , This Journey was full of excitement and surprises , this movie was like few other movies where you really don't know through every frames of movie , what you will find out next , i am fan of every Nolan's work and i also expected a lot from this Movie but coming out of the Movie i felt like not to mention anything about it and just to go back and sit in the middle to experience again Many thanks to Nolan and Zimmer.
1.0~Dismal with "dismal" inscribed on it in filigree. jmlawton Sign in Permalink Reviewer Ketzer said (and I've only read this since I came back) "Should your cinema be graceful and insert a break, USE IT, get out, the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years." and boy was he right. Fortunately my cinema did insert a break, and while I'm home writing this a bunch of poor souls are still suffering. I thought the tedious preamble to the film went on too long, wishing we could get on to the interesting bits. Little did I realise that the tedious preamble *was* the interesting bit! The "story" and "characters" were so unengaging that when (as was bound to happen) one of them expired, I looked at the remaining ones, and couldn't figure out who'd gone. Some people giving one star reviews have said they've done it to balance up the over-puffed 9s and 10s. I don't. This is a 1 star film. It is abysmal. It is truly abysmal.
3.0~crap biancawhitlock Sign in Permalink so so so so boring. first of all, its 3 hours long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no need for it to be THAT LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and most of it is them talking. when it does get to the good part, which is only one part of the movie, that's it, one part that was remotely interesting. i even skip'ed 30 mins at the start (because it was way to long) and i never missed a thing, i pretty much just missed the story time about the dad and the daughter. i usually say with not so great flicks, give it a watch if you have nothing better to watch, like i done when watching this movie.. but its not even worth watching when bored!! if you're hardcore into sci fi, aliens, mars, and astronauts, then you might like it. i liked the martian way better than this.
1.0~Very disappointing GlendenningCram Sign in Permalink I am really amazed at the good reviews this is getting on here, as I found it a huge disappointment. Absolutely nothing about it makes any sense; in fact no single moment in the film follows logically from anything that was happening 15 minutes earlier. The "science" is ridiculous: a six-inch deep ocean with 200-foot waves is one of the more believable elements. The motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute, and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision. The special effects are unimaginative; Kubrick did it all better, without CGI, 50 years ago. The bombastic music's only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue. And the final resolution of the central mystery is utterly nonsensical; involving manually transmitting what must be many, many gigabytes of data in Morse code via the second hand of an old wristwatch. WT*? Definitely NOT recommended.
10.0~Unique...simple astonishing! spiceman16 Sign in Permalink A remarkable story of searching for footprints on a different surface...a story to remind us of the duty we have as earthlings and how things can quickly fall to pieces. A tale about the things parents will sacrifice in order for their children to fulfill their destinies and how that bond between them will always exist. One man's vision turns into another man's ability to pursue that goal at whatever cost to him. The harsh reality that time waits for no man and that no one can ever predict the future without suffering some sort of rejection for the present.
7.0~Not So Stellar heisenberg12 Sign in Permalink It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a "pretty good" film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent.
2.0~A bad movie with music lifted from 2001 davegold-facebook Sign in Permalink I was very, very disappointed by this movie. I had high hopes but it felt like a rather poor ripoff of 2001. It even used music that was eerily similar to 2001. It supposedly had underlying hard science but the science was utter nonsense. The story made no sense, the special effects weren't particularly good, and Matthew McConaughey for some reason was covered in sweat the whole movie, even when he was just sitting around. The opening scenes on Earth were reasonable, and set up interesting possibilities. Particularly the "official history" of trips to the moon gave flavor and personality. But once the rocket launched, it quickly devolved into almost random events that didn't have any particular purpose. Another movie I'd compare this to is "Contact". That very clearly brings up the issue of science vs faith, when the scientist has an experience that she "knows" is real, but there's no data to back it up. She believe in science... but she has to take her experience "on faith". It's just a much clearer telling of the story than this muddled movie. I want both my time and $ back. If you haven't seen this, save your money and rent 2001 instead.
1.0~I Had To Stop Watching... soupster1 Sign in Permalink It starts off with a farmer (Independence Day style), and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because... well... we're not really sure why, but it involves a lot of wind. Then NASA gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of 'space' that comes complete with bad paintings of old 'hubble' pictures, lots of 'space' type language... and gravity. The gravity is ever present. Nothing ever floats about, and they get 'skipped' off the orbit around Mars before whizzing past Saturn (it has rings) and arriving at a black hole. They get through the black hole (like that's possible), by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys. The robots look and act like corn flake boxes, the humans (mostly well known), look bemused... and at that point... I had to stop watching. I was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke... but it wasn't. I don't like ranting, so I won't. Suffice to say that if the Earth has to end... at least let it explode before Hollywood can make another 'turkey' like this. Embarrassingly bad.
7.0~Don't expect too much cm_fox Sign in Permalink Just watched this in New Zealand. The IMDb rating is still above 9 at the time. Not sure it will stay there though. It's not a bad movie but it's not a great one either (which a 9 should be). It's creative in terms of story but it is drawn out. It goes for the Gravity look and feel, being slow, filmed in space and with dialog often replaced with music, but it does not have the suspense of Gravity. It's doesn't draw you in. It just doesn't have enough substance to carry it off. It has plenty of promise but lets you down in the end, especially once you pull all the pieces together to formulate what's going on. It's still worth watching, at 7/10, just don't expect a 9/10.
9.0~General theory of relativity comes alive on screen SangamYadagiri Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a movie worth watching only in large format theaters just for the experience. It's loosely based on the Einstein's General Theory of relativity - going into the black-hole travelling with the speed of light and navigating back and forth in time as one of the physical dimensions. Visually it is interesting to watch the theory of relativity come to reality on screen which is very impressive. It depicts the quantum physics near accurately. The fact that when an object/subject travels with the speed of light, it's original state or age is unaltered/slowed down - is shown convincingly. Apart from the science, the movie strongly revolves around the different Relationships among human beings especially the father daughter one. Matthew McConaughey's acting is very convincing in every scene. Graphics is something that is worth mentioning here. A new technique that has apparently been used in this movie. Normally the green screens have been used to shot the dramatic/action scenes with actors and the computer graphics were created later and then were super imposed. Even thought this technique is very effective as the computer graphic designers can design the graphics effectively according to the actors movements and the script, the actors should imagine the backgrounds which is quite difficult at times. But for this movie shooting, the background graphics were already generated and played in the studio while the actor can feel it and act naturally. The graphics to the viewer may not appeal but in this movie they were apt in the sense that -it's all about the light in the space which may be just white in color or monochromatic theoretically speaking. Narrative is very good with the age old technique of an old person starting to tell the story and the whole story run as a flashback. There have been many movies on the Sci-Fi genre released in the past such as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, Steven Spielberg's ET & Close encounters of the third kind, James Cameron's Avatar, Ridley Scott's Alien & Blade Runner, George Lucas's double trilogy Star Wars, and Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) but Christopher Nolan's Interstellar stands out in many aspects that have not been covered in the previous sci-fi movies that were made over the years. Personally, I still think Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made as it has some of the gigantic jump cuts starting from Rock ages to Space ages and concluding in a very convincing theory (Star Child) and the whole movie is a pure experience and allowing the viewer to immerse completely into movie and stop thinking about it. I regret not watching it in a theater especially a large format one. I would say my second favorite Sci-Fi movie is Interstellar.
9.0~Leaves you wondering matej-trkanjec-133-920386 Sign in Permalink A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called "the most scientifically accurate movie" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.
1.0~Wanted so much to love it. danielskav Sign in Permalink I went out of the movie theater with mixed feelings. I love Sci-fi, I would have like to travel to other planets (not anymore). I wanted to like the movie so much that my brain forgot most of the bad side of it. First I said to people that interstellar was only for Sci-Fi freaks, that it was not a feel good movie (pretty damn dark and depressing) but it was overall a good movie, but my "love" of Sci-fi had block all judgment. After talking to other people who saw it, my view of the film change radically. Here are why : 1. Have you seen stupidest robots than in interstellar. 2. The pilot farmer daughter saw GPS coordinates in "dust" (yeah right) and they goes to those coordinates and "find" NASA bunker. They are abducted by the NASA and the NASA chiefs tells the farmer : you are the one we were waiting to pilot the spaceship that will save humanity... (even tough the NASA didn't sent the dusty coordinates) WTF 3. The extra being/god/or human of the future had placed for humans a wormhole... near Saturn... why so far? 4. They went to a sea planet to rescue/see those sent before. That is a sea planet with no ground to plant food/animals. Not a good choice. And, they couldn't see the giant waves from space? 5. They went to a ice planet to rescue/see those sent before(Ice planet without animals/plants...what's the point) so close to a black hole that a few hours on the planet = 23 years to the spaceship in orbit. Is that a good choice to try to establish a colony on a ice planet near a black hole? 6. The spaceship is relatively small (we could see the 2 shuttles and the ring that create the gravity). Inside the ship, there is the machine to create babies (100-10000 ? fertilized human eggs)without ? the incubators. If you find a planet, yes to the babies, but the spaceship so small that the food/baby milk would be out quite soon. 7. Have you seen so bad cryogenic bed? A kind of trash bag that wrap you up. 8. Nobody's really knows what's inside a black hole, but Nolan's view is ridiculous. Add that the the farmer go out of it and survive, to find is old wrecked house inside a giant spaceship.
10.0~Interstellar is a beautiful masterpiece SimonDiamonds Sign in Permalink I'm going to keep it as brief as possible with no spoilers.I went to watch this movie by myself in a small theater on a less populated day of the week just so I could watch it with no distractions and really soak in the movie.I enjoyed every single minute of it from beginning to end.I felt as if I was in the journey along with what the character was going on.It kept me at the edge of my seat and for a moment I almost forgot I was watching a movie and felt as if it was reality,causing me to feel the emotions of the movie as if I were experiencing each moment in first person.The storyline,the theme,the dialog,the soundtrack was an absolute masterpiece. BRAVO !! INTERSTELLAR YOU ARE NOW IN MY CLASSIC COLLECTION.
10.0~The best movie of the entire civilization www-14686 Sign in Permalink A movie involved philosophy,science,physics,emotion and all of those aspects express perfectly.
10.0~A Tale Of Love And Sacrifice Desertman84 Sign in Permalink Interstellar is a science fiction film that tells the story of space travelers that are in search of a new habitable planet in the outer space.The cast includes Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. It was written by the Nolan brothers: Jonathan and Christopher,who also the director of the film. The time on Planet Earth is nearly up.Cooper,who happens to be a frustrated farmer as it has fallen victim into famine caused by overpopulation; a blight is killing crops and creating massive dust storms; and the rise of nitrogen that is going to cause asphyxiation that will cause the end of humanity.He also happens to be a former NASA Engineer and trained test pilot that lives with his children,Murp and Tom, together with his father-in-law,Donald.One night,Cooper and Murph reach into a secret underground location that was left by NASA wherein a project headed by Professor Brand that intends to find a habitable planet before the clock on earth runs out.Cooper is found to be qualified in this space exploration wherein the destination happens to be a wormhole near Saturn. He later learns that the wormhole happens to be inhabited by aliens of great intelligence that could help human beings survive the current situation and survive the conditions it is currently experiencing.Ten years back,astronauts were sent to scout a dozen possible habitable planets.But now,the human beings final destination is being determined.Mindful of his children's future,Cooper agrees to pilot the craft together with Brand's daughter, Amelia; scientists Doyle and Romilly and the sardonic robot TARS.Later,Murph grows up into adulthood forming anger towards her father.She becomes an astronaut and Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her. The film depicts life on earth for the first 45 minutes.It establishes how humanity is suffering and the close father-and- daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.The theme of sacrifice is fully explored especially after the father decided to leave his daughter for an space exploration for the sake of billions of people on the planet.It eventually disappoints Murph as she finds out that he may not be able to comeback.When the story shifts into space,the journey of the space exploration becomes the focus of the film.It was good to see Christopher Nolan limit the use of CGI effects so as not to overwhelm the viewer and let them go through the narrative which happens to be far from being clichéd and predictable.The conclusion is where it takes its chances as it tries to resolve the conflicts of the story with some questions left unanswered.Despite being 3 hours long,it was far from being boring for it does not drag and the story is told in a breakneck pace. This is a big-budgeted science fiction movie that is worth more than $160 million that has a very simple tale of love and sacrifice which later becomes breathtaking,hopeful and heartbreaking.It is another visual masterpiece from Nolan especially with the great special effects that is far from overwhelming but truly amazing.The operatic music from Hans Zimmer is also worth mentioning.The complex dialogue about the outer space can also be easily understood by the viewer regardless of one's educational background.Finally,it's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This one should definitely be seen inside a movie house for it is an awesome and incomparable theater experience.
10.0~Everything for the fanatical Science Fiction nerd! hakanyttergren Sign in Permalink This is a movie for anyone who loves science fiction. The film had a long playtime. But after I've seen the movie I understood why. It's a galactic experience with such detail and sense of a space simulator. Did you find movie "Gravity" was cool so is this movie light years better. It has a style similar to "2001 A Space Odyssey". But everything in this movie has so much more to effort. This isn't an adventure. It's more like an explosion of details and experiences through a drama perspective. It has it all for the fanatical Science fiction nerd to thrive and the movie does that to the maximum! An excellent movie!
2.0~Creepy ethical and racial undertones empty-bin Sign in Permalink Nevermind the story is up its own butt what with quantum gravitational arithmetic being communicated through time via 5D man-made singularity in MORSE CODE. No, we won't stop to talk about that; it's been thoroughly discussed here. We're going to talk about how incredibly white and American the plan to save "the species" was from the beginning. Plan B - Population Bomb. Both doctors Brand walk us into a gene bank wherein Dr. Brand(F) lets us know the facility contains "5,000 fertilized eggs". Mud asks her how these babies are supposed to be raised. Dr. Brand goes on to describe the process: with the related equipment the first 10 eggs would be selected, processed and incubated and those children raised (by the founding settlers?). Then surrogacy such that within 30 years: "a colony of hundreds". She goes on to say that the real "difficulty" with colonization is "genetic diversity" at which point she pulls ONE CYLINDER filled with eggs out of a wall full of cylinders, opens it and gestures and goes, "this takes care of that." Okay. The mission begins with 4 scientists and 1 ingenious Oki pilot. Natch, only one of them is black and he dies (albeit second) rather mysteriously. So from the start, the colonial settler(s) were going to be white. Having said that, the people responsible for selecting and processing the first 10 eggs, raising the first 10 children and successive children until surrogacy took over were going to be white. Means nothing! ...Until you take into consideration that the space colony built by future 5D humans is populated... entirely... by white people. How did that happen?? Not a single Asian, African, Mid-Eastern or otherwise olive-skinned person appears in ANY of the scenes following that of the black scientist's death. In fact, from the very beginning this movie was light on non-white people. While NASA's conference room thugs re-introduced themselves and gave Mud a rundown of the bravest people ever to live we see photos of the mission leaders - all of them white with the exception of a single Asian male. Additionally, at the start of the film we watch Mud chase down an "Indian drone", hijack it and repurpose it despite the fact that he knew the Indian drone was "looking for something". NASA, perhaps?? Why didn't India know where they were? Weren't they in communication? Who else didn't know where NASA was, where the ship was or what NASA was planning with regard to saving "the species"?? Why wasn't this an international effort? It could still have been secret (and probably better funded!) So now I'm left with questions. Where are all the non-white people in our 5D colonial future? I understand that the colony was likely built by earth humans who survived having applied the quantum data transmitted by Mud across time. This means these weren't the products of the population bomb. That's fine, but what... they just packed bags from the American mid-west and decided to name the colony Screaming Eagle 1 and the new planet when it's founded, New America?? What have I watched? A bid to save humanity driven by a handful of white scientists in the American Midwest excluding every other country on earth? This film thoroughly creeped me out in ways I still have difficulty articulating.
1.0~SF soap opera alexandra-dragomirescu Sign in Permalink Interstellar has some originality into it, it is the first SF soap opera (crying, tears,crying) I have ever seen, made for house wives from rural farm areas, that have no idea about relativity, but believe in the fact that love will save us all and the storm is coming. The movie is long and quite illogical: 1. If the main character sends his girl the message STAY, how come he sends her the coordinates for the NASAlocation? 2. Where did the dust storm come from? The Earth was covered with crops and cities and lakes... 3.What was the effect of the new discovered formula? In the end humanity is around Saturn, not beyond it. It could have gone there from the beginning. 4. How come no character realizes the frozen planet is not suitable for life? The viewer is smarter at this point. All characters have to be told about it...by the villain. 5. On the water planet, how come the waves were do high and the water so few? Why did the character started running on a water she knew nothing about. If it was Enterprise, guess the crew would have used some sensors to see the bottom...No sensors here anyway... 6.Why is technology so rusty (XX century) in this movie, as the space ship is concerned? In the end, the space station around Saturn seems like coming from another movie. 7. How come the character survived in the worm hole without his spaceship that is destroyed? 8. The obsession of the movie is the word gravity, they all pronounce it as if they talk about some God, but what is the real part of gravity in this movie?! 9. The Saturn picture is similar to one taken from a coloring book, all rings so perfect...guess the budget was limited for special effects.
1.0~Garbage; seriously questions humanities future for the praise it gave this film sayedelamin Sign in Permalink I can't believe anyone found this movie even mildly entertaining let alone brilliant. even more preposterous are the comparisons to 2001???? Like all of Nolan's other movies, Interstell I'm not going to write synopsis or give details but simply share my opinion. There was nothing even remotely 'good' about this film. It attempted to blend ideas and plots from past Sci-Fi films, but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess. Everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characters,cheesy and awkward dialog, to the story, or lack thereof made this film unwatchable. The characters did not come off like scientists; they didn't even come off like people in such dire situations would. Such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole. Anne Hathaway's character was particularly inferior. I seriously wanted someone to strangle her. Of course this could have been excused if the movie didn't take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualities/aspects. However, the film tries so hard to be profound, but it ends up being awkward. the end
2.0~Incomprehensible without subtitles alan-467 Sign in Permalink I'm writing this review a month after seeing the movie, so I could be excused for forgetting some of the details. In fact, I've forgotten almost everything about the movie as I've got no idea what it was about! I have a minor hearing problem. It rarely causes me any trouble, but 30 minutes into the movie, I realised that I had not been able to understand a single sentence - either because the "background" music was so loud, the dialogue was so soft, or I couldn't understand the actors' accents. I didn't walk out because I thought that the visuals may have helped, but two hours later I still had little idea of what was going on, and I didn't believe any of it anyway. I've given it 2 out of ten for the photography and special effects, which were amazing. If I thought it might have a reasonable plot, I would have considered buying the DVD when it comes out so that I could read the subtitles, but, having read IMDb's description of the story, I don't think I'll bother.
3.0~I thought it sucked... hard. bad_syntax-1 Sign in Permalink So I kinda wanted to see this, it looked good, I heard great things, but it never looked great to me from the previews. But it stunk, hard. The science stunk, the story stunk, the plot stunk, about the only thing that didn't suck was the casting and characters. The folks in it did a great job, but when everything else sucks it just can't save it. I'm amazed this had such a high rating, what the heck America?!?!? Let me list just a few things that stunk: - It was WAY too long It drug, badly, and never had any form of a climax The science was seriously flawed. Planets with super tidal waves and 1.3g yet 1' of water, floating clouds of ice on a semi-breathable planet, love being a 'dimension', gravity not functioning correctly on 'cooper station', etc, etc. So, um, they sent these guys through the wormhole to check out a few planets. Got it. It took like 90 years. Got it. When he fell back to our solar system, he encountered a huge space station folks lived on. Why the heck didn't they just hop through the same wormhole and land on a beautiful planet instead of spending *massive* resources building a space station? The whole library thing towards the end....oh my gosh was that dumb. The robots were also silly... I mean, they had funny personalities, and a couple neat abilities, but were completely illogical to construct, especially as a military item. – Did I mention it was *extremely* long, too long? Oh, and boring? – Dust takes out the human race? Really... dust??? Seal your house a bit better, grow some plants, move underground... ugh, dust?!?!?!? – We can scan a planet from space now, but they couldn't see the mile high tidal waves moving across the planet? No radars? No telescopes? Didn't notice those on your flyby in the freaking space ship??? I'm guessing the previous pilot who got fired after finding some farmer to replace him was pretty upset. This was painful to watch, and though it has a super high rating, the fact it only made $190M and had a budget of $165M seems to match my feelings on it. It wasn't just me. I'm a technology nerd with far too much knowledge about "space stuff", so I could dismiss that as just me. However, my wife, an MBA sorta person, also didn't like it at all and was extremely bored. She didn't understand the scientific inaccuracies, but the story was too weak to support her attention. Really disappointed in it, obviously. I wouldn't recommend watching this if you are smart unless you have absolutely nothing else to watch. I would love to see a movie that inspired humankind to look towards the stars instead of borders on a map, as it is the only way to truly perpetuate the species, but regardless of what I heard, this was NOT that movie. Reasons for my #, starting at 10: -2 Scientific Inaccuracy -3 Story -2 Movie flow (boredom level) +3 Casting, acting, and relationships
1.0~I know i am currently in the minority but it was bad. blake-e Sign in Permalink I went to this film and all I can say is it was the longest technical demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen. I'm having a hard time writing about this film because I honestly wish I could forget about the film. The film has its strong points and those are visually appealing cinematography and an impressive use of sound. The negatives of this movie are however to many to put in a single review. The film has an alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty well and you get to see Matthew McConaughey do some wonderful acting. However none of the characters were developed enough for you to care for them. However the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene thrown in to keep you awake. The movie is full of quantum physics Jargon that no one could possibly follow. The jargon is about an hour of the movie and I have a fairly basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but I can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context but in the frame of the movie didn't make any sense I'm not writing anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film. It felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid trip.
10.0~From now, Sci-Fis will be categorized as, Before Interstellar and After Interstellar urztrulysooraj Sign in Permalink Interstellar _ My Experience Love is the only thing that transcends Time and Space I am not sure whether I am intelligent enough to review this film, but as a normal viewer, I am going to share my views about the Interstellar Experience. My Interstellar experience started even before watching the film itself, I spent some time, brushing up my knowledge about the theories discussed in the film. The advantage of being a Physics student made my work easy. In fact, the movie became much more understandable. In the near future, our earth becomes more polluted and human beings have to find a new home to survive or at least to stop their species from extinction. NASA sends a group of explorers into a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable land for the humans. This is just the basic plot of a wonderful experience. This is a Christopher Nolan film and he wants the viewer to have some basic knowledge of physics to understand the film. He is best known for the novelty in themes and the emotional approach he takes. The Dark Knight Trilogy director maintains his trademark of elevating the content than the characters. Nolan literally takes us to the outer space, from earth to various planets through the wormhole. One would really feel oneself as Cooper while watching the film. Placing some unexpected events in between, the writer amazes the viewer. Especially, the climax. The final phases of Interstellar were mind-blowing and thought provoking. I was blown away by the ideals Nolan placed in the penultimate scenes. The concept of fifth dimensional sequences inside the tesseract came out as a surprise, those sequences were beyond my imagination. One of the best climaxes ever. While watching the climax, only one thought appeared in my mind, "How can this Nolan be so brilliant and imaginative!" Special Kudos to the Nolan brothers for those excellent and heart touching dialogues. Even in the simpler scenes, certain dialogues came out as wonder. Nolan wanted to express something which any space exploration film didn't express: the eternity of love. The emotional approach Nolan takes to describe the father-daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph was heart touching. He even draws a sketch over the life of space explorers. How they spend years of their life, selflessly, searching for something that will be beneficial for the people on the earth, keeping their lives at risk. The unnoticed friendship between Cooper & TARS and the light humor they produce, proves Nolan's mastery in presenting complex subjects in a simpler way. Christopher Nolan's films which are known for their utmost brilliancy in making also have memorable characters and Interstellar is no exception. Oscar winning Matthew McConaughey, perfected as Cooper. Cooper will always remain as one of the most remarkable characters of all time. He excelled in the emotional scenes. I felt like crying, when Cooper watches the recorded videos sent to him from the earth, such perfection. Anne Hathaway and Miachel Caine too delivered memorable performances as Amelia Brand and Professor Brand. Anne was good in the emotional scenes, especially in the scene, she reveals her love for Edmund. Miachel Caine had an important role this time, a lengthy one indeed. The kid Murph came out as a surprise, Mackenzie Foy had all the emotions required for the character. Jessica Chastain too delivered good performance as the adult Murph. Casey Affleck 's negative shaded Tom and Matt Damon's extended cameo appearance as Dr.Mann were also interesting. The two robotic characters, TARS and CASE too had equal importance in the story line. TARS will surely be remembered as one of the best robotic characters of all time. Music by Hans Zimmer and camera works by Hoyte van Hoytema makes Nolan's simple approach to the complex theme successful. Zimmer offered scores matching the mood of the film, in fact, certain scenes were too silent to be enjoyed, could have made better. Cinematography by Hoytema was a work of wonder. Nolan didn't use any great graphics or anything. He used limited amount of Visual Effects, concentrating more on the subject. So, this film will be a better experience for the ones who believe that content of the film is more important than Visual Effects. Interstellar is more of an experience than a film. Missing this film on Big Screen will end in deep regression. Special Note to the ones who are going for this film: In this film explorers are seen rotating their space ship, usual audience may not be able to understand the theory behind it i.e., the creation of artificial gravity. There are many such moments in the film, which are related to deeper physics. So before watching the film, just go through the topics such as, artificial gravity, wormholes, neutron star, relativity, time dilation and tesseract. An idea about these topic make the Interstellar experience an easier one. I will be able to understand the film "completely" only after watching it again. I am fully satisfied with this Experience. I will be a able to rate this film only after watching it again. "In this universe, there is time, there is space, there is gravity and there is 'love among human beings', which is much more powerful than all other universal parameters." I Thank Christopher Nolan for this Interstellar Experience. Thank You for reading my views about Interstellar. Yours Truly. Sooraj
5.0~Disappointing rubenm Sign in Permalink So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed.
3.0~3 for the visuals, 0 for the story. sonofocelot-1 Sign in Permalink I'm usually happy to sit for half an hour and write a lengthy review. Today I can't be bothered. All I can say is, having hundreds of millions in budget does NOT make for a great director, as Nolan proves here. Being fortunate enough to work with an amazing FX team and having the budget that Nolan does for his films should make amazing visuals a given, and we certainly get them with Interstellar, but that's where anything remotely impressive begins and ends. Like I say, I would usually analyse every single aspect of the film in a review, today I can't be bothered. Simply because, the majority of the 10/10 reviews are DEFINITELY paid for. DEFINITELY. The acting is shoddy, McConaughey in particular is very flat and unlikable. Hathaway is not much better. Even Caine is not at his best. For such a big budget sci-if movie, the visuals (as impressive as they are) are accompanied by slow, lumbered, uneventful and quite frankly boring story. Lack of realism is never a problem for me in films, but lack of excitement definitely is. They could have done so much more, they didn't. I cannot stress enough how much the 10/10 reviews are definitely paid for, and I encourage you to watch a 3 minute clip on YouTube of the best CGI moments of this film. That's all that's worth watching. It's otherwise a real, real letdown. Nolan once again proving that he's extremely hit and miss, and extremely overrated. Anyone can make a good visual with enough money, but you can't buy talented writing/directing. 3/10.
1.0~Ridiculous p-darkhal Sign in Permalink this movie was awful, I was deceived by the fake rating. it was full of pseudoscience, so superficial and boring. every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional. being a PhD student in science, I envy SciFi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by non-professional audience. such a ridiculous robot, underground NASA that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition, the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water, entering the black-hole unprotected, LOVE being the 5th dimension, contacting through black-hole by pushing the books! Oh my! can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind: don't waist your time.
3.0~Interstellar Nonsense. robert-259-28954 Sign in Permalink This excuse for a big budget thriller was the same movie as "Gravity," with an equally unbelievable storyline to go with it. Gravity was a totally incredulous, high tech cartoon, with absolutely no emotional content. Interstellar is a high tech cartoon with soap opera emotion gone horribly awry. First, a great film has to create that illusive, "willing suspension of disbelief." Any film maker can make fantasmagorical imagery, but if it doesn't maintain some degree of reality, a movie can go south like a flock of frightened fowl. And that's what this overstepping scifi farce was, a turkey. A pseudo serious, tear jerking moon walk with a premise as weak and flawed as it's desire to be more than what it was... pure Hollywood drek dressed in melodramatic clothing... er, spacesuits.
2.0~Another wow movie tomduffycpa Sign in Permalink Another nearly three hour journey into space and special effects. Humans must travel far to find a plot. I guess the special effects and sound WERE the plot. I was thinking the 8+ rating was because the super creative surprise ending was coming. Nope. It was more like, OK, we are out of worm holes, black holes, dust bowls, docking suspense, tidal waves, and multi-whiteboard formulas, so, let's just use a Southpark ending and....it's gone. My review is supposed to be at least ten lines, because they want my review to take as long as this movie. The movie did have quite a few big names included. So must have had a big budget. I guess I'll check what the box office was. Now I know why I never heard of this movie. What happened to earth anyway? Saving the people on earth was the objective and you never find out what happened, even though the writer had three hours to get to a conclusion. Oh brother...
1.0~Disappointment FreakRenegade Sign in Permalink I was expecting another movie, I expected a science fiction movie, a philosophical movie. I am very disappointed. This movie is boring. Meaningless. Excellent special effects, good actors, McConaughey talented, every little expression every little gesture. Scientific theories all true, inserted in a context so should be simplified. They are too difficult, the dialogs all chaotic. This film does not make sense. And the worst science fiction movies that I've seen. Getting started is as annoying as the main character behaves with one of the two children, treats him like an old rag, while her daughter her favorite is the queen. for 2 hours of film his obsession with his family; no excuse for the daughter she existed only to get to the end where his daughter, does not care about his father. The cube that looked like the Borg cube, sent from the future in a time without time ....... The other astronauts launched into space as a sling from a black hole .... This movie does not make sense I repeat: The worst science fiction movies ever seen. Sorry for my bad English
1.0~the worst movie i've seen in 10 years cyril-royez Sign in Permalink THE worst and longest movie i have ever seen ! acting : it might be the worst performance of all these great actors, sound : a terrible midi synthesizer not even acceptable for a sitcom, image : bad Photoshop of static images of Saturn, scenario : could have been a very interesting to play with relativity theory but a complete failure, moral : if we destroy the earth, let's find a new planet with an American flag ! very very bad recycling of the some good elements of 2001 space odyssey I could write pages of bad elements of this movie, but you got the point : don't loose your time !
5.0~One serious flaw mb-155 Sign in Permalink They spend a vast fortune on firms like this. They must spend so much more to get a big return than say a TV series like Star Trek or Stargate SG1 might so they should get all things right not some right and some wrong – yes? The new frontier stuff like seeing earth from a great distance and the end of the film were both "far out" and good. Yet not being able to hear the actors for most of the time is a crime that does not occur with a film like Gravity where the actor's voices are crystal clear. Even at the start we had issues; the three people in the SUV where did the son vanish to and driving back to the combine harvesters with a flat tyre. Not a brilliant start for a serious science fiction film as opposed to less serious science fiction like Edge of Tomorrow which was brilliant all the way through and yes you can hear the actors like Tom Cruise. Why do they always whisper that's not acting if you can't hear them. Matthew McConaughey may be a good actor but why talk in whispers against a background of loud music and sounds and the much more important computer graphics. Little wonder the android type computer says: "Why are you whispering they can't hear you". Maybe director Christopher Nolan encourages this as even Anne Hathaway sounded like she was in another room at times. Perhaps they should have use Matt Damon in the lead role because you can at least understand him. At least when he got angry I could hear McConaughey. But we stuck with this film like Starship Troopers even though travelling through the wormhole owes a lot to the TV series Stargate SG1 and yes we could hear Michael Caine.
3.0~In Space No One Can Hear You Yawn BRYN-26 Sign in Permalink Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001. Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off? Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes! Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you! The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design). Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer. The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son). Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art? Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well. A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001.
3.0~Age Inducing Boredom lexva5 Sign in Permalink This must be one of Nolan's most boring films despite its high intentions. Matthew McConaughey seemed as fake as ever in this movie and hated his accent (my subjective opinion) and the dialogue was as real as mickey mouse. When the time came to watch footage of his aging children, from his spaceshp, and he cried profusely, I took the hint and stopped watching. There were a couple effects to behold and initially the story seemed intriguing. However after one hour of watching this drivel I really felt like I was wasting my time. Also felt there was no chemistry between actors as well, nothing to hold the film together not even the spaceship.
3.0~Too long, too inconsistent, dialog too vague mmagliaro Sign in Permalink I really wanted to like this movie. After seeing it, I came away thinking, "It could have been great." But alas, there are just too many basic things wrong with it. 1. It is somewhat too long for the amount of story. At nearly 3 hours, there are simply too many sections of it that drag on without enough progress in the story. Cutting about 1/2 hour out would have picked up the pace and made it much better 2. Too many scientific inconsistencies. They take off from Earth in a conventional rocket with separating stages needed to escape Earth's gravity, yet there are scenes when they miraculously jet away from massive planets many times Earth's size (with gravity at least comparable to Earth's) in smaller portable vessels. The worst example of this is the reveal that the father actually sent the "Stay" message back through time to his daughter, completely overlooking the age-old time paradox that if someone from the future were to communicate to the past and were to alter it in any way, it would change their very presence in the future. 3. Too many scenes rush through explanatory dialog quickly and with poor sound fidelity so that it's easy to miss key phrases or explanations. That happens often in the transmissions from home. 4. There's too much jumping around between parallel plots with rapid cut scenes so it makes the story awkward to follow. For example: When they lost touch with Romilly and then find him again, 23 years of his life have gone by. They had discussed the plan earlier, so that the viewer understood that time would slow down for the ones who left the ship. They return to the ship and he has aged. That's all good and consistent (although I pick a bone with the fact that he could have gone to sleep for much of that time and not aged as much... after all, they all knew that this would happen). But later, in the scene where Mann has busted Coop's helmet and he's dying from the ammonia atmosphere, and Brand is madly flying to save him, we have this great action with him fighting on the planet with Mann, his helmet gets cracked, he calls Brand, she is flying to save him. Back and forth it goes... her flying, shouting, "faster faster faster!", Coop gasping for air, Mann walking off being the villain who can't even look at Coop as he is dying... and then... we have scenes of Romilly figuring out that Mann's data, which he is extracting from the robot, isn't "right"... ... and then Brand saves Coop, and then the ship with Romilly in it blows up... What the ??? Yes, you can figure it out, but it is very clumsy, and in fact, cutting back to Romilly tinkering with the robot while Brand is saving Coop just kills the tension and drama of that sequence. I kept feeling like cutting back to him was just plain getting in the way. There's too much of this: little bits intercut while something else is going on. I know they are trying to portray the passing of events at different speeds and the action on simultaneous worlds, but this above-mentioned scene is just one example of places where they take this too far and do it unnecessarily. 4. Finally, they play fast and loose with important-sounding Einsteinian explanations of gravity, time, matter, and black holes, neatly explaining physical and universal phenomena that simply aren't true.
8.0~Although amazing, not as amazing as people make it out to be. Floclung Sign in Permalink I saw this movie in an IMAX theater and I have to say, although it has amazing visuals and suspenseful music, I was disappointed. The story was engaging, I cared about the characters but it didn't touch me and it didn't amaze me. The visuals: Everything about them was breathtaking. The use of models and little CGI really impressed me and the camera angles were close to perfect. It seemed like everything was planned and planned again, kinda reminded me of a Kubrick style movie (somewhat like 2001) but more dynamic. All the space stuff was amazing and completely silent which added to the movie as a whole. The music: Now, I have a few problems with it. I didn't really like it because it seemed to repetitive. Usually, the soundtracks made by Hans Zimmer always impress me but this time the music felt too repetitive. Is was all like someone was beating a drum in my ear over and over again. Though it did add to the movie, I just didn't really care for it. The plot: Now, I'm gonna go into a bit of a spoiler zone, so if you haven't seen the movie I suggest you stop reading right about here. So, I usually have a rule that I tend to get mad when it gets broken and this rule is that when you make a sci fi movie you either go for the "realistic" future, in which the laws of physics and technology and everything about it is plausible, to some extent (like Gattaca, Moon etc.), or you make a future that is set in another world that has its own rules (like Star Wars, Star Trek etc.). You never mix the two, and if you do it's very hard to make it work. Interstellar doesn't really make it work really well. It starts of as a hard sci fi and near the end it turns into complete fantasy. From the moment Cooper enters the black hole the movie is ruined for me because the movie sets out to be believable and right at that moment becomes too much. I couldn't get over it. If it happened in another movie, or if the movie started out as the type of movie that throws this kind of "fantasy" things in your face I would've been okay with it, but when the whole point of the movie is to make it seem so real and possible and every little thing has science behind and that it and could happen in real life, when it tries so hard to make you think about it as a real world and tries to make you think about every detail in it the whole ending of the movie makes 0 sense. The ending really dropped the ball in my opinion. Overall, a great movie, stunning visuals, great, if a bit repetitive, music and a good story until the end. 8/10
1.0~Overrated and dumb sleons Sign in Permalink Don't waste your time watching this film. Every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through. I found fascinating the parallel story that's being told between the main character and his daughter. At some point Nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases. The film is a huge contradiction. And the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is. They are on a mission that's more important than any personal issue, man kind's future depends solely on the success of it. But fø©k that, in this kind of Hollywood bullshit protagonists can't die (just because test audiences don't like that, it makes them really really sad) so against all odds McConaughey makes it back home. Hooray for him, and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending. Mark my words... by the time Matt Damon appears you will be compelled to kick Christopher Nolan right in the balls. I read that they were advised by physicist in order to be "scientifically accurate". I'm sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001, event horizon, etc. Interstellar is a cash grab. If you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole. Christopher Nolan might have already had his way with you. My asshole is intact because I torrented this bad boy. Suck on that film industry!
1.0~Another moneymaker psy99999 Sign in Permalink The first few minutes were good and promising. However soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster cliché, even if in an unusual packaging. Let's compare it to Transcendence. Despite its few flaws, Transcendence depicted a very realistic scenario from beginning to end. It was reasonable with its depiction of humans too and remained so throughout. Not so this one. It was made for the masses and the whole premise is stupid. The scary thing is that this salivating 'blockbuster' is cheered with a 9 rating while Transcendence is written off as something unreal.
1.0~Space Junk bendiab Sign in Permalink Having slogged through this movie, with every scene more painful to watch than the last, the overriding feeling I was left with was one of seething anger and resentment. Three hours of my life wasted watching this tripe when I could have been doing something more enjoyable, like sticking hot pins into my eyes or eating pieces of broken glass. An hour into this supposed masterpiece of a film and I was wishing for a black hole of my own to crawl into, anything to escape the $160 million worth of steaming nonsensical horse sh*t closing in around me. I have never taken drugs but Interstellar is what I imagine a bad LSD trip is like. What exactly was the point of the scene at the start with the Indian air force drone? and the school scene for that matter. Movie not long enough? - They didn't know about the massive cliff they were about to drive off? despite it only being a short drive from home? - Hang on,the secret NASA base just happens to be an easy drive from the farm? -Er, so the only way for er, future bookshelf-playing Coop to communicate with umm, past Coop is by using magic magnetic dust? - So you can send high quality video messages to Earth from the far reaches of space but the 'scientists' could only send rudimentary pings about the planets? - Returning to the house during the dust storm the driver bizarrely parks about 20 yards away from the front door, why? - 'Scientists' have the ability to design craft to fly to Saturn, through a wormhole, and LAND on planets, but are defeated by 'blight' whichdoesn't seem to affect the pristine baseball diamond? - A wormhole explained with a post it note and a pencil seemingly provides sufficient information for our hero to zoom off to said hole. 'Woah woah that's more than enough information for me slick' drawled our hero, 'I'll take it from here' - Those robots dear oh dear oh dear oh dear, a square box is apparently the most suitable design for a cramped spaceship? it's something my 3 year old builds using baby Lego - If NASA wanted Coop to fly the ship why didn't they er, phone him and ask? maybe even invite him to pop around for a visit considering he is only a short drive away - Why not just send the boxbot to collect the probe from the puddle planet? - So he floats through a black hole, down some kind of sparkly shaft until he ends up floating behind the bookcase? This isn't sci-fi, it's a new genre I shall call 'magic comedy caper'. I had so much more to say but I can't bring myself to waste any more of my life on this nonsense. It's rubbish.
1.0~Very Bad Valorum Sign in Permalink Before seeing it, I heard how apparently realistic this movie was in being true to the science. Yet it was anything but. The whole plot nonsensical. Not the worst movie I've seen (would rate it 5.0 if it wasn't for the incredibly high rating). I know I'm nitpicking here but: A saturn rocket type take off, yet they are able to get off another planet with similar gravity with a tiny shuttle which already used part of its fuel for landing. The spaceship rotated to create gravity however that would not mean there is any in the middle section where most of the scenes are. Not even gonna bother going into the worhmhole/bookase/mores code thing. Interesting concept but rather weak story.
2.0~What is wrong with me? harcobouwman Sign in Permalink So many questions, what's wrong with me? Why is the contrast between the average and my rating so big? Am I the only one with this deception level? Did I actually see Interstellar or did I watch an amateur makeover? I just cannot understand why Mr. Nolan burned so much money on a movie so less convincing when it comes to special effects, emotional depth, character complexity and overall credibility? Why losing so much time in the boring first hour and rush in the end? Why is this movie a bad mixture of The Knightrider and Flash Gordon to me? Is it the infant approach of the development of the emotions? Is it the acting capacity of McConaughey that looks like a bad copy of David Hasselhoff in The Knightrider? What's wrong with me?
2.0~Interstellar - a mess of a film. happyhappystephen Sign in Permalink I watched Interstellar on an IMAX screen, I found not one of the characters sympathetic. I didn't mind the science talk, some of the dialogue was clunky. I found Dr Brands revelation and Matt Damon's character's deceit chilling. The black guy on the space flight was interesting. The emergency docking scene was good. I didn't like the scene where Cooper is crying watching the videos of his children after being on the water planet, thought it was over the top. The score was interesting but overpowering, it was hard to hear the dialogue at times. I didn't like the first ending in the black hole. The second ending on the space stationy thing had a nice touch when Murphy told Cooper to go to Amelia Brand, there was a touch of forgiveness in that, encouraging her father to go be with the daughter of Dr Brand who deceived her. Finally, every time I think of the film my head hurts, I probably won't watch another Chris Nolan film as Inception really hurt my head when I thought about that after watching it too. Chris Nolan seems to have developed into an overbearing and heavy handed director, in Interstellar there is little grace and lightness of touch pervading what he puts up on the screen, basically I think Interstellar is a mess of a film, I did enjoy little parts of it, but that doesn't make it a satisfying film. So I'm only giving it 2/10.
1.0~Less than stellar by at least 5 dimensions terrypeck Sign in Permalink I got something out of this movie. I really did. It was 35 degrees Celsius outside the cinema and all I needed was a three hour nap in cool air-conditioning. Lucky me! The latest Nolan film, just there for the taking. It started off as I hoped it would, all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the U.S. otherwise known as nowhere, the end of the world syrupy American-style, little kid tugging at the heart strings - my eyelids already beginning to droop even before Coop and his daughter Murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very Jewish daughter inhabit (guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director), but that was fine, I was almost in REM sleep - not having been able to process a word of dialogue from McConaughey in over 20 minutes. Pure bliss. And it got even better from an insomniac's point of view. Thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative CGI effects, my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of... well, let's just call it credulity. I don't sleep this well at home! Wait! We're going through another Kubrick-style time dimension - didn't we just spend half an hour on this planet re-using some special effects, this time made to look like giant waves, left over from Inception? I think so, but time warps so nicely when you're practically snoring. I think we lost an astronaut somewhere. Maybe that's the game. Who's next? I hope it's the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist. Either that or it was origami for dummies. Maybe that *was* the guy we just lost - hard to tell, they all act the same. Flat as the dialogue. Thanks guys. Anyway, we can only pray it will be Hathaway soon. She's starting to keep me awake. How can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? But I'm being unfair; I think I remember her trying to act some of this script. Brave move from an Oscar winner. I'm starting to want my money back. Anyway, I'm roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy. We're in another galaxy's version of Antarctica minus the faintest signs of life - this despite (because of?) the unzipping of a new bad actor. Fortunately, this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and I'm soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod. I think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a Dave and HAL routine. He must think he's in a good movie. Poor sod. Did I mention there must have been yards of Inception on the cutting-room floor last time because I'm watching more and more outtakes? Gotta save a few million here and there. I had a dream. I dreamed that Nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick. But they carried me out on a stretcher before I found out if it was true. Apparently, I was having a nightmare screaming "Morse Code! No! No! No! Not Morse Code! That's Spielberg!" at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons' naps. I was obviously paying too much attention even comatose.
2.0~The worst best reviewed movie ever dennis-hinkamp Sign in Permalink I don't usually like to write reviews with spoilers but this is the only way to dissect how ridiculous this movie is and I'm not even talking about the black hole science part. I makes so little sense on many levels. This is one of those movies people will think is brilliantly complex and moving or melodramatic. Maybe it was my mood or expectations but I'm going with the latter. Seemed like great sci- fi premise lost to a weepy love-conquers-all romantic journey. It always gets a little thick when you start talking about black holes, event horizons and singularities. There is a nice reinvention of the helpful robot on the crew but the rest of this imagined future is still run by Dell laptops and mathematical equations on chalk boards? Even reviewers who I usually trust have become Nolan fanboys and talking Academy Award for Matthew McConaughey!? Really? In place of a real story they just asked an A-list of actors to do their best crying. I was like screaming at the screen when he goes on a driving rampage through a corn field..the most valuable resource left on this view of the world to catch a jet powered drone somehow with is Toshiba Toughbook and almost drives off a cliff in the middle of Kansas? You just know the two non-star crew members are toast but the poor guy left behind for no good reason while they go to the water planet has to just sit there for 23 years...thanks guys. This movie needed a good Segourney Weaver character to slap some people silly
9.0~A great movie, nothing more, nothing less jeffrey-charlebois Sign in Permalink I will tell you this... this movie is great. That's it. My expectation weren't high, even if we all know that Christopher Nolan has quite the portfolio of movies. The Dark Knight is amazing, Inception is out of this world and Memento is pure genius, but Interstellar doesn't quite reach the level these movies have obtained. First a will tell you this, the movie is slightly too long to my taste. I've look at my watch too many times. Yes I understand the long stretch of dialogues are not for everybody but I most say it was the right amount for this movie. The action was also the right amount. The visuals are superb and it's nice to see a new vision of the galaxy and dimensions, for once, that is not completely copied from 2001: a space odyssey. I must say that this movie brings what we were waiting for from last year's Gravity. The cast is simply magnificent. I liked the character backgrounds and the plot twists (yes, there are multiples as expected). The whole philosophical questionings about the purpose of humans and life are really important to this movie and it is the key purpose of this movie. I ask nothing less from Nolan. Truly a great movie and I highly recommended if you have a 3 hours to kill. 9/10
6.0~Lots of goofs! hghazaryan Sign in Permalink Yet another Nolan's film. With all the flaw and strong sides (scientific accuracy not being one of them). There are many questionable moments in the plot, related to the characters, such as why wouldn't a man wish to send his sick child to a safer place? What's the message of the film - don't leave your beloved ones behind? Don't mess with your mother-planet? But most annoying were to me personally the scientific inaccuracies. Sending a message back from the event horizon just like that? Yeah, right!... Tidal forces of such a magnitude that cause such an incredible waves, yet, they don't tear the planet apart? Or at least heat to boiling temperatures? Shall I continue? Authors should have hired a college student as scientific consultant. There's one things I dislike more than stupid movies - stupid movies that pretend to be smart. Other than that it's nicely filmed and played, although nothing extraordinary.
4.0~A Bit of a Disappointment mmccord9126 Sign in Permalink When I first heard of the making of this film, I had reservations about it. Then, I learned that a well-known scientist(Kip Thorne) was attached to it as a technical consultant and my interest began to increase. Getting it right, scientifically, seldom works with the film industry, although there have been limited occasions where it has. Avatar, Kubrick's classic 2001 back in 1968, and one even further back, Forbidden Planet (1956) show that it can be done. With this in mind, I thought this might be one of those rare ones that could live up to my expectations. I mean, after all, Christopher Nolan and Thorne. How could it fail. I've always believed that, in order to make a quality science fiction film, you have to have a writer that knows what the genre is all about. In this case, there is not only the potential for quality writing from Nolan but also scientific expertise from one of the top scientist in the field - what could go wrong...go wrong.... Well, in spite of all that, it did just that. Yes, it was a visual treat that applied all the wonderful effects developed over the years. And it did that very well. But that's not enough anymore; at least not for me. What I experienced instead was story that was based on a premise that was faulty almost from the start with scientific shortcomings and implausible circumstances. And that's where the disappointment comes in for me. I can understand Nolan's possible lack of detailed knowledge of wormholes, time dilation, gravity effects, and the like, but how could a respected scientist like Thorne allow it? Unless of course he had little control over the film's production. Alas, that is probably the case. I'm not going into any detail about the the actual story because that is already well documented in other reviews. I end with a final summary and opinion: If you know little about that actual scientific aspects of the various theories touched upon in this film, you'll probably find it entertaining. If, on the other hand, you have sufficient knowledge of what we humans actually know of such things; you too, may be a bit disappointed.
6.0~weak storyline, this film is over-rated. Hunky Stud Sign in Permalink i was expecting to see an exciting sci-fi film which will keep you watching till the end due to its high rating, but it was a disappointment. it has several problems in no particular order. 1. the robot's design is too simple and ugly. it was basically a square with a computer screen in it. if people can send spaceship beyond the moon, shouldn't the robots have more functions? this ugly robot doesn't even have two hands. it can't really do anything other than talking. 2. the robot's voice sounds just like matt damon. i thought that they want to save money, so they just used the same actor. it made the film sounded cheap. 3. cooper the character didn't do anything scientific, all of sudden, he was flying a spaceship into the deep space? that didn't make sense. 4. lack of asians. in 2016, black people are protesting lack of "diversity" in Oscar, this film didn't have any Asian faces in it. there are more Asian scientists than blacks . this film failed to hire Asian actors.
3.0~Only sheeple must love this non sense movie kuneroo Sign in Permalink What a waste of time. Seriously, completely waste of time. When you are a simple person, with simple thoughts, just like a sheep, you can only love hypes and act like a parrot. The too low rated movie sky line is just pure reality compared to this movie. I was getting bored after 15 minutes of awful drama acting. So when he finally went up to space, I thought okay, let's do it... But omg, it even got worse... The only thing I liked, was the simple quick words about relativity and space time continuum and the wormhole. The black hole stuff, was ridiculous. Well I do not go any further, it just a waste of tears.. If this was an 8.8 rating, humanity is doomed and full of when-I-say-jump-you-say-how-high brainwashed sheeple. Sci-fi all the way, but this movie is not even close to shiite.
6.0~Confusion spoils good space yarn davphv Sign in Permalink I watched this on DVD. The first half of the movie seemed like it needed an intro as to why the world was so devastated. Also why there were no threat of violence from gangs hoarding all the resources like most other apocalypse movies? Nice human touch, but not realistic. We don't know anything about the planet except for the slice of life of a dozen people. What happened to the weather patterns? Strike one. How does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. Strike two. The middle of the movie was the best part. Their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. The ending with Morse communication was snake oil and mirrors. Where did that multi-dimensional structure come from? Seemed like it came from 2001 Space Odessey. Strike three. The plot leaps from grounded science to Twilight Zone too often for me. Before the movie I was wanting to give it a high grade, but I don't think I'll even watch it again. Anne Hathaway bumps it up a notch.
4.0~Nolan is intelligent and will recover but might benefit from making smaller films which can still support some of his bigger ideas. Likes_Ninjas90 Sign in Permalink Amidst the stars in the galaxy known as Hollywood a deep mystery remains: who is Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker? After seeing Interstellar in IMAX, his ninth and least satisfying film, the question perpetuates. Nolan is one of the most powerful and bankable directors in the world. Together, his last four films earned nearly four billion dollars. Money builds opportunities and egos in Hollywood and consequently each entry in Nolan's filmography has grown in size and scope. Yet outside of his admiration for 35 mm film and practical effects, grasping Nolan's auteurist imprint is difficult. He says he wants to make the biggest film possible but so does Michael Bay. Nolan's films walk a difficult line, balancing large ideas and explosions, proving blockbusters don't have to be mindless. But these are studio films, without insight into the filmmaker himself like transparent ideological goals. In interviews, Nolan mirrors this impersonal nature. He is softly spoken, measured and serious, concurrent with the thematic goals of his films like the hidden identities of men. In 2010 The Guardian asked if Nolan is the new Stanley Kubrick, a misguided comparison with superficial parallels. Kubrick distanced himself from Hollywood by owning his own cameras and editing equipment. He also relied on the specificity of images to create meaning rather than dialogue, making his films cinematic in form, not merely scope. Stylistically Terrence Malick (The Tree of Life) is a more appropriate companion to Kubrick. Artistically, Nolan shares more in common with Steven Spielberg as both directors inject ideas into the existing framework of sizable studio films. Spielberg was originally hired to direct Interstellar with Nolan's brother Jonathan writing the script from an idea by physicist Kip Thorne. Christopher Nolan replaced Spielberg and helped rewrite his brother's script. The first hour of Jonathan's original script was set on Earth and retained but his brother's decision to refine the space elements has drawn comparisons to Kubrick's flawed masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey and Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. To this point, I have enjoyed many of Nolan's films but Interstellar's script is terribly inconsistent. Using a mostly narrow, linear structure, the narrative hurls ideas at us about climate change, parenting, space exploration, time travel and alternate dimensions, but the script lacks refinement. The Nolans talk over us, not to us. In a self-conscious move to intellectualise a "save the world" story, they substitute detailed characterisation and backstory in favour of impenetrable scientific discussions about relativity and gravity. An embarrassingly rich cast is left to substantiate these thinly realised characters. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a former pilot who is now a widowed farmer with two young children, including a girl named Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and an ageing father-in-law (John Lithgow). Cooper, not dissimilar to Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, is an archetype of the reckless parent who is sentimentally motivated by his children and largely only interesting because of McConaughey's predictable charisma. Earth is doomed because of dust storm and droughts, a nod to The Grapes of Wrath, leading Cooper to be tasked by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) with travelling into space and investigating three potentially inhabitable planets. Another major character is Brand's astronaut daughter Amelia (surely named after Amelia Earhart), played by Anne Hathaway. Her reliable expressiveness instills some surface emotions to an otherwise stony character, with no backstory or arc. Other actors are either underused or have distracting cameos. An actress the quality of Jessica Chastain deserved a bigger part but only features deep into the story in a forgettable role as the adult Murph. This time the self-seriousness which gave the Batman films a unique stylistic tone is Nolan's Achilles' heel. While desperate for the story to emotionally resonate, resorting to extended close-ups of Cooper crying for leaving his children behind, he remains unaware of the story's absurdity. It is an insurmountable task when the dialogue is dry, textbook theory and the plotting becomes increasingly ridiculous, attempting to marry between the spaces of a bookcase shelf the pretensions of alternate dimensions with a family melodrama. There are also episodes where the stock characters fail to move us. During the exploration of the first planet a side character is killed, which expectedly strikes a chord with Cooper and Amelia, but matters little to us when we've barely come to know the character's name. Other singular moments remind us of how skillful Nolan is with set pieces. The first entry into outer space is intensely realised, with the galaxy being simultaneously beautiful and dangerous. The infrequency of these emotions stresses how undisciplined the narrative is, particularly in an incoherent, final hour, which doesn't utilise the multilayered structure of The Dark Knight Rises or strike Inception's emotional high notes. Watching the film in the IMAX format is as inconsistent as the narrative. Hoyte van Hoytema, the usually reliable Dutch-Swedish photographer who shot Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Her and Let the Right One In with great symmetry, has replaced Nolan's regular photographer Wally Pfister. Surprisingly, the early scenes on Cooper's farmhouse are poorly lit and the images are muddy and graining, a deliberate imitation of the sandstorms, but an ugly choice all the same. Other shots use the full volume of the IMAX screen and the scale is impressive. Some of the galactic images are awe-inspiring and vivid but their scarcity coupled with the tight, obstructed camera-work inside the spacecraft, is disappointing. Uncharacteristically, Nolan's pacing is also laborious, dragging the film to his longest running time of nearly three hours. The film isn't as calculated as 2001, a difficult feat for any director, but pales substantially to last year's terrific Alfonso Cuaron film Gravity, which eclipses Interstellar for precision. It was made for sixty-five million dollars less. It is half the length and aside from being a technically superior film, it understands the futility of a large canvas unless our emotional investment is supported by strong characters.
8.0~A visual treat for Sci-Fi fans CMTiago Sign in Permalink As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story. The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy. In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied. Rating: 8/10
1.0~Untelligible in all senses mwdhowell Sign in Permalink Matthew M mumbles and mumbles. No idea what he's on about. MM is miscast. We need someone who is audible and attractive. It's dusty but the dust doesn't settle on the corn. (No dust cloud follows the pick-up as they plough through the cornfield, chasing a drone.) This is a totally unexplained encounter. The family are so busy watching the drone that they nearly drive over a cliff even though they are on their own land. Perhaps because they are driving the pickup blind, yet fast enough to keep up with a jet-powered drone. Hello??? No intelligible explanation for how MM landed the drone, what he found in it, how a groovy pile of dust helped him find the space station nor why they hired him to fly the mission. Why should Michael Caine be the NASA project director - he is hardly an obvious rocket scientist! Why such a bizarre robot? And did it wake them all up before the worm hole - or did I miss how that was to happen in the mumbles. Lo and behold - despite having travelled for months to the wormhole end near Saturn, they find themselves right beside a suitable planet at the other end. But I guess that was the work of "them". It is key to the plot, but there is no scientific concept that would make 1 hour on a planet into 7 years. And how come the open sea is paddle-able and a vast tsunami appears? Despite the size of the waves all is immediately calm and they seem to be predictable stuck. Some equally improbable idea was going to solve this problem but I'd lost interest. It is the moment I walked out. The movie to that point was uninteresting, and wholly illogical. I really thought with all the hype, it would be compelling, Instead it was plain irritating. Anne Hathaway was okay. At least we could hear what she was saying! And we could hear everyone else for that matter. Poor miscast good ol' boy Matthew. I have now read the Wikipedia synopsis, which is likewise unintelligible, and am hugely glad that I left - even though I have wasted one hour of the two hours I saved by writing this review!
3.0~A Dumbing Down Experience westsideschl Sign in Permalink A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love.
10.0~Nothing Not to Like in this movie! The music is transcendant vinnydigirolamo Sign in Permalink I've watched this show many times. Mix time travel across the galaxy and I'm in. Plausible, suspenseful and it may take a few times to get all of the gory details figured out - my kind of a movie.
6.0~It's all to do with space and time. xxharrison Sign in Permalink Interesting set up introduces us to a disintegrating near-future world. There's an intriguing reference to re-writing history, along the lines of Capricorn 1, where planetary exploration is faked in a film studio. McConaughey is the astronaut turned farmer who takes a circuitous, and somewhat unlikely, route back to being a rocket man. Interstellar tries to get the science right but quantum physics doesn't make for the best dialogue. Neither are helped by dropping the spoken track way down in the sound mix. McConaughey's tendency to speak through gritted teeth doesn't help either. Although it looks great and is often very imaginative, the film takes too much time exploring dead ends and detours. At times, it felt a bit like a very long trailer for a very epic series. And it really does seem very long, without ever settling on a unified theme. The time anomaly aspects were good, but too much time was spent getting there.
7.0~Worst Christopher Nolan Movie Ever fawn_jane Sign in Permalink When I first saw previews of the movie, I thought it looked really sappy and unappealing. But then I saw it was a Christopher Nolan movie and I thought it had to be good. I love all his movies: Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION. He's made so many great movies, I thought there was no way it could be that bad... well it was. The movie starts out and the premise just makes no sense. I don't understand what humanity's problem is in this movie. Humans survived for literally 100s of thousands of years before farming was invented, but all of sudden we're all going to die just because we can't grow wheat and okra anymore. It isn't explained satisfactorily at all. People have cars and electricity, but they can't have an MRI machine? MRI machines are not that hard to build. The world of Interstellar makes no sense and they don't even try to explain it. But the biggest problem is that the movie is boring, so very boring. We start out on this boring farm. I couldn't wait for the main characters to leave this boring planet, but they just dragged it out with the sappiness and the "please don't go!" There are so many scenes that just seem to pointlessly drag on and make you wonder why the editor dropped the ball so much. Then when go off into space it gets a lot more exciting... some of the time. Thinking about grativity, and relativistic time effects is pretty cool, but this is puncuated with some odd interpersonal conflicts that don't really play out in a compelling or sensical way. For some reason Hollywood has decided that romantic relationships aren't compelling anymore. That sort-of makes sense, it's kind of silly when movies are about two people who just met and then all of sudden they fall in love and are willing to kill and die for each other. But they have replaced romantic relationships in movies with something less compelling: boring, undeveloped relationships. The main character has a son and a daughter, but for some reason the father doesn't seem to care that much about his son, and instead the movie revolves around his relationship with the daughter. But honestly, I did not care about them. None of the characters were particularly interesting or likable. You could replace the actors with any other big name actors it would not have made much of a difference. There was so much in the movie that I just plain old didn't understand. A lot of scenes in the movie that were supposed to be exciting and suspenseful just fell flat, because I had no idea what was I was supposed to be rooting for or afraid of happening. Much of it isn't exciting because of the fundamental nature of what is going on on screen... like watching someone trying to figure out the answer to an equation, while some dramatic music plays. That's just not exciting. The worst parts of the movie, besides the nonsense and plot holes, was the weak philosophizing on the nature of love and its relationship to science, and that kind of thing. Blah blah blah evolution, survival instincts. The movie does has depth, but when the characters go off on some philosophical exposition it just comes off as pretentious and shallow. They never make a single point about love that is even slightly original or though-provoking. But the movie isn't all bad. I like the Robot AI character. The movie had some unique visuals and situations that are memorable, they should have been used in a better movie... And so in conclusion, this movie is okay. I'd recommend it if you have nothing better to watch.
5.0~Disappointing: spoiled by too many unbelievable plot elements bruno-curfs Sign in Permalink I was looking forward to this movie, with its elements of adventure and discoveries during interstellar travel. But the movie has too many unbelievable plot elements that ruined the experience for me. The superb music, the special effects and the actors saved it from being a disaster. Here are some of the indigestibles. When Cooper is fighting with Dr. Mann, the spacecraft coming to save him is flying *underneath* a rock formation. But I do not remember from other scenes that it actually contained these caves. Not so nice. More problematic is that we were led to believe the method of hibernation: sit in a fluid, lie down, and somebody else zips the bag. Apparently there was no problem with suffocation, even without an oxygen mask? Also, we are to believe that if the pod is opened, the bag is unzipped, and somebody sits you up, you will just wake up with all our memories in tact immediately? Unbelievable. Besides, how did Dr. Mann zip his bag and close his pod? Worst, touching at the core of the movie, Cooper discovered a binary code in his daughter's room, apparently coming from "the others" (postulated 4 dimensional creatures). With this information, he finds the NASA quarter and is invited to join the space mission. Later, it is suggested that it was he himself communicating the code to himself, while he was being trapped in the 4 dimensional room. Yet, in another scene, he tried to convince his daughter not to let him go (because now he knows that he will get trapped). These two messages are clearly contradictory. Besides the time loop paradox that it involves: how could he communicate the coordinates of the NASA quarters to himself BEFORE he left, in order to leave? And then get trapped in the 4 dimensional room, so he could try to PREVENT himself to leave? (Even the last part alone, is paradoxical, because he could only warn himself because he left, and so how could he not leave?) This unexplained paradox ruins the movie for me. I found it unbelievable that Prof. Brand would lie about his findings, in order to be able to motivate the crew. I believe that he should have been honest, in order to INCREASE the success of the mission. I believe people can make moral decisions with full information. If it was impossible to return, it would only make it more important to succeed in colonizing another planet. He deceived them in believing that he could not solve the equations that would tell him how to return, but that he could solve them before they returned. Prof. Brand had in fact solved the equations and it had told him that it was impossible (!) to come back. Therefore, Cooper's daughter, when she found out about this deception on Prof. Brand's death bed, could never find out if her father knew before he left that he would not be able to return. Later she discovered that her father was communicating to her through the watch, and she was hoping for his return despite Prof. Brand's belief. Why? There was no mention of anybody negating Prof. Brand's results. Unbelievable. Then, at last, it turned out, that it WAS possible to return and Prof. Brand had been WRONG! Also very unlikely and unbelievable. In a scientific team, results are checked and tested. So, even if Prof. Brand believed it was impossible to return, now we know that he was wrong. So, if his conclusions had been checked, another solution could have been found. In fact, without knowing anything further about the movie than its title, I theorized that the crew would end up colonizing another planet as the ONLY survivors (and I would love to see how they discovered this for themselves). I was wrong, but Prof. Brand believed it, so I wasn't that stupid, was I? The movie did not deliver, though. I have more objections to the movie, such as the bleak portrayal of the "inhabitable" planets. If we will ever be able to do interstellar travel, we'll have a good idea for what kind of planet we are looking for. We will have very sensitive telescopes and computers that analyze the data of a 720 degree (i.e. full 3D range) input channel and gives us exact data about atmospheres of planets within range (tens of light years). It was disappointing that a lot of interesting aspects of interstellar travel and colonizing have not been touched upon in this movie. We might find life forms much different from ours and it will be challenging to live in harmony with them during colonization. I wish I could be more positive about this movie as I had high hopes for it. And although now I would not recommend this movie to any SF movie lover, because of the highly problematic plot, I found the actors proficient and skillful. They made the psychological and interpersonal aspects of the plot acceptable, so that I conclude that the characters were sufficiently detailed and human for my taste. It's what I've missed of vision that prevents me from enjoying what was visible.
10.0~Watch it in IMAX . Thank me later. ankit-r-shah63 Sign in Permalink I believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science fact/fiction part of it. With this movie, Christopher Nolan tried to answer some questions that science is yet to. The transition form fact to fiction was seamless. Even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate, they are simply beautiful - visually and emotionally. As far as the story goes, I could care less as the stunning visuals and great background score more than makes up for it. For those who are not fully satisfied with the story, I can understand, could be because of a very high bar set by Christopher Nolan himself. However, Don't let it hold you back if you like Nolan's movies. If you're gonna watch it, watch it in IMAX. ﻿
4.0~Corn dollies hodgsonb Sign in Permalink Not sure if you can make sense of the film from this, but here goes: In a future world people can only eat Sweetcorn and begin to look like the Simpsons. A farmer flies into space, realises he can fix things be sending messages through gravity and space-time back to his daughter, and everything is cool again. A Mr Man tries to screw it all up, but he gets his. I'm not convinced that this film should be so highly rated. - It's too long - Matthew McMumbly hardly speaks clearly - The story is hard to follow - The maths makes no sense - The boil-in-the-bag cryogenic capsules look bad - The sudden jump from being in a 'singularity' to a hospital bed is bogus - They work out his age by counting the rings in his leg, like a tree, so he's 124 - The set piece speeches about love are silly - It's too Hollywood Rent Sunshine instead, or Moon which is even better.
8.0~Absolutely epic WalterSoprano Sign in Permalink The soundtrack, story, visuals, and concepts of this film can all be categorized as epic. It starts off a bit slow but once the intensity appears it is nail biting. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is Oscar worthy and so are the visuals. If this film doesn't win the Oscar for best visual effects I have no faith in the academy any more. I am a huge fan of Kubricks all time classic 2001 a space odyssey and I have to say this film is a great return to that subject matter of space travel. One of my favorite scenes in 2001 would have to be the trippy wormhole portrayal, needless to say interstellar has much more advanced visuals and a much cooler wormhole portrayal. On top of that interstellar went to reaches of space travel that even 2001 didn't explore. If you are a fan of 2001 I highly recommend this film to you. I don't want to reveal any spoilers but one of my favorite scenes in the film would have to be the imperfect docking scene. This specific scene ramps up the intensity to levels that are rarely experienced. Plus you have Han Zimmer's outstanding score to back it up. You will know which scene I'm talking about when you watch the film. The films ending is kind of confusing but is fitting. I'm hoping to be able to see it again because I have a good feeling this film could be better on a second viewing. It's pretty long clocking in at 169 minutes and even though I really enjoyed the film I have to say it had some slow moments but would be better on the re watch because you could really understand it better. This could very possibly be my favorite film of the year. I hope you found this review useful, thanks for reading my review.
