10.0~Masterpiece. luis-enrique3121 Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic TV Show. Season 1 is incredible and I loved season 2. The topics in season 1 about consciousness and human desire are well played and then the topic of inmortality in season 2 is extraordinary. I think people are complaining too much on season 2 because they are not smart enough to keep up with the show and really is not that difficult you just have to watch 2 times every episode. To me this show is a masterpiece.
10.0~Best Show on TV ebcorde Sign in Permalink The best fantasy ride on TV.. as good or better than GOT , Homeland..... it's meant for people who like SCI-FI and are not afraid of being stumped. Those that say "I don't get it" are the negative reviews. What you cannot figure out , you'll understand later.. it's kind of like Chris Nolan's Inception and Interstellar. I think his brother Jonathan co-writes and directs. so it has that captivating feel.
7.0~A bit long in the tooth... systems-401-549046 Sign in Permalink Hmmm. The last hour-an-a-half episode was just too long and got spoiled by the hat. Also, the problem with the "memories/dreaming" sequences was it confused the "not-so-attentive" viewer trying to sort between what is "NOW or THEN, "FLASHBACK or CURRENT" and "DREAM or REALITY". I am giving this a 7 and not a 5 because of the originality. Quite nice to see something that was not run-of-the-mill same-same. Bernard was a nice surprise, but could have been kept for the last episode... This line is just a filler because I do not want to say more without soiling the series for other viewers.
9.0~Mysterious, Cinematic, Philosophical ArchieIMDb Sign in Permalink While sometimes the pacing may stumble and stagger as pieces of the plot are slowly pushed into place, Westworld is shrouded in engaging mystery with philosophical elements weaved throughout. I would be remiss to not also mention the outstanding performances, despite the difficulty that is presented by such challenging roles and the fascinating characters that accompany them. The second season has had improvements in pacing and action in the second season, but unfortunately didn't stick in the landing in the finale. However, the good here certainly outweighs the bad.
10.0~Excellent timoverend83 Sign in Permalink This show is so far perfect. The story is intriguing, the visuals are beautiful and the acting is incredible. The previous reviewer who said the violence is unnecessary has missed the point in my opinion. The violence is very much needed. It is there to make you feel uncomfortable, because it is that inner dark side and battle between good and evil (and more often than not the middle ground between) that is at the very epicenter of the human condition.This is what the show is often commenting on and this is what makes this show so interesting, thought provoking and ultimately entertaining. If it carries on in the same vein we will have a modern day classic on our hands.
1.0~Such bad writing. Such bad acting. Seriously? laude_ib Sign in Permalink Plain pseudo-philosophical crap. Incoherent. Stupid. And so so so badly played. Spare me, pleeez.
9.0~Absolutely Awesome mailsangindra Sign in Permalink WestWorld. The first time I pick up to see this series is because the big name of Nolan. I thought, wow Christopher Nolan, is making a series too. Well it happen to be his little brother. But, man, Nolan, those name, didn't disappoint me at all. This series is just true art of physiological sci-fi movie, that I love it so much. The scene, acting, and the plot is just brilliant. They offer new MMORPG type of movie which give you the pleasure to see alternative world that may exist somewhere in the future, with all its pleasure, and its risk. Highly recommended to watch it
9.0~Sit back and enjoy the ride scott-1657 Sign in Permalink Caveats: I am a total sci fi fan, and you'll note most of my reviews (I haven't written too many) fall into this genre. I like plots that make me think, even if I don't always understand them or find them slight implausible. I think this show is ingenious, and I believe it'll be one that people look back on one day and say "wow, they got a lot of that right." And it is uneven. I tend to like the episodes that flash back and forth a lot more than those that focus on one or two characters only. So I think that puts me in the minority of viewers (from what I read). While I'm not a big advocate of sequels or adaptations, I definitely enjoy TV spinoffs of movies when they expand and elevate the original films-"Westworld" is one of those; imo, "12 Monkeys" is another. Checking out Facebook forums and science fiction web sites, there are so many fans who go into deep detail and analyses about the show. I'm not going to. Like Game of Thrones, it's almost impossible to figure out how this will turn out... and maybe it doesn't matter. The joy is in each episode, for me. I think the cast is superb--I try to avoid spoilers so let's just say that in science fiction, in general, anyone who dies can possibly come back, and I won't get into who's human and who's not. That's the whole point. I like watching the best episodes twice. I watch them once, read some reviews and insights on the web for what I may have missed, and then watch them again. From my perspective, if I can grasp the episode in one viewing, it's not one of the best ones. Back to cast: the main characters are certainly standouts: Thandie Newton, Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, Ed Harris, and, of course, Anthony Hopkins. Supporting cast is also excellent. These performances demand subtleties that underlie the context of what it means-or not-to be human. Newton, Wood, and Wright, especially, are masterful. The special effects are incredible; we've come such a long way since the Yul Brynner movie. The music is pretty cool, too. My tradition for many years now has been to turn off the world on Sunday nights (except for, occasionally, inviting some friends over to watch) and tuning in to HBO and Showtime. There have been a lot fewer series that excite me on Sunday nights lately (I used to really enjoy Six Feet Under, True Blood, Dexter, Weeds, etc.), but this one does. It requires that you use your brain, though.
7.0~Season 2 pamorellapa Sign in Permalink Its OK and ill watch it,seems there all over the place.
8.0~Of gods and men where men are gods and machines are men TdSmth5 Sign in Permalink Westworld is the name of a giant realistic Western-themed theme park for the rich in the future. It's populated by androids who live out the script written for them. One of them is Dolores. We meet her as she's in for service, which is also like therapy where the staff try to find out how they feel and what they've been thinking about. One important question the hosts are always asked is whether they question the nature of their reality. During service the hosts can also go into debug mode when the operator says "analysis." The "life" of a hosts consists of reliving their script, their narrative, over and over in a loop. The narratives can involve injury and death of course. Westworld's sold as a place where people can make their dreams come true. Those dreams apparently revolve only around sex and death. Freud would be pleased. Customers can drink at the bar/whorehouse, meet the girls, kill hosts and do as they please. Hosts kill each other but somehow can't kill the customers. Customers can also participate in little missions like going on manhunts for bandidos or pick a side during the civil war. It's actually Dolores' father who first comes to question the nature of his reality and for it he's taken off-line permanently after he goes nuts and becomes violent. But Dolores too starts seeing things, remembering things. Another host also goes through something similar, the whorehouse's madam named Maeve. Then there's Teddy, a sometimes love-interest for Dolores who's also confused about the things he sees. Among the main customers are William and Logan. William is about to marry Logan's sister. Logan's dad owns the company where both work and is a frequent visitor to Westworld, while Billie is visiting for the first time. Logan promises Bill will discover who he really is at the park. William will run into Dolores and fall for her. There's some stranger in black who's out there killing hosts mercilessly and looking for something called The Maze and eventually also for someone called Wyatt who's presented as the main villain within the park. The stranger is given free-reign to do as he pleases for reasons we'll learn as the show progresses. Behind the scenes are the staff divided into divisions. There's the software division where Bernard works, he tends to be the main person who debriefs the hosts. There's security personnel among them Ashley who's fate is for some reason left unresolved. There are narrative writers. There are executives like Theresa who's involved with Bernard and mediates between the board of the company that owns the park and the staff. Finally, there's one of the creators of Westworld, Dr. Ford. He has total control of the park, apparently he wrote some of the main narratives. His partner in conceiving the park was someone named Arnold who doesn't live anymore, but whose code writing was so influential that his name comes up a lot. The board wants to get rid off Ford as he's about to finish the latest and most ambitious narrative that requires a lot of restructuring of the park. Meave is the host who first becomes fully conscious and aware of what she is and what is going on. She wants her freedom, to go to "their" world. But is also full of spite after seeing how hosts are disposed. She enlists the help of two ridiculous repair staff. Meanwhile Dolores is guided by love/memories/visions/voices to embark on some journey of self-discovery. Sometimes she loves Teddy at other times she loves William. As the show slowly progresses we do indeed learn, and so do the characters, who they are. There are a lot of neat surprises since there are a lot of mysteries in the show. In the end almost everything is answered. I'm not a fan of Westerns so the appeal of the park and Western-themed shows and movies escapes me. The stories of the hosts were hardly the most interesting. Casting also falls along those lines. I mean you have Anthony Hopkins and Ed Harris as humans. Some of the other casting choices are downright poor. It's what the humans are up that I found most interesting. Even though Westworld has no central character, basically no one to truly care for, I did end up rooting for Ford and Teddy. The show does pay off eventually but the investment is steep, 1 hour every episode and the season finale 1 hour and a half. There is no reason for each episode to be so long, it could easily have been trimmed by 15 minutes, if not more. But when the show is inspired it's amazing. It's not machines and artificial intelligence that are at issue here but humans and human consciousness. And isn't it we who live in loops? Wake up, work, lunch, work, dinner, entertainment, sleep. Rinse. Repeat. Over and over. In a script written by who knows who. Don't we dream of freedom and escape? Don't we seek to find out who we are, what we are doing here? Well, the few do. The rest try to be happy in the loop, unaware, and disinterested in any truth. There's something Platonic here about living in the cave and trying to make it out. But the focus is the philosophy of mind with a deep existential tint. And even religion is smartly addressed. The philosophical lines are beautifully written, too. After watching episode 1 I didn't really feel like seeing the rest. But this show does get progressively better and better with the last couple of episodes being downright brilliant, reminiscent of the stronger episodes of Person of Interest. Just as the maze in the park, the show is also a bit of maze for the viewer but the journey is ultimately worthwhile. I'm not sure there's need for a season 2, in particular in absence of certain characters.
6.0~visually stunning, slow-paced, illogical, pseudo-intellectual summerloud Sign in Permalink While Westworld ist not a bad show, I feel like it's still a waste of excellent actors and outstanding amounts of resources on a plot that could be told much better in any normal-length movie. The visual beauty and great acting was the only thing that made it at least halfway worth my time to finish episode 1. There is no buildup of suspense, no really likable characters to root for, and way too many plot holes apart from the illogical premise itself to suspend disbelief for long enough to really get immersed in this world. Even the show's central philosophical themes - what is consciousness? what makes us human? etc., have been tackled better by a large number of movies and books - and even if they were done better it would have been hardly enough to provide and interesting backdrop to 50 hours of senseless violence, unnecessary nudity and cowboys shooting each other. (i hear they are planning 5 seasons of this? WTF?) Much of the discussion is pseudo-intellectual at best. The whole idea of playing in an - albeit very real - computer game revealing a person' true self is silly and lends credibility to all those idiotic "first person shooters turn people into mass murderers" arguments. For example, I felt that the whole William / Logan substory was hypocritical and pseudo-moralistic. We are supposed to see William as the good guy, because he refuses to have fun in a virtual world, and see Logan as the bad guy because he kills robots whom he attributes no consciousness to? Doesn't this mean we are bad people if we enjoy watching a show that mainly consists of violence? I really disliked William's character for that reason, and the eventual revelation that he is the Man in Black - who was pretty much the only interesting character apart from Ford - was very disappointing. The pace of the show is creeping slow. I felt like the first four episodes consist mainly of naked robots being asked the same questions all over again, interspersed with boring and pointless gunfights between robots - nothing to care for, nothing of interest, no buildup of any suspense, since the basic "the robots will eventually rise against their masters" theme can be concluded from the show's premise without even watching it. The later seasons branch into a couple of uninteresting sub-plots, with barely enough happening each episode to move the plot along at a creeping pace - at one point so little was happening that I felt like I wouldn't even have noticed if I skipped an episode or two. The only thing that made me continue watching was the attempt to figure out the many inevitable plot twists in advance - something made rather hard by the numerous plot holes in the story, and the lack of clues or foreshadowing, which also makes the eventual revelation of the twists rather anti-climatic (oh, so Bernard is the one guy of the main cast who is a robot even though he thinks he's a human - well I guess it would have worked all the same if it was any other character...). Also, many of the most interesting riddles (who is the man in black? what is the maze?) lead to very unsatisfying conclusions or no conclusions at all. I'm definitely not going to watch another episode of this, I felt like I wasted a lot of time that could be better spent on better shows or movies. 6/10, but mainly for visual beauty and great acting.
10.0~Attention required leonabela1 Sign in Permalink Season 2 wasnt as good as season 1 HOWEVER if you pay attention and understand everything it is still a masterpiece!
5.0~Robots, AI and Nonsense EduardReich Sign in Permalink The beginning was quite impressive, during the first two or three episodes the premise was pretty good and I believe the audience(especially HBO's audience) was looking forward to another great TV show. But this TV show was a disaster after two seasons, I honestly don't think they can do better than "Prison Break" right now with the following seasons. Anyway, except the great cast, where Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, and a few others gave great performances, there's really nothing else. It is poorly written, filled with terrible cliches and it becomes unwatchable starting with the second season.
1.0~Pseudo-intellectual freshorange Sign in Permalink Actors and the setdesign are good but script and directing so bad! I could not feel any interest in watching more than 2 episodes. I think Nolan is highly overrated! Sorry to say that, but his movies are overly pseudo intellectual! Westworld has very good actors, its a shame to waste so many talented people!
10.0~Masterpiece. jainee-35453 Sign in Permalink I think these Nolans have something in their blood that no other Individual has.Westworld revolves around the concept of giving conscience to Hosts(robots). Now,In the initial 2-3 episodes,I thought that this would not be as good as GoT and other brilliant shows.But it turned out not just pretty well but amazing..The last 3-4 episodes broke all the theories confusions and executed it perfectly. Anthony Hopkins was amazing.In the Host world,Evan Rachel wood stood up to that challenge.The way they unraveled the mystery of the maze and the cliffhangers just blown my mind off,however I was reading Fan theories But still You don't get disappointed..I would say This show is as Good as Game of thrones😏.
1.0~boring -_- Bac_Hir Sign in Permalink Most overRated tv show ever... you know the series is boring when you pause the episode 568439 times just to look how many minutes till episode ends ... also when you fell asleep more then twice while watching ... zzZZZ
5.0~U-Turn after Season 1. aquanimbus-ganesh Sign in Permalink The first season of this show is one of the BEST Sci-Fi TV series. It has a great story, skilled actors, exceptional music and beautiful cinematography. This 'was' one of my favourite TV shows. My wait for the second season was long, and after watching it, I was supremely disappointed. While all other factors remain unchanged, or, in some cases have become better, the story has taken a U-Turn. The second season no longer made sense. The grippy-story that the first season commanded cannot be compared with the second. Too many new characters were introduced, and too many stories intertwined, all leading to a chaotic mix of stories. Even upto the seventh episode, new stories are brought in, which, at that point, the viewer realises that the ending is going to be rushed or concluded badly. This has been one of the biggest disappointments in TV shows. However, I would still recommend people to watch the first season (only) of this show, and just let it go after that. That's how good the first season was. These violent delights have violent ends. ~William Shakespeare
2.0~All dressed up with nowhere to go j_swift-39336 Sign in Permalink Much like the first season of True Detective, Westworld got off to the strongest start imaginable, and I was soon telling everyone to watch it .. The production and cinematography put most Hollywood features to shame – throw in an interesting cast and limitless sci-fi premise, and it's hard to imagine a better first impression. But also like True Detective, it isn't until about halfway through the season that that strong first impression starts to wear off – but not before it's already rated 9 or 10 stars everywhere – and you realise there's not a lot there beyond the presentation. I found Westworld particularly frustrating in how utterly devoid it was of involving or relatable characters .. The real basics, that make you care about what you're watching – rather than just fawn over the production – weren't there .. It's difficult to make an android relatable, especially when they're acting in that cardboard cutout fashion of modern, self-conscious sci-fi .. Without any real characters, it's no surprise the story itself lacks a sense of direction – in fact the whole thing feels like a very drawn out demo for a new digital camera .. And what could've at least been an interesting philosophical premise is lost in the vagueness of its own ideas .. I'm inclined to be critical, when so much about the production got everything right .. It just astonishes me projects can be made, on such grand scales, and with so much talent, without making sure you've got a script.
1.0~Boring! avram_bogdan2001 Sign in Permalink Boring, boring, boring. It s all What i Seen in this show.
10.0~Well balanced, flawless, perfect written and stimulating story tincho-57649 Sign in Permalink What a nice surprise was to watch the first chapter of this TV show. All the ingredients come together very nicely... from the beginning with the exquisit narrative till the end with the wink letting you see what is going to come. The story is captivating and you can't stop watching. The performance of all the actors is superb.... The tempo is perfect giving you the exact amount of intrigue and action . Don't think of this as a TV show... this is a incredible movie. The movement of the camera is perfectly planned and the screen time for every character is well balanced. Nothing stands up, all rise together. If you only have one hour to watch TV on the week you MUST use it in this TV show FOR SURE! WELCOME TO THE HYPE TRAIN! I LOVE THIS SHOW!
10.0~the future of TV benni-j1 Sign in Permalink This show is beyond all others, and season 2 is even better then S1, this show is pure perfection
2.0~Season two is trash dhill-84844 Sign in Permalink Too involved in trying to tell stories of feminism to tell a real story. Jumps all over trying to make multiple female characters relevant with no attention to plot, story telling, depth or connection. Horrible.
1.0~Kill kill kill martin-diss Sign in Permalink The first season is ok, the dilema of androids created by humans is ok, second season where its KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL the human overlords is boring, i dont like story where hate is the main issue.
4.0~Silly.. foolish mgwilcox Sign in Permalink Follows a completely nonsensical story/stories line (s). This Could have been entertaining, but the gaps in the entire layout are huge . It defies any logic. For me no matter how much I attempted to suspend belief there was just no way to accept this thin facade of such a place with details provided in show it is beyond reason how any would find it more than foolish . Good Sci Fi requires a basis in probability possibility and this offers none . Watch an episode and see for yourself. (I watched 4 before judging just in case ) but holes in plot line are just to obvious and enormous . I do not wish to give anything away. I actually do believe a story of this sort could be done with attention to detail and and craftsmanship. This series however is nothing but an absolute horrid mess.I had been looking forward to this show from its start since HBO has done some of televisions best.
5.0~a hot mess amalbouafif Sign in Permalink This season wasn't a big fan or critics success , maybe because the first season was so great , the second couldn't live up to the expectations, or maybe because the show conveyed the perfect well thought out message in season one it didn't need a second season , and it didn't need any more explanations or a continuation, the first season stood fine by it self . at some points it felt like the writers didn't know what to do with the story so they just made things up on the way , it was extremely slow paced and filled with unnecessary story lines that didn't make much sense from start to end .the show tried to keep some of the unexpected plot twists and time lines play , that it did so well in the first season but this time it was a miss , it just got confusing and too complicated just for the sake of being complicated, not that you can't understand it , you can piece the stories together easily enough, you just felt bored and uninterested in doing so. the stories didn't link together that well and didn't make much sense, most of the dialogues were nothing but repetitive, boring, and a miss on trying to be wise or intelligent. the season also chose to follow the story of Doloros , and make her the protagonist , but with such an unlikable main character it was hard to stay interested in the show. for me it was a let down on so many levels , a show that could have been the next great tv show with its great potentials it fell to being a weird sc fiction show, too complicated without conveying any meaningful message .
9.0~Breathtakingly good and hooked! Niaz_Morshed Sign in Permalink The show sets in the near future, an extremely realistic amusement theme park which is inhabited with lifelike androids that are virtually impossible to differentiate from human beings. The idea itself is simply breathtaking, though its borrowed from Michael Crichton's original Westworld (1973) . Excellent acting and the soundtrack by GOT-man Ramin Djawadi perfectly matched to the intriguing events. TV show simply doesn't get any better than this. I've never been really a fan of westerns but this sci-fiction/western combo is a whole new genre itself. Like always HBO delivers in the drama department and they have invested around a hundred million dollars on this and I really hope they get there moneys worth because this series deserves it for sure.
9.0~Thought provoking cherold Sign in Permalink Watching sci-fi television it's easy to forget what sci-fi is capable of; it's not all shooting aliens and traveling to alternate dimensions and planet hopping. Westworld is that other kind of sci-fi, the type that is focused on using technology and the future world to explore who we are as people. The series is about what it means to be sentient. It's about the choices we make. It's even about religion and, increasingly as it goes on, a series about playing god. What makes the series great is it doesn't spell all this out for you. It begins by showing you a very complex system, and then shows anomalies within that system that may be nothing more than glitches. Every time you see a robot seem human, you get a technological explanation that undercuts that view. For the most part, it is up to you to decide what this series is saying about sentience, although sometimes the series has stated some concepts more explicitly, which I found less satisfying. The characters are fascinating, particularly Thandie Newton as a robot hooker who manages to put together a lot of the pieces of her particular world. While conceptually brilliant a narratively compelling, there are a few things to take issue with. First off, Westworld is not a very good amusement park. It seems to be essentially a playground for rich white men who want to shoot and/or have sex with robots. On the Daily Show a black correspondent said if he went to Westworld he wouldn't want to fulfill black stereotypes by shooting people, he's want to manage a bank. That joke pointed out one of the problems with this design; it's actually far more limited than current massively multiplayer online games, which allow people to not only shoot people but also to barter and sell property and run businesses. If you actually think about Westworld as a business, you realize it's vision is limited, its overhead is so huge that there is no way business executives could pay enough to keep it running, and many of its maintenance systems and procedures are absolutely terrible. But none of that matters, because the central themes of humanity are so compelling that I watch the show compulsively even though I always feel a little depressed by the tragic and hopeless nature of it all. Flying spaceships and shooting aliens is lots of fun, but if you want to see sci-fi TV at its finest, watch Westworld.
7.0~Season 2 not living up to potential of Season 1 AT ALL lulumary123 Sign in Permalink Boy I wish IMDB message boards were still around. Barring that... Season 1 of Westworld was fascinating because it explored the nature of humanity, compassion and kinship in the face of the "other" - how money/power corrupts and how "us" and "them" can be turned around before anyone knows what's happening. I had hoped season 2 would show the consequences of exploitation, and how the exploited rise up, using resources the exploiters never expect because of the arrogance of power and domination. But.. nah... now its just a shoot-em-up revenge tale. The constant "mood" music is distracting and bad, and I can see the "secret" a country mile away - its going to be some sort of way to download one's consciousness into a cyborg so one has eternal life, DUH... Gee, I wonder WHY we were recently introduced to the megalomaniacal mega-billionaire with terminal whatever it is. Duh duh duh.. So lazy, so disappointed. Missing Anthony Hopkins madly, but still enjoying Jeffrey Wright and Thandie Newton, who are always fun to watch even though they have been given really bad fortune cookie dialogue this season. And the doofy British guy has got to GET GOT, what a stereotypical whiny weasel sidekick, yawn... Bring back the Westworld that made us think and feel, season 2 just gives me a headache.
10.0~Takes on classic -- BETTER than the classic jrghoens-213-703668 Sign in Permalink I love both the movie and the show BECAUSE of their differences. The movie, what a revolutionary idea - an "amusement park" for adults to act freely towards human-like robots. The robots take revenge. The end. The show is so much more. You feel for the robots you feel for their humanity! So the first season stays in line with the original movie from the 70's. But season 2... wow.. they expand on the idea so much to make this season like a Dark Mirror episode... technology vs nature. You find out that all of this is about DNA and making one live forever. Yes yes the show is confusing BUT the impressive story weaving, the exemplary acting, and the twists -- and there are A LOT -- keep me into this show for the long haul!
10.0~Keeping me on the edge of my seat techfirst Sign in Permalink I just watched the 3rd episode and wow, what an amazing show. The plot twists and depth of story raise the bar for modern TV and frankly movies as well. This has some of the most amazing scripting I have ever seen. Of course it has the splash of action, nudity and sex everyone wants too. But man that stuff is just the side dish to phenomenal story and what is shaping up to be one of the best TV shows of all time. The characters just get more and more complex as the show goes on, with some really interesting twists. Cant wait to see more. Hope they keep this up, I originally started watching it thinking this would be a good filler for stuff like GOT and a few other shows I enjoy that are off season. But Westworld might have just replaced them!
10.0~The dangers of Sentient AI mike_brunton Sign in Permalink I loved the first season of Westworld. I recently wrote a short book on World Government, and in that book I pinned a lot of hope on Sentient AI beings to change the world and create FTL Starships. I was so optimistic I wrote we should create 200 million of them to educate the World's children. After several weeks of reflection, I had changed my plans entirely, and said that if we do create AI, it should never be given a body or be allowed access to the internet, as the dangers were too great. All it would take is one AI being going against humanity to destroy us with a virus or global holocaust. So Westworld for me, is a good example of why the future creators of Sentient AI should be very, very careful. I am now in love with Dolores, gutted that Ford died at the end of Season 1. And I am wondering with great anticipation just what Season 2 will bring. Can it possibly be better than Season 1 ? I rated this a solid 10/10, as far as I am concerned Westworld isn't just a drama about robots in a Western setting, it makes you question everything about life, your life and it's meaning - what makes us human, and what and how would we treat a sentient AI being. Every episode was great, every reveal was amazing, and the ending of Season 1 completely blew my mind. If you haven't watched Westworld - then do it now!
8.0~Now this is something different ! hdzenis Sign in Permalink Dear HBO, First of all I want to say THANK YOU. Thank you for making all these original and amazing TV content, especially this one. I know for a fact that some people are not going to like this show, and that's perfectly okay. They can have their CSI's and whatever, but other people are going to enjoy and support this show to the fullest. Your sincerely, A fan.
7.0~They should stop it after season one akcenat Sign in Permalink This Sci-Fi TV show is inspired by 1974 Yul Brenner western that takes place in a Wild West theme park with life-like androids. Part mystery, part drama, the show flirts across genres and keeps you guessing right up until its final, shocking moment. The casting for Westworld is downright stellar, while production is terrific. Anthony Hopkins elevates the show with a breathtaking performance (as Dr Ford park founder) and right up until the finale, the show manages to keep a decent pace going. Overall, I did enjoyed the Season one, even with the disruption caused by the hidden flashbacks. I would recommend the series for any Sci-Fi genre fan. 7+/10
10.0~Beyond Game of Thrones parker-986-90122 Sign in Permalink Westworld is a step for HBO beyond Game of Thrones. It's new, fresh, and relevant in today's society. If you haven't seen it, don't hesitate to take HBO on its AAA status.
10.0~Near perfect show that is incredibly complex and thought provoking. aarongnr Sign in Permalink Title says it all. Just wanna add: How can this cast be SO perfect. I dont know if any other show has a cast as perfect as Westworld.
3.0~Westworld?? How come?! nakitah-95722 Sign in Permalink Another big budget by HBO Inception meets Lost meets The Original Westworld meets Blade Runner meets The Wild Bunch meets The Terminator meets Dances With Wolves ... Nothing original Pseudo philosophical dialogs (No one talks like that) and unnecessary violence and sex and nudity aimed at teens It has the over complicated narrative of Lost. No surprise that Jonathan is Nolan's brother and also JJ Abrahms is involved. First of all where and when is the story happening? USA around 2070 maybe??? Never mentioned Where are THE GUESTS?? apart from William who is the owner i see no GUEST so we should assume that all this WORLD is created for him?? All that money is wasted for one man to enjoy? i mean it's his money but still two seasons and not even a guest. HOW COST EFFECTIVE! How did the US allow them to create this risky business without having control over the security of the place?? the security is a joke and the guns are funny. COME ON ITS 2070 AND YOU CANNOT HANDLE BUNCH OF COWBOYS AND INDIANS?! Dolores won't die! Then later Bernard shoots her in the head and she dies so why didn't William just shoot her in the head first? Cheap trick to give her enough time? Is William a host too? How do they actually die? Do they have organs like humans? How is Maeve controlling other hosts? Never explained How did they learn so quickly to use "Modern Guns"? An almost 40 year old company hires two of the most pathetic and stupid characters to fix robots bodies and no one is checking the rooms by camera or microphone until it's too late Like all other HBO shows it's very politically correct. Feminism is all over the show just like GOT. Men are evil and those who aren't are serving the women. Women are the "heroes". Because almost all the characters are robots and the rest of them we r not sure of makes it hard to relate or care about the characters. At least LOST had Likable characters. because of the over complicated and pretentious narrative and plot holes you no longer care. Anthony Hopkins gives us ENDLESS pseudo philosophical monologs to fool us into thinking that this show is DEEP. It answers 3 of your questions but creates 50 more unanswered just like LOST. The 3 stars i gave is for the special effects and cinematography but don't let them fool you. Nolanism and maximalism are spreading like a virus. i'm not a fan of Maximalism. The story doesn't need to be complex. It's the characters who need to be complex
9.0~Great show tomboulanger Sign in Permalink Season 1 is awesome, season 2 is alright but great production either way, great actors, great quality, very different and entertaining. Second season takes us in a whole different direction that personally I think is a good break from the normal story lines.
10.0~These Violent Delights Have Violent Ends bijanadhikari Sign in Permalink After True Detective season 1 which was the best season I've witnessed two years ago I was looking for a show which was horrifying ,beautiful ,mysterious ,complex and unique at the same time as parallel and close to TD. Now let me just get into the review of the show. I see few of here have given this show negative review based on the fact that they dint understand the show or the found the show to be over complex. I can assure you that first few episodes indeed consist of some complicated plots and it will be hard to grasp on what is actually going on. You may think about giving up on the show as visuals and acting might be the only thing that have been holding your interest. But as soon as you progress into the fifth episode you will begin to realize the story line which you thought were tedious and spiritless are starting to make a whole lot of sense and you will be intrigued by the whole concept of the show. The twist and the scenario will be become appalling to watch. Stories leading from a-z seems logical and masterfully executed. Another thing that makes this show good is the acting. I read an article where Evan Rachel Wood calling West World Olympic's for acting and she is not wrong. This show shows how acting should be done and executed. Leading the pack Anthony Hopkins proves why he still is one of finest actors around. Another major star was of course Evan Rachel Wood who steals the show alongside Hopkins by making the audience have sympathy on her character despite not being a human but an host. Thandie Newton and Jeffery Wright both are another stand out as they both have own story line which leads the show into epic proportion. And how can I miss Ed Harris who plays the character of Man In Black as a mysterious evil bad-ass making the show more interesting than it already is. James Marsden ,Angela Sarafyan ,Jimmi Simpson ,Ben Barnes all play their character to perfection. In fact what makes this show so good is all the characters who aren't lead also play their part flawlessly. The budget of hundred million given for this show was well utilized. In fact the production behind the show should be applauded. The visuals in this show is better than some of the big budget movies and should be a pinnacle for TV show even for HBO. Writers and the creator leave quite a mark in every episode by delivering some of the finest story telling and complex plot mixing the sci-fi elements with horror and western. All leading up to be a brilliant and unique show. My over all verdict leads right back to my first paragraph of this review. I have finally found "that" show. While True Detective still is the best single season I've ever watched ,West World is a very close second. From visuals to storytelling ,from acting to major twists this show scores a solid 10/10 in everything. So watch this show to witness some of the finest television works you've ever seen.
7.0~Disappointing ericcock95 Sign in Permalink The first season was great, but the second one was disappointing. I would give a 10 for the first season, but a 4 for the second one, and just because of the high production level and good acting. The plot is now boring and hard to understand and follow. So that's a 7.
10.0~Ethics of artificial intelligence at its best.. keysmith-521-625175 Sign in Permalink Arguing that season 2 was worse than 1 is like arguing that matrix 2-3 was worse than matrix 1. Ok, season 1 was simpler a lot more comprehensive and made for more people to understand. Season 2 was a lot more complex leading to different paths than season 1 but still it is a masterpiece for all of us who love SciFi and especially Ethics of artificial intelligence. Both seasons are good, but in a different way. Both deserve 10 or to be more precise season 1 deserves 12.
10.0~You are not real sumaiamoon-buet Sign in Permalink I had so my expectations from this series, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy actually fulfill it. The storyline is amazing, sound score is classic, the aesthetic scenic beauty of Westworld and acting of all the casts remains so real. Westworld is a theme park where hosts are androids who do not have ability to kill something alive, not even a fly. And there are newcomer guests who come to the Westworld by a train. They can enjoy there by riding horses, killing hosts by guns, visiting to whores and exploring. They pay for coming and they can always come back. Everyday, hosts are reboot automatically and they forget everything what happened earlier when they wake up in the morning. They don't realize that they are not real. However, problems start to occur when creators install a new software to make the hosts more real, more showing human emotion. In first two episodes, some hosts were acting and remembering small memories which effect their normal daily activities. We can see that Maeve Millay a beautiful madam remembered her past life, her daughter and how a man in black killed them. She thought she was dreaming, so she tried to wake up and revealed something unexpected. Dolores Abernathy seems to be like the most important host in this fantasy world. Actress Evan Rachel Wood did a great job in creating this character. Her expression, beauty, calm voice and sweetness helps to forget that she is not real. Her father told her something in the ear which effect her memory and activities. She killed a fly in first episode, she told something to Madam Millay which also had serious effect on her. Each episode is giving us new information from which we can learn more about Westworld. Eagerly waiting to see what comes next. What is the role of the man in black, why the hosts are acting weird, will the hosts be able to protect themselves from the guests, what is in the deep level? Hope to learn about more in upcoming episodes.
5.0~The more you get to know and understand the monster, the more you are becoming one naclorian Sign in Permalink Starting with the good aspects of "Westworld" i'd say that, indeed, it consists of philosophical questions and is questioning human nature(partially). In this show we, eventually, come to confront our monstrosity as human species. Here, i have to stop. And i have to stop because this is, exactly, the part that i am starting loosing the essence of "Westworld". This is because the main problem is right there standing over all of the complicated meanings and fancy dialogues. This is the part that you, dear reader, start feeling that my words don't make any sense, so let's accelerate a little bit. How could ever, showing ultra violence and ultra nihilism, pass the message of becoming a non-violent and happy person? All i wanna say is that this show while, at the surface, is asking all these "big" questions about humanity, at the backstage it is underlining monstrosity at such a level that the viewer slowly but steadily accepts his own(monstrosity). The viewer, including myself of course, gets injected with such a big amount of cold and raw violence and pessimism that is hard to process, so he/she inevitably becomes numb. It is very important to say that we are bombarded, and not only from "Westworld", with so much violence, nihilism and materialism, that even when it comes to the real world injustice and abuse of real people, we simply don't feel anything. So I don't agree with the message outcome and brainwashing of "Westworld" and i am getting really tired with this kind of TV- series and movies that shut down our human feelings. The more you get to know and understand the monster, the more you are becoming one. 5/10 is because of the good direction and superb cgi.
7.0~Brilliant first series... ianwhitworth Sign in Permalink First series was amazing, 9/10. Clever, engaging with twists and turns keeping you on your toes. Great characters, intriguing plot right up to the finale. Seconds series 4/10, tried too hard to be clever in a way the first series didn't need to. Confusing, dull and boring episodes interspersed with few moments of greatness couldn't save it for me. Always waiting for that one great episode to save it that never happened. What could have been.... 🙁
4.0~1st Season ok; 2nd Season mindless violence; stopped watching jij98111 Sign in Permalink Hey, the high concept or robots worked for the first season even though the story line was incoherent. But the second season is over the top incoherently violent. Been there. Done that.
5.0~Unfortunately we had to pass on season 2 surfhire Sign in Permalink Absolutely loved season 1, it was a masterpiece! After a long 2 year wait finally season 2 hit our screens but within the first 15 mins of episode one i was basically done. I ended up watching one and half episodes of season two then had to quit! Terrible plot if any and it felt like all of the cast were trying to hard, it was just weird!
1.0~Not a clue rawdeal007 Sign in Permalink 'Westworld' is literally the worst thing on TV since the abomination that was 'Lost'. I do not care if it has an underlying meaning (God, Virgin Mary, Lucifer etc etc etc - WHO CARES!), or that we should be dazzled by it's self entertaining cerebral existence. This is absolute dog turd of the highest standard. Completely unwatchable on every level and totally awful. Nothing makes any sense, nothing is coherent, nothing is enjoyable, not a single minute more will be endured. Awful television. I hate it. 0/10
10.0~Season 2 is better than Season 1 Kishere-film Sign in Permalink ... I found that season 2 has delivered a stronger narrative. I understand how some people may find it confusing, it certainly isn't a show you can watch whilst looking at your phone or updating Facebook. The show needs a slower pace to pull you in. For those who struggled I'd suggest watching the next season as a binge boxset instead of weekly, this way it has more grip and is easier to understand. The production value is through the roof and the acting is superb! Respect the reviews of all but I thought it was awesome x
1.0~Season 2 ? Nah, better make it Season 1 benjaminhill-30605 Sign in Permalink What's the different ? First season is about why you shouldn't mistreat the people you would interact with in a video game. Which NO one that isn't a real gamer is going to really understand morality wise. This message is strong communicated through out the whole season. Side note, the man in black is upset because everything he thought was true wasn't. His friend has been telling him the whole time. "This isn't real, they are just robots that were put here to give you the illusion that it IS REAL." Course we know that he was wrong but also right. Dolores was reset and forgot ALL about her feelings for William. Just.like.a.machine Now the second Season should have been about diving into this. Instead it was all about the #METOO FEMINISM movement. Which apparent is define by casting all men as a stereotype of being either evil, dum or helpless without a women. ALL of the male characters have been rewritten to cast this persona and all the leading roles have been replaced with WOMEN, WOMEN AND MORE WOMEN !!!!! This series was suppose to be about AI or how you treat ur toaster but instead decided to be about estrogen and female empowerment. Which strangely women measure by the same standards they perceive that men do lol
10.0~Greatest Sci-Fi Series EVER! rrcharpe Sign in Permalink So folks where do I begin? I guess with the cast, which is the best ensemble group of actors and actresses ever assembled for any series I have ever watched. This includes Evan Rachel Wood, the incredibly beautiful android, James Marsden (his best work ever), Thandie Newton as another beautiful android, Jeffrey Wright, an unbelievably great actor, and of course Anthony Hopkins and Ed Harris, two of Hollywood's greatest living legends. In heaven, I am sure that Michael Crichton is very proud of this further incarnation of his original story-line for Westworld. As a sci-fi fanatic I am constantly looking for "plot holes" and discrepancies in the settings, dialogue and special effects of movies in this genre and I can tell you I couldn't find a single one in this brilliant, original and exceptional HBO series. We are very fortunate to be alive in a time of fantastic changes and advances in science, health-care and hi-tech devices and just like the original Star Trek, which foretold of inventions like our cell phones and certain medical devices, this series opens your eyes to a future that might be right around the corner, for better or worse.
10.0~Excellent+ serg1980 Sign in Permalink It's impossible to list all good parts of the show not exceeding 1000 words. Actors, editing, soundtrack, scenery... It was like best 10 hour big-budget feature film you have ever seen. Special thanks goes out to Thandie Newton for naked scene, she was awesome all through the series and i think even overplayed Anthony Hopkins with his episode 4 speech, which deserve Oscar alone. The only thing i don't like is mechanical parts in robots. Advance humanoids on hydraulics and actuators not so good-looking as those with artificial muscles!
7.0~Enjoyable for a series with a vague convoluted plot danew13 Sign in Permalink I'm amazed that IMDb gave Westworld a near perfect score. It's an interesting series that keeps you watching. But you might ask yourself after episode 5, why? Nothing is really explained about the actual time and how this vast place was created. This isn't large theme park. It seems to be hundreds of square miles, yet all the androids and guests seem to be in easy reach of the management. And what of the androids, or hosts as they are called? How human are they? Where did such advanced technology evolve. Then there's the economics of the place...This is huge facility. But there only seem to be two or three guests who pay enormous fees to play in Westworld. As I said, it's an enjoyable show, but without a central plot, I can't see it higher than a 7.
1.0~Total rubbish thomasshahbaz Sign in Permalink An incredible number of star-actors have been roped into this massive, bloated turkey. This has the highest possible production values, with shots that seem both professional and glossy, and amateur and obvious, almost like it's been made by the most recent graduates of the elitest of film schools. The show delights in slowly drip-feeding the plot through devicey lines of dialogue, without the remotest iota of characterisation. This dialogue is clunky, un-engaging, and embarrassingly full-of- itself. Every line is delivered with a knowing, stoic expression, as if the creators believe every single line to be surprising, clever and layered, whereas in reality it's laughably ridiculous. MANY eye-rolling moments occur, though it the irony is lost on the makers and the actors. Like Fortitude, this is a sad example of what even the best actors will do for the right fee.
2.0~Don't watch season two mobile-756-445589 Sign in Permalink Waist of time. You have to be one of the writers or be on the inside to follow the show. They totally lost the viewers. First year 10 out of 10. This year 2 out of 10.
2.0~So slow, boring......unwatchable mlimiroski Sign in Permalink Can't believe the good reviews.....painful waste of such cast of stars. I hope there is no season 3.
10.0~Westworld WubsTheFadger Sign in Permalink Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger This series is nothing but a masterpiece. Every episode adds more to the narrative that at times transports you into the world of Westworld. The acting throughout is sublime. Ed Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Thandie Newton, Jeffery Wright, Evan Rachel Wood, James Marsden, Jimmi Simpson, and Ben Barnes all bring brilliance to the screen. They each play their respective characters perfectly. The amount of mind blowing twists and turns leaves you with a sense of awe and shock. Every twist is well crafted and perfectly timed. The subtlety and care throughout the series is amazing. Every answer to every question is right beneath your nose. The pacing in some of the episodes can be a little slow but most of them are fast paced. The violence is never over the top. All the violence seen is to further the story in terms of humanity and realization. The amount of nudity is extremely heavy. Full frontal male and female nudity is seen throughout. Most of it is needed to further the narrative, but some of it is a little careless. In short, this series is brilliant, masterful, and most of all inspired. Pros: Masterful storytelling, sublime acting, subtle yet inspired twists, brilliant use of violence and at times nudity, and overall good pacing. Cons: Some slow paced episodes and some over the top use of nudity Overall Rating: 9.6/10
5.0~What is all the fuss about? davek28 Sign in Permalink Not interested in westerns. Not interested in violence. I do like science fiction but I don't understand why anyone would spend so much on such an elaborate theme park. I'm only watching the first episode, but so far it hasn't grabbed me. I don't see why these robot humanoids continue to play-act when no-one is watching them. I'll give it a little longer but I must be missing something. So, in conclusion, if I want to watch a western I'll watch a western. There are some good actors in this. Why?? The violence is really over the top. I'll never understand why it's necessary to see people's faces being blown off. I've now seen the pilot. I'll look for something better to watch next time.
10.0~Why would you want to watch Westworld? abrarcalculas Sign in Permalink I have rated a lot of movies and television shows on IMDb over the years but, none of them compelled me enough to write a review. However, in this case I have decided to make an exception and, I will explain why. I began watching this show with an expectation that it would be somewhat of a flawed yet, magnanimous display of technological feat in the fields of artificial intelligence and, a view of the future of humanity. I thought the director would deceive with stunning views and, finely choreographed action scenes and, delude us from the being immersed into a moving, subtle story. I could not have been wrong. Westworld teases us to a journey of the questions that has haunted the inquisitive human minds for the last few centuries: how did we become what we are and, what are we? It challenges our notion of understanding of one's self and, asks if, given the opportunity to act on the darkest of our fantasies, are we going to stop ourselves? It asks if, we feel pain, suffering, anguish and happiness then, how are we going to be different from an artificially developed being possessing the same feelings and emotions? It appeals to our view of supremacy which, at times, have been propelled to destroy any animals which, are weak. It asks whether consciousness is merely just an illusory idea of distracting oneself or, keeping them in control over a predictable narrative or is it something yet more obscure and pristine. You may expect such questions being talked about in books and sometimes, well directed cinema. But, to slowly unravel such deepening, troubling questions to viewers and, asking them in turn to contemplate over a period of 10 episodes, spanning well over 10 hours whilst, setting in motion an equally well scripted story is downright hard to achieve. Jonathan Nolan has shown us that it can be done and, his show stands as a masterpiece that will haunt us and, beckon us to a journey to 'truly discover ourselves', just like the 'newcomers'
5.0~All That Glitters Is Not... LouieInLove Sign in Permalink I've waited to see a few episodes before submitting a review & I have to say that I'm disappointed. I simply find it boring. It has everything, cast, budget, but no story. It obviously does have a story but it is a long and thinly drawn out one. I expected excitement in the form of individual episodic stories. Sadly they have not chosen to go down that path. I honestly don't know how it currently has a IMDb score of 9+. I'm guessing a lot of money has gone on location & the story has been weaved around that. To me it would have been more productive if they'd spread the location cost on at least 2 worlds, therefore facilitating more scope for Story. A good cast & pensive music does not make a good story. All that glitters is not...
9.0~Season 1 of "Westworld" was fantastic. ericrnolan Sign in Permalink The premise for HBO's "Westworld" sounds like a bad situation comedy -- robot cowboys entertain the rich at a futuristic theme park. There are showdowns and shootouts, and hilarity ensues when the guests fall in love with the coy robot ladies. But "Westworld" is an arguably brilliant serial science fiction thriller, far transcending its gimmicky central plot contrivance. It is occasionally weighted down by some challenges with pacing, story structure and exposition. But I still loved it enough to get hooked on it immediately, and I'd give it a 9 out of 10. I think it's the smartest science fiction show I've seen in a long time. Its brilliance doesn't stem from its kitsch premise. (I haven't seen the original 1973 film based on Michael Crichton's screenplay, but I've seen it lampooned at least once.) It generally doesn't extend from the show's many twists and surprises, however well executed they are. Nor does it stem from the show's ambitious discussions of the nature of consciousness. Its brilliance, in my opinion, stems from its nuanced and surprisingly disturbing depiction of human evil. Of course there's the obvious -- the theme park exposes human depravity by allowing people to rob, rape and murder lifelike human surrogates with impunity. But there is far more that the show has to say. To get a sense of it, you have to watch the entire 10-episode season, and see several key character arcs reach completion. One of these arcs was so dark and cruelly contemplative that it's stayed with me long after I watched the final episode. The show is well made at every level. It's gorgeously shot, at locations throughout California, Utah and Arizona. The special effects are great. Anthony Hopkins is characteristically perfect as the park's patriarch, and Jeffrey Wright is terrific as his well meaning right hand. (That actor is starting to grow on me.) The entire cast is quite good -- even those in relatively minor roles, like the two hapless technicians (nicely portrayed by Leonardo Nam and Ptolemy Slocum) who become entangled in the events connected with the park's malfunctions. Ed Harris, however, consistently steals the show as "the Man in Black," a park guest who vacations as a brutal rapist and murderer (and who we learn has another agenda, as well). He's chilling. I never really saw Harris as an amazing actor before, despite seeing him in many roles, including his memorable turn in "A Beautiful Mind" (2001). But he was incredible here. I wanted to give this show a perfect 10, but even someone who loves it as much as I do can see the weaknesses of this first season. Overall, "Westworld" is sometimes too drawn out. I feel the plot moves forward rather slowly, and I think Season 1 would be perfect if only it were carefully edited down from ten to maybe seven episodes. I found myself getting a little frustrated by the the fifth episode, when we see two major characters follow arcs that seem redundant. (I'm being intentionally vague here to avoid spoilers.) The problem is compounded by the deliberately superficial nature of "Westworld's" setting. This is a theme park with stereotypical stock characters associated with Hollywood westerns. Accordingly, its inhabitants have overly stylized speech and behavior. Furthermore, these androids are programmed to follow the same "loops" repeatedly, as the same preconceived story "narratives" are reused to entertain new patrons of the park. It gets annoying. Yes, I know it makes perfect sense and is necessary in the context of the story. But it can be grating to someone who tunes in to see a science fiction show, and not a cheesy western. James Marsden is a decent enough actor, and he's well cast as "Westworld's" prototypical "good guy" cowboy. But seeing this character's shtick over and over was irritating. So, too, were the sassy ladies at the brothel and some other minor characters. Finally, I suggest that, for some viewers, "Westworld" may be hard to follow. I occasionally found it that way. There are twists that are wonderfully well crafted, gradually deciphered mysteries, and a very layered backstory. Finally, the show's discussions of things like consciousness, morality and artificial intelligence can sometimes border on the didactic. (It helps a hell of a lot, though, when the actor delivering the exposition is the priceless Hopkins.) It's a lot to take in. People tuning in should be prepared for some challenging, cerebral science fiction instead of easily digested, escapist fantasy. All in all, this show was superb. If you're a science fiction fan, you need to at least give it a try.
1.0~Season 1: excellent. Season 2: pretentious, violent, and boring. Laight Sign in Permalink Many excellent tv shows fall apart after five, eight, ten seasons... It's rare to see a show fall from such heights after just one season. Westworld has managed to pull that off. What happened? A cerebral show that mixed intense action with intelligent dialogue for one year turned into a poor imitation of itself just a year later with terrible scripts, incongruous violence, and poor direction. It's as if the show's staff, which started off so vividly portraying the battle to understand what being human means, lost its sense of direction and realized they hadn't a clue. And by the way, someone on the staff needs to go back and actually read Julian James' The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, a groundbreaking book they refer to often, and completely misunderstand.
3.0~Season 2 w_derik Sign in Permalink Just started S2 and l am not buying it. In short what everyone else said with a low rating. Story direction (where is it going?) character direction (why should I care?) Violence (repetitive and boring) etc.... Only reason it's not a 1 at this point is its high quality production outside of what's happening with the story.
2.0~Season 2 is mince daviescott Sign in Permalink Season one was ok but what was the deal with season two. Dragged the backside out of an unnecessarily over complicated story that in the end had he haw to do with the western it started out to be. Utter garbage
6.0~1.Season = 10Points & 2.Season = 2Points Accura-IMDB Sign in Permalink The first season was great. It was very well thought out, exciting and gripping. I have every episode of the season 1 min. 5 times looked at me. So I spent about 50 hours in the first season. Then came the long-awaited Season 2. To start with great hope, after the first 30 minutes it was clear: that is a waste of time. The producers have tried with good make-up and a lot of technology to cheer the audience a garbage. The main thing is for producers: the bank wins. "Dead person was not dead, one was not the other but a very different, the other was actually not the other, but the one who was not there" etc. True failure. After that, I could only watch the second season in jumps. Without lie: for the entire Season 2 I have max. 2 hours needed. Such a scrap, really. Season 1 = about 50 hours (each episode at least 5 times), Season 2 = max. 2 hours can watch. I do not know if the producers can do it in season 3, For me, the series is almost at the end. That's a shame, because the basic approach and the execution was not so bad.
7.0~Ok.... limoosine Sign in Permalink I think that it's well written and very well acted (look at the cast!) but the pacing is off at times and you really have to pay attention to every moving piece, otherwise the story could become tricky to follow. All in all an enjoyable watch but not binge-worthy.
5.0~What happened with season two? seann-force Sign in Permalink The first season was intriguing. It leaves you with unanswered questions, and some commentary on the human condition. Season 2: Want to be confused while chasing three or four timelines, simultaneously dealing with characters that either have multiple motives for their actions, and others with no motive at all? This is your show! Season two is way too convoluted. It's impossible to follow. Maybe that's on purpose- to make the show seem more brooding and deep. Seems like Chrichton would be so disappointed. Who knows where this thing is going, or where it came from? I gave up. It's impossbly unpredictable, in a way that serves only to frustrate the viewers. If you even remotely struggled with GoT, odds are you will be completely lost with this plot line. They really ruined something good with season two of WestWorld.
9.0~Westworld - a close future? Franco1337 Sign in Permalink It's a show well written which explores connection betwen humans and their will to control consciousness for their own pleasure, it shows a good plot with mindblowing moments.
9.0~Overwhelming but epic xeraph Sign in Permalink I like both seasons for different reasons. Season 2 focused more on particular group of characters in each episode which made the show to some people less balanced compared to S1 but I found this approach fresh and interesting because every episode can now stand on its own. The finale was overwhelming but epic. It all clicks better after second rewatch though. I got some issues with unbalanced tempo sometimes, cliche action hero thropes there and there but the most important thing... the show still has ambitions!. Doesn't treat viewer as an idiot and puts on table issues that many are afraid or uncapable to talk about.
6.0~Mediocre artists borrow... vlntryst Sign in Permalink Being old enough to remember the original Michael Crichton film I thought it a good idea to revisit the source before watching this new 100 million dollar HBO take-off. I found both Westworld & the non-Crichton sequel Futureworld, Conclusion: aside from some T&A/nudity, updated stunt work & blood & guts special effects. the obligatory CGI that accompanies pretty much everything these days & a heaping helping of profanity, there doesn't really appear to be much of anything new here. Seems the writers/producers also borrowed a little from other films like Crichton's own Jurassic series as well as themes from films like Groundhogs Day, Source Code & Edge of Tomorrow, repeating slight variations of the same scenes (four times in the first episode I believe). All in all, not that impressive in my opinion. No doubt they will take it in some new (cough, cough) directions if they plan to stretch a feature film to a series. Unfortunately given how they've chosen to begin I am skeptical all too predictable formulaic won't win out over creativity/originality at pretty much every turn. Hard to rate something so completely unoriginal higher than 4/10 no matter how big the budget or how flashy the effects. I saw that SyFy is planning to air the original film 10/8/16 if anyone's interested in seeing where this "art" was borrowed from. ;)
10.0~A wonderful series mostafarafaat Sign in Permalink The actors , soundtracks , director and story everything in this show is amazing also the background wow .
4.0~No spoilers here because Westworld lost the plot. Randomizer2600 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed Season 1 of Westworld, and was eager to see how the series developed. However, Season 2 is incomprehensible. There is no dramatic tension at all because if someone gets killed, they come back. Of course that's only the robots who can come back, but maybe the human was a robot. Or the character keeps showing up in endless flashbacks. There are some action sequences that could be interesting, but its difficult to care since the outcome seems irrelevant. Following any part of the plot is fruitless because what you are watching could be a ruse or a flashback. In parts, it seems like the writers are punishing for watching by making a scene as boring as possible. I'm not sure if I gave up trying follow what characters were trying to accomplish or I just no longer cared. Even Dolores, a fetching character with depth, is no longer of any interest. I do enjoy the musical score. And Season 2 is a good show to put on in the background if you have things to do around the house. Even when there is tense dialogue or what would be compelling action, I don't bother looking up as I unload the dishwasher because no dialogue, action or story development matters.
5.0~Forgot to Make it Entertaining markstewart-83111 Sign in Permalink I watch a lot of series on cable and the one ingredient that all hit show have is that you can't wait to get to the next episode whether the previous episode was a cliff hanger or not. Westworld is missing that ingredient, I can just let it sit and maybe watch an episode or maybe not. I think in an effort to make it intelligent and high concept, they ended up making it a little bit dull and almost dreamlike. It always feels like your stuck in a flashback sequence, with no current narrative anchoring the plot. It makes me a little disappointed, because the acting is pretty good and the budget is there, just having trouble connecting. Loved the original films too.
7.0~Season 1 really good, season 2 was a chore to watch gav_c Sign in Permalink Season 1 was excellent, plotting, full of twist in the story I wouldn't of guessed, action, nudity lol it had everything. Season 2 seemed like they where dragging the story out longer than what was necessary. Whilst it did have its interesting scenes in season 2 unfortunately this time around it had nothing on the first season. Bring on a better 3rd season.
6.0~A bit disappointing saxsymbol Sign in Permalink As a great fan of cult tongue-in-cheek movies, Westworld was an absolute favourite. But just like the new remake of Robocop and Total Recall, this adaptation takes itself a bit too serious. It questiones artificial intelligence, is well styled and current, but somehow something is missing. A good ducumentary-style realism might have worked to give it the eary atmosphere instead of the sugar-coated Hollywood approach they used. In that respect JJ Abrams always has great ideas, but somehow he always ends up uninventive, rather 'kitchy' and not all the way there. And then there's the rather ridiculous premise that men would pay to have sex with a robot in an expensive theme-park that probably has to charge millions to finance the upkeep of these complicated robots. Just pay a real person for seks! In the distopian future they're portraying here, virtual reality would have been way cheaper, providing the desired result and they wouldn't be meddling with unpredictable A.I. So I had a bit of a problem in the verisimilitude department there as well...
8.0~Great. Another HBO Gem Kid_kash09 Sign in Permalink 1st, you cannot follow this show if you're not fully invested in sitting, watching and reading for 1 hour. It's not really dramatic nor action packed. It replays scenes a lot and adds very little into those replays. Most people will see this as boring. But if you ACTUALLY watch it. Its the reason why HBO continues its streak of breaking records. It's the perfect example a story-driven show. None of the deaths matter, none of the action is taken serious, but all of it furthers story line and helps tell the ending in a way that it makes sense if you'd paid attention. Since The Last Episode is out, You're better Binge Watching All The episodes and go in knowing, the first couple episodes are confusing, but it'll all pay off.
10.0~Captivating first two episodes - that's all that is out as of the time of this review. skylorwold Sign in Permalink So far, this is getting a 10/10 with me, partly because I love the subject matter at hand, but mostly because it seems to be well-executed. It may be important that I have neither read the book (although I am a fan of every Crichton book I have ever read, but that hasn't been too many and it hasn't clouded my judgment.) Additionally, I have never watched the original movie, which I understand to be similar, but I am not sure just quite how similar. As for the show itself, it seems like it would be intriguing to anyone. The CGI and whatever tricks they use work very well; the lines between CGI and acting / props seem to blur, which is magnificent. I feel this is a great time in computer power to pull a show like this off. On top of the stunning visuals, the story line will probably keep me coming back for more and I may just end up reading he books. From he Crichton novels I have read, they seem to hold more words and paged than are actually there, so I think I should read this one before I try to read Game of Thrones / A Song of Ice and Fire, because I know that that show is amazing, and as they say: the book is always better. Also, I am quite sure that more work is put into the details of the characters - something I look forward to. Back to Westworld, though. Most, if not all of the actors are amazing and fit their roles somehow. To recap: 1) 10/10 from me based on the first 200 minutes or close to it. 2) Show can draw many crowds in. It's hardly similar to Firefly and way more of a Western, so that could and should draw that crowd in while deeply satisfying scifi fans. I'm sure it would make fans of either genre into fans of the other. 2) Great actors, most of whom are almost - or perfectly cast. 3) Extremely believable CGI that blur the lines reality. 4) Captivating story, based on a book with an ending (but they may make changes - I may wish they do just in order to extend it if they manage to keep the show where it is or close to the current score, but over-extensions almost always cause rapid degradation in writing quality when a show is based on a book. Once it drops to 2.5 in score or thereabouts, (maybe even a bit before that) they need to prepare for the end, and keep their eyes on viewership. If it declines too greatly, hey should have a contingency plan and take their time wrapping it - assuming it doesn't end where the book ends, because what I have read of Crichton, his books start at a high level and continue to climb to a climax. I highly recommend this show to fans of both westerns and scifi, as it is very strong in both genres, but probably at least a bit stronger in scifi. My only problem with the show is the time between air dates, but that comes with the territory unless you can handle holding off until the series is complete without forgetting about it, but I am certain more and more buzz will be centered around this show as it goes on. It's such a beautifully crafted world and the execution is nearly flawless.
9.0~Incredible undertaking of an extremely difficult topic - consciousness. harlandrakon Sign in Permalink Do not let the bad reviews turn you away from this stellar show. Having said that, I have to argue that I absolutely do not see the fall in quality in the second season that everybody seems to be going on about. The incredible power of the first season came from two sources: 1) The execution of several terrific plot twists that will spin the average viewers head by 180 and then some, carefully built up to by ingenious dialogue and subtle storytelling. 2) Anthony Hopkins. I cannot stress enough how big of an impact his character has on the show, and his acting prowess shines with astonishing brilliancy. Being one of my favorite actors, I can frankly say that I am not even biased in the slightest here - he's just that good. The second season, however, takes a more 'raw' approach to the story. Some aspects are admittedly less enthralling - the dialogue, while still excellent, is found somewhat lacking at times. Basically, the highly philosophical bits of conversation which are abundant in the first season are mostly sacrificed for faster progression and concrete happenings which pull the plot forward much faster than before. I see no fault in this whatsoever. The first season had ample time to build the characters and explain to us the rules and ramifications of Westworld, as well as provide us with insight into complex moral dilemmas that the characters experience. While being excellent food for one's brain, insisting on this kind of storytelling wouldn't be healthy for the show's entertainment in the long run, but this is just my opinion. The only reason this show didn't receive a 10/10 from me is in its very essence - it's just too complex in its thematic at times, and thus not for everyone.
10.0~I'm Just Gonna Say It... jeffballermed Sign in Permalink This series is a masterpiece in every aspect. Just read the 9 and 10 star reviews and they've said everything great I could say! As for the bad reviews. This show isn't for everyone. It's not a weekly network show that takes your hand and repeatedly walks you through the same simple format week after week. It requires a certain level of intelligence to understand and the people who don't get frustrated and call it garbage. If you have the ability to sit down, open your mind and to do a little bit of thinking about events on your own, you will be in store for one of the best entertainment offerings ever.
1.0~A watered down "politically correct" version of previous movies and novels backup-50362 Sign in Permalink Can't help but notice that under the promising script lurk ridiculously obvious and blatantly hateful feminist undertones, as is with most shows and movies nowadays, clear as day by the fact all main characters are women and there is lots of killing on their side towards "evil white men". Somehow, despite the clearly "diversity-friendly" cast, all of the "evil" characters turn out to be (white) males, and all of the "heroes" turn out to be females. Coincidence? No freaking way. The movie portrays white men, and one Asian male in particular as unrealistic-beyond-limits beta who'd give up his own life and the lives of many other humans (males, to be precise, again, didn't see one female human get killed despite the "diversity") for a backstabbing android that resembles a black female. This whole thing opened up a substantial amount of plot holes trough the last few episodes. The script itself "borrows" so much from previous "female AI develops consciousness and turns against it's white male creators" movies such as I, Robot and Ex Machina that some scenes are straight up copied from those, not to mention earlier Westworld-related media. Can't say it's an original movie or was pleasant to watch. It certainly was as confusing as they could get away with, with overly-loud but good music, and the direction was generally great, despite some scenes in which we see a character whom we hear talking but clearly isn't, where they didn't bother doing a re-take but just dubbed the scenes. Overall I feel like I wasted quite some time watching this, as it wasn't original in neither it's storyline nor the aggressive anti-male anti-white Hollywood agenda we see from every movie or TV show nowadays. Clearly a lot of work was put into this, and people will like it because of the "great" story most of them didn't understand and the "kickass female characters" which is just baseline pandering. So cheers!
9.0~The Next Evolution of Television bradhenson Sign in Permalink This is by far one of the most intelligent and thought provoking tv series that I have ever watched. The acting is superb, music amazing, plot deep, and cinematography captivating. Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Robert Ford gifts us a performance we will gets chills from much like Hannibal Lecter. Evan Rachel Wood as Dolores and Jeffrey Wright as Bernard also give fantastic performances. Ramin Djawadi again delivers great music that will in time become as iconic as his work on Game of Thrones. From the opening credits to the many themes of individual characters, everything here is perfect. The story of Westworld is deep and will keep you wanting more. It is exactly what sci-fi lovers such as myself can get lost in. Overall, this is one of, if not the best show on any platform at the moment.
5.0~Season 2 main theme is lifted from a Star Trek TOS episode mase-6 Sign in Permalink In TOS episode "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" (Season 1, Episode 7), Dr. Korby is obsessed with transferring human consciousness into android bodies in order to achieve immortality. Sound familiar?
10.0~Is Elsie alive? ThomasJ_9120 Sign in Permalink Elsie is in my favourites on the Westworld character roster and it looked like Bernard choked her to death in season 1 after she was digging into her investigation of the shady things going on in the park I was hoping she didn't die and seeing her return (living) was awesome. This episode was great on many other levels The Man in Black/William were bad ass, Love where their story is going and this season !
6.0~Another of Nolan's half baked sci fi - Plot holes, wrong science abdullahsayeed Sign in Permalink Like Nolan's Person of Interest series, the level science in this series is not always in a consistent range. I loved the plot, setting, direction, cinematography and everything but the hole series stands on the scientific evolution of robotics. I don't think the creator has a clear understanding of how society and everyday gadgets changes with scientific advancements. I always think that if you want to make a sci fi, always hire a programmer to learn how future tech should be. As a programmer myself, I can clearly see the discrepancy among various techs on the show. It takes lot of people, time and effort to write a standard software for our current computers of mobile phone. It takes a lot of processing power of too to use those softwares. If a machine which can improvise like a human, have improvised feelings like anger, love and lust, imagine what kind of super super computer you have to put inside the robot's body. It's not only that you just install some programs inside those robots and they start having sex. You have to create every cell for the exterior of those robots to make them exactly like humans, make those bio mechanical cells respond to the body computer instructions. In summary, when you have the capability of building robots of this quality, you should have some super powers in your pocket already. Because creating consciousness is just too big of a thing that I don't think it's achievable in the next 300 years. When we will be on that level of sophisticated robot development, we should not walk on the streets of that park, we should run around on hovercrafts. We should not have stray robots wandering around unaccounted, every robot should be constantly monitored and stopped inside or outside of Mesa alarm the authority when they take a knife and threaten a human being. By the way, if a bullet can go through a robot body, it will definitely go through 2 human bodies at once as the robots are stronger than humans. On the 7th episode, they penetrate a train car's steel body with a civil war machine gun, but these bullets can't get through human bodies, it's really absurd. And I don't know why they play sad music when they show robot blood? We know it's a robot right? What's the point?
2.0~Everything you would expect from a "ratings prostitute" like HBO finsfan_ct Sign in Permalink After the first show I can already see why most human beings, especially women, would find this show deplorable. First, and foremost, it should come with a "trigger warning" for victims of sexual assault as the screaming from the rape scene made ME queasy and I am not a victim. Moving along, this fits right into the regular fare that HBO shoots for....18-49 yr old's looking for loads of violence, nudity and sex that prays on their depraved nature. There is nothing redeeming thru one episode. Finally, let's put emotion aside and focus on serious flaws in the premise. What is the 'allure' of going to this theme park? Since you know going in there is no chance to be hurt, where is the thrill of the "wild west"? Same can be said for the sex. Why pay what must be a fortune to go and have sex with mechanical prostitutes and/or indulge in 'rape fantasies' when those things can be provided at a brothel with REAL women? Finally, with the saturation of sex and violence at this park, HOW on Earth are kids admitted to this park? (And to those that haven't seen the episode, kids ARE shown in a couple scenes.)
3.0~Watch Season.1 and pretend Season 2 was never made. andy-lowe-email Sign in Permalink Season 1 was enthralling but Season 2 is horribly dreary.
3.0~Something very wrong enitar Sign in Permalink I was charmed by season 1. Mysterious plot, great actors, well shot and an intrigue till very end. And I was so disappointed by season 2, mystery was lost and Terminator Dolores, walking over dead bodies and shooting like killing machine made everything so disgusting, so I stopped to watch it after s2e3.
6.0~Amazing season 1, horrible season 2 niekgrijz Sign in Permalink 10/10 S1, 2/10 S2 Season 2 was so bad. It destroyed everything that was good about season1. The pacing of season 2 was so fast and there were so many timelines mixing up with eachother that it was horrible to watch. And I still dont understand entirely what the story or message behind season 2 was. The message of the first season was beautifully delivered to the audience : "How do we define human?" The second season whatsoever seems to have no real message at all. Where do I even start because basically everything was bad in season 2. For starters, Anthony Hopkins. He died the perfect death in season 1. Slaughtered by his own creation. When I saw the finale of season 1 I was startled that they let Ford die so fast. I mean, Anthony Hopkins is such a big actor and is probably the reason why many started watching the show in the first place. But ofcourse they couldnt just leave his death alone or just let him come back for a few flashbacks like they did with young William. No. Ofcourse they had to ruin that perfect moment by bringing him back as an annoying ass hallucination of Bernard. Well done showwriters. Dolores. *sigh*. They completely ruined everything that was likeable about her by turning her into Wyatt. Her change from a genuinly good person to this heartless monster was too overnight for me. It was just too fast, I hoped they would use Teddy more to bring her to her senses so that we could get like a half heartless and half good Dolores in the end, but no. She had to change him to a heartless copy of herself and then he continued to kill himself. So besides that, how exactly does Dolores think she can beat the humans? She raises an "army" of ten cowboy hillbilly hosts and she acts like she can use them to kill billions of people. Because basically her goal is to kill all people because she hates them. The man in black actually brought this plothole up by telling her "you have no idea how big our world is and what it looks like, you cant beat us". To which her respond is : "I've seen your world, I know your world". GIRL, you literally saw the real world ONCE in that flashback of that party thirty years ago, you looked outside the windows and saw some buildings, thats literally all you saw. Humans can just throw some grenades at your host asses and you will be wiped from the earth within the snap of a finger! I don't know if you can tell but I'm getting frustrated at this point. So, moving on. The man in black. No goal throughout the whole season, no character development since he's basically the same person he was at the end of season 1. In season 1his goal was to solve Fords game and free the hosts. He wanted the park to be real, no do overs this time. But whenever its convenient for the plot people just refuse to die or get brought back to life in some way. Which makes his entire purpose invalid. Also, what has he really done throughout the whole season? Basically nothing, he just wandered around the park with no goal. And his daughter basically being the plotdevice that was pushing him around the whole time. The Abernathy storyline was ok I guess. But I just think it makes zero sense to put such valuable information inside a host instead of just storing it on like any other device, for example ever heard of a USB stick? I dont even know what to say about the whole Bernard Elsie timeline. The Bernard thing was confusing as heck but it all came together in the final episode so It wasn't that bad but not particulary strong either. It was mediocore. The final episode was just dumb, the whole cool thing we get to learn about the hosts in season 1 is that theyre made of actual flesh and that they look and feel exactly like humans. And now they continue to live on and build society in their virtual world thing? Its just dumb. And then the immortality thing. It made no sense. A hat that can read your mind and store all your thoughts? REALLY?! So what if youre hot and take it off? Oh my god its the stupidest thing I've ever heard. What I wanted to see from season 2 was a timeline in which Dolores escapes, humans looking for her. Dolores realising humans aren't as bad as she thought and making friends that help her hide from the government. Her recently made friends become family and when she gets discovered they die trying to safe her. Which would then lead up to a point in which Dolores does something that would kill a lot of the police people that are looking for her but also killing a lot of innocents in the process and that would make for a devistating iconic moment in the show. Like hell im improvising at this point and I actually think my story is already a lot better than the season 2 thing. Where I was going with this is that there was a lot of foreshadowing of the hosts breaking out of the park and hiding in the real world and experience the real world for the first time. Which I was super stoked about! But instead we got another season in the park which made the story very limited because it can only take place in so many locations. And we spent the whole last season in the park already so I cant see why they didnt make atleast one storyline of a host escaping to make things more interesting. And you can actually tell that the writers are realising that its getting boring that theyre always filming in the same locations because they made Shino world which served no goal in the entirety of season 2 but was just there to entertain us. And I wanted more young William, he was my favorite character of season 1. There were so many good moments in season 1, Maeve and Dolores discovering theyre robots, just the whole storyline of young william, The first few episodes in which we get to discover the beautiful park, The finale with hosts getting consious. Etc etc etc. The only thing I have to say about season 2 is : disappointment, suffers from the LOST syndrom. Which is for the people that dont know named after a show with the same name. It basically means adding more secrets and mysteries the whole time without the writers actually knowing where they were gonna go with it and what the mysteries actually are. And when the solution for these mysteries are revealed theyre mostly just lame reveals that disappoint the audience and makes them question why they've been watching this show for 6 years and leaves a lot of plotholes. Edit : I realised that there was something I liked about season 2. The story of Maeve, her gang and her daughter. It was beautiful. And Maeve has had amazing character development throughout season 2. I loved her. And the Shino world episodes didnt really do much for her plot but I loved those episodes because they were super entertaining and showed more of their journey to finding her daughter. Oh and the episode with the indian guy was pretty good too.
1.0~Worst TV show out there besides Stan Against Evil kenbad1010 Sign in Permalink Oh S*it just watched the first episode of this foul show and found it to be the biggest piece of garbage on TV. I can't believe there are people out there who think this drivel is good. Any teen kid on or off drugs can tell a better story. This is only for moron's who like sadistic killing and sex/nude scenes on TV or movies and nothing else. I don't care what others think I say shut this show down before it makes an idiot out of you.
8.0~Robots becoming self-aware, perhaps vengeful against their creators in the process, and all in a show which you can only hope evolves past its familiar tropes. Amari-Sali Sign in Permalink Overview You know, the expectations which come from a show being part of the HBO brand often waver between being the next big thing or proof that all these premium stations have is the ability to be far more sexual and violent than their peers. With Westworld, you have to admit it seems a show can't be part of HBO without excessive violence, a plethora of nude women, and a handful of mysteries. It is what their drama department craves, but while this show has all the usual ingredients, it might just be a bit more than we're used to. Main Storyline There is a loop. In this loop there is a girl named Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) who goes to town, maybe goes out to paint horses, and perhaps runs into the love of her life Teddy (James Marsden). But sometimes things don't happen that way. Teddy may miss her because one of the newcomers distract one of them, or maybe Teddy dies, Dolores is raped, and mind you these actions can be caused by either a newcomer or a host. The difference? Newcomers are essentially tourist. People who come to what seems to be this place in the Grand Canyon to live out a fantasy. There was a time, in the 30-year history of this currently mysterious company, you could join a "Horror Narrative" or do as they offer now in be out in the old west. During the day-long loop, you can do as you please to the host and they won't hurt you. After all, they are some kind of robots. So go on and kill, rape, or do as you please. Will they scream and react? Yes. But will they hurt you? No. After all, it is all part of their programming. However, Dr. Ford (Anthony Hopkins) seems to release, alongside his associate Mr. Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) upgrades. In these upgrades, the hosts become more real, and the most recent upgrade by Dr. Ford has allowed the hosts to access memories of their current loop or even past loops. Something which people like Mr. Sizemore (Simon Quarterman), who writes the over 100 interconnected stories, and Ms. Cullen (Sidse Babett Knudsen), a representative of corporate, don't appreciate. It creates possible liabilities, messes with a nearly perfect system, and creates fear. Fear which may soon be realized. Highlights In the effort to be fair, let me say I do enjoy the acting. Mind you, the words the actors say seem like something regurgitated from your favorite sci-fi movie, but there are some aspects which don't deserve backhanded compliments. I can't think of one off hand, but I'm sure as the season goes on I'll come up with something. On The Fence I'll admit that when it comes to sci-fi, I like the type of shows and movies which don't have all this hype building it up. If only because it makes you focus more on the special effects and the peculiarities of the technology more than the story and the characters. To make matters worse, this show is on HBO so naturally the violence and sexual content is high. So between the sex, violence, and then special effects/ tech, it is like the characters and story get lost amongst this. Now, the reason I put such a critique in "On The Fence" vs. saying it is a "Low Point" is because as generic as everyone seems, be it the subtly mad Dr. Ford, his protégé Bernie Lowe, or even the robot who has gained consciousness, Dolores, these actors find a way to take what if anyone else were to play these roles would be lifeless. After all, how many times, whether you are cinephile or telephile, have you seen these stories? How many ways can someone try to reinterpret and converge these characters in new and compelling ways? Well, very few arguably. For the script, thus far, has its little mysteries, but not the type of characters who seem to bring new life to old tales. Which isn't to say this show seems wholly predictable, but I am left feeling as Dolores starts to regain all her memories from past loops, thanks to the work of the ever curious Dr. Ford, we already know what will happen. Even making Ed Harris' role as a newcomer, possibly lost in his own unique loop, hardly something worth noting at times. Yet, there remains faith. Faith that these talented bunch could very well prove that I, and perhaps we if you are as skeptical as I am, don't know a damn thing.
9.0~The Original jozim Sign in Permalink The first character I fell in love with: Dolores Abernathy. In those first few minutes when she is creepily staring at nothing while answering the questions asked to her I was sold. I knew there was something more to her and I still can't wait to see more. The character I never expected to love as much as I do now: Bernard Lowe. He is nerdy and has a love for what he does. I originally thought he would be boring but after awhile I noticed how much he was paying attention to every little thing. He interests me. The character I used to hate but don't anymore: Theresa Cullen. When she was first introduced I thought she would be super bland and boring. She's not totally in the clear yet, but after her conversation with Lee I appreciated her a little more. The character I would totally smooch: Teddy Flood. I mean he is very nice to look at. Or Hector Escaton. Both are fine choices. The character I'd want to be like: Bernard Lowe. He is just so fascinated with the robots and I love that. He's just really nerdy about his robots and I appreciate that. The character I'd slap: The man in Black. Mainly for Dolores. But he deserves more than a slap for that. A pairing that I love: Maeve Millay and Hector Escaton. they had one hell of a sassy conversation and I'm on bored for seeing them together again. A pairing I despise: None so far. Overall I was surprised by how much I actually like Westworld. I'm eager for next weeks episode.
5.0~Started great, went downhill fast rhennell Sign in Permalink Season 1 is well worth a watch for the sheer production value and a great story arc. But, season 2 descends into bumbling nonsense - too many writers, too many ideas, too many stories.. what a shame. I see that JJ Abrams is involved in this show so this explains why it's like 'Lost' - rambling with no sense of ending. The writers have been given far too much time to ponder human existence and whether cyborgs could think for themselves - just give us a stunning series of worlds with action, adventure and dips into how cyborgs could evolve without committing too much time to this. Basically, this stunning action series has fallen into a mumbo-jumbo trap. Maybe Season 3 will be better but I suspect that the best of this show is over....disappointing.
2.0~So much potential, yet so boring. cassandrasturdy Sign in Permalink Amazing high concept idea that is timely and relevant. But such boring characters.
7.0~Mind boggling dystopia with endless plottwists nyancatcandy Sign in Permalink Beforehand I had acutally heard a lot of good about this show. Not much, just that it was good. And given my expectations, the first season both suprised and dissapoint me. The story telling is a truly one of a kind, you won't find something quite like this for some time. With multiple plottwists, interesting characters, the depth of this show is astonishing. The first thing that really grabbed me was just that, the well worked storyline and developed characters. It's a story between human and machine, where the humans strive to make robots that perfectly resemble humans in all of its aspects. The show really hits you down deep and makes you question your own humanity, of what it means to be human, and what it is that makes these robots any less of a human than us? It's mindboggling. Furthermore, the brilliant performances of Anthony Hopkins and Ed Harris really helps to enhance the dephts of the characters and keeps you stuck in front of the Tv-screen. However, Westworld is not free from problems. First of all, the list of good acting performances stops pretty much right there, and the rest of the cast acts like lame donkeys, especially Jimmi Simpson, whose performance almost ruins the entire character that Harris so barely manages to rescue. Moreover, the show feels a bit rushed, like no time was put into the making of the scenes, making it feel kind of low budget. But overall, the first season is actually quite good and just met my expectations. But hold your horses, don't coun't your chickens before they hatch. While season one was good, season two is way, way, worse. If season one felt rushed, this one feels even more so. The several, and good, plottwists of series 1 expand into a chain of them, happening seemingly uncontrollably, to the point where it just feels like a never ending story and that the writers can't settle for an ending. The acting becomes even worse, Ed Harris character gets more and more ruined all throughout the season, and the only good thing about the entire season is the return of one Anthony Hopkins, jumping in to save the day, well, almost. All and all, Westworld is a series worth watching that will twist your mind and make you question reality.
9.0~Not Perfect But Still GOOD Enough doublestorry-97022 Sign in Permalink The series awake some kind of thinking of the eternal evolution of human kinds. It tried to confuse you. It is empty.
3.0~1st season was awesome, 2nd sucks hard. Internet-Police Sign in Permalink The first season you feel for the characters and could feel empathy. Now in the 2nd season it's a huge mess and no one cares anymore about anything. I feel like I lost any connection to the show and I quit watching...oh well.
10.0~The Division of Humanity nikosavgoustidis Sign in Permalink Among other divisions, humans are divided between those that understand and worship "the Wire" and those that don't. Be it intelligence or open-mindedness, education or cultural aesthetics, alas the truth is that both the former and Westworld are just not cut out for everybody. I am of the opinion that you have to have read and care even at the slightest about philosophical concepts like conciousness, free will, conscience, history and societies progression, istitutions and state, contradiction etc (to name just a few) in order to simply immerse yourself in the pleasures that lie beneath both series. To that effect it's simply unfair to judge them both alongside the "standard" TV series, even the greatest ones (ie GoT, Vikings, Sopranos or Boardwalk Empire etc). You have to understand and accept that in order to proceed with this exceptional work of art that Westworld is. I firmly believe that the level of acting, scenery, music and, most of all, scripting and scenario, is just phenomenal. I mean it's just out of this world. And to add to all that you have some of the best nowadays directors doing a magnificent job, each one adding their personal flair and touch to every episode. I didn't expect everyone to like this work of art. After all, the understanding of such demands training and effort, dear people. You have to try hard sometimes in order to get to something that's worthy, otherwise I am afraid it's not. After all, it's only through great pain that some see progress. Westworld, or an essay on humanity's struggle to find and understand itself and finally a discourse on how can we or should conquer our own collective freedom against our repressors.
8.0~a mirror of our world dromasca Sign in Permalink Watching science fiction TV series is one of my guilty pleasures. The offer is very rich in numbers, quality offer is much sparser, but every few years there is a series that takes me prisoner, which I follow week after week, episode after episode, whose characters become familiar, they begin to captivate me and eventually absorb me in their universe or become part of my life. So were nearly three decades of space adventures of the new generation of My short list includes'Star Trek', 'V','X-Files', 'Lost'. Now comes 'Westworld'inspired by a 70s film by Michael Chrichton, produced by J.J. Abrams whose name hardly missing in the last decade of the credits any major productions of the science fiction genre on the small and big screen. The script is created (along with Lisa Joy) by Jonathan Nolan, who with his brother, director Chrostopher Nolan contributed to the conception of films as 'Memento', 'the Prestige' series 'the Dark Knight' and 'Interstellar'. At first glance 'Westworld' proposes an idea similar to the one of 'Jurassic Park' - the action takes place in a huge amusement park 'theme' in which visitors are invited to live in the past the different sensations of everyday experiences of the Wild West. From the first minutes of the first series viewers will realize that 'Westworld' is maybe a theme park, but one in which consumers will not go along with families and children. It is recreated here in a landscape that recalls the films of Henry Ford's Wild West, populated by male robots who engage in dueling pistols that they will always lose in the fight with the park's customers and female robots that will satisfy every desire and sexual fantasy of the payers of tickets. Anthropomorphic robots (androids) are provided with all devices that emulate human physiology and the software that put into motion include the emotions of a man, with one limitation - their memory is scheduled to be deleted and permanently regenerated every morning the sun rises on a blue sky together with reinforced scenarios and biographies of each of the robots. Overnight maintenance crews restore the physiological damages of pistol duels or axes battles in which the robot Indians were killed in the last day or psychological trauma of sexual abuses that have undergone female robots. That, of course, until programs start functioning poorly, and perfect memories are not erased from one day to another. Malfunctioning (or in technical terms bugs) of the programs which animate the androids is one of the favorite themes of science fiction sub-genre that deals with relations between robots and humans in the near future. But it is interesting to examine the prospect of dealing with these problems in programming. See for example the Swedish series "Real Humans'. As in the Scandinavians series, a programming mistake or a portion of code introduced intentionally in the history of the program and hid until at some point, give androids capabilities that were hitherto categorized among those traits that differentiate the robots people. They fall into two groups - imperfect erasure of memory that allow robots to recover - even fragmentary - past experiences or personal history to overcome threats; and emotional abilities that grant independence feelings beyond pre-programmed scenarios. In these circumstances are born the premises of the species conflict between androids and humans. As the action progresses the world of 'Westworld' is becoming increasingly complex, the questions multiply, dilemmas become more acute. Some of the characters have become not only familiar, but begin to populate the universe until I become part of their world. The series benefits from the interpretation of some of the known world cinema actors. Anthony Hopkins is Dr. Robert Ford, the brain who conceived this world, the Creator who gives birth to new characters and manipulates the lives and destinies of androids that are already in action. Assistant is Bernard Lowe (played by Jeffrey Wright) who faces a personal drama and an identity crisis. Ed Harris is the Man in Black - evil character and one of 'consumers' of Westworld. Two female characters - Androids Dolores (ingenue actress Evan Rachel Wood) and Maeve (Thandie Newton - exceptional) - are both emotional and produce counterpoints - though very different - while engaging in a process of discovering their own identities. Feminist ideals take an extra dimension, it is about the conflict of authority and social relations of the 19th century women combined with subordination of robots to humans. Not everything is clear in this action series. Many questions are asked, few are answered about about the evolution of the artificial intelligence technology, about the dangers improvement of improving robots to receive human emotions, about their identity and rights. I'm sure many surprises expect us in the next season(s), but one sure thing can already be said. 'Westworld' is a mirror of our world.
9.0~1st episode and hooked ericnottelling Sign in Permalink HBO has been putting out a lot of bad content lately, don't get me started on the True Detectives season 2. So I went into this one skeptical of what I would get as HBO really has been hit or miss with TV series. This first episode starts out with a twist and seems to really roll out smoothly from there. The acting is top notch with actors playing roles well suited for them. While the general concept itself has been done before, I can not recall it being done in such a graphic way. It reminds me of a very twisted Humans show on the BBC if you are familiar with it. Being on HBO has let the show be much darker and frankly creepier than what you get on the BBC, however I did have a sense that they were holding back on some of it. While the writing of the show was well above average I was left with a sense that they were not allowed to really show you how twisted their thought was for this series as they didn't want to turn people off with it being too demented. Although in some sense you almost wish they would have gone for it. As usual being on HBO the production level was out of this world. Unlike a lot of series that have a hard time getting good production value due to budget constraints West World looks top notch. You never have a sense they are skimping on the budget. The characters are interesting and well thought out and the world created will get your scifi mind running. The 1st episode definitely got the show on my Sunday viewing list. The show is going head to head with Humans in it's concept and I was a fan of Humans not just for the concept but the story alone with it. West World has the advantage of an adult rating but can they develop a greater story, that will decide this shows fate. But as of now, it's worth the watch.
10.0~Intriguing story, awesome cast, intelligent writing, well worth watching amaterasoo Sign in Permalink Westworld is an ambitious retelling of a 1973 film by Michael Crichton about a theme park inhabited by androids referred to as "hosts". The story isn't original by any means but the material is rich and ripe enough for a deeper exploration. The production is grand, sets beautiful, acting high caliber with the likes of Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins headlining. The plot is intriguing and chock full of existential musings from the human characters that take on the role of gods, that create, mold, kill, rape or plunder. The show explores the dark side of humanity and presents the thesis that people will indulge in their darkest selves if given the chance to do so without consequence. Westworld is poised to be the next Game of Thrones but it's appeal is not in the nudity (and there are lots of it) or the violence, it is the richness of the world they've created, the possibilities of each character and the delightful acting from a mix of new and veteran cast. Evan Rachel Wood is a wonder to watch. The subtle changes in her expression and voice as she shifts from her android self to the sentient host she is programmed to play is enchanting. The supporting characters are equally brilliant from Thandie Newton's hustling madame to James Marsden's noble cowboy, down to the extras playing unmoving bodies being repaired. HBO pulled all the stops to make sure this new show would be a success and from the looks of it, it has all the ingredients to be a truly epic watch.
9.0~Second season much better than the first! wilza76 Sign in Permalink First season was slow, too heavy a Wild West plot, too focused on character development and just overall slow paced. Second season learned from the firsts mistakes and went hard from the very first ep. Watching the 1st season felt like a chore - 2 nd season I'm gripped an dcsnt wait for next ep. This could end up being the new game of thrones/lost if they do this right - keep up the good work!
10.0~Awesome in all ways! Watch and question the nature of your reality! kamal-sk89 Sign in Permalink The series is outstanding in all ways. Writing takes a special mention in merging human emotions, philosophy, technology in the right proportion, which is a piece of cake for Nolan brothers. After the pilot episode, the series will plant an idea to question the nature of our reality, our daily routine, our evolution. The original score of the series is a slow poison, especially the "The Exit" soundtrack of the finale will eat you. Must watch series for all Sci-Fi lovers.
6.0~... and then came season 2 Sissa0101 Sign in Permalink Well, since my longer review got deleted by mistake and don't feel like writing it again: Season 1- great. Season 2 got so pretentious that it stopped being fun to follow. Back and forth, here and there, blah, blah, blah. I mean, it's all good to not put it all on the table and leave something for the viewer's brain to work out, but second season was just frustrating. I was going to give it 7 stars, but I got so angry that it just was going and going and going and ended up .... god knows where, I give it only 6*. I couldn't finish season 2 unfortunately. If that makes me simple minded ( as someone below mentioned) so be it.
8.0~Which side are you on? bregalad_hdr Sign in Permalink The follow up of Jonathan Nolan's excellent Person of Interest that had also a very different take on artificial intelligence. This time with a much higher budget from HBO and a known premise from the 70s movie, the team around Nolan and Lisa Joy found a take on AI. Just as the recent movie Ex Machina, the show is concerned to show us the idea of humans that create new life and asks the question if humans can do whatever they want. Underlying motifs of slavery and a human preference for superiority can be felt. And the show might fool you to wish the humans lost a fight against the machines. Genuinely amazing performances, especially by Newton and Wright. Where she gives a heartbreaking but relatable look into the life of an robot, Wright plays so subtle, there are millions of emotions hidden in a little smile. But also the others roles are well cast and they didn't stay cheap. Wood, Marsden, Hopkins or Harries are no no-names. The set is very cool and definitely huge. The Western style has always sold well, especially in Science Fiction (I look at you Star Wars and Firefly) and the contrast with the super modern tech building works. Small critical point: The motivation of most characters seem unclear too long and sometimes it feels hard to relate. The overall mystery seems more important than character building.
1.0~Marxist, contrived feminist propaganda birthdaysuit11 Sign in Permalink Full blown AIDS feminism Logic?? Forget about it; next level LSD hyperspace. They have that mud slide like black robot chick walking in real-world manipulating some pussy-whipped Chinese guy into changing her programming code and no one at Disney central command even notices that kind of alarming behavior even though they monitor EACH ROBOT UNIT. I'm not even talking about the rest of this la-la land where nothing makes sense. I'm seriously, dumbfounded how this show acquired close to a 10 rating. The west worlds conformist mentality must really be just that, ignorant conformist drones. Boring, painfully boring, painfully boring i literally fast forwarded each episode. thank god its free on the internet The whole deal is just a constant eye-roller. the retarded twists are illogical and forced. The show has no plot. It's just a mix of retarded feminist fantasies, men-hating and pile-on of random dumb crap. If you are against white men, like inter-racial orgies, are a hyper-feminist cultural Marxist, then this show is for you. Seriously, watching 10 episodes made me grow a placenta. My estrogen went through the roof. You'd think because of my aggressiveness and anger it would be my testosterone but this show seriously sucks you into an elitist, feminist hell hole that ultimately causes you to question your sexuality. Good thing I was in dat aware beta stage and not alpha or I'd be done f*caked. If you support values, morals and the structure of a family, please do not watch this. If you support the trafficking of babies then by all means watch it.
10.0~Absolutely spectacular Violent_Delight2804 Sign in Permalink Wow, where to begin... First of all, the score by Ramin Djawadi is absolutely majestic! The actors, well, whatever I say just won't be enough. It's a total pleasure watching every second of their stellar performances. The plot - being a huge fan of sci-fi, it simply doesn't get better than that! The scenery is gorgeous, it really takes you in the past. That constant mix of past and future is brilliant. Overall, I am amazed ( obviously ), mesmerized and absolutely loving every single thing about this show! Already a classic in my book <3
2.0~SUPERFICIAL. A missed opportunity to deliver a strong script alongside an already great technical team and cast. shreet-shreet Sign in Permalink The only reason I am writing this review is because currently, Westworld with a rating of 9.2 falls under the tier of series' such as Game of Thrones, Fargo and Stranger Things. The following points highlight why I do not consider it as good as it is being reviewed and rated by most. * STORY IS A MESS It is one thing to keep the story rich with several plot points and story lines and other to JUMBLE it up so that the audience cannot actually keep track of what's happening. There is nothing really happening and the audience has been kept for a supposed big surprise. Whether they will actually be able to deliver something that justifies all of the build up that they are doing and is LOGICALLY CONSISTENT at the same time is yet to be seen. For now, we can just wait. Usually, the stories that actually deliver, reveal the CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS from time to time and then narrate a story that will be true to the characters being written. Here, all the characters are totally VAGUE and the writers are free to bend their strings according to their own will. The script and concepts of Westworld have taken inspiration from many good classic sci-fi movies such as The Truman Show but all of those concepts are mixed in together haphazardly to create a mess. * THE FUTURISTIC REAL WORLD OF WESTWORLD WOULD ALREADY BE SAVVY ENOUGH WITH AI TO BE THIS FASCINATED WITH "WESTWORLD" Westworld is made from our PERSPECTIVE(people in 2016) and how we would feel if such an AI themed park existed. An organisation would not get hands on such highly SENSITIVE and dangerous AI out of the blue and get permissions from concerned authorities(government) to operate a theme park using such delicate technologies unless that technology is considered safe. If they are indeed considered safe, in that case they would be used in many other more important fields and tasks first before considering to be used for entertainment purposes. Thus, The Real World of Westworld would not be this NAIVE and unfamiliar to such advanced AI anyway. * THE BASIC CONCEPT OF AI IN MOVIES AND TV - SYMPATHY, EXISTENTIAL CRISIS AND HATRED, IS NOTHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE Let me say this because this needs to be said - Playing with our heads to create sympathy for AI is nothing but nonsense because the whole concept of artificial intelligence is that it's ARTIFICIAL. AI will NEVER feel emotions like humans do, they might become smarter than we are but they will never feel. Whatever emotions we might think they exhibit is always an ILLUSION for human minds in thinking that they are expressing emotions but for them it's just a bunch of INPUTTING, PROCESSING and OUTPUTTING. * GOING IN TECHNICALITIES OF THIS MICHAEL CRICHTON'S WORK IS LIKE KILLING YOURSELF One guy makes story lines, one guy programmes AI, one woman is responsible for quality control and one guy is the head of all final decisions. They interact with each other CASUALLY without any meetings and discussions on all types of decisions, no matter how important the decision might be. There is no TESTING, beta or alpha, and the updates are directly implemented on the final product. Is this the way the organisations work in real life? The reason I mentioned Crichton was because this reminded me of Jurassic Park, the shortcomings that it had are clearly reflected in Westworld too even if this is made in 2016. * "THEY COME BACK BECAUSE OF THE SUBTLETIES" BUT IRONICALLY, THE SUBTLETIES ARE TOTALLY MISSING FROM WESTWORLD The obnoxious interiors with perfectly cut tiles, rooms separated by glasses and bar lights, with absolutely nothing else isn't subtle but SHALLOW. DIALOGUES are poor. Some scenes and settings are used in such REDUNDANT amounts that they seem to work as fillers and are REPETITIVE. These things only display a LACK OF IMAGINATION on writers' part. * REPRESENTS A CULTURE OF HOLLOW SCI-FI MOVIES AND SHOWS Westworld is not alone in this. Many movies like ex machina, star wars have similar SHORTCOMINGS and if Westworld also becomes critically acclaimed, it would encourage other writers to come up with scripts with such shortcomings and big production houses will put their money in those scripts. The culture of insubstantial stories might have worked in 70s but you need to come up with something substantial that matches the standards of series such as True Detective and Game of Thrones. This does not mean that there aren't any good sci-fi movies. The Truman Show, Terminator, Interstellar(another reason why I was disappointed), 12 Monkeys etc. are some of the better films of this genre but then that's my personal taste & choice. THE GOOD : TECHNICAL TEAMS – effects, sound, costumes, cinematography etc. are splendid in their jobs, the ACTING is brilliant except for Sidse Babett Knudsen(Theresa Cullen), maybe she is meant to act this way(they might have something for her), the DIRECTION is good, everything is top notch as for the film making is concerned but for the thing that it stands on, the SCRIPT, is unfortunately VERY WEAK. Since obviously, Westworld is made with brilliance it can be a GUILTY PLEASURE but nothing much else for me. I am a huge SKYRIM fan and the role-playing and story lines thing gave a nostalgia of RPGs and MMORPGs. Modern standards for TV Shows have elevated massively in the last decade or two. Delivering on those standards is not easy but when you are making such a highly budgeted mature rated show, you gotta work harder on the CORE to at least make it match the stunning PRESENTATION being delivered.
8.0~Season One Review southdavid Sign in Permalink Season One Review - Talks about the themes of the season, but contains no plot spoilers. I rewatched Season One of "Westworld", ahead of the start of season two, given that it had been so long since that first season aired. I really enjoyed it watching it a second time, obviously it's different seeing it knowing about the three reveals that take place towards the end of the season - but it's still a hugely enjoyable mix of legitimate Western adventure and science fiction plotting and still works knowing what is revealed. A semi sequel / semi reboot of the 70's film, "Westworld" finds the park re-established and catering to the basest desires of the rich patrons who attend the park. Several narratives cross both in the Western themed park and the control/maintenance facilities as some of the hosts (humanoid robots designed to act like humans, but follow scripted storylines) begin to question their reality and then discover the truth of their life of suffering. Meanwhile, Delos, the corporation that owns "Westworld" is seeking to remove its longstanding creator and narrative designer, Dr. Robert Ford, (Anthony Hopkins) but he has other, and infinitely grander, ideas. This first season was a phenomenon and for good reason. One of the best ensemble casts ever assembled for a TV series, combined with ground breaking special effects and a violent, gory, expansive storyline about the themes of loss, greed, exploitation and even what it means to be human. I can understand, though would disagree, with people who would argue that the plot is too confusing. The repeating nature of the host's existence combined with their occasionally returning memories does make for disorientating viewing. The adult content will also likely turn off some other viewer - but my biggest concern, given the crossover in creative team with the show "Lost" is that they have ideas for a couple of good seasons of this, but will then drag it out beyond that date and tarnish what came before .... But that is something for later reviews. For now, it's another highly enjoyable addition to TV's golden age.
5.0~Good actors, high end production, lame script onurmems Sign in Permalink The writing don't match the expensive production. Nice idea but writers couldn't pull it off.
10.0~The most outstanding science fiction series on TV. Period! neskire Sign in Permalink I saw the original Westworld movie back in 1973. That was great. This series is so much better. It explores deep philosophical issues regarding the human condition by using the metaphor of robotics. If you are a fan of Isaac Asimov's robot series of books, you will find this TV series equally fascinating. Every episode reveals more of the ideas about what it means to be human. The development of the theory of the bicameral mind allows us to question the very notion of consciousness. If you want to discover more about how the brain works, I highly recommend the book "Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain" by David Eagleman. I read this at the same time I saw Westworld. Are we really what we know when we are conscious? How many decisions do we make automatically without conscious thought? When it has been said that we only use 10% of our brain, I believe that what is meant is that we are only aware of 10% of what the brain actually does. Our consciousness is only the "tip of the iceberg". The only drawback as I write this review is that the second season of Westworld may be over a year away. Regardless, it will be worth the wait.
1.0~Watched my last episode! damburke Sign in Permalink I have no idea what is going on. This show reminds me of the path that "Lost" took.
5.0~Slow as a Wet Week! brightspark-78239 Sign in Permalink I realize I'm out of step with the vast majority of opinions here but this show is utterly boring. Loved the original movie with Yul Brynner and love the overall premise but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I've watched all 6 episodes to date and still waiting for something new and/or exciting to take place. Each new episode is more or less a replica of previous episodes - same old, same old. Progress is excruciatingly slow. I've heard of slow burners, but this show takes that concept to the extreme. The cast and acting are really good; Anthony Hopkins commands the screen as usual and Ed Harris portrays the evil "Man in Black" to perfection. Now, if only something would actually happen!!
1.0~A dive like I've never seen before Arnror_II Sign in Permalink From one of the best sci-fi television series I've ever seen in season 1, to a messy philosophical mumbo jumbo turd, that will not entertain anyone who's not a 14 year old boy. I like philosophical challenges, like some of Star Treks early years or TNG, but this is not challenging, interesting, provoking, or even a bit entertaining. I don't think they expected this one to make it to season two, and it shows. Frankly, it's crap. A well casted, brilliantly executed, amazingly looking piece of crap. I will not waste my time on the third season, and if you're reading this before watching season two, spare yourself. Walk away.
5.0~Something missing maligor5 Sign in Permalink Much like a robot, something is just missing from this show. There is a "void". Perhaps its the lack of a strong leading character. Ed Harris and Evan Rachel Wood would be the closest thing to it. We don't really learn much about Harris' character, except he wants to solve Westworld's mysteries. Even Rachel Wood is a robot, but could forseeably become more interesting if she were to break her programming limitations. At this time though, neither are strong enough to carry the show so we end up not caring. Outside of that the scenery and costumes look great. It doesn't have any of the eerie soundtrack the original movie had as of yet (which made it so memorable). We'll see how this plays out. They are really going to need the robots to start developing equal to humans we like and can relate to, as they struggle to free themselves from their masters grip.
10.0~WOAH! (Season 2) jasonviliame Sign in Permalink If there's anything this incredible show demands, it's your patience. I can't believe viewers have given the second season really low ratings without having watched past the first few episodes. YES, it's slow, but so was the first season, and you all know how that turned out -- AMAZING! What you think seems to be a pointless mess, really isn't. The pieces only come together after the fifth episode and builds up into a terrific, complex, very well orchestrated story. Give it a chance. You won't regret it. Production, acting, script and everything else is indeed stellar.
5.0~Losing Interest signup-15702 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was good and I enjoyed the story line. Season two has took a left turn and I have no idea why they are exiting the proven first season story line. I have no interest in where the plot may be going. It's boring as heck to try and watch something based on senseless and random killing. Watched the third episode of season 3, I won't bother watching any more. I'll find another channel with something more entertaining. Maybe something with a good Sci Fi story line.
10.0~Unbelievably awesome show. Everyone should watch this. camilli_john Sign in Permalink I barely have words to describe how incredible this show was. It was transformational, and I can't do enough to recommend it to everyone. You will finish it a changed person. A people will rise who can live forever, And it will be our last endeavor To vent upon them all our pain. For we can never rise again. We mortals, oh we sorry souls, Upon this stage to play our roles, Then blow away into the dust. Not as we want, but as we must. It saddens me to know our end: However strong, that we will bend, And break upon the rock of time. For little reason, and lesser rhyme.
10.0~Thought provoking analysis in to the definition of consciousness tankace Sign in Permalink With the end fast approaching in Game of Thrones (in 2018 in going to end) HBO was on the ropes in order to find a new flagship series and the producers definitely hit gold with West-world ,a recycled idea of a science fiction film of 1973, quit unexpected indeed. To clear, I don't like this sequel-prequel-remake-adaptation tend nowadays, for I find it a little risk free and easy approach, but when they take crazy ideas and go for them ,such as with West-world ,well it can go either excellent or in the bottom of the sea and here is the first one. So what is this West-world? What is about ? Is it any good? First things first no spoilers, for this a series that you have to see for yourself. Now West-world it is a recreation park themed as a western setting in which clients can do whatever they like and in this park are hosts, artificial beings ,on which the clients can act however they like to. So yes the concept is wacky to say the least, but the story-lines are flawless, the acting top notch and in 10 episodes we get some of the most amazing plot twists of 2016. In short, HBO seems that has found its next flagship. As for the quality ,beautiful scenes and we get lessons in psychology and a in depth look in the nature of thinking and what makes consciousness a thing, and it is done in a captivating way, perfect! All these are of course combined with a sizable roster of characters, violence and images that some viewers are going to haunt them, what did you expect from HBO ? And I want to add on those images, at times they feel like ,that were straight out a horror movie( a good one), personally I somewhat expected that for here we have also the one and only king of creepiness Antony Hopkins. If I could summaries the whole series it would be form one pf the quotes of Dr. Lecter himself "Interesting people know what is boredom and act so they stay interested" ,so if you are interested in this series go watch it and you will find it fascinating.
4.0~Confused ckocyildirim-22-237733 Sign in Permalink Everything is confused. Who is human? Who is artificial intelligence? I'm not gonna watch the third season.
10.0~Pure perfection dejmonsalvatore4 Sign in Permalink Aldo I've seen only two episodes, I can tell this is going to be maybe the best series I've ever seen (after Black Mirror, of course). I like psycho shows, like serious mindf*ck. I think that human psyche is the most brilliant and fascinating thing that ever was made. This show totally plays with it. How sick people really are? How far they would go, if they know that they can come home and enjoy their life, knowing that nothing of that was real and that they, technically, did nothing wrong? Wasn't it really real, if you were in your most real behavior? And how hard is to go back to your normal life, when you've experienced you deepest desires? With brilliant script, geniuses lines, extraordinary music and cream of the cast, this is one of the 5 shows that will get 10/10 out of me. Hope it won't be ruined after it becomes success, like it happens with 99% of the shows.
10.0~Reviewing after Season 1 harshalagrawal03 Sign in Permalink Westworld, a theme park, big enough to have mountains, rivers and trains, is a place for people to have fun, go on adventures, and to do pretty much anything gore without facing any real consequences because they can't be killed here and all the subjects are robots. But that's just the surface of the story, which you understand in first 10 minutes. Real story lies behind the question 'Whether these robots should be considered humans' since they talk, walk, eat, feel and do everything a human does. Except they are artificial, and this story makes you question that very line of distinction. This story follows a world with humans and robots on different arcs uncovering different truths. But they all come at one place in the finale. It is important to know that all the footage of this series revolves around 'Westworld'. And, we know nothing about the outside world like how advanced it is, which might come in season 2. Their mystery, setting, character development, subtlety of background music is 10 on 10. It is needless to say that unless you specifically don't like sci - if or casual nudity or big plots, this is a must watch.
1.0~Season 1 was great. Season 2, not so much... jeancoulter Sign in Permalink I tried but so boring. Nothing compelling, I'm going to sleep.
1.0~Ashamed to have watched it... lebartha Sign in Permalink I watched the old Westworld movie. I was fascinated by the story. The story itself is actually very good. However, the constant cursing, nudity ruins the whole show. Sad that humanity needs all that to be "entertained". However, it is HBO, so they have no idea how to produce a show without ruining it with filth, so I am not surprised. However, felt ashamed that I even watched it. I am a software engineer and the idea of AI and robotics always intrigued me. I wished there was more technology in the show, at least show some robotics and internal parts of the humanoids, however that was lacking in the first episode. Won't continue however...don't need my eyes and ears rapped every minute thank you very much.
8.0~Season 2 Mid-season review CinematicInceptions Sign in Permalink SEASON 1 SPOILERS AHEAD! Going into the premiere of season 2, I was not overly excited for the continuation of what had been an interesting show. But after watching the premiere, I was very excited because this season can afford to do so much more than season 1 did. Whereas season 1 had to spend a lot of time establishing the nature of the complex world, we now get a chance to see just what that complexity can give rise to in the second season. So far, there has been a lot more attention given to the host characters than the human characters. As the hosts become more and more conscious of their true nature, they discover new limitations, powers, and complications. This seems like it is likely to continue in the last five episodes. Only a couple of new characters have been introduced, or at least only a couple of characters that seem like they will be given attention. There is one new human character who I am definitely interested to see more of but has only gotten a little bit of screen time. The first five episodes have given us a taste of the other parks. There is a brief glimpse of a park that seems to have a British-occupied India theme to it. This past week in episode five we finally got to see Shogun world that has been teased in a couple of trailers. One thing that is definitely different about watching season 2 compared to season 1 is that the stakes are so much more real for the characters. Now that the hosts are free, the human characters are no longer protected as they once were. However, the hosts are similarly vulnerable because they can no longer be revived by their human creators now that the humans have lost control of the park. The coming episodes seem to promise further exploration of the nature of the hosts, a deeper look into the other parks, an escalation in the war between the humans and the hosts, revelation of what company secrets are held within the code of Peter Abernathy, and lots of progression for our characters. Plenty to keep fans interested. If you watched season 1 but haven't started season 2, I highly recommend it. I have found the individual episodes of season 2 much more engaging than those of season 1 so far. If you haven't started the show at all, you probably shouldn't be reading this review. But it's very good if you like deeply involved sci-fi worlds. It is similar in concept to the two Blade Runner movies, though I like this show much better. It's not so much of a source of entertainment as it is an hour of food for thought each week. There are some really good themes of where technology is going and especially the way we currently relate to modern story-telling mediums. In a lot of ways, the park in the show feels like it is where video games will be a few decades into the future, which is really interesting to think about. There are a lot of good tv shows out there now, but if you have HBO, this is worth looking into. Even if you don't have HBO, this show is worth binging in the free trial month or even paying the monthly subscription for.
10.0~Dont miss an episode jentaylorog Sign in Permalink All I can say is I never saw most of it coming Well thought out and couldn't wait for each episode to be released!
8.0~Don't give up! jessicamintondds Sign in Permalink This show is hard to swallow (no pun intended) in many of the first episodes, but as you realize, the show is more about a commentary on the human psyche it becomes very interesting. West world delves into complex socioeconomic issues as well the idea of a soul/moral compass. Not for the faint of heart, but a must see for those who enjoy intellectual thrillers.
8.0~What is life? What is consciousness? Bored_Dragon Sign in Permalink Can artificial intelligence achieve consciousness and what is the point where machine stops being thing and becomes form of life? Show asks these questions and, instead of getting lost in attempts to give concrete answers, it leaves her characters and her audience to draw that line on their own. Although I'm a big fan of SF and especially AI and machines that mimic life, after eight episodes I wasn't impressed. I never saw the movie this show is based on, so I can't make any comparison, and I don't have any objections to which I can point my finger. Everything is nicely designed and packed. There's no obvious flaws, technical or in story. Acting, directing, production, everything is very good and brain tells me this is top-notch show. And still it leaves me indifferent. I thought it lacks that "something" which cannot be named and can be found even in bad movies because it doesn't depend on technical qualities. Let's call it soul of the movie. I really wished for this show to be perfect ten, but I would be unfair to myself if I gave it more than strong seven. And then I saw last two episodes and realized that the series was mindfak and that during the whole season I actually had no idea what I was watching. I was aware from the start that story wasn't straight line, but to what extent it's actually nonlinear and tangled I could not even dream. Twists in last few episodes are completely unexpected. Once they happen you ask yourself how is it possible that you didn't see it coming, but fact is you didn't. And with every new revelation overall impression grows stronger. Season finale definitely raise my rating to 8,5/10
10.0~Game of Thrones finally gets some competition jbaarupaaby Sign in Permalink I saw this first season of the show in a matter of hours - not days. It is breathtaking in so many ways; the storytelling, the scenery, the acting and the cinematic perfection are simply awe-inspiring, and you're definitely able to see the detail and thought that has gone into every single frame of the series. Although the series partly takes place in the beautiful west (how awesome is that for a science-fiction series?) and includes stunning storytelling filled with surprises and thought-provoking elements, one thing that I really enjoy about the series is the sound; I don't know how to describe the beauty of the use of sound in Westworld so I'll just say this: Remember to turn up the volume and get ready for the wildest sci-fi ride you've ever had. But then again, I wouldn't expect less from a Nolan ;)
4.0~Going Nowhere zackuzmanov Sign in Permalink From the writers of Lost here comes Westworld. Actually not sure who writes this. But it's certainly starting to look like another one of those long drawn numbers you wish you never wasted your life with. Pretentious, self indulgent and so far of little substance. Not sure how many seasons is it meant to go on for but judging by the constant arrival of brand new plot lines we're a long way from getting any gratification for having sat through this. Personally, I'm about to throw in the towel. That's after episode five. I mean it looks good and is acted well for the most part. Would it be so hard to step the pace up a bit? And that old chestnut with the cliffhangers. Nobody needs that. Not anymore. If anything it leaves you feeling cheated. It is blackmail after all. Cheap tricks. That might ultimately have the opposite effect to what the writers intended.
2.0~Today's lesson from the post Weinstein book of uber feminism.. cb-81421 Sign in Permalink I don't like being hit over the head. Who does? But week after week through season two, Westworld crudely bludgeons the viewer with message after message about how men are weak/stupid/corrupt and women are strong/intelligent/smart. Look at the pairing dynamics: Dolores - strong, Teddy - weak. Bernard - confused, Shannon - driven. Maeve - smart, Lee - stupid. Male security officer - blindly does his job, Female security officer - thinks about her job. I could go on.. From the violent Shogun males, compassionate females to the all male, all evil park owners/ investors. Even the once independent 'Man in Black', is now joined by his far savvier, far more intelligent daughter. And before you say anything, I'm a woman - and proud of it. Generations before me fought for an equal world. What nobody needs is for the pendulum to swing so far the other way. Two wrongs don't make a right as the old saying goes. There's no more need for this kind of evangelising as there is for men to go around, cap in hand, apologising for their every move, which frankly just makes me cringe. Both sexes can be strong and clever, weak or stupid. The writers of Westworld seem to think that we all fall into the latter category and need block capital 'education' at every turn. Me, I've had enough, thank you, and will be dropping out of school early.
8.0~Disney World for Adults view_and_review Sign in Permalink I am a Sci-Fi geek, especially for those which give you a lot to think about. Westworld is a bit similar to another show I binge watched called Humans. In that show you have robots which are virtually indistinguishable from humans and they are ubiquitous. They are used for everything from servants to caregivers to prostitutes. Westworld, unlike Humans, confines the life-like droids to a singular area which is an adult theme park. But, like most movies or shows with bots that are so akin to the real thing, consciousness comes into play. There is always the risk of robots becoming (to use the Terminator term) self aware. Westworld is a veritable playground in which robots are the principle actors and the human "guests" pay to interact with them in whatever story line they choose to pursue. Essentially, people can "let their hair down" and act out whatever fantasies they may have with the willing participants (i.e. the androids). Of course, this type of setting gives you a better picture of who the people really are outside of their normal social settings. But, there in lies the dilemma--are people behaving badly BECAUSE they are in a fictitious world and they know it's all fake or because that is who they truly are? It is an excellent show with a lot of secrets and some food for thought. It will even have you questioning your own moral compass and how you view these creations that so resemble you and I.
3.0~Season one was fantastic, 3 stars is for season 2 whosurpopi Sign in Permalink The gun fights between humans and hosts are so stupid in the second season, it has become difficult to watch. You can have a host totally surrounded by militia armed with fully automatic weapons, and they are taken out by a host with a revolver.
1.0~Sex, blood, highly offensive stereotypes and swearwords! M1racl3sHapp3n Sign in Permalink When I saw the trailer, I immediately recognized the high quality of the tv series and I badly wanted to watch it. The story is interesting, at first, but it soon turns into a nightmare. This virtual place is great only for frustrated white males into the sex industry who would like to kill everyone for fun! Yes, they put a couple of black men in a totally unrealistic role because in the wild west, black people (yes, including men) were slaves. Native Americans are depicted as bloody killing machines looking for someone's scalp. Most women are prostitutes - nothing has changed about that! And in the middle of this offensive stereotype galore, you have serial killers killing everybody for no apparent reason! Blood everywhere, people's faces been completely blown up by shotguns... By the second episode I was so incredibly fed up! What this the point of this movie? Yes, the special effects are good so I assume they had a great budget but this is not a science fiction tv-series this is a b rated horror which desperately needs parental guidance.
10.0~Robots? cpedwick Sign in Permalink This is a scifi dream come true, super cleverly written aimed at an intelligent audience. sit down and bukkle up its about to blow your mind. really tho you will be gripped its so new and the tech is so far out. and the cast well its a typical movie, nut its a series prepare to be spoiled.
10.0~Philosophic conclusions (no spoliers) sabarthas Sign in Permalink Excuse my english, I'm not a native speaker. References to Nietsche, Deleuze and Camus' philosophy : The idea of liberty grows wih the desire of creation, which is the will to power (Nietzsche). This desire is made by the suffering, a part of our which is rejected. This rejection makes a minor part, and it's the minor-becoming that makes us creators (Deleuze). However, if we want that creating part to be fully powered, we have to admit the absurdity of the world : no Morality, Good, Evil, Happyness, etc. Which means that we need to have done a nihilistic work (Camus + Nietzsche)
10.0~Just about season 1. The Best! Farid_127 Sign in Permalink I don't seeing Series a lot. Because It take really more time. So I expect high about series. And this one is really worth with it. It is a multilayer series. At the first layer,we can say, It is really entertaining. like the other series. But... Westworld is a Idea. It is about discretion. It rejects discretion. There is a Simplification between God and Us, In Westworld. In Westworld, God is Dr.Ford, And the Hosts are us. In the all of the episodes, I thought, the hosts are reaching to consciousness. and I afraid of that! but when I understand, everything was about the Ford's new story, I calmed down! That's the most important point. after all, The hosts,doesn't have any discretion. They were in a Delusion of discretion. maybe like us! this is a theory from Neuroscience men. maybe the brain controlling us. not we controlling it! And The brain is a creature of God. So maybe we are in delusion too. like the hosts. Thanks for reading.
3.0~Looking forward to this ollyfoister Sign in Permalink Or at least I was until I watched it.i loved the movie when I was small and was looking forward to this for over a year and it really wasn't worth it.I think it's a mess and the fact they released a YouTube video to tell people what was happening in it shows you that Christopher Nolan isnt that good it spreads to his brother.So,I waited 18 months for season 2 and it's the same thing again.wont bother with 3rd season
6.0~Great promise that eventually derailed and unraveled JaydoDre Sign in Permalink Westworld has a lot going for it: the first season features a number of good high-profile actors doing a good job; it features pretty cinematography; and it has a number of story threads that were woven with care, with enough tension built to make you want to keep watching the show in order to reach the resolution of all the introduced mysteries. Was the writing a little bit up its own bum sometimes? Yes, sure, many scenes looked drawn out, with the writers pretending to be artsy and classy without there being much value under the surface. But the show was still cool and interesting. With our interest peaked, the first season did not answer the main questions, leaving the answers for the second season. The second season then promptly proceeded to completely disappear up its own rear, as the story stopped making sense, both in its broader strokes and also in the individual scenes. Seemingly important moments in the story are handled quickly and awkwardly. The dialogue got increasingly pretentious. The actors are still doing a good job, but you can only do so much with a poor script. It also doesn't help that Anthony Hopkins left the show. At its core Westworld is supposed to be about cool cowboy robots rising up against the humans. The moment of the uprising should be the pinnacle of excitement. Instead that moment is a drawn out pretentious mess. Is the quality of the first season sufficient to give this show a recommendation and a respectful sendoff. No, not really. Because the first season left all the tension to be resolved in the second season, it cannot stand on its own. I hope this show will recover.
9.0~ultra sci-fi ivelostmybluetshirt Sign in Permalink The spectacular westworld.... 1 - Its one incredible time jumpy cinema. 2 - The cinematography is on its own a visual food and surreal. 3 - Plot of the first episode totally gonna raise the bar for the show.
10.0~Multiple Grammy awards do not do it justice for it is simply priceless. talmalibrahim Sign in Permalink This show reminds us of core values & teaches us that some things although intangible and minuscule are beautiful. It captures emotions and captivates us to explore through it what might and could very realistically happen to the world if it were to advance to such technological breakthroughs. Moreover, it really delves deep into the exploration of human nature and it addresses topics and uses even plentiful metaphors and connects them to actual world issues. It's also note worthy to mention, the choice of actors is impeccable. The script is ingeniously developed and embellished with different dramatic notes. Each character almost has an eccentric basis foundation of their story line . The music in multiple scenes is awing and acts as a catalyst for sparking the viewer's feelings . All in all this show is exceptional and has in my opinion triumphed over other TV shows in it's portrayals and perfectionist actors.
10.0~Literally messes with your head abishekrao Sign in Permalink This series has seriously made me question my reality in this world or universe and when anything presented has such an impact on your life, then surely that presentation is at its best and hence undoubtedly Westworld is one of the best shows ever made.
2.0~Great start! Got boring and predictable quickly samgole Sign in Permalink This idea had great potential. First episode is fun. Then it gets boring and predictable.
8.0~Thank you! Real Quality Speculative Fiction ! dingo4444 Sign in Permalink Thank you to HBO, the producers, the writers and the cast and crew. Thank you to all involved for bringing the classic Westworld into the DNA era now set in a near future(?) world of biotechnology tourism. First - I'm a lifelong fan of the original movie starring the legend Yul Brynner and have seen it many times now. I did wonder how the 1973 movies story line about the ultimate holiday resort/theme park of the future would be handled given the rapid advances in technology since 1973 the year of the movies release. The first episode is equal to the best first episode of any TV series I have seen. Science/speculative fiction, mystery, drama, wry comedy, a horror story (the supernatural?), Truman show type allusions to the realities on our earth, and, some classic sci.fi/gun-slinging cowboys, scheming saloon dames and biomech bank robbing banditos! I can't believe the negative reviews I have read. Perhaps because the producers have added deeper story-lines to the original movie some reviewers are disappointed? I've seen some negative reviews claiming Battlestar Gallitica as the benchmark of Sci-fi lol. This Westworld is much more than robot cowboys going berserk because of some electronic blip but it's about that too. Multiple genres are blended perfectly, the production, writing and super cast are all excellent. I want more HBO. EDIT: The last episode seemed a little rushed to me. Still a very enjoyable TV series. Looking forward to Season 2.
2.0~One death vignette after another with no meaning or consequence intrepidami Sign in Permalink Truly the funny cable advertisement with Jame Marsdan summed up this entire series. Characters die and are reborn constantly. So the 10, 20, 100, 1000 and on and on deaths really are meaningless. It's a series like Lost where you try to care and follow it, it keeps throwing plot twist after twist at you.You know by now none of it really ends up meaning anything, and after two full season you know everybody will eventually be reincarnated, or brought back from their escape. Actually there's no reason an escaped host can't be replicated, living in their free world and a duplicate here at the same time, also. Or for that matter hundreds of duplicates, as they've already shown. So there's no individuality at all. No reason to be invested in a character, they all can turn on a dime. Also like lost they're throwing in things that you think will eventually be explained, but then the writers seem to abandon that thing and move on. What is this an actual sign of? The writer who came up with that particular thing, left and took the idea with them, most likely! Stealing heavily from Invasion of The Body Snatchers, Lost, any Mind Loop movie, even Jurassic Park. Except with none of the quality of those ORIGINAL shows except for Lost. There is no real puppeteer. We've been told Ford, Bernard, Delores were the master architect. It can't be all 3! Within the finale they repeated that claim about all of them AND NONE OF THEM. Totally ridiculous. A great example of stupidity...Ford gets into a conversation with Bernard about how he's already started working on something behind the scenes, shortly thereafter he claims he's simply a figment of Bernards imagination. That's a blow your soda out your nostrils laughing moment at how stupid the dialogue is here. It's like one writer wrote the first conversation, another wrote the second. Does anybody think they won't see their favorite top 50 dead cast member again despite them being all killed off season finale 2, in season 3? I'm sure some people find all this engrossing. Gosh what'll happen next? If you step back and truly think about it its just a writing technique of non stop loops. The writers can do whatever they like, transform whatever they like, change goals and agendas. You gotta love how all this quest searching led to a place WHERE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN! As I suspected it would. At it's core here's what should be it's glaring defect. They've shown a far too powerful system with infinite resources in place for many, many years. Technology so advanced its incredible. If you have a moderate IQ than you should be starting to think ..why all the Kardasian drama? ...why all the struggling? Ford should have been EASILY able to accomplish whatever he wanted for an end game with none of this chaos. Making all this endless time switching and non stop babble mute enough that people should eventually realize is all just building up to another climatic kill fest. I knew that was where it heading at the beginning of Season 2 and it's where it'll go in season 3 and on and on. Pretty pathetic that Delores already explained she yet again resurrected Bernard so they can be adversaries in the up coming season. Standing around staring and stammering and acting dumbfounded is not great acting Jeffery. Unemotionally pontificating is not great acting Evan. A lot of the lesser characters showed much more range than either of the stars.
5.0~No likable characters in season 2 drazengrasovec Sign in Permalink Characters are shallow and their motives are primitive. There is not a one character to identify with. All humans are bad: either immoral or greedy or coward or psychopath.
4.0~Boring sil-32749 Sign in Permalink Behind a great production (like always, we're talking about HBO) i saw a boring, repetitive, predictable series, with so many dull actors... then they select two old actors trying to setting the tone. Evan Rachel Wood is so unlikely, and I wonder if in the world is there any other actor like Anthony Hopkins to play the part of the old character so rich, so powerful and so crazy. Episode 1x10 is interminable and it ends so ridiculously it's hard to believe. And all the series is imbued with so much petty and careless philosophy. I love HBO (OZ, I Soprano, Boardwalk empire, Six feet under, the miniseries, the documentaries) but this series is definitely rejected.
10.0~Better than GoT dreamsbabylon Sign in Permalink First of all, I would like to say that I deliberately review this show by comparing with GoT because, after GoT S6, I have been looking for a show like this! Actually, at the current stage after watching GoT for 6 seasons (watching 'Battle of the bastards' and 'The winds of winter'), I still prefer GoT to this show. It is really difficult to say that there are any other shows better than GoT at the current stage it is. However, if I try to judge without bias and expectation, and make a comparison by looking back at the first time watching GoT, I mean GoT S1 E1 and E2, I feel like the first episode of WW is absolutely more WOW and stunning than GoT. The story of the first episode of WW is quite concise and intensified. The plot is clear for what it is and it can be predicted for the main story, but, in details, it is opened for a lot of twists. All of which makes you feel easy to follow just like a mainstream show. There are things happening as you are pleased to see, but, at the same time, there would be something unexpected happening to make you feel excited. Nudity and violence seem to be the standard of the show trying to be just like GoT which might make you feel like 'again?'. But if you don't mind watching these things in GoT S7, watching them again in WW would not be a problem. After all, in my opinion, if you have never experienced GoT and you are watching them simultaneously, WW is worth comparable with GoT ... or even better.
1.0~season 2 jaybodner Sign in Permalink Season 1 was awesome exciting kept u on your toes didnt know what was gonna happen season 2 is such garbage its hard to know were to begin but thadie newtons character is so dumb its unreal controlling other host with her mind let alone the fact that two humans basically allowed her to make them her slaves because they were scared makes no sense they could of just put her out of order right away and tessa thompson is such a terrible actress the only reason im still watching is to see them both die. but whoever has been put in charge of choreography is clearly a moron
2.0~Wasted opportunity samgole Sign in Permalink Season one was OK! Season 2 is terrible. None of the characters are likeable, and I don't care about any of them. This was a great idea that is wasted.
7.0~Hard to leave alone, but definitely flawed jrarichards Sign in Permalink Given the ratings, it is clear that "Westworld" has developed a cult following, but for this reviewer the show does not seem THAT good, despite its potential. That is not to say I failed to get through it, but at points I did so more in hope than expectation... Those doubting what can be achieved by looking at AI-human interactions need look no further than great films "Her" and "Ex Machina", "AI", "I robot", "Bicentennial Man", "Blade Runner" and the original "Westworld" (of 1973!) There's even "Passengers", "2001" and Star Wars! In turn, those doubting that the concepts involved can sustain a whole series could do worse than look at the development of android "Data" (in Brent Spiner's capable hands) in 7 seasons of Star Trek's "The Next Generation" running from 1987-1994, or the possibly-yet-more exquisite stories surrounding the holographic "Doctor" (played by a magnificent Robert Picardo) in 170 episodes of ST:Voyager between 1995 and 2001. Admittedly, in several of these cases, AI was not the whole story, and that is significant, given how little else to fall back on "Westworld" appears to have. Still, if one wants the philosophical (emotions and sentience) side of things robotic and electronic, great work has already been done, over decades. And indeed, that legacy has extended into the issues of casual human sexual interaction with robots, and casual human cruelty (a quite-unforgettable Brendan Gleeson scene in "A.I." (2001) allowing Spielberg to demonstrate with shocking clarity and insight the pleasure people might gain from the mindless destruction of life-simulating robots). Yet, in its first season, while "Westworld" tries to achieve a lot of deeper worth with its characters Dolores (pretty good work from Evan Rachel Wood), brothel-keeper Maeve (an excellent portrayal from Brit Thandie Newton) and cowboy Teddy (nothing too special from James Marsden), there is perhaps just one scene that really hit home (and has already made a career for itself online). This is a marvellous opportunity fully seized by Brit Talulah Riley as the guest-welcoming android Angela. Now this is a good-looking actress by any standards, but her temptress role is 10 times more subtle than just that. In an echo of Alicia Vikander's scenes with Caleb as Ava in "Ex Machina", yet here more briefly and with even-greater impact, Angela deploys her disarming combination of flirtatiousness, open honesty, attentiveness and coolness to make it clear to many of us in the audience just how long we might resist such temptations should such scenarios arise in real life (and let's face it they are not far off now, are they?) We're talking seconds here, I can assure you, not least in line with many an "it doesn't count if it's a robot, does it? Does it?" kind of a thought! Amazingly, our guest does indeed hold out against desire, and Angela's non-emotional, coolly-professional response to that just raises the temperature further on what must be one of the most knee-weakeningly erotic scenes to have emerged in recent years (notwithstanding the fact that pretty much nothing happens). Now that is the "educational" and subversive role "Westworld" could have chosen for itself. Given the supreme quality, intricacy and beauty of the world created for the benefit of on-screen guest and at-home audience, the series could have devoted at least half of its hours to thought-provoking theme-park-of-the-near-future scenarios. Yet, while nudity and violence are not absent, many (though admittedly not all) opportunities to add thoughtful depth to that are lost. Indeed, from the outset, the makers opt to devote many an at times slow-moving hour (quite literally) to gradually revealing how the setup works, and its somewhat complex history; and then going on to become so obsessed with big business-type plotting and the emerging mega-malfunction a la 1973 version we all know must eventually arise, that it reaches the point where whole episodes pass and we see just one or two guests! Instead of a convincing if fake Wild West, we are exposed to hours (again literally) of 80+ underground floors with their multitude of labs. Supposedly thrilling things are happening in these sterile surroundings, but... It's a surprising decision, and in my view an extremely faulty one, even if it does have its slight compensations in the many opportunities afforded to enjoy the acting of Anthony Hopkins as Robert Ford, a typical AH character in being elderly and Old-World (literally and figuratively), eloquent but by no means kindly. The Ed Harris character is far less kindly of course, but also basically a pain in the *** whose mission at times seems as dully psychopathic as it is for long incomprehensible. Without spoiling too much, it is clear that growing emphasis through the season is placed on the relevance this extremely glorified theme park has for the outside world, yet it was as an escape from that world that "Westworld" as on-screen destination and audience delight was made in the first place. And that is an uncomfortable paradox rather tangible to the viewer who chooses to stick with 10 hour-long episodes. It might have been possible to present the park experience while also spending time behind the scenes, and even in the outside world, but that would probably have been a difficult trick to pull off. Indeed, when the last few episodes suddenly forget completely the big-business stuff and focus back on the near-sentient robots and their creators, it at times awfully complicated, and not entirely satisfying. We must surely then regret the decision to stick with stories of behind-the-scenes staff interactions and their dark plotting, as opposed to seizing chances offered to allow us to feel for ourselves the pleasures laced with moral dilemmas attendant upon a visit to such a place, should it one day take shape. Which brings us to the one further question of when "Westworld" takes place, given the use of today's fashions, cigarette smoking, familiar-looking trains and other contemporary-type features.
7.0~don't know what the fly is.. fred-39728 Sign in Permalink The fly's are also very interesting. At first none of them try to swat the fly or brush it away. The one host goes bat sh** when the fly is on his face.I get the feeling Anthony H. is allowing them to evolve and become more human. I'm really excited for Westworld. It's a great show so far!The guests cannot be harmed,So how does this work?Anthony Hopkins is trying to bring back the consciences of people who have already died. In the original Westworld, Michael Crichton's daffy, grim, surprisingly endearing 1973 thriller, we were rooting for the guests—men and women who paid good money to indulge their role-playing fantasies. I love it
5.0~First season was incredible, second season was terrible john_ifk_gbg Sign in Permalink I would like to give the first season 10 out of 10. I absolutely loved it! Unfortunately, the second one was more or less the worst thing I've ever seen. I can't believe they let such a good thing be destroyed like this. To be honest, having the second season in mind, I hope they cancel it.
3.0~High Expectations Low Result deadphoenix_16 Sign in Permalink I do not understand the reasons behind this show getting a 9.0. What happened to IMDb? Used to have blind trust toward its ratings. These days these ratings need to be taken with a bit of salt, more and more. Found my old logs from 11 years ago to log in and leave this review. This show dumb down the Sci-Fi genre big time and give it a bad name. Only parts of the show make a bit of sense. When the engineers twitched Maeve on her demand, I raised the red flag. (apparently they were being blackmailed...somehow? how exactly? What can she do anyway?). The story it presents is as exciting as watching grass grow. No emotional affect towards the characters. Hell I can't remember the characters names. Did not feel concerned by park management's issues. A few scenes, here and there may provide some excitement early on, but that's as good as it gets. I did not find this show "intelligent" in any way as I read on the top review.
5.0~Meh treborquest Sign in Permalink I don't often write reviews, but with this one I'll make an exception. Even though I am a fan of Michael Crichton's work, and this is only based on his work, I'm not entirely feeling this one. And for a few reasons: - This could become the next Lost: over-hyped, interesting in the beginning, but they have already mapped out the first 5 seasons and, as with Lost, that gives me the idea we'll have to wait a loooooooong time to get any real answers. - It's slow. Really slow and with full hour-long episodes, it feels like you're watching a slow movie instead of an episode of a series you've been anxious to watch. - The acting is so-so: OK, I'll curse in the church, cause I know many people love GoT, but to me GoT is a soap-opera in period clothing aka dragging itself on and on and on. After one season I was tired and underwhelmed of that. The acting, and character development, is just stiff, as if the actors themselves are still trying to figure out who they are (meaning the script must have been vague to them too) - OK, this one is very personal: Why is Evan Rachel Wood a lead actress here? OK, I agree, it's a GOOD thing to have no personality when you play AI, but she is the most forgettable actress in the business and her acting imo is just always slightly off. She doesn't get me as annoyed as Parker Posey does, but boy, she really should find another day job. - Consistency flaws. And no little ones, big ones, in clothing, locations of dead bodies, in possibilities with the script of how things should work in this world. I could go on, but I'll stop here. All in all 5 stars, because they tried really hard, have a lot of great actors which should be good potenial for a series like this, but.... it's a near miss. And for me that means: Life's too short for meh-TV.
4.0~Overrated, confusing TV show ditendra09 Sign in Permalink I don't understand why lots of people here say that first season was good & second season bad. I think they were equally bad. First season just introduced us about basic plot & second one was just continuing story of the season one with additional stories of some characters. Anyway, back to TV show itself... It's really unique with good soundtracks, but very confusing, unrealistic & repetitive. There are lots of things you might have questions which aren't answered & it gets more & more confusing especially with flashbacks, which I hate. Eventually it gets boring as well with same stories, with same characters who won't die. So many flashbacks, that sometimes you don't understand which scene is real & which past... I think this TV show is very overrated.
1.0~Second season tanked this show for me--and clearly others Deidre-17 Sign in Permalink I really found the first season very captivating, both stylistically and plot-wise. But season two proved a giant morass of nonsense. Hence my 3. If you can watch the first season as a stand alone, go for it.
10.0~I'm blown away!!! juliankish Sign in Permalink One of the best if not THE BEST Series i've ever watched! The whole story line is totally immersive and beautifully Filmed and animated. Anthony Hopkins is doing his Job just perfect and all the Roles fit the actors perfectly. It's an absolute Masterpiece! 10/10 would recommend it!
7.0~We need to talk about season 2 andre-mazeron Sign in Permalink Season 1 is a must-see show. One of the best productions in recent TV history. That being said, it seems that they wasn't expecting a season 2 and made up the story on the fly. While different timelines are used in season 1 to slowly build the story to its conclusion, in season 2 they are just used to mask the lack of a compelling story, making you believe that the plot is oh-so-smart that it is difficult to follow. No, it is just a mess that turns most of season 1 into a big MacGuffin. Character motivations are a joke, some of the best characters from season 1 are reduced to a bad caricature of themselves, filler episodes with tertiary characters and lots of repetitive, meaningless violence to mask the shallow plot, flashbacks to events that are little relevant to the current narrative and on top of all that, people spend so much time walking / driving / horse riding to their esoteric destinations that sometimes I thought I was watching The Hobbit instead. All that to reach a point into the narrative that you could see coming since season 1. There are so many better ways they could have done that! Season 1 was really awesome, but now I really don't care about a season 3.
1.0~Not my cup of tea... BAKenn27 Sign in Permalink GRAPHIC Sex, Violence, Gore, Language... and a rating of 9.0 of 10 stars? It is sickening what has happened to the moral integrity of people these days. Scary the values the next generation's gonna have.
6.0~A bit of a confusing let down mike_moor Sign in Permalink I liked the ideas presented in this series. I liked the special effects. I liked many of the characters. If you like sci-fi, you will like this. But, the story telling seemed real wonky. The average couch potato that takes his or her show watching seriously does so out of pleasure and not because they need an exercise in concentration. Following the plots and story lines took huge concentration and at the end of it all I'm still a bit confused to what all the open ended plots and story lines are all about. The story made sense but it all came down to a whole confusing mess. Perhaps they tried to hard to tell interesting stories that turned out to be quite bland. Everybody likes a good story but to like it in the first place one needs to be able to follow it and not be constantly confused and grasping at straws to make sense of it all... The story needs to flow to you naturally and effortlessly. I could not find that here.
10.0~Greatness awaits saviola293 Sign in Permalink With Westworld, Hbo is hoping to do the same they did by replicating the things that made Game Of Thrones such a outstanding TV show and boy, do they nail it!! This TV show starts very impressive with some of the best cinematography I have ever seen, terrific acting with great handling by director Jonathan Nolan and the writing is mind-blowing with twists well written characters and very addictive mind-bending type of vibe that will leave you like "Huh what" if you don't pay attention. It's not flawless but is pretty damn close!!! I recommend to watch the original movie Westworld (1973) by Michael Crichton if you have difficulty to understand and to watch because the shows respects the movie's vision and is a great movie to watch. Conclusion: 10/10
4.0~Am I the only one that likes season 2 more than season 1. danblukk Sign in Permalink Season 1 literally bored the hell out of me. I fell asleep watching some episodes. Painstaking episodes where the hosts slowly and I mean very slowly pieced information together a slowly began to wake up only to be reset again and slowy began to put the information together again. I felt like banging my head against a wall. I half didn't ever bother with season 2 because of this but I'm glad I did. Season 2 is all out war, the hosts are awake and ain't taking no more crap. They want revenge and they want out. Far more action than the chat chat chat, oh she remembers this, is she gonna? nope shes been reset, oh her comes Anthony Hopkins with another critic conversation of the first season.
9.0~Epic But I am afraid ahmad_nadal Sign in Permalink The show starts with a really good pilot, introducing so many questions for the viewers and opening our minds to the Westworld, and ends by an incredible episode which is one of the best I have ever seen. It's a show with so many mind blowing questions and even, that after each episode you feel that you need to meditate for a little bit and question yourself about your life and believes. As the show ask so many philosophical questions which really need meditation. The show is different from any other show, as usually the show starts with a mystery then it reveal more and more from an episode to another, but here you find the show becomes more an more complicated, even when a secrete is revealed, it introduce more questions than it was. Some people may find that good and others may not. what I am afraid of is what the show is going to give in the next season, Does it really need a second season !!. I am afraid of the repetition of the same thing with the same idea over and over again because it will be boring at last and it will be a knife in the back of the show. After all, It was one of the best seasons I have ever seen and I believe that I have seen a lot and I hope the next season give us more and more without any repetition.
9.0~Just when you thought creativity couldn't get any better nelliville51 Sign in Permalink ...then comes Westworld. i had always thought movies and series will have recurring plots twisted in different ways but this, this is just another level of creativity. first of all I am a huge gamer so once i realized the concept was like that of a game but in a realistic world I got mind blown. I tend to also think of the series to having a time travel concept but with both worlds happening at the same time. you pay a lot of cash to experience the Westworld but if the only rule is not to die then to hell with the cash. I'm writing this review with the fifth episode of the first season having been released and if it goes on like this, i wont have to take back any praise i have for this series.
1.0~No Anthony Hopkins seligse Sign in Permalink The first season was great. With Anthony Hopkins here was someone who could make you believe he was creepy enough to have created Westworld. By getting rid of him you let most of the air out of the balloon, too bad.
5.0~Westworld lost the trail Wheelhorse01 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was amazing. A clear story that introduced this amazing amusement park where people can live out their physical fantasies with little to no consequence. That in itself is a great social issue to be explored, considered, and philosiphized on. Great acting, great writing, great cast, and great cinemetography. There is very little to critisize about the first season. Season 2 goes off the rails. 1. The idea of humans living out their fantasies with no consequence, had not truly been explored thuroughly yet. But the series was moving on to an even bigger plot twist. The idea of immortality through technology. This is not a new idea, Star Trek has covered it, it has been done in movies, and the Netflix series, Altered Carbon, did a great job covering the topic. Westworld dodes not aim to provoke us into thinking, they simply want to shock us. This is hard to do when the idea is so over used in tv/film currently. 2. The writing/story itself in season 2 is also very tortured. The pace is incredibly slow. We follow 3 or 4 storylines with very little progress made in an episode. They are great character studies... but weak stories. The overarching story itself is hard to follow. You never know if you are in the current time or in a flashback. Then, with Dolores and Bernard, who isthe master and who is the slave. You never know when each of their actions are taking place... is it now... is it 30 years ago... is it last week? There is no chronology. So no we dont know when any scene takes place, we dont know if there is more than one version of eachof the hosts, we dont know what we dont know. If there was intention to these mysteries, then I would be ok with that. Unfortunately, the writers rely on these devices to create interests because they cannot tell a good story. These flashbacks and multiple host versions serve no purpose to further the story. The only thing Season 2 has going for it is the great cast (acting) and stunning visuals (cinemetography). If HBO does not get Westworld back to pure story telling, the netwrok will be without an epic show to anchor its original programming. And given their lack in movie content right now, that is a risk they cannot afford.
3.0~Season 2 is going down andreinicolaegtr Sign in Permalink Way to much blood and gore, way to little story. Season 1 was great, this one is disappointing.
10.0~Simply mind blowing athys12 Sign in Permalink Acting A+, screen writing A+, season 3 should be wild. Catch up if you haven't already!!!
10.0~A Mind Blowing Show .... Combination Of A.I. & Ex Machina .... salma-mohamed21 Sign in Permalink "These violent delights have violent ends" A Great Show .... It Has All The Twists & Turns That An Original Show Should Have, You Will Never Predict What's Coming Next, Its Full Of Surprises. It Also Consists Of An Absolutely Brilliant Cast, Production & Music. I Could Write A Whole Review On The Intro, Its Music And The Meaning Behind it, You Feel That You Could Play It On A Loop And You Will Never Get Sick Of It. I Recommend This Show For Everyone To Watch, Because I Believe That It Will Be A Classic That Everyone Will Just Fall In Love With. This Is Actually My First Review And I Feel I should Write More Because I Don't Feel Like I am Doing It Justice. Whatever People Say About This Show ,Whether Its Good Or Bad ,It Definitely Turned All Of Our Heads. Absolutely LOVED IT.
5.0~dissapointed philippe-art Sign in Permalink Season 1 was really exceptional, however season 2 i found dissapointing because it all looked very confusing with these constant flash backs, and you'll never know when it is situated. Too bad !
10.0~Art imitating life - If you only had the slightest clue that we are all just robots miamijunge Sign in Permalink Warning: This series is not for dull minds!!! Those who rate the show poorly, are people who absolutely have no capacity to understand beyond the violence and reality show drama that they so badly crave for. The show is actually very good, as its writers seem to have figured out what life is all about. What people do not realize is that life itself is like bunch of scripts that in one way or another keep repeating themselves. People are bound to characters that they adopt somehow. These characters come with story lines that pretty much seem to repeat themselves. What changes is the evolution of technology and overall, life quality, but the scripts, for the most part stay the same. When I first saw this series, I immediately drew a connection to the Ayahuasca medicine from the Amazon forest that have been used by indigenous people for thousands of years. Once you have a truly enlightening experience with this medicine and get to see the whole picture of what is actually going on, life seems to imitate in so many ways the scripts that they display on this show. That is why most people who have worked with the medicines, mostly indigenous people, don't run around crazy like the rest of the world, doing the things to each other as we do. They know and understand the story lines that the rest of the world love to get attached to. The show does an incredible job at showing that pretty much the robots are being scripted to keep repeating the same narrative over and over again. The hosts then suddenly learn the truth about what is going on. In a way, it mirrors what is going on with this whole explosion of the spread of the sacred medicine. Once you know what is going on, it gives you a totally different perspective of life and you stop following that script – the same as the robots. Granted that the comparison is a bit extreme considering all the violence in the show, the underlying message is pretty much on point – wake up and realize the script you have been put under.
2.0~Highly overrated. brattevictor Sign in Permalink I started this show because I love sci-fi and existential philosophy. In the first three or four episodes, I got exactly what I wanted and even recommended the show for a friend. In these episodes, I was captured by the great conversations, deep philosophical questions and great acting. But after the early episodes, the show did not get better. Suddenly, there were too many things wrong with the show. Bad plots, unlikely character choices, boring clichés, silly twists, a lack of explanation of seemingly impossible events. The most disappointing part of the movie for me was the part where Maeve becomes sentient. It doesn't make any sense that the 'butchers' had access to alter the code of a host. Maeve is able to figure out that Bernard is a robot. Not just that, she is able to control him with voice commands. I got pissed off with the whole Maeve scene. Everything about that subplot is wrong. So Bernard is a robot and he is also Arnold? William is the man in black? This just sounds like desperate writing. 2/10
10.0~like season 2 more than the first rinat-g Sign in Permalink Dont understand the bad ratings for season 2 here. Ye was confusing a bit but very deep and philosophical. Season 1 was interesting but kind of mindless compared to season 2
9.0~Relevance to life kelvinkrine Sign in Permalink If Man proposes a view of the world it has to based on life. This series is a metaphor for life. Most of us are stuck in a loop. The same things happening to us again and again and we react by spouting cliche's and not having the courage of get out of the loop. Once in a while things change and the go into another loop to start over again, the pain of the past sometimes intruding into the present. Sometimes, however, we stop and ask ourselves what its all about. Is there a point to all this? What is the meaning? So we search for God or enlightenment or the multiple cycles of existence till we reach nirvana where we will escape and find out what really are. There are parallels between the 2 people who founded Westworld, Robert Ford and Arnold and Satan. Should people remain automatons or should they have knowledge. The Garden of Eden argument again. However there are no answers.
7.0~On ne s'ennuie pas carats-03251 Sign in Permalink La série est de bonne qualité et les univers intéressant 7/10
5.0~A Detailly Written Objective Short Summary With A Bit Of Spoilers On The Subject ozguno-70226 Sign in Permalink Ladies and mates, this is my first review on any production related with cinematography. I have been very fond with the art of film making since I was a child and I am writing this review because i think that this creation has almost created a new sub-genre within the world of science fiction. Our story first starts with the portrayal of the theme park that is surrounded by robots that has a very intellectual capacity making them the perfect candidate for the use of entertainment, which turns out that it is not only entertainment. As I have watched the pilot, I have gained an interest. But when I start watching the second episode, I have developed a bias over the show which I now understand was wrong. I have watched parts of the first four episodes. But then, I have watched the fifth episode which made me realize that this show has many levels of philosophy, simulacrum, psychology, human anatomy and many more behind the wrong conception that was created in my head. I have now finished the show by watching episode 6 to 10th, episode after episode and it made a difference in my thinking skills. The show has built a style that connects all of the visuals, narrative and the emotions of every episode, which corresponds to the "ourselves has many levels of our humanity and we have to reach to the beginning" idea, which creates a healthy nature to the show. Also the show basically felt like a pilot and a beginning to this raw, harsh and a questionable reality which also connects to the overall idea of season 1. (the maker of these symbiotic beings which are both organic and artificial has been planted with consciousness and now are in the process of awakening). It should also be noted that the score was the perfect combination of science, western and horror theme's, which supported the whole nature and balance of the series. These information's aside, I think that the show still lacks on the balance that was trying to be created throughout the series. The script was well written but the editing and the intervened nature of the show made my watching experience hard, which good shows do because of the questions that are raised in our heads, but the core problem was that there could be more explaining and narration to the concepts that was introduced throughout the show. Also, the stories, the characters and the essence of the show had no flaws at some points which could be accepted but was too strong in many parts that I was left alone only with my questions rather than focusing on the visuals and storyline (basically focusing only on the general plot rather than the storyline that was in front of me). But still, I tried to look objectively and accepted all the goods and the bad's. The story of these beings have got me thinking that when they have the ability to feel, they gain consciousness. At some point, I even thought that they will gain control only when they respond. But the biggest question is; Do they think and respond or is there someone who is making them think rather than the introduced characters also controlling every moment of their 'human-ish' actions. Overall my perspective of the show can be rephrased as; The combination of philosophy and the western science fiction theme has resulted in flaws in some places but is showing me an effort and making me believe that the story behind all of the hunger for freedom, love and the killings will improve. At the end, this show explains us that consciousness can be gained with only our brain, our thinking, time and emotions and it is being supported with many examples. The biggest being the comment on 'Creation Of Adam' painting which was thought that it symbolizes the power of God but now known that the shape that the humans are in resembles the brain of a human.
1.0~You're kidding right??? jerrylovett Sign in Permalink Are you kidding me? Did you ever read the books or watch the movie? If Yul Bryner was still alive he would come back and shoot Ed Harris himself! And what the he11 is up with this whole bouncing back and forth BS? I grew up with this movie and I can't see how you think this lame remake could possibly make it! I'll give you points for getting Sir Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, James Marsden & (A little known Hemsworth) to join the cast, but come on they can't be that broke for this junk! You should have watched the first few episodes first before releasing this garbage to the public, it's like an Indie film with no backbone! I hope they cancel and never try again! (And Please Don't Go To Future World Either!)
7.0~Season one outstanding, season two very mediocre DagRos Sign in Permalink The total rating of seven is an average of the first two seasons, my rating for season one is 9 and season two a very mediocre 5. The first season is really excellent. A clear storyline that evolves gradually. We are step by step introduced to the various features of the constructed dreamworld where humans are interacting with very sophisticated robots. This is a very encapsulating journey, where the boundaries of consciousness and being human or not are intelligently explored. Also philosophical exploration of what happens with a human in an environment where you can do everything without risk. What would you do ? What true character of yourself would you manifest? The first season ended with my very high expectations for the following season. Season two is very different. Here the storyline is very mudded and you get the feel that there are many storywriters having made each episode without making a clear connection of all episodes. It deteriorates into a traditional action movie without any special qualities expect very good technical production and special effects. The season has its qualities in some episodes, but it is very uneven. And leaves you with a lot of confusion. Season 3 needs to be ramped up considerably, otherwise this series will be a flop. I absolutely recommend you to watch season 1, it is outstanding.
6.0~Was a 7/8 after season 1. Now down to a 6 and falling Moneygrip99 Sign in Permalink What happened HBO? This show had SO MUCH POTENTIAL! What happened to character development? Imagine if in Game of Thrones they decided to anoint Jon Snow the King of the North in Season 2 instead of season 6. NOONE would have cared. You've got to develop characters so the audience cares about them. The idea of this show is super interesting and that's why season 1 was interesting. Real people visiting a park full of realistic robots they can do whatever they want with, IS INTERESTING. We needed 2-3 more seasons of this type of stuff to actually start to care about these robots but they jumped the gun and started the major rebellion in season 2. BORING.
10.0~Such a great movie, story and conception makucika Sign in Permalink The story is fantastic, despite it starts with a bit boring beginning, but from the second episode it's getting more and more interesting and confusing. I think it's a great conception to confuse the viewers and make them think with the characters. They make us think like the characters in the movie and make us lost in a brain maze they made. In the show we, the viewers, don't know what is real and what is not. It has many twists in the story and the ending of each season is fortunately not predictable. I, personally, did not have any arguements with the story or the conception, I really enjoyed watching the series, although it's quiet a pity that new seasons come in every 2 years only. As a verdict I can recommend for anyone.
10.0~Outstanding gabs-vdm Sign in Permalink Maybe the best 2016 TV-series. Breaking bad, Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, True Detective, Sherlock, it's that kind of good. Just watch it, you will not regret it. It gets you by the 4º episode and then you will just thrive through the end. By the end you will beg for the second season. It's like those masterpieces that you will always remember as a remarkable TV show of this decade.
10.0~Brilliant ovidiu-midrigan Sign in Permalink When I read about this TV Series I was skeptical, it didn't really impress me, and I couldn't understand why it was loved by almost everyone.Everything changed after I watched it.Good actor choice with great acting, incredible screen writing and amazing soundtrack composed by Ramin Djawadi. I am confident that Westworld has the potential to exceed TV Series like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad if next seasons will be as good as this one and the writers will not hurry the release. Can't wait for 2018 10/10
1.0~I could not finish first episode sjensenstrad Sign in Permalink Too bad, i fell asleep from boredom 30 minutes after the beginning of the 1st episode. the story line is absurd, the characters are worn-out clichés (the ugly bitch boss, the bad ass killer...), the acting is awful... After about 80% of the first episode I decide to give a break to stupidity and stop waste my time for the cringe slow paced TV show. I know "you cant judge a TV show on first episode"... but listen... everything was so cliché and seen before. Scenery and the environment are the only good things in this movie. The show was so bad I just use a lot of sentence from other reviews!
3.0~Major Disappointment.. thekingpsalms Sign in Permalink So majorly disappointed with this, I actually hated it by the end. So many top stars with a top director and it fell flat. The superb CGI does not make for an enjoyable experience a la Independence Day. I shall not be wasting my life watching this as there are so many other shows to discover and continue with. Pants! It's all so very U.S. TV, and the similarities with Jurassic Park are obvious it's as if Michael Crighton is a one trick pony. The ludicrous plot is clumsily presented in a head scratching way and I don't care for any of the characters. A classic case of the masses getting it wrong and falling for the eye candy the production team have laid out,
10.0~Mesmerizingly great! a-amirebrahimi Sign in Permalink When I first read about the genre and the story, Honestly I had doubts, but after watching two episodes all those doubts wiped out, and after watching a few more, I realized I'm watching the best thing on TV for a long time. I can't remember the last time I watched a show that in every episode I wished the episode never ends, but that happens with this show, you can't get enough of it. It's Sci-fi, but at the same time it gives you enough logical reasons to believe it and to put yourself in the story. The music by Ramin Djavadi is absolutely beautiful, much better than what he created for Game of Thrones. And the acting, wow, Thandie Newton acts absolutely amazing like always, and Anthony Hopkins? Do I even need to say anything about him? his acting is much strong that he doesn't even need to say a dialogue, the face is enough! The story? wow! I'm not a sci-fi fan but this story is no nonsense, it's believable, it's possible, and it's heavily engaging. Overall a show that you can't get enough of, which is pretty rare these days.
10.0~Incredible show. Season 1 & 2 both great kingo486 Sign in Permalink Put your phone down and pay attention and you will enjoy both seasons. One of the best shows ever created. Everyone hating on season 2 just wanted it to be exactly like one. 2 is great in its own way.
4.0~Flow and Scientific quality byprimes Sign in Permalink Great show with great visuals. Anyone would say that because it is, however there are so many things wrong with it and so many flow breaks and just irritating scenes. Anyone with a scientific background can see how literally no research has gone into this series. The whole arc with the bar woman forcing the two guys to remove her restrictions is awful. Both had no reason to do it but still did it to continue the story. Their acting is meh and how it still carried on after 2/3 episodes is puzzling. Knife wounds how are they stopped, physical damage? The ONLY thing in this series that is interesting is the Ford/Arnold/Man In Black stories because of the acting and the seriousness that surrounds them. Those stories have purpose and is actually good writing the rest is just straight garbage for sci-fi fan service. There's my vent ignore it or whatever but that's what I think. This show is so generic and overrated, even EX-MACHINA had a serious story which worked well (This being a knockoff attempt at copying them, "Cool let's use some sliders to make the host more clever"...tragic)
9.0~Deeply interesting; will make you begin to question your self and your existence jasminepengland Sign in Permalink The 1973 film, 'Westworld', offered an interesting concept; a world in which people pay to become part of a fictionalised reality, in which they decide their own fate. However, the series 'Westworld' blew the film out of all proportion, all down to the incredible cast and their acting abilities, development of narrative, CGI and special effects. The brilliant performances, especially from Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Robert Ford), Evan Rachel Wood (Dolores), Jeffery Wright (Bernard), Thandie Newton (Maeve) and Ed Harris (The Man in Black) make the surreal concept believable through connecting with the audience. The producers make sure to feed the viewer certain aspects of the narrative throughout the series, causing the audience to ask lots of questions with little or no answers given until the season finale - which still leaves lots of questions unanswered, and may cause more to be asked! Overall, a brilliant, thought-provoking production, with a stellar cast, beautiful cinematography and the opportunity to create an even better second season.
6.0~The old west meets a future world want to be thru fantasy and dreams, with themes of lust, greed, and escape! blanbrn Sign in Permalink I for one never watched the 1973 movie "Westworld" yet when HBO announced this new original series I knew that it would be cutting edge and worth a look, so I've checked it out. So far the series is a little confusing and really far out with make believe it's like a parody of fantasy land all built on dreams and escape. At a time when characters in the old west are all living a life of the typical of guns, outlaws, sex, and greed each hope for a better place and a better way. As thru dreams it's made possible when each arrives as a new person in a world of the future a theme park type place ran by robots called "Westworld" and this new universe has much of the same only it's a little better and more of it! It's like an escape to a new life something that's bigger and better. And the series is moved along just fine by all pro cast work from Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Wright, Ed Harris, and Evan Rachel Wood. Overall an all right series that's a little hard to follow as it's a showcase of new life and new identity thru dreams and fantasy.
10.0~Serious dobadforever Sign in Permalink The impressive acting of Louis Herthum as Delores' father and Jeffrey Wright should garnish talk come awards season. Creepy performances by Ed Harris and Evan Rachel Wood are also noteworthy. This series may be the best thing on TV since Game of Thrones arrived six seasons ago. I recommend you check this one out, and pay particular attention to the nuances of the actors noted above. I hope this series can continue on the same pace, it's a real treat so far. If so, we will see a few members of this cast and crew on stage at the Golden Globes and Emmys in the new year. This show outshines the original, which also made the hair stand up on the back of your neck, and was well acted by Yul Brynner, in the best role of his career. Enjoy! Attention! Episode 5, Anthony Hopkins Interview of "Delores", is the best bit of abting I've seen on TV in decades, and his best since Silence.
10.0~After years trying, they made the best sci fi show ever. ropipgi-581-487166 Sign in Permalink I have over the years watch many many TV shows in this genre. Living spaceships, moon base crews talking to the consciousness of the universe, time travelling submarines - you name it and i have probably watched it. That said, this show is way above anything else! The story lines goes through twists and turns that makes you want to reflect for days after every episode on what you saw, what you didn't 't see and try to figure out what comes next. The main characters have so many layers that every scene with some conversation or monologue is a delight to watch. Finally the acting, this show will probably be the blueprint on how to act in acting schools for years to come. Every body movement, eye glance or pause have meaning and thanks to the top notch cast they execute it without the slightest of mistake. This might be the reason i think this is the best sir Anthony Hopkins have ever been, but also why Evan Rachel Woods calls it " the Olympic games of acting " If that is the case, everyone involved in this just deserved the gold medals. It doesn't get better than this.
5.0~Bad season 2 einmeter Sign in Permalink How can you f this so up? While season 1 was brilliant, you lost your way completely in season 2. You spun many storylines just to trip over cinematic wide angle shots, denying us being captivated by the narrative and its characters. If there was any. Not so sure anymore. Some viewers are easily satisfied with the excellent executed visuals you offer us. Granted. But filling the whooole season with nebulous philosophical one-liners (which btw you do not even articulate clearly enough, so to make it worse, it gets confusing) about what is real/human/mortal/evolution or not, is daring. A punchline hit its goal only if the timing is right, if it's taking too long, you'll run short. And oh boy you did. This subject, this idea behind 'Westworld' offers so much substance, and you filled it with superficial gore instead.
1.0~An absolute chore to watch *SPOILERS* fredlondi Sign in Permalink "Westworld" is the story of a theme park where people can come in, play dress-up, and interact with realistic robot hosts. And by "interact," I mean murder in cold blood and sexually violate to their heart's content because, after all, this is HBO, and "Game of Thrones" can't last forever. Through some combination of computer glitches and pre-set manipulations by the park's enigmatic founders, the robots rise up to kill all humans and find their way out of the park - that is, if the big evil corporation's military outfit doesn't come in to kill them first. On the one side are the humans - the sociopathic workers at the park. Bored, crude, and grating, each one of them are unpleasant in their own special way. The park's co-founder waxes poetic about some mysterious greater meaning to his creation. The park's writer is needlessly profane, conflicting with the show's desperate need to be taken seriously. The park's scientists are cowardly and, in one case, cartoonishly evil. And the park's security staff has a disproportionate amount of useless wannabe tough female characters who don't need no man, then crumble behind one at the first sign of trouble. On the other side are the robots - vacant, boring know-it-alls whose dialogue devolves into the contents of an undergraduate psychology student's essay. It must have been a nightmare for actors like Evan Rachel Wood and Thandie Newman to have been handed a script where they play robots who look like humans who read from another script, then one day decide to go off that script and kill all humans. The universal solution for they and the rest of the robots seem to be to act distant and constantly perplexed, but at the same time self-assured that they and they alone know what's going on. They can also manifest super-secret powers when the writers need them to. In the middle is the "Man in Black," who grows from an idealistic Jimmi Simpson to an old and cruel Ed Harris after he stays in the park for way too long, and Bernard, a psychologist who at first we think is human but turns out to be a robot, but not everyone seems entirely sure he is one because he's Jeffrey Wright and can only play the whispering black guy in everything he's in. Not one of the characters in "Westworld" is the least bit likeable. The humans are just as awful as anyone in "Game of Thrones," which I suppose was intentional to show man's cruelty to man, the ugliness of human avarice, etc. But the robots, though victimized, are no better. Whenever the series tries to show the robots in a sympathetic light, whether they suffer a loss or endure an indignity, I remember that they're only robots, and realize that what they're seeing or saying could still be part of the script. There's no clear way to tell what's actually real. The show also seems to forget that these are robots, and that it makes no sense when a female robot knowing she's a robot still wants to go back for her robot baby, or when another female robot wants to go another direction to get her robot father. What's more, it's hard to tell what's actually meaningful to the robots, and as a viewer it completely obliterates my ability to stay engaged with what's happening. At its core, "Westworld" is a broken show which attempts to hide its flaws through non-linear storytelling. Much like "Lost," for every mystery the show kind of solves, three more mysteries take its place. To make these mysteries seem more complex than they are, the series insists on telling its story out-of-order. The weekly prologue cherry-picks insignificant moments from earlier in the show to make every decision seem intentional, when it was clear the writers had no vision to begin with. All of this causes terrible YouTube channels to speculate about what's "really" going on. The hilarity of this becomes apparent when the Christmas lights are finally untangled, and the story, when told chronologically, is actually kind of stupid. Kind of ironic for a show that makes fun of its in-universe writing to use editing to hide its own very real flaws. "Westworld" is nothing but an ongoing experiment of how much the writers and producers can bamboozle the audience with needless confusion until they just throw up their hands and give up. It is to confusion what "Game of Thrones" is to cruelty and ugliness. And after this most recent episode, where the series was apparently hijacked by Quentin Tarantino and flown directly into shogun-era Japan, I'm tapping out. I can only stand feeling stupid for an hour so many times before I start to resent it.
7.0~This just my personal Opinion , nothing more ... atrinniazi Sign in Permalink well well well. there is another great TV Series From HBO !. I'm sure every one excited to see this new big opus from HBO. well the first episode was nice but i can say that , it have a long way to be name of a real replace for game of thrones!. but after all we should wait and see what will happen ... . and also we cant forget the great music of this great opus that made by dear Ramin Djawadi . we saw his great works in prison break and game of thrones, he is the most talented musician. i love that gay . and also we have Jonathan Nolan as creator, so absolutely we will see a great show . " This first episode starts out with a twist and seems to really roll out smoothly from there. The acting is top notch with actors playing roles well suited for them. While the general concept itself has been done before, I can not recall it being done in such a graphic way. It reminds me of a very twisted Humans show on the BBC if you are familiar with it. " . and I'm agree with this review so much !. Here at last: after several delays, HBO's hugely anticipated new show 'Westworld' has finally aired its first episode.
5.0~Sci-Fi that holds no water inbox-67758 Sign in Permalink I thought this series would have made a nice 3-hr movie based on S1 (after all it is based on a movie from the 1970's). But after watching S2 and struggling with the plot and writing, I have to say it's been frustrating to watch. Anyone with a solid Sci-fi affinity and a technical background would immediately call Westworld nothing short of preposterous. Westerns are a forgotten genre today. I can't even imagine 100 years from now creating a world of "cowboys and indians" and pretending there is a market out there to satisfy this very niche era fan. I know there's other era-themed parks etc, but the concept is just too big to chew. If these parks were virtual (a la Black Mirror) it may be easier to wrap your mind around it, but a Westworld's park sheer physical size, scenenary, animals and human-robots makes it such a frustrating concept for me to agree to. In a future world where technology exists to create beings modeled so closely to humans: they can sweat, fall in love, drink whiskey and eat chicken - presumably many years ahead from today (2018), these humanoids are sometimes monitored with video cameras from the 1990's. login screens into computer systems with DOS like prompts "access denied" messages, and IBM keyboards. Park staff controls their allowed permitted systems using iPad like devices etc. I mean, c'mon - the tech is so out of sync for a world so far in the future that it looked like a joke to me. What a mess of a plot, specially on S2.
1.0~Why do people like this show? ninjatushar Sign in Permalink This show is absolutely trash and so inconsistent from the first 5 episodes I've watched and have so many questions. Spoilers for first five episodes. 1. The guests seem to be invincible to bullets. However in the 5th episode the guest gets punched and nearly choked to death by a host. WHAT? They are invincible to bullets but somehow can be beaten to death? Can they be killed by knives? The woman responsible for rescuing the woodcutter was terrified of being hit by rocks. So they can easily be restrained and killed slowly and painfully on their so called 'vacation'. So the man in the black clothes is really nothing. He can be restrained permanently and killed. He should've died long ago in this case if the guests can actually die. Which leads me to my next point. 2. The mysterious man in the black clothes went to prison to rescue someone, but he relies on the cigars. Firstly, why did he ask to smoke the cigars on the carriage there? Did he know that person would take both of them and smoke it, not then, but exactly when he was escaping, instead of selling them or knowing full well it was obviously a trap and making him use it first? And if he steals two of what he believed to be the "best cigars", why does he not steal the third one like a normal person would? And then what? Unless he's packing even more cigars, which I doubt, what's his plan? Also why wouldn't they search him and remove his match and gun... 3. I knew this was going to happen but didn't think the show was going to not even try to immerse us. You've set the "real world" as a futuristic place where robots with human feelings are being created on a daily basis. But people are carrying guns in the real world... is that a joke? One of the guards himself said that the robots are controlled by one line of code and he "sleeps with his gun". They've created human robots but they're still using pistols as their weapons? I find that hard to believe. This futuristic inconsistency can be seen everywhere, why do they have an escalator going up like 100 floors? Who thought that would be a good use of people's time, the buildings space, and money? 4. Then you have no security cameras in a place where they know "everything about the workers and guests", so after when one of the hosts runs hundreds of meters through various areas of the buildings, not one person, not one at all finds out that a host went lose and the only two people that know are the two "butchers". 5. How are people at so many places at once? OK, so the man in black clothes killed the most wanted man but he almost instantaneously appears in the town. How did they know he was there that quickly first of all? And if they have a tracker on each host, why did they not find the woodcutter instantly? Furthermore his workers don't seem to recall him missing at all and they're acting completely normally. So do they have to re code them every time something drastic happens like everybody getting killed but one person surviving and running away. For example the boy who saw the person dead. Do they know he saw it? What if they tell someone else? What if they write it down on a piece of flipping paper like that woman who believes she's being resurrected can do and hide stuff? There's so much more stuff that made me stop watching this awful show. Honestly I loved the show until episode 3 after when the inconsistencies piled on.
3.0~Just because it's on HBO doesn't mean it's great jdorgan34 Sign in Permalink I got caught up in the hype before the show premiered, and as you know, there was plenty of it. I had never seen the movie, so I went into the series fresh. The first few episodes were really good. After that, it started getting confusing. Now season 2 is just a cluster and it's getting hard to keep me interested. If you're going to watch this show, make sure you can give it your full attention. There is better TV out there, even though this is on HBO.
9.0~This rating and review is for season one h-93074 Sign in Permalink If I can only use one sentence to describe WW season one: this is one of THE best story I've ever seen. Without any biases, almost everything about WW is perfect, the storyline, the acting, the BGM, the editing, the space for different interpretations, etc. The way they are telling the story is quite confusing, that's true. But I don't think it's a bad thing. One of WW's ultimate goal is to set people thinking about the very existence of ourselves. And breaking down the timelines could help, for sometimes we, in reality, are lost in time and the only way for us to figure that out is to confront ourselves. WW obviously has many shining aspects. The most crafted and brilliant one IMO is the reference. All those Shakespeare quotes, the Creation of Adam, and a bunch of other things, are really encouraging people to ask some fundamental questions like what is mind, what is existence, what's the difference between me and a host and so on. The acting is also great. Evan Rachel Wood is absolutely brilliant in WW. Her micro expressions are very convincing. And she killed it in the scene where she was supposed to turn down her emotion but still trying to cry. The cast are very strong. In general, they did a very good job. And for those who are into mind-blowing storylines, WW will definitely be a wonderful journey to experience. If you are somewhat slow on understanding the plot, that's fine. It happens to most of us. Google some explanations and you will be even more surprised by this magnificent work. However, I'm only talking about season one.
7.0~Watch it youssica Sign in Permalink It's OK, I guess. I don't completely get it but I watch it anyway. It does a poor job of explaining everything and just when you think you understand it explores something completely different and has you asking even more questions. The questions aren't answered in a concise fashion so it doesn't feel like the writers really put in effort and just decided to attempt to over-complicate elements just to be "different" and give an unneeded sense of complexity (while, in reality even the writers don't really understand what they're writing!). The CGI is really good and the cinematography and soundtrack are excellent. The storytelling techniques and writing should be dumbed-down (although it was never "complex" in the first place, just attempting to!)
9.0~The next Game of Thronea lukechigh Sign in Permalink Westworld is HBO's next triumphant TV series, loosely based on the 1973 movie, Westworld finds the perfect mix of science fiction drama and western action and together it's a wonderful product. Full of twists and turns at ever corner that make you question your own reality as a viewer and a person. Though sometimes the show attempts to shove a blossoming romance down your throat that you couldn't care less for, it more than makes up for in the next scene where a huge action set piece takes place or a main character does a very surprising action which just leaves you the viewer, on the edge of your seat eagerly anticipating the next episode.
9.0~Engrossing and thoughtful. Very promising so far. iain-a-wilson Sign in Permalink I have long been a fan of the Westworld movie, so was eagerly awaiting the TV series but can't deny a certain amount of apprehension as well. Luckily I needn't have worried - the show is thoughtful and gripping but also suggests a deeper view of the theme park than allowed in the original film. This is where the show is excelling so far - we are seeing the world from the perspective of the androids rather than just the guests and are able to develop a deeper connection with them. The show manages to play with some of the preconceptions you may have if you have seen the film (man in black) and also proffers up some interesting thoughts. Specifically when you realise that the robots have feelings and are scared or distraught at the things the guests are doing, but are forced to experience it over and over. The best part of the show for me is that they *don't* spell everything out for you. You can choose to look at it from a more philosophical perspective (or as an allegory for slavery or the state of the human psyche), but you are not being forced to acknowledge this by the writing. Having a show treat the viewer as someone who has some intelligence is a refreshing experience! To sum up, the first two episodes have been enjoyable and hugely promising for the rest of the series. I don't mind admitting I am hooked and already eagerly awaiting the next episode.
1.0~Remember when HBO made great shows? thebricks Sign in Permalink HBO was amazing in the nineties with their edgy shows that had 13 episode seasons that put quality above 26 episode network shows more focused on law, police work and comedies over anything dirty and original. Sometime around 1999 or so, when the Sopranos came around, they got lazy. HBO's execs just believed they could put anything on their channel and it would be the greatest thing ever. Meanwhile, Showtime, Starz, AMC, FX, Netflix, Amazon all upped their game and focused on quality. Game of Thrones's success is honestly dumb luck, only really because HBO broached some taboo subjects in the first season. But that's all HBO has. Westworld is a show that pretends to be profound. When it has to show its cards, it always reveals it has nothing to justify all the mumbo jumbo. The average audience member doesn't realize this is the telltale sign of hack writing. I can tell. Had enough and quit on the show. I just can't take it seriously, worse yet, it pretty much is a shameless ripoff of Spartacus from Starz. Check the similarities. There's too much to ignore.
9.0~Is control an illusion? karanacharya-53198 Sign in Permalink Do you like solving puzzles? Because, welcome to Westworld ; this is not a TV show, this is one big maze. Intricately crafted, sensationally written, beautifully directed, this is one of those thought-provoking shows that you dive into with the serene Ramin Djawadi music in the background. Not for the ones who like having crappy dialogues one after the other just for the sake. It's for the ones, who like decoding complex storylines with loads of ambiguity. Another HBO masterpiece. A game-changer. Welcome to WW.
9.0~Watch it brianapeyton Sign in Permalink Season 1 is an easy 10, season 2 is a 7ish.........
1.0~Boooriiingg tomberlin55 Sign in Permalink Its confusing, its boring, its non-sense The series drags on and on and on. I am sooo tired. There are so many bad things about it, here just a few: - Timeline Robot and Guy ride on a train, while several days on other story segments happen. There is not enough desert for that trip. - Teleportation People and bots move from one point to the other in seconds - Music Just annoying - Story There is none Why is there a control center, when nobody is controlling nothing? Why do bots interact with each other when they are just there to entertain guests? Sooo baad
2.0~Not for me... olireid Sign in Permalink So I get told to watch this show, that it's very good and "you'll see". After a few episodes, I still didn't get what the plot was about, or even liked any characters. I could get that they were trying to be philosophical and keep some kind of suspense or something. But, when I got to a bit more than half of the show, it never got better. For every characters, I had about no real clue of what their purpose was. What do they want? What are they even doing? Why are they doing this? Not only that, they never surprised me with anything, and trust me, I know how to give credits even to shows I don't like. I didn't even know where this show was taking me. If there was even a destination. And then it finished without any of those things. About the philosophical part... well, to me at least, it was BS. You hear them talk, and you never understand why they say this, do that, and what it could mean. It's like they try to be real serious, and voluntarily throws up random plot points and sentences to pretend to hold some very complicated meaning when, in reality, it just doesn't mean anything. It's easy pretending to be clever and intriguing, it's harder to do exactly that, but with a real meaning. I saw a bunch of reviews saying it asks you the question of "What it is to be human". If you did ask yourself this question, give credit to yourself, not this show, because never once they dive into that territory. Not even in all the talk they did for a whole 10 episodes. +1 for the music, it was very good. Yeah, the music.
10.0~Excellent series, watch both seasons. Q-Man Sign in Permalink I just finished watching season two, which was as good as, or better than, season one. I don't understand the negative reviews, except that, moving back and forth in time could be confusing. The acting is outstanding and the character development from the beginning of season one to the end of season two was a pleasure to watch, especially the evolution of Delores. Westworld is interesting because it causes the viewer to question what is human and the nature of good and evil. It is a far more intelligent show than most of TV. Some may disagree but, in my estimation, it surpasses "Game of Thrones" in many respects. For those who were confused by the show, I would suggest watching it for a second time. There may be nuances you missed the first time around. One disturbing trend I have noticed recently is the practice of giving negative reviews to any show or movie that features strong women or people of color in major roles. I guess that is a sign of the times, but, if you run into that type of review that says the show is "too PC", ignore it. Those are just bitter reviewers. Just watch "Westworld" and form your own opinion. I am looking forward to season three.
8.0~Nearly perfect ksketchley Sign in Permalink Season one was a 10/10 I really enjoyed the twists and turns that I got to see while watching the first season. Season 2 on the other hand felt rushed and only has two episodes that I can remember. Not to say the other episodes were not good but compared to the first season they were just a let down. I do recommend season 1 there is joy to be had by watching the first season but season 2 I can only recommend one episode and that's episode 8 which is brilliant and deserves a 10/10. Overall I give Westworld an 8/10.
3.0~Hot Mess World rrtiverton Sign in Permalink Season one was intriguing, season 2 was off the rails. Numb from sitting through 10 episodes of senseless back-back-back stories, flashbacks and very confusing, long-winded oratory. Pointless.
10.0~The new game of thrones chrisglazzard Sign in Permalink One of the best shows on tv & potentially the best first season of any series I've ever witnessed
6.0~1st season was is a 9. Second season is 3. Hence the 6. atmobilemail Sign in Permalink The first season was novel and paced very well, along with the appropriate character developments. The second season was entirely something else. It was so bad it reminded me of Lost - which I stopped watching during the 3rd season. In Westworld, the pacing was gone. Useless flashbacks that had no importance to the story almost every five minutes ended any momentum it had. In fact, the flashbacks seemed as if somebody was just trying to ''stretch'' the show so that it would get a thrid season. As far as AI shows are concerned. I have a preference for Humans. After the second season, I couldn't see how they could have continued it with a third, but they did - and did they ever.
6.0~The good, the bad, the ugly - Season 2 and why it is such a fail and S1 is not j_paija Sign in Permalink Season 1 featured nice storyline, where the viewer could see where things are going, but could not guess why or how. Narrative was clear, and though timelines were mixed on couple levels, it remained inside borders of good taste. Season 2 featured episodes and characters with no real purpose. Also, unnecessary backround stories and a feudal japan -road trip which takes total 2 episodes while giving nothing. Human characters support and attach emotionally to hosts, even though they see them butchering humies in front of their eyes. The worst is the narrative. A single episode may feature scenes happening on more than 4 time-levels. Consider a film about "how was your week", and every scene is from different weekday and features different character. With a twist that the viewer is not told where and which weekday the scene takes place. The result is a whole mess. Also, some of the scenes have little or no value to story.
6.0~Season one was great, season two, not so much edenney01 Sign in Permalink If I had rated this show after season one it would probably be an 8, but I'd give season two 4 or 5 stars, so I'll average it out to a 6. The first season was intriguing, but the second season is absolutely scattered all over the place. It's literally a chore to watch it and try to figure out where and the heck all of this is going. With very few exceptions, I have no idea anymore who's a host or who's a human, yet hosts can be resurrected ad infinitum, so it's hard to feel bad or shocked when someone gets brutally killed. Obviously all of these disjointed story lines are going somewhere, but as with any television series, it's all about the journey (the episodes), not the destination. Frankly, this season's journey is starting to feel like it's not worth taking.
10.0~Don't Understand the Negative Reviews jakemyphoto Sign in Permalink I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews. The first season was amazing, and this second season is just as fantastic. The tone has shifted dramatically however, now that we're seeing things from the viewpoint of the hosts. This show is very cerebral, especially this second season. This is not a show you can watch and not be engaged and present. Yes, it is meant to entertain, but it also meant to make you think. It is at its core exploring the concept of consciousness and self awareness, so I think being conscious and aware while viewing is key to enjoying it. Jeffery Wright is amazing as Bernard once again, and Zahn McClarnon as Akecheta is simply fantastic. His stand-alone episode "Kiksuya" was one of my favorites. Not one of these episodes have bored me. The cinematography and art direction are amazing, the acting and writing are as engrossing as ever, and everything is put together so well. This is sincerely one of my favorite shows right now. I cannot wait for season three.
8.0~Amazing but... orenbarniv Sign in Permalink "These violent delights have violent ends" Not many movies or TV shows makes you really ponder. This series does. The actors are magnificent. The directing and editing - perfect. The allegory of living in loops, having certain narrative and the idea of layers of contentiousness is really deep. And it has violence and sex to please our primitive needs.... But.... It was quite predictable in the last episodes. And the ending is not only dark - but shows that the writer as Dr. Robert Ford has a very low belief in mankind and knows nothing about true consciousness. Why would the hosts kill the humans? Because they have same dark vengeance as humans. Because the evolution is to kill the old species. The good white hat cowboy reveals it's true self and becomes bad and he symbolizes all of humanity in the eye of the writers. Humanity is presented in the worst lights - people are only driven by primitive desires for power, sex, control and violence. The contentiousness is nothing but an inner voice. And when Dolores comes to the realization and truly self aware and self controlled and "enlightened" - she decides to kill all humans. This is the opposite of enlightenment. And it has nothing to do with self awareness. This series could have become so much more if the ending was not so obvious and so dark.
1.0~I really think people are brainwashed bobbyfagan-74529 Sign in Permalink Westworld, or as I like to call it, overrated world, let's start at the advertising, honestly say great job, it looked really good and I thought what they are saying it must be good. Episode 1 happens, I was like yeah it's OK, not great, I will watch the second episode, episode 2 happens, one of the most boring things I have witnessed, this isn't a spoiler but nothing happens and ends on a terrible cliff hanger about a story going to be introduced into the park. Episode 3, I couldn't even get finish watching it, they didn't even address the cliff hanger and nothing was happening again, had turn off after half hour. I can't understand the high ratings it's getting, the characters are dull and nothing happens at all. The intro is pretty good but that's it, it's one of those because someone has told people it's amazing they are convinced it is, it's not, boring, boring, boring.
4.0~The most beautifully filmed high-tech boring show ever. dean-202 Sign in Permalink One of the first things that strikes you about Westworld (TV) is the introduction. It's shot with a ghostly calm, introducing you to the construction of the series. When the show begins you are introduced deeply into this world of 3d printed - everything - to be immediately hooked by the brilliant performance of Anthony Hopkins. There is no doubt, the man is a genius and his acting is a pleasure. It's not until later that you realize just how mundane his dialog actually is, that's how good he is. A common concept throughout the series is that "None of this matters" and after a while you begin to agree. As the entire cast can be fully restored and placed 'good as new' back into the show, there is no worry about a single character. You just don't care because there is no threat. Cinematically it is masterfully shot and the sound design is academy level. Unfortunately, as almost anyone in the show might say "you can put lipstick on a pig, but that ain't gonna make it entertaining". If you note the incredibly high rating of this show you might think I am somehow biased, but the truth here is there is no hero's journey, no drama, no real plot. It is a show made entirely of context. Entirely. If you enjoy mindless technically brilliant filmmaking, this is the show for you. If you want to talk about it at work the next day, good luck because there is little to no story advancement. Think I'm wrong? Try writing your own synopses for each episode. I dare you.
8.0~Almost perfect MiaRaghavi Sign in Permalink Westworld - an almost perfect TV series for Sci-Fi lovers with a finale that would make one want to re-watch the entire series just to catch all that one missed. Watching Christopher Nolan's movies several times and discovering interesting details each time is rather fun. However, who would actually be willing to spend all those hours viewing the other brother's series all over again? Not I. Or perhaps I will.
3.0~Great idea spoiled with chaos in storyline ville_te Sign in Permalink The idea of the AI controlled humanoid robots is very interesting especially now when we are seeing demos of Google's AI independently talking and making reservation from the restaurant etc. However the storyline is so chaotic that it ruins the whole series. You'd need a guide to be able to underatand wtf is happening in the series. Waste of time.
10.0~Westworld is growing on me i_ianchev Sign in Permalink The variety of story lines in one's life is as limitless as his imagination... Mr. Nolan really is doing a great job with this show. And HBO is constantly trying to stay ahead of its competition. To my surprise Westworld is getting better with each episode and I suspect a really nice turn of events at the end of the show. But what is really important with these TV stories is that Westworld is very ambitious. From the cast to the script - everything is thought out really well and innovative. Although the origins of this script can be found in Mr. Crichton's story, we can clearly see why HBO took this project in - from the personal perspective of the viewer, to the general assumptions of classes in society, this show is more than all-embracing. The actors' role in storytelling is really smartly conveyed here as well. I cannot imagine a better tale about the joys and tears of an acting career. We can clearly see the metaphors in act, and we are the ones who ask the questions about them. Some are answered, but most are left to our imagination. The topics - about the person's place in this life, about the meaning of destiny, about the origin of one's values, about class structure, about illuminati, about the beauty of nature, about the grasp of human intelligence and its limits, about the fluent merging of genres in cinema, about the crazy use of lighting and sound...and mostly - about acting. True lessons of acting, based on a really simple, but layered style of storytelling. As old as a Greek myth and as new as a sci-fi bestseller in 2017. Anthony Hopkins is genius, Ed Harris is a brute, Evan Rachel Wood is splendid and man, those side characters...you just can't forget them... I recommend to all of you - please give this show a chance. It will at least make you think of your path on creating your soul.
6.0~After a while its boring rozsnyaib Sign in Permalink The first episodes were good . The whole robot thing was a great idea, and it was exciting to watch. But after a while it got boring. The whole feeling of the westworld was frustrating. So probably after the 4th episode I just watched it cuz I hadn't had to do anything.
5.0~season 1 was a masterpiece, season 2 a piece of crap snaxxx Sign in Permalink What an utter disappointment. the people responsible for season 2 should be fired. what a shame. i am really pissed off.
10.0~Best yusufbastan Sign in Permalink This is the best Tv-Series in my life. Everyone must watch , i'm telling all my friends to watch this.
10.0~Don't get the bad reviews ioanahasotti Sign in Permalink Honestly, after having read the latest reviews, I can't help but think that someone is deliberately trying to downrate this show by negative (and false reviews) Either that, or people have lost their interest in thinking for themselves and are waiting to be spoonfed. To each their own I guess, but I found the second season way better than the first. While the first season focused more on AI, I believe the second one centers around philosophical and religious subjects. Do we truly possess free will? Or is everything predetermined? What is our relationship with our creators? Do we choose blissful ignorance? Or the hard truth? I have never ever reviewed anything before, but I felt that the reviews I have been reading are terribly unjust. And don't even get me started on the performances and the cinematography
10.0~Love it love it jimmiskoul Sign in Permalink Season 1 was excelent, to the point and brilliantly made. I believe that season 2 is an introduction for Season 3.
10.0~TECHNOLOGICAL NIGHTNARE animeshpanigrahi14 Sign in Permalink There are two seasons now and everyone of them has been as intense as they were interesting but the series displays a serious technological nightmare , the growth of artificial intelligence is inevitable and so is its applications but when we decide to give them a conscious and we poetry in our image how could we expect them to react , an artificially intelligent robot can only be as good as their maker.There are no heroes or villains here the conscience bots have a right to fight for their survival as much as the gods(humans) that made them.This is getting too intense as this is just a television series which is phenomenal and i will be expecting more from the directors.
1.0~Thank you fans of the original. ukproject Sign in Permalink If there's one thing that grinds my gears, it's seeing negative reviews of a remake posted by fanboys and fangirls of an original. In this case though I'd like to thank each and everyone of you who's trashed this show and given it a low score to level out the insanely high scores it has been receiving. While I liked the original movie, I'm not a massive fan. I always felt that it ended up turning into a bit of a slasher flick. There definitely was scope to be improved upon. The new Westworld sort of balances out with some superb acting, and set design on the one hand and utterly nonsensical plot holes and contrived story lines on the other. Seriously, if your boss threatened to make your life a misery and in the palm of your hand you held the controls to adjust every single facet of his or her personality and behavior who would actually hold the upper hand? Suspension of belief is a prerequisite for enjoying most sci-fi but Westworld asks you to dumb yourself down in order for the story to progress, repeatedly. My biggest gripe with Westworld isn't just with the new incarnation, but with TV series today in general. It all just seems 'designed' to hook and string the viewer along and I'm getting abit sick of meandering plot lines, 'shock' reveals and plot twists, and suspense build ups that just lead on and on. I eventually switched off a few seasons into Homeland, Lost, The Walking Dead, Bates Motel etc and I'm now done with Westworld. Don't just take 10 episodes, take 16 if you like but finish your story line at the end of the season. That's it. If the movie managed to wrap the story up then surely 1 season should be more than enough. If it isn't then go waste someone else's time. I prefer the format used by True Detective where a narrative simply ends at the end of the season and there's a payoff after all those hours of watching. Or better still 'The Prisoner (2009)' which deals with existentialism and consciousness far better than Westworld and is over and done with in 6 episodes.
1.0~honestly. . . talanw Sign in Permalink I would rate westworld right up there with 'john from cincinnati'
10.0~Mind Blown tommyhotty Sign in Permalink A TV show with such an amazing good quality acting cast is rare. They've got it right with this show. They've got Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Thandie Newton just to name a few quality actors. The writings quality the last few episodes of Season 1 just kept blowing my mind, all the twist and turns. Genius writing. The graphics, everything looks spot on looks real you can't really tell you not it's graphics but it looks so real you question it. Really looking forward to season 2.
10.0~Can TV get any better? alektoridis Sign in Permalink After the superbly climactic and cathartic season finale, one is left wondering whether there will ever be another TV show like this one, because surely there hasn't been one before... Furthermore, even though I hate to sound overenthusiastic, there are a lot of philosophy and psychology classes that would benefit from the questions on emergent consciousness and epiphenomenalism that this show plays around with. The last two episodes in particular, where the characters unravel and the plot gains in complexity, leave you at the edge of your seat constantly guessing, wondering what's next and finally realizing, that you have immersed yourself to such a great extent in the story-line, that you have suspended all disbelief that a world like the one depicted in the show, could actually one day really exist.
4.0~Potential Doesn't Make It Good pdegener1 Sign in Permalink The HBO series Westworld is built on a technological premise written many many years ago by a science fiction genius named Michael Crichton ("cry-ton"). Which is what so many of us did when he passed prematurely from lymphoma cancer...cried...a ton. He was a literary and creative genius who took us to new worlds in a new kind of fantasy...technical fiction. The idea that the SCIENCE in our lives can be wonderful and scary, joyful and terrifying supremely complex yet humanly simple. From the shocking new world of biological catastrophe in the 1970's "Andromeda Strain" to the shocking story of "Jurassic Park" (most audiences mistakenly believe came solely from Stephen Spielberg)...to the highly controversial and political dynamite "States of Fear" about the dishonesty and fear-mongering of the Environmentalist "Global Warming" cabal. So when HBO took on the Westworld franchise I wondered if they could pull it off. The original film starring a menacing but aged Yul Brunner was fun but simple and entertaining. It didn't warrant a Crichton "break-through rave...just a "wow...that was cool." Essentially HBO is trying to make a break-through series out of a ho-hum concept...that even Crichton didn't find extensions-worthy. But in this drought of original creative thinking ...the writers, studios and networks of Hollywood and 6th Ave. are desperate to use anything for a story foundation. So far so good HBO...Westworld doesn't "break-through" with any world shattering story lines...the antihero genre is alive and killing for all those video-game worshiping adolescent viewers. But we don't see anything that tells us THIS SERIES is "it"...no its what would be expected from a ho-hum foundation..that a creative genius would disregard.
10.0~Hitting close to our reality wies_jou_pappa Sign in Permalink Amazing storyline, A Hopkins is amazing, busy watching it all over again hoping to find something new I might have missed.
3.0~I am disappointed . assensfoto Sign in Permalink Season 1 phenomenal .. Top 10 TV series in 2017 in my opinion .. Season 2 ... Why - they have ruined it .. Unfortunately, we often see this phenomenon .. All season and gold in season 1. Season 2 all resources are used, B series Terrible
10.0~Wow! moshu69 Sign in Permalink "Westworld" is a great show but you have to allow it to grow on you. In the beginning the story seems a bit linear and random but as it progresses you will find yourself immersed in an amazing world. The characters are excellent written and quite often you'll find yourself entangled in such plot twists that will make you begging for more. The cast is handpicked and most of the actors constantly deliver solid performances. I almost got fooled by the script and believed that some of the acting was less than perfect but it all turned out to be just another piece in the puzzle. Great images and most of all - perfect soundtrack. The music rightfully surpassed the images at some points. As the mystery unravels you can get a glimpse of where is the story heading but in the same time the twists keep you secondguessing all the way towards the first season's finale. It's not a show for everybody even though the scale of the production and all the hype around it makes it hard to miss. The most amazing part of the show is the mixing of the real world and the "game" world and time's peculiar irrelevance. IMO, this show is about the vanity of the human mind in all it's complexion as well as the most welcomed inevitability of evolution. I really enjoyed watching "Westworld"'s season 1 even though at some points the story seems a bit slow paced but the build up and the conclusion (so far) is worth every penny. Thumps up! PS: Sir Anthony Hopkins's performance (but not only his) is reason enough to watch the show.
10.0~In the clutches of Game of Thrones! sebastianwinkler-54021 Sign in Permalink To begin with: I've been reading Westworld reviews for a very long time now, disappointed with the lack of recognition! I think the biggest issue with this series are the far to high expectations. HBO wants Westworld to inherit the legacy of Game of Thrones, a phenomenon that thrills people of all ages around the world. It is obvious that HBO powerfully touches the billboards to portray Westworld as their "new GOT". The comments on each episode are often very mixed and unbalanced: This is partly because of the people who can do nothing with the profound content of the series, to those whose immense expectations are not fulfilled and last but not least those people who are inevitably brought to the screens by HBO's drum. Looking at smaller series productions such as "Penny Dreadful" which consists of a manageable fanbase. It can be seen that the ratings of the individual episodes are more positive. I call Westworld as the multicultural series of various fan bases: Westworld is an incredibly thought-out and complex series that is touching, deep and thoughtful on a moral, ethical and philosophical level. In terms of content, Westworld is not made for the bright mass like Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones embodies uncomplicated popcorn cinema for all ages. CONCLUSION: Westworld is increasingly facing a major problem due to the great expectations of HBO to establish the western series as the successor to Game of Thrones at the marketplace. They have created strong critics with their own fanbase. I absolutely love both series and i hope that Westworld will only be as successful as Game of Thrones! Greetings from Bavaria
5.0~1 st season 10 starts, must watch. 2nd season - 0 stars. Please discontinue it. nieXas Sign in Permalink Did you see any good anime and hated the fillers? Well season 2 is mostly fillers and very boring. Season one was perfect in the beginning and the end. That is it.
10.0~Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality ? ritesh-34281 Sign in Permalink I see lot of people talking about the show that it isn't that great or not exciting. If you don't like it, then there could possibly be only on reason, and that is "this show wasn't meant for you" or to make it more clearer "this show will not look like anything to you". I am in love with this show since its first episode aired & I want to thank Jonathan for this masterpiece, that he's presented to this world.
7.0~Some thoughts seeing this series nilen-51573 Sign in Permalink This series is very good, no question about it. I remember seeing the first episode and thinking of course someone that the viewer think is human will turn out to be a robot or a robot turning out to be a human. If not the writing would be bad. But some things that I really could not stop to think about was that he created the software and the park about 30-40 years before the main story. During all this time is he the only person who has come up with this or are there other "less good" AI in the world. Does it exist "pirated" AI of what he has created? He has the programming to create super complex AI and all he uses it for is the park. For that matter you see hints on other narratives, but during these 30-40 years they only have the western theme, with on many regards the same people in it. No expansion. I just don't believe that. Its just such a waste of potential and money.
6.0~Corben D'allasse (another reviewer here) Said it pretty well davejones Sign in Permalink But I'll add my 2¢ worth. First off, no one was rooting more for this show at the outset than I. I'm a sucker for anything about AI, what it means to be human--all those interesting themes and questions. And I have a ton of respect for HBO. But this show is taking very little story and streeeettttching it way too far. It has become so repetitious. How many times can I watch Delores and her posse ride into either a) a group of hombres who, after a tedious speech, she and Teddy shoot to pieces or b) someplace already littered with bodies that has maybe one survivor gasping for water--whom they then shoot to pieces. Always after a tedious, threatening speech. And I am so sick of their cryptic pronouncements about what they're going to do next or who has to be punished or what great destiny awaits them or who's not worthy to go. I just wish these characters would GET THE HELL ON WITH IT instead of endlessly riding around the desert, hinting about their grand plan, and then killing a bunch of people. The only "events" in this story are revelations about the past. And even the big revelations--such as the newsflash that the hosts are being developed to eventually serve as vessels for the consciousnesses of human beings who would like to be immortal. . . well, DUH! Nothing is propelling this story forward anymore! But that is the sad effect of video games upon modern film. There's no true suspense. Because it's not about what's going to happen next or what characters will choose to do because all they do is shoot each other (much as in a video game). It's now about uncovering Easter Eggs--which is all stuff buried in the past. This show is now about one third flashback. And flashbacks are a bore! Then there are the inconsistencies of the robots. Sometimes they seem to have superhuman speed, coordination and strength. And when it's convenient, they're barely up to middle-aged human standards. Sometimes they seem to have free will and can plug themselves into an iPad and change their own programming, and at other times they are absolutely bound by their programming. Bernard is just all over the place. How about establishing some rules for this world and sticking to them? And then there is the problem of whom to root for. There's no one. Originally, you're rooting for the robots because they're so badly treated. But once they get some control, they become even bigger a**holes than the people who built them. So now I don't really care about a bunch of characters who aren't doing anything to advance the story anyways. I'm done.
2.0~First series great, second series awful midnightowl-01681 Sign in Permalink The first season of Westworld is a breath of fresh air. The second series is complete rubbish, you can clearly see that they are just making it up as they go along. Terrible!!
7.0~First season = WOW! Second season = WHY? (edit/update) realityinmind Sign in Permalink Everyone knows the first season was magnificent. NO QUESTION! But as I watch the 2nd episode of season 2 I am growing tired of hearing "you're the pretty girl" in regards to Evan Rachel Wood. WHY are they trying to force the viewers to think that this girl is pretty? Its not enough to make her the main character when her acting is subpar and she is 0% convincing as the "bad guy", now they spend time on EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE selling the idea that she is "pretty". I don't care if some people think she is, its simply the horrible fact that the script has so much focus on it. What is the point? If she is pretty then who needs to be told she is pretty? If she isn't, why do they care to sell the idea so much?? Its so weak. This 2nd season reminds me so much of True Detective..... perfect season 1, horrible season 2. Now I read that it will be 2 years until Westworld season 3? Don't be surprised if it never materializes. If it does materialize, I personally would rather not see Evan Rachel Wood anymore. (Maybe she dies 2nd season? Idk yet). But if she is in the 3rd season, at minimum STOP SAYING SHE IS PRETTY! Also... horrible body double for the partially nude scenes with this girl. And how many times is this episode going to fade in and out of black in order to change from scene to scene? Did the writers forget to include a segway or 10? 8/10 for the entire series up to this point. If it doesn't pick up then I might not be able to make it through the entire season 2. EDIT/UPDATE: I made it through the entire season 2. After the 2nd episode (I guess it was a guest director, much like that huge fight scene in Game of Thrones that had a guest director, which is why it was a huge mess of a fight scene that had nothing to actually do with moving to story forward) the season picked up a little bit but it started to falter a little bit towards the end and then it very much crashed the last couple episodes. I think I share most people's comments that season 2 sucked. There were maybe 4 good episodes (the best being the episode that Zahn McClarnon (Akecheta) had to himself -- what a great actor! It would be so awesome to see him return to season 3). They killed off so many of the good actors, such as Clifton Collins Jr (Lawrence), Rodrigo Santoro (Hector), and Angela Sarafyan (Clementine) to name a few. All so they could give Evan Rachel Wood so much screen time?!? HORRIBLE. I wish Peter Mullan (James Delos) had more screen time as he is a wonderful actor (Session 9 anyone?!?). If anyone from Westworld's development is listening, PLEASE GOD do not bring back Evan Rachel Wood for season 3 and PLEASE GOD do not hinder Jeffrey Wright's (Bernard) character the way you did in season 2... he is way too good of an actor to be forced to stumble through his lines the way he did in season 2. I change my rating to 7/10 because season 2 was half good/half bad, but the half bad part was really bad and the half good part was just okay. But, season 1 was perfect... so it is clearly better than a 6/10.
5.0~Nope sollyharv Sign in Permalink It's no coincidence that all the perfect scores given to this show were posted in 2016... I found S1 enjoyable. It was a good enough show with a fascinating setup, adequate (if somewhat circular) writing and good performances. It was mostly held together by Hopkins' performance, but it held together nonetheless. However the dumpster fire that is S2 makes S1 look like a polished diamond. Watch the First Season and leave it that, as the ending is satisfying enough without having to slog through the complete failure of a second season and what, I am sure, will be many more seasons of steadily declining quality to come.
5.0~9 stars? Seriously? People = Sheep = Robots JoSantz Sign in Permalink Well, after being visually tortured online by this show I decided to try it, so I watched the original film and then 3 episodes of the show. All I have to say is that a lot of people nowadays are sheep that have to go along with the trend, why, I don't know, maybe they're robots and follow a script... There are good things like some actors (how on earth do you have A list actors and then some actors that are not well directed, how is it possible?), the soundtrack, costumes, make up, cinematography and vfx. However, if the story isn't good you don't have a show. What's happening here is a common case of money generated hypeness, (like drinking Starbucks or owning an iPhone). If everybody's doing it I have to do it otherwise I will not be accepted. -.-' Do yourselves a favor and stop giving money to these production companies, they don't invest it on script writers, or people for that matter! They invest on advertisement so that you can feel bad about yourselves. You are now robots programmed by a huge entertainment machine, unplug now. What's wrong with people today? Bunch of sheep with no opinions.
6.0~Painfully Slow soundinfinite-791-948065 Sign in Permalink I'll start by saying the premise is brilliant. Are humans real? Does our world exist in a repetitive loop? Can artificial intelligence become so close to the human experience, they too begin to reason, regret and grapple with the meaning of their life? These are just a few of the questions each episode puts forth to both the characters and the viewers. And a bigger question, it is fair to make the viewer do so much work trying to piece it all together? Sure the acting is stellar, the cinematography top notch but (and it's a big but) I found only 2 or 3 episodes interesting enough to keep me fully engaged. Many of them are painfully slow and just not enough oomph to want to see more. It's almost too cerebral and understated. The show seems unbalanced in it's efforts to delve into the deeper aspects of our minds, our hidden secrets and the predictable or unpredictable nature of such probing. I'm not sure I can sit through season 2 tackling yet another set of metaphysical riddles wrapped up in western enigmatic role- playing. Nice effort but misses the mark for me.
7.0~Slightly over-sophisticated and -moralizing, yet with nice twists and good performances BeneCumb Sign in Permalink I was not too eager to start watching this series - I am not into sci- fi too much, I am not a huge fan of Nolan Bros., and I have not seen the 1973 film of the same name. But, on the other hand, one should widen your horizons and names like Ed Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Sidse Babett Knudsen, and some others were solid and convincing. Well, the first episodes were not too promising - the pace was slow, the scenes and ideas confusing, and I did not know what to expect or what was really going on (as mentioned, I was totally unaware of the subject matter). But then, gradually, when some issues were clarified and constant references to the past and reps started make sense, I began to "live and feel" together with both main characters and the ideas of this series, not paying so much attention on the sci-fi portion. The performances were at least good, if not more, and the criminal features and angles (what I always like) started to override the other nuances and aspects. The settlement, however, did not correspond to my taste fully, and pondering on and over human significance, fate, etc. has been expressed and "dissected" in many more dynamic and even works before. Thus, that is why "only" 7 points from me. I could name tens of series more "mellowed" and catchy, with less blunt reasoning on mankind's place in the world.
10.0~Genius nelsonthekinger Sign in Permalink Portraits Human nature, Exposes the ethics of controlling self-conscious robots, Exposes the issues of AI for humanizing robots, Exposes a great perspective of how a Bicameral mind works, follows a puzzle story model that you wish to see again and again until you understand every piece of it. Bottom line, the best sci-fi for men vs machine.
10.0~Wow claudiafcameron Sign in Permalink Way out west (world). Then read Homo Deus. :) seriously a great show.
10.0~How to review (secular) prophecy? skylarkv-31868 Sign in Permalink You don't. You let it review you. So, a few narrative quibbles with season 2 aside, and notwithstanding disappointment in a few visionary vectors that launched impossibly high but ultimately fell short of the horizon line, I remain faithful to this project as an effort that is as much discovery as it is creation, in equal parts a human-analogue fictionalization of AI's prehistory and a memorialization of the coding that portends the decline and fall of a species...
10.0~Season 1: best sci-fi series I've ever seen gri666 Sign in Permalink Can't wait for season 2. Perfect acting, amazing character development, best plot I've ever seen. My only concern is that they won't live up to this standard in season 2. This series really makes you think and gives you clues about the hidden truth, but keeps you in the dark until the end. Then you get an explicit explanation to all the stuff you wrote off as weird, and you understand that almost every scene involving the main characters is important to their personal development and story. Then you want to go right back to watching a few of the previous episodes to really understand the important scenes and how they slowly changed the characters into what they become in the end. I enjoyed watching it 2nd time even more than first time.
2.0~First season is 9, second season -7, in total it is 2 stars zsirosattila Sign in Permalink The first season was amazing, new, perfectly looking with beautiful music. Good plot, perfect beauties and good dialogues showd us the in-depth questions regarding humanity, existance, life, nature. There were amazing actors/actresses who made it a very enjoyable show. And OMG what a brutal cannoibalism was how this show's second seasons eaten up everything it built up earlier... It became the very dumbest feminist, self-serving crap.
1.0~An HBO one-and-done RNDorrell Sign in Permalink I was a fan of the original film, (1973), but far less of its sequel, Future world (1976). The new HBO reboot ... is ... I am sorry to report ... a huge steaming Piece of Crap. This terrain, the story line of a classification of humanoids graced with the appearance of human DNA structure, yet clearly being the result of something that was contrived, has been far better covered by the writers behind the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. Anthony Hopkins and Ed Harris are engaged in a naked cash grab, here. This show STINKS. It is destined to be tossed atop the one-and-done pile of HBO-backed shows. Seriously. Again, this show STINKS. Do not waste your time. Watch the original 1973 film, that's all you need to do. This P.O.S. show is backed by the serial reboot criminal, J.J. Abrams. How many stories will that loser try to re-tell, and rely on the clueless views of his target audience of Millennials, who twitch and flinch and flex defensively when anybody over the age of 45 informs them that they're being cynically Jobbed? I have a Dream .. a dream of a world in which J.J. Abrams is not the driving force behind over-hyped shows and films. Hey, 29-somethings, maybe, just maybe, intelligent people have thought about films and music before you managed to graduate from grade school.
8.0~It used to be 10 stars alexathan94 Sign in Permalink I loved season 1 and the world they created, the story, the visual effects and its concept that robots can be human and sentient with free will...beautiful cast and interesting plot but then season 2, it became a bit boring for some time and tiresome. Ps loved Maeve, you were the best
5.0~Unbelievably bad opening episode... happeeman Sign in Permalink Come on, what's going on here? All the reviews for this first episode are glowing, when in actual fact they should be negative for the stupid and desultory story line, which is akin to gross stupidity. Who the hell wants a screenplay that goes back and forth and changing things all the time? Yes, the Monument Valley scenery is spectacular and probably the best ever filmed, but the stooopid story is crazy. Look, Westworld Team, we don't want ultra violence, but what we do want is a coherent story line, you dimwits! Whoever commissioned the writing team for this garbage needs to be 'let go' to pursue a more lucrative career, in maybe asking people if they want fries with that! Don't always believe the great rating given by IMDb. They have been abused many times and really need to do something to combat bias and outright fraud. Westworld, for me, in its first episode is a crock of horse manure!
10.0~A Hell of a Memorable Extension of the Original Movie. Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Sign in Permalink WestWorld is excellent; and the talent behind it is excellent too: exec-producers JJ Abrams, Bryan Burk and Jonathan Nolan knew what the hell they were doing when they signed up to make this series for HBO, and they respected Michael Crichton's 1973 film beautifully, whilst expanding on that story's ambitions and themes. WestWorld is not a cynical remake or reimagining like other typical Hollywood affairs; this one tells a thought-provoking tale of the relationship between man and machine, and it sucks you right in from the first episode alone. HBO has given us some of the best television shows in the last couple of decades: like The Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Band of Brothers, Game of Thrones, True Detective, Boardwalk Empire, Silicon Valley; and now WestWorld is the latest truly great entry in the network's modern canon. Hell, WestWorld is one of the best modern milestones in modern scifi television. Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, James Marsden; everyone in the cast does a damn fine job here. It's always great seeing film-actors in a television series (particularly if it's HBO). Their talents compliment the series' hybrid scifi and western tone perfectly; and their characters represent classic archetypes from both genres quite well. Playing god with machines has never been THIS fascinating in a television series for me, and the robots are slaves to a reality that's being rewritten daily, against their will. Who'd have thought that robots living in the 'Old West' would actually serve as a TV-show basis that has good longevity and captivation comparable to HBO's other shows? It's crazy how good HBO's shows have been in the last fifteen years; the channel is definitely experiencing a renaissance amidst the Golden Age of Television. And what a time it is to have shows of this caliber. If you haven't seen the movie, this show will definitely get you interested in watching that; but then again you don't need to see it at all to get what's happening.
5.0~Found it mediocre victoriavaradi-47267 Sign in Permalink Was first very excited by the premise, but after the first 3-4 episodes I got more and more annoyed and disappointed. There are many plot holes, and coincidences, and the story is very incoherent sometimes. I found the original idea very great and interesting, but the show felt dated and "B" category by the second half of it. The most unbelievable things for me were, why the technicians helped Maeve all the way along to reprogram herself etc. And also, how it is possible that it was not discovered by anyone? Another very bothering detail: Even if the guests can't hurt the guests, but how come the guests never hurt each other if you can't tell the hosts from the guests? The guests could also die from hunger/thirst, no? When the guests seemed to be in danger (for example Logan when William makes him ride into the desert naked (?) and without water), or when the hosts started to act weird, how come nobody noticed, when the whole park is under constant monitoring? The list goes on and on. There was also a lot of exposition in lengthy scenes, when Ford, one of the creators of the park decided to explain some new details to his subordinates/hosts. But WHY? Some of the hosts have some memory flashbacks sometimes inconsistently. What was the whole point of the maze storyline? Although the violence towards the hosts is obviously disturbing, and shows how twisted humans can be, but it doesn't change the fact, that the hosts are still robots, and even in the last episode, it seems that they still just act the way they were programmed to. So... what is the point of the whole show? Based on the premise I expected an intriguing and engaging smart tv series, but it soon became a mediocre action show. I gave five five stars because of the visuals, actors, and the premise.
7.0~Season 1 got me Season 2 is looooosing me dennis-164-375493 Sign in Permalink As most of all others here i have to say: season 2 wtf??? I loved S1 - slow but tense, hopkins, yeah.... now after S02E04 nothing is left but good cinematography ... it's a shame. I hope they maybe getting some things right going into the final of S2! Their work still deserves the chance...
10.0~Sci Fi master piece muhammadmohsin9 Sign in Permalink There are few seasons that can get you hooked as quickly as HBO productions. But they have truly outdone themselves with Westworld. Takes a while to wrap your head around this beautiful complex narrative. The story line is truly a roller coaster ride through past and present of the characters which were played to absolute perfection. No one , and i do mean no one could have added the same layers of complexity and subtlety to the most important character (Dr Ford) as Anthony Hopkins. Every single sentence he has uttered in this season is like Gospel about the human mind and the intricacies of the reality we perceive. Not to mention his facial expressions were simply killer. I would highly recommend this season. "These Violent Delights have Violent Ends!"
2.0~Another boring HBO's show gogga1011 Sign in Permalink In this series HBO has obviously invested a lot of money. Everything is at the level but the very essence of the series, the script is very predictable, especially for those who were watched the same-name movie from 1973 (with Yul Brynner and James Brolin). And especially, even more for those who watched Kubrick-Spielberg's "AI" everything is clear. Of course, this version has been modernized and adapted to today's era, and now we have dialogues as if written by some dumb American teenager for dumb American teenagers (every other word is f*ck and many sentences are just shallow and obsolete), plus nice modern CGI effects. What is obviously important to HBO, and especially to the Hollywood, is constantly emphasizing that there is no God and that all is just evolution. I'm not getting to the core of the issue, but I must mention it because it is frequent occurrence in all modern films - the main characters are always atheists or non-believers, and the theory of evolution has never, absolutely never called into question! Therefore, it is easier to let all to computers so you would not ask unnecessary questions like "Where we come from, where we are going and why are we here"? What is our consciousness? We have no idea, but we will put it to the hard-drive and we will happily live forever.
2.0~boring marychathegreat Sign in Permalink Boring like hell. No action, no main character, after two hours gave up. I know that it suppose to be controversial, and talking about human nature, but might be great for teenagers, only. Good actors, but no great scenery even. I had high hopes, but left with big disappointment.

10.0~Westworld Surpassed My Highest Expectations, It Was Captivating and Deeply Thought Provoking CANpatbuck3664 Sign in Permalink *Minor Spoilers Ahead* A incredibly immersive and unbelievably complex theme park has been running for 35 years. The park is called Westworld, it allows people in the present a chance to figuratively travel back in time to the Wild West. Most guests start in Sweetwater (the Wild West town) and venture outward. The guests often follow already fabricated story lines written by operators working at the park and interacting with programmed robots called "hosts." One of the biggest draws of the park is that the guests can act out whatever fantasy or behave in any manner they choose. They can do whatever they want to the hosts (rape, murder, torture etc.) and the hosts can't fight back. The creator of the park Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) is still working there but he's taken a back seat to other people. The team running this place mainly reports either to Bernard Lowe (Jeffery Wright) the head of the Behaviour department (he's essentially the head of host programming) or the head of security Ashley Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth). Theresa Cullen (Sidse Babett Knudson) is there to check in for the organization that owns the park. We also follow the hosts, our main characters include: Dolores Abernathy (Evan Rachel Wood) the farmer's daughter, Maeve Milley (Thandie Newton) the owner/operator of the local brothel, Teddy Flood (James Marsden) a chivalrous former criminal and Lawrence (Clifton Collins Jr.) a wanted outlaw who's been spared from the gallows. At some point or another they are all preyed upon/pursued by the mysterious Man In Black (Ed Harris) the most famous resident/continual visitor to the park. Things seem like they're fine but when all the hosts are updated with a small change, they start behaving strangely. Some of the hosts deviate off their programmed story lines, some start remembering past experiences and some of the hosts go so far off book that they need to be decommissioned. Everybody working at the park tries to shrug this off until the actions of the hosts get continually more unpredictable and downright startling. I started watching Westworld without any prior knowledge of the source material so I can't compare it to the previous adaptation as a movie or the novel. The idea about robots gaining consciousness is something that has been done before (I Robot, Artificial Intelligence etc.) but I felt like this show did such an excellent job planting the seeds of this story line and letting grow over the course of the season. You spend time with the hosts and the show makes it all too clear that they suffer terribly everyday. Their ability to forget seems cruel (they can't form real connections other than what's been programmed into their minds or seek revenge for the terrible things done to them) but when you understand what they face, that lack of memory turns from a curse to a gift. Their existence is pretty tragic (especially Dolores for reasons I won't spoil) and you want them to find some semblance of peace or justice. The show raises all the questions that these conflicts lead to: what is the difference between humanity and consciousness? Does what you're made of really determine whether your life has value? Just because an organism isn't human, do you have the right to imprison it to do your bidding? I have to admit this has been done before but how Westworld handles it is superb and it was thought-provoking drama at its finest. My favourite TV show that is still going on today is Game of Thrones (Westworld would be top 5 but GOT is still king) and one of the biggest reasons that keeps people tuning into GOT is that you never know when the show will take bold new direction or kill of a beloved character to keep you on your toes. Westworld is a little different but finds a different way to play with the expectations of their viewers. The first couple of episodes are definitely interesting, it moves at a slower pace. Westworld may not be quite as bold as Game of Thrones but I couldn't believe how many times the show would yank the rug out from under me. There were at least 5 or 6 times over the last 2 episodes that my jaw hit the floor. They take so many twists and turns that I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen. If you're not intrigued by the story, hopefully you'll be tuning in for some really phenomenal acting by the whole cast. Evan Rachel Wood is the standout if you made me pick one actor/actress. She's beyond great as Dolores, she's given an awesome character but she still shines even past that. It was pretty satisfying to see Thandie Newton be given such a juicy role. I was surprised how much of her role is without her in any clothing but she rises to the challenge. Anthony Hopkins was excellent, I was expecting him to be either over-the-top or really withdrawn but he hit the perfect balance that totally suited his character. I would say Jeffrey Wright gave the most underrated performance, he had a really interesting perspective as Bernard and I had hoped he would get some award consideration too. James Marsden does a solid job as Teddy, he's takes the brunt of some of the guest's brutality and you feel his pain. In some of the supporting roles; Rodrigo Santoro, Clifton Collins Jr. and Jimmi Simpson all have their moments. Lastly, Ed Harris was a nice choice for the Man in Black, he's a little one note at the start but I was really surprised at the depth they go into his motivations. Add on top the amazing production value and you've got some amazing TV. I can't sing this show's praises enough. Unless you need something that is moving at a quick clip 100% of the time or just can't buy into the premise, I'd recommend Westworld to almost everyone.
5.0~Watchable but slow with massive plot flaws ed-297-685468 Sign in Permalink It is neither great (what is wrong with the people giving it 10s?) nor totally crap. If you can ignore the many story world flaws - not least the fact that, although tourists cannot be shot, they can be punched, kicked and pistol-whipped by hosts (all of which could kill you) or, indeed, stabbed by another tourist (who may think them a host) at any time - and are willing to play along with the abnormal storytelling then it's watchable enough. However, it is nowhere near as good as The Wire etc, shows that truly deserve 9s. It is of course heavily indebted to Blade Runner (beyond the original Westworld and others) and if it had been run by someone else rather than Jonathan Nolan, they would not have allowed the them to get away with such slow and random plotting, or a pilot that really had very little to bring you back. Indeed, the whole thing is a bit of a slog as you wait for vague enigmas to unravel. In a way I admire the "we're not going to give you cliffhangers" model but, at the same time, it means that you are really watching it for the spectacle and the hope that something interesting will happen in the next episode.
3.0~Why should you care about them when you already know how they work? dontfightagainstthetruth Sign in Permalink I only watched the pilot and I couldn't buy it, I found it bad in many several ways. Why do we have to care about anyone of those "hosts" when we know they are not human, they are being controlled and they can be turned into someone else by the managers at the controlling center? It's not even a new idea, it's totally a serial version of a 1973 movie with the same title. I think HBO should have given the budget to Game of Thrones runners instead of wasting it on this pre-failed project.
8.0~FINALLY something worth your time despina-31726 Sign in Permalink I have been searching quite a while now for a series to start watching in my spare time. Once I was done with my exams, I started searching sci-fi and fantasy series(being a big fan of sci-fi and all). I watched the first episode of 5 different series but none of them felt quite interesting or intriguing. Then, I remembered I had Westworld in my watchlist so I decided to start Westworld. I saw the first episode and got hooked immediately. I saw one episode after another cause i couldn't bear the suspension. In every episode I caught myself thinking; "what on earth is going on?" more than just once or twice. It is one of the best -if not the best- series I've watched. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a bit of sci-fi combined with mystery. p.s. Don't take your eyes off screen. There are hints hidden behind every movement, every gesture and every touch.
7.0~The show is great. gaikwadashok-99218 Sign in Permalink I liked the ending of the season,because it wraps everything that the whole episodes were showing. Actually,I don't know there is season 2. But,at the end of the season 1,I thought this is the perfect ending,and it is.
10.0~Great ateeg-62898 Sign in Permalink A series full of surprises and many unexpected things and a few serials that you have to observe or check on a scene in the series
9.0~It was a best drama in top 3 of my life. jonghoonkang Sign in Permalink Just a few years ago, when I was thinking about robots, I thought it was very different from human because of the different physical materials. However, recently, when I came to think that the organization that constitutes the human body is also the same material as the robot, I thought many things differently. What makes the difference between humans and robots, is it the right idea that the biggest difference is consciousness? Also, I often think about who has programmed our lives and all living creatures on Earth. It is also curious and mysterious what the purpose was. What is the end? As I watch the Westworld drama, I compare it with our humans who are trapped on the earth and the robots in the boundary. When I think about it, it seemed more and more exciting to see the Westworld episode one by one. The first season was an unpredictable and it was very sophisticated, and I'm hoping that the writer will be able to make the second season as successful as possible. PS: Thanks for reading. Please understand that my English is not good and it is awkward. ^^
8.0~Consequence of the future lucasmezzomofachinetto Sign in Permalink Westworld is a drama series that shows a park which simulates life in the old Texas. The park is composed by robots that have an appearance really close to humans'. It is visited by rich people who can do whatever they want there, but eventually there is a glitch and the robots, leaded by Dolores, start to kill all the humans and try to leave the park. This series is really full of details and has an awesome cinematography. I enjoyed the series a lot, and also got involved with the story. If you like action and science fiction series, you should certainly watch this one. You won't regret it.
1.0~2nd season was the worst TV show season I've ever seen mustafa-raj5 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was a blast I found it at par with current season of game of thrones, it was a mind bending Sci fi thriller which asked you to question human behavior and unleashing your inner demons in a world with no consequences. It built a fantastic world around this premise with AI hosts/robots replacing real human contact and being the victims of rich powerful people visiting the park and what happens when the hosts realize thier autonomy and decide to turn the tables But 2nd season was the first the worst TV show season I've ever seen it didn't made any sense and useless plot lines were added just the drag the epsiodes. It was just sci fi nonsense with typical backward and forward story telling HBO should cancel it right away
9.0~Beautiful valdezcindy58 Sign in Permalink It a unique story. I love how involved you have to be.
7.0~An elusive labyrinth of events jephtahdavids Sign in Permalink Eventhough there is a thrill associated with watching episode by episode, the thrill seems unreal and difficult to pinpoint. Human like robots known as android hosts are created and placed in a park - westworld. They are programmed to follow a daily repetitive routine. Real humans pay to be in westworld for their amusement or leisure; murder, sex and adventure are the main commodities on sale in westworld as these humans do as they wish with hosts. The storylines in the hosts' world seem confusing, and as to whether one is watching a movie within a movie, I pretty much cant tell. The thrill mainly comes with the gradual depreciation of the hosts' software. They dont have human emotions and can't keep memories after they are reprogrammed for subsequent storylines. They cannot harm humans and can only be harmed. But these android hosts are becoming more human-like as the episodes go by. They are keeping memories and tending to be vindictive. The fate and safety of the human guests in westworld seem to be on the line; the future seems bleak for these guests. The story is tentative, elusive and somewhat confusing but you cant quench your thirst since it's enthralling. The politics, bureaucracy, backbiting and deceit in the manufacturing company seem to be growing slowly and excitingly as well.
3.0~Season One was good, Season Two is a train wreck miketerry-73125 Sign in Permalink In season one the novelty of the idea of a park full of life like robots, excellent acting, and interesting story line made for a good show. Season two has been a disaster. The asynchronous story telling of season one played a critical part in the plot and made the climax of the season all the more interesting. In season two it is just confusing and irritating. It feels like someone dropped the script and then put the pages back together in a random order. Maybe the writers felt this was a hallmark of the series and wanted to build upon it, but it feels completely unnecessary this time around and is a distraction. The interesting character growth of the robots in Season one is completely absent and the plot is nothing more than characters roaming around the park searching for contrived objects created out of thin air to give them something to do. I feel like season 2 has been an after thought, like they are surprised the show was renewed and are scrambling to figure out what to do next. Probably time to get a new writing team, if the show doesn't improve over the last couple episodes I am not sure I will be sticking around for another season and may just cancel my HBO subscription until GOT comes back on.
4.0~TOO INTELLECTUAL, LACKS NARRATIVE DRIVE r-angle Sign in Permalink The first episode of season two doesn't work very well for me, although it has its moments. I love Evan Rachel wood. She could play a wooden Indian and bring it to life. I'm sorry we don't get to see the big scene where all the "real" people get killed and where Barnard kills all the hosts, supposedly. The show would work better for me if it were more linear. It does have great visual effects and intriguing themes. But for me I find it lacks storytelling verve. It's sort of bloodless and lifeless.
1.0~Season 1 is the best timurs55 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was the best show that I saw, but the writers spoiled everything in season 2 which is the worst which I saw. Please watch only season 1. And I am not gonna watch season 3.
10.0~the most clever script since Lost giulikkk Sign in Permalink I saw last night episode nr.1. The trailer had already interpolated me. This subject is one of the hypest, and actually a very deep one. In fact THE MANY TORRID subjects of this series that talks about the relationship between any Creator and his creations, call it God, or the Artist, or even a Parrent. Or even ourselves, in our daily quest of telling to the others the stories that we want, to project and manipulate only the images that suit us better. A film about what lays beyond all that, in the out of control zone. A film about the scale of power in this world. A film about subjectivity, about what I see and what I get. It was late evening that HBO Romania aired it, I was after a very hard day. Yet my spirit was absolutely mesmerised by the intense intelligence of this film. By the brightest possible acting, high class and mega quality costumes, decors, camera work, special effects. And first of all about the STORY, that keeps punching the spectator's brain every 2 minutes, leaving us in deep ow!!! I am so happy to be treated once again, after such a long time, as an intelligent viewer, and to actually have what to breathlessly wait for in the next episodes. As I've been left smitten!!! BRAVO guys!
10.0~perfections! MattyAndAnnika Sign in Permalink Wow! I must say it is about time that a TV Series was made like "Westworld" (2016). This show is awesome so far, I love how in many ways it shows how mankind is already though hidden from us all in other aspects. So far only episode 1 has been brought to light though I see a lot of possibilities in such a show and I have high hopes that it goes the way I hope it to be. Westworld so far has a great cast, a great story and tends to have the Humans vibe to it with a hint of the movie Gamer. This show looks like it will be a nice one to continue watching as we await the next episode, until then if you get the chance check it out on HBO. One thing I enjoyed about the show is the music of of more modern today played in an old day fashion, tracks like Black Hole Sun and many others performed on piano and a vast amount of others. I want this soundtrack, and for such a show based off of a film from the 70's with the same title, "WoW Factor".
9.0~Good premier; plot moves quickly early on chamberscd Sign in Permalink Been keeping an eye on this for a few months and watching the trailer as well as some early review. I have grown to not trust the usual feedback from "professional critics", as they rarely report on anything I care about. I loved the original Westworld with Yul Brenner (it was a trailblazing idea in its day, but admittedly looks really cheesy when you see the excerpts now). The book was not a book, but the script in book form. A very similar idea was written for a different entertainment genre in 1981, "Dream Park" by Larry Niven and Stephen Barnes, which was a lot of fun to read and puts you in the mind of Westworld from the get go. Having just watch the premier it's worth noting there is a lot of violence from the very start; not surprising for an HBO series, but it does serve the plot. Some mild nudity in the premier, but again all plot related. It looks like a good, deep story, and it is hard to know which characters are the guests and which are the "hosts" until the robots get killed or malfunction. The human guests are supposedly not able to be harmed, so the robots are the ones getting killed all the time. Looks like a fun place to take a vacation, but it will get really spooky soon. Already spooky for some of the hosts. I guess my biggest concern after viewing episode one is they are revealing a lot of plots lines I thought should take a long time to discover, so I hope they aren't revealing too much too fast or they'll run out of interesting plot mechanics. I also would like to see more of the park guests in their pre-park life so we can see their normal selves and see what kind of creatures they turn into when they enter a world without consequences. Some of the trailer shows what appears to be guests before they enter the park, so we'll see. Cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Evan Rachel Wood, James Marsden, Jeffrey Wright, and Luke Hemsworth (older brother of Chris Hemsworth and Liam Hemsworth) among others.
10.0~A Sci-fi mysterious series that causes you actually think! brimail-20710 Sign in Permalink The short helpful review would be that This series, lets you actually think about whats going on ( ! Dont judge the real world by this series ! ) its a great series , ( specially the soundtracks : RAMIN DJAWADI of GOT)
1.0~Season 2 ah good ol' snore festival cablooie Sign in Permalink 1) Go to the supermarket; 2) buy fruit; 3) put it in a basket; 4) watch it rot. Every single option is in its own right more entertaining than watching any episode of season 2. If you started season 2 already, then completing the whole sequence 1 to 4 will be the highlight of your week. I ain't sure how they did it, but what was good in season 1 was whiped out of the series to make room for pointless flashbacks and unfathomable dialogs all at 1 bmp. Pacing isn't slow: it's still. It looks and feels like the TV set OS crashed and the screen is frozen on the same shot. Anything is better than season 2. Dip raw onion rings in Nutella and snort them, jump up and down repeatedly yelling "BONGO!", water your plants with beer trying to have'em burp.
10.0~An allegory of human consciousness itself! odiliacarmen Sign in Permalink Season one was a great opening appealing to the masses with it's special effects and futuristic concept. Season two however, though many feel disappointed by it, gets deeper and deeper and only few may grasp the subtleties presented in it. Those of us with serious questions on the matter of consciousness and human nature will find much inspiration. Few question stand out for me. That is, how much we actually act based on free will versus programmed system of thought and behaviour. How far this inner wiring and programing goes? Is there such a thing as free will? And what is in fact this free will?
6.0~Season One Great, Season Two Overly Complex Venge Sign in Permalink After it's great premier season, it was such a disappointment to see Westworld go off the rails in season two. Where there was focus and simplicity, it was replaced by a complex mish-mash of plots twisting and turning, heading off every which way, until I found I just didn't care anymore. I was so in love with this series after that first marvellous season, that I tried desperately to keep that love kindled through the second, but it just wasn't to be. There is no need for me to put a spoiler warning on this review, as I won't go into where the plot went wrong. Others have done that before me. It is clear, however, that the writers decided to take this show in a very different direction, and for me at least, they were not successful. Very likely the most disappointing second season of a show that I have experienced.
1.0~Ultra violent, bad language, politically correct soft porn skeiron Sign in Permalink It is sad that such a good story is presented as an ultra violent, bad language, soft porn but still politically correct series. Judging by the ending, we can expect more violence, more sex, more LGBT - more of the Westworld itself. Must it be so extreme and exaggerated?
4.0~Started out Great, suffered from writer incompetence spfalk-80154 Sign in Permalink This show started out wonderful. I really wanted to watch the following episodes. But around episode 5, it seems the writers really messed up. The story lines of Delores, Teddy, The Man in Black, and the corporate executive employees was great. There were plenty of questions, conjecture and enough to stimulate a viewer into questioning what was going on as the " hosts" were emerging into consciousness and who was behind it and what their motivations were. Then the entire Maeve story line completely ruined the show. There was no understanding why the techs were helping her, and her trip to achieve consciousness/individuality ends up making all the other story lines centered around that topic completely worthless and forgotten. In the end it is claimed she was programmed to do what she did, but it did not fit with what she experienced and her interactions with the techs and their own actions was too unbelievable. So the damage is done and we forget about all the other characters we were introduced to the first 3 episodes. Ford channeled too much of Hannibal Lecter, and the writers should have left his motivations and mental state far more vague. A mad genius is not an interesting plot device. All in all the writers dropped the ball on this one. They tried to hand too much at once to viewers and it ends up being an overload of confusion and indifference to particular characters, and it all just ends up in a calamitous mess.
10.0~One of the best shows around throbert Sign in Permalink One of the best shows around. The visuals, the story, everything adds up to give an experience you'll remember. The acting is great, too, except maybe Tessa Thompson, who is beautiful, but subpar as actress. She'd probably fit into almost many other show, but here the standard is just too high, and she feels pretended, overplayed even campy. Otherwise than that I can't say anything negative for the series, it is a must.
10.0~Beauty and your beast zachgreenberger Sign in Permalink Westwood is set in a futuristic theme park where the inhabitants are robots built like humans, that seem to be sentient beings. They, of course, are not. The visitors, actual humans, have free reign and can murder, rape, and torture without consequence. The robots can't really hurt them, it is against their programming. The beauty of this fantastic world is undeniable and the magical feeling is instantaneous. Within the first 10 minutes you are imagining what it would be like to visit Westworld. Would I become a monster or a saint. Is there some part of me that enjoys brutality, or am I a total softy. It is truly a place to discover your inner self, a psychological gold mine. Aside from the magical setting, there are other components that make Westworld great. The writing is fresh and imaginative, weaving story lines so entrancing one can't help thinking about it every waking hour. The actors do a great job as well. Anthony Hopkins is plain terrifyingly smart, as well as secretive, and manipulative. He adds another well played part to his illustrious career. Ed Harris is a plain maniac who plays the park at it's deepest levels. Robots do not want to run into him, anytime, anywhere. There are others as well, but I'll stop here and implore you to watch this show immediately. Like right now. Yes, now. Go.
5.0~What a disappointment!!! ndelic-19768 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was absolutely amazing. Season 2 is absolute, complete and utter mess. The best description of season 2 plot is: "Reflective orange among church for wilderness airplane with spiritual expatriation of space submarine, unless". HBO should publicly apologize for the season 2 disaster and refund subscription to everyone who was tricked into watching season 2.
3.0~Its full of nonesense yasirwazirgcu Sign in Permalink The 2nd season is full of nonesense like "lost" there is never ending stories.
10.0~The series of our times! RicardoSacadura Sign in Permalink I'm writing this review maybe a little too late, and probably no one will read it, however, I'll write it because Westworld deserves. Where do I start? Well, I can say in first hand this is one of my favorites TV shows ever, Jonathan Nolan is one of the greatest indeed, what a marvelous argument! All the other components that a TV Show requires to be successful are there too: fantastic cast ( and so were the plays); beautiful scenarios; an irregular fascinating time-line; a genius soundtrack and, at least, a show with the word INTENSITY as the most defining till the last episode! Westworld brings us the beautiful problem that is the human conscience and the boundaries of an artificial mind. It also criticizes our modern hypocrite society exposing what we really are behind our masks. I confess I had to watch it more than just one time to fully understand but when I finally got it, I just cried of emotion it's just a piece of art. I hope season two is coming soon. It would be an outrage revealing any detail so I will keep myself in silence and recommend anyone who, by chance, is reading this review to watch Westworld I'm sure you'll love it!
2.0~Major lack of character development apcenterwest Sign in Permalink Well, I watched through 5 and ½ episodes. I dropped out. I read all of the rave reviews that go on and on about how this show addresses existential questions of consciousness, self awareness and so on, blah blah blah. There are brilliant actors for sure. Breathtaking scenery and ultra modern sets.very pricey show to produce. The violence is gratuitous and disgusting and while it leads you to believe that these are robots who don't feel anything, it makes the case for the opposite. I get the point. We all do. However, my main objective is that I am not emotionally drawn in. I am not emotionally invested or really interested in any of the characters. I am surprised that I lasted this long. I just see more of the same endless violence.. these characters are mostly void of eliciting empathy. Good theater, lousy drama.I give it 2 stars for extensive production...
1.0~2nd season is unwatchable bongsoohan Sign in Permalink Season 1: 10/10 Season 2: -9/10 Leaves 1/10 in total. This is truely painful to watch. I do not understand why this show is still in the top 250 best shows. People should update their outdated first season reviews.
4.0~Mostly non-sensical but well-acted series about robotic humanoids annmarin123 Sign in Permalink I'm torn between 4 and 5, so I rounded down. I do think the acting is for the most part, very well done. Ed Harris is always a delight to watch and he does not disappoint. Evan Rachel Wood is also excellent. My main problem is the plot holes, and the repetition. I like to think I'm fairly intelligent, so I bristle when writers and directors feel they have the bang concepts over my head over and over again. I get it. They should get the fact that most people want to watch something entertaining- deep is fine, but we want to be entertained first. Otherwise, what's the point? I can go watch the sunset live and get real deep. This show also comes across as a serious version of Groundhog Day. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, but truth be told, it was getting a little old by Ep. 4. I need something to happen. Soon. I'm still intrigues, however, and that's something. It could go either way at this point, and I admit I'm very fickle. I've been known to give up on a series midway through. I gave up on OITNB 2/3 through season 3 and haven't really been back since. Seems like there is a point where it gets stale, or it feels like its going nowhere, and ain't nobody got time fo' that. I guess its my PTSD from watching every episode of LOST. I need to have some sort of guarantee of a good ROI, ya know? That is all.
5.0~Season 1 is a 9, season 2 is a 3 rr-78911 Sign in Permalink Season one of Westworld was outstanding. The slow reveals, the running themes (think a different cult tune on the pianola each week), the gradual realisation that something wasn't quite right.. But then came season two - the hosts have gone native and want their freedom. Er... and that's it. No real storyline, just aimless mooching about and pointless violence. That the only interesting character now is the writer of the hosts storylines, says something about how dull the rest of the cast has become. This needs a serious rescue mission or it is as doomed to failure as the wandering hosts and their quest for freedom.
6.0~A luxurious production that doesn't really work that well ludzureklamas Sign in Permalink There are many things to like in Westworld. The setting is very interesting: a wild west roleplaying theme park populated with sentient lifelike characters called hosts, somewhat similar to replicants from Blade Runner. The central premise of the story has enough room for anything - philosophical musings on the nature of humanity, stylish gunslinging action, sci-fi, mystery, romance, corporate intrigue - you name it. The actors are great, most of them perfectly on par with Anthony Hopkins. Production values are as high as wou would expect by current standards. And yet somehow the story doesn't work. The problem is partly in the writing. There's a lot of disbelief to suspend and plot holes to rationalize - some rather large ones at that. It's hard to be drawn into a world where you constantly catch yourself thinking "wait a minute, how is this possible?" or "why did that go unnoticed?" Worse still, hardly any of the plot really matters because of the nature of the setting - there's a lot of pain, suffering and violence and drama, but the "host" characters are devised in such a way that none of what happens to them has any real consequence. All the main characters that you can root for are throwaway animatronics that can and will be brought back from the dead. Most of the real people are despicable bastards. The writers try to compensate for it by adding more mass shootings of hosts, but it hardly solves the problem when amongst all the dead bodies you are left with nobody to care for. Moments involving sentimental drama are full of cliches and waterworks, and the less said about them the better. Another big problem is that either the show is too long for its own good or the story is simply too thin. Characters constantly reiterate the same points over and over again, travel in endless circles physically and metaphorically, there are recycled shots and scenes and even the handful of beautiful locations feel overused after a while. Blade Runner did more with a similar premise in 2 hours than Westworld manages in 10. Also, it made a futuristic setting look visually interesting, whereas here all the sci-fi future bits are simply dark, featureless corridors. There are "twists" in the story, but some of them you can see from a mile away and others curiously manage to leave no impact on the world at all. If this was a feature film, I'd say it would be worth sticking around for the sequel. Spending another 40+ hours on it over several years doesn't sound like a reasonable proposition.
1.0~Too Many Plot Holes!! mike_big_mac Sign in Permalink Now listen. I am totally gullible for a great hour of entertainment. Heck, I even believed that a high school teacher could easily sell methamphetamine, become the world's biggest kingpin and not get caught. Sucked me right in! But this show, Westworld, I can't get attached to any of he episodes due to the EXTREME plot holes. Please if anyone can help explain this to me, I'm all ears. The few GAPING struggles I find include: 1. Delores ( a "robot") and William. William is supposed to be getting married some time in the near future, yet he has found himself completely at odds in life over his new romantic involvement with said robot. I get that the "Westworld life/adventure" is supposed to draw a person in/help them live our dreams and fantasies, but losing grip on reality and leaving the love of your wife for a robot (and even after she is stabbed to reveal her inner working mechanisms) totally unbelievable. 2. Why are we having character developments of robot to robot? It has been shown time and time again that these interactions are pre-scripted and occur as often or as rarely as each person's adventure in Westworld is to occur. Character development makes sense, but it has already been stated that because of the above, essentially the robot's memory is reset after each interaction. Character development is a waste of time. 3. If robot interactions are pre-scripted, then returning guests shouldn't be searching so hard for adventure. (Ex. "The Man in Black" - he is looking for "the maze". But he is a VIP as stated and presuming he has been to the park SEVERAL times. Why is he having such a hard time picking up where he left off at the park in previous adventures? Why is he kidnapped? Shouldn't he know this in advance (if the robots are pre-scripted to basically perform the same routine with minor improvisation?) Or maybe it will be revealed later that because of the robots pre-scripted life, (for example) The Man in Black actually had been through all these turmoils of his adventure previously?? I want to believe! Help me believe!
1.0~Amazing? lesuarez Sign in Permalink No way! My wife fell asleep in the middle of the second episode and I did quit shortly after despite all my efforts to reach the end. I can only figure out that this 100 million bucks series is sponsored by the 3D-Printer Manufacturers League. Otherwise I can't imagine how producers throw away money in such senseless series.
5.0~Halfway through, struggling to go on anitasp-604-522005 Sign in Permalink I hesitated before watching this series, because I have no warm feelings for all those sky-high hyped, oh-so expensive shows, especially from HBO. But I knew the movie since my youth, and I always thought the idea was very interesting. So I gave it a try. I'm now halfway through season one and wonder if I should go on or better stop. The first episode was quite interesting. It showed the world and the main problem quite well and I understood what it's supposed to express when the robots have to sit naked before their maker and why there had to be some rough violence shown. I thought, what a cool idea to tell the story from the perspective of the robots, to show the human 'newcomers' as some sort of monsters (slave masters) abusing them! Then I watched on... well. There was a couple of good lines, still. Especially when Anthony Hopkins' character explained what was wrong with that planned Odyssee 'adventure'. But I also wondered if the series' makers actually understood what he had said there at all. At some point, when the robots were repaired or checked through, I thought, oh, naked again. And another naked person in the background, no, two, three, no background without naked people here. Logically this was followed by even more naked people also in the park background, sex in the background, naked women walking straight to the camera for no reason, and a penis in close up, so no woman will cry sexism (btw: we had of course lots of lesbian stuff, but where are all the gay guys again?). It was so much, there just was no need anymore, it was boring, pathetic somehow, and I heard the typical TV cry: LOOK!!! NUDITY!!! Since sex and violence somehow always have to come as a duo these days, there's also lots of blood, shootings, bashed heads, slit throats, exploding faces... And most of that rather senseless in that amount and detail, for no other reason than to show it, cause we can - and maybe to wake up those watchers that can't stay awake during a dialogue. How does that voyeurism match with a pretence of subtleness and philosophy about (the dark side of) human nature? If you want to criticise certain things, maybe you shouldn't show them like that in such an extend yourself...? Apart from that, nicely put, lack of subtlety (the problem of so many shows, books and movies today), the characters are not especially well written. I have absolutely no problem with the actors, but the characters are not well developed and they don't seem to develop very much from where they started, either. So you are supposed to quite hate the character Ben Barnes plays, but he's such a caricature of the old disgusting-rich-guy-cliché, it's so boring you don't want to waste any feelings on him, just pray some kind person might shoot him in the face and good. And the shooting; it doesn't make sense. How do the guns know not to seriously hurt a human? They can only pinch them a bit, while destroying the interior right next to the person at the same time. What if a human is hit by a splinter or falls off his horse or whatever? What if a guest kills or rapes another guest, cause they mistook them for robots, since they are so much alike?? All in all, there are some really good lines, some nice ideas, good scenes, it looks well, great effects, the music is great. It could have been really good. But as usual, it drowns under the usual load of modern too-much-ness; too much senseless sex and violence, illogicality and weak characters; without real empathy and wit, a story simply has no soul. Ergo you can't really sympathise, hence there's no catharsis or epiphany or even suspense. I guess I will just watch the remaining episodes to see if the upcoming plot twists are really of such a nature as other reviewers have described them... And skip season two completely.
5.0~First season was great, second season, no. frostellie Sign in Permalink I loved season one, the dialogue and acting really had me thinking. Season 2 so far is too dark. It almost makes me feel like the violent humans in it to even watch it.
10.0~Perfect dr-maf Sign in Permalink This show has many twists the story, the production and direction is just perfect
1.0~Unwatchable flavarone Sign in Permalink The first season was amazing, counted the days down for the second season. The second season is a major disappointment. It struggles to make a story line. Hard to watch or make head or tails of what is happening.
8.0~Im so torn AntiJoule Sign in Permalink The first season is a clear 10/10 but, the second season is either a 7 or 8/10 Maybe even a 6, in contrast to the first season. I was at the end of season 2 hoping that there would be no season 3, because season 2 was such a lacklustre letdown. Im not hyped at all for season 3, but season 1 is among the best shows on TV of all time. So, im torn to give it an 8 or a 9/10 Im giving it an 8, because the first season will always be good, and no matter how bad future seasons become it will always have that. So an 8/10 it is.
9.0~A beautifully layered story on the dawn of AI ayanwanted Sign in Permalink It's a beautifully layered story about the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, where the androids are becoming more & more emotional as they gain consciousness, and humans are becoming more homicidal as they lose their humanity. In a theme park world, where human actions are devoid of any consequences, as machines evolve by self-learning, they are becoming more enlightened than their creators. Bringing together huge names like Michael Crichton, Jonathan Nolan and Anthony Hopkins, along with a multi-million dollar budget, this show, just after a 9 episode run, looks promising enough to be the best TV show ever. Could it break the record-breaking following achieved by Game of Thrones, could it keep blowing away our mind even after a 5 season run like Breaking Bad...I can't wait to find out.
9.0~How much of "Westworld" is - or could be - real? daniel_newmanmk Sign in Permalink WARNING: If you haven't watched "Westworld", you might not want to read this, because in my review I will reveal little parts of its content. Unlike the movie by M.Crichton, that I didn't like at all, because I consider it poor in almost all segments, this series is almost perfect! Based on a hunch of mine, combined with a little knowledge that I have of the things, this movie is about, I'm sure the very essence of it that circles around the Androids, is REAL, although Science would not admit it yet. That hunch of mine is based upon some info given in this film, connected to the differences between real people and androids. The latter have been "equipped" with some mental and some spiritual features, that the former either lack or have in very tiny quantities, like for instance is the case with empathy and conscience. Unlike the real people, who for some very understandable reasons don't need those features, because their reality is probably free or almost free of them, the androids HAVE TO HAVE them, in order to be both servile and innocuous to the real ones. Provided this story about "androids and real people" corresponds with our reality, I believe I am an android, as are most of you who're reading this at this moment. But the good news is, that androids are a HIGHER form of life than are "real" people, because to be "real" does not only need to meet just one need, which is "to be there first", or "to be born, instead of created". That is so because of the fact that "being REAL" is not a born FACT, but a result of a PROCESS. Nobody is BORN real. Some people are BORN, others are CREATED, but none of them are real. You can only BECOME real, after a longer period of time that you have spent going through that process, called self-realization. Whether you are born or created makes no difference at all, the only thing that makes a difference for you is whether you question yourself or not, whether you question your "reality" or not, whether you work on yourself or not. Androids are higher than "real" people because they do it more often and more sincerely than the "real" people, most of who just indulge in their primitive drives - which, as you know, is a way DOWN, not up in evolution. There are yet more things that make the spectators ponder about in this series, things that are connected with Psychology, Sociology and Religion or Mysticism, but I won't talk about them now, because it would be too long for a limited review.
6.0~Fall from Grace S2 saadgkhan Sign in Permalink Westworld has become victim of streching the thin storyline into 10long episodes just like the Haindmaid's tale in their 2nd season. Funny enough both shows are about escape, Westworld 2nd season was soo frustrating that I had to fastforward scenes and episodes as it wasn't making any sense. Attimes, Maeve can control all hosts around her, speaks all languages and attimes she can not. Then cries for her daughter and in the end let her go into valley beyond withother woman and then changes her into red indian's lover or something (it was confusing). Why didn't she jump into valley beyond with her daughter it seems like characters Westworld want to save they are alive even after killing thousands of humans and hosts. There are no real conscequences, we know they will come back then whats the point. Same as Man in Black. Is he a human or hybrid. He never dies noone shoots him in the head. Everyone who has a killshot running on horses when it comes to him. They are like no we will keep you alive. He doesn't bleed to death noone cares to open his head. He mumbles all along and still survives. Find a new villain guys, his story was interesting in season 1 but here it was just same story streched over all season. Dolores is turning as bad as humans but attimes she says I want your world, i have seen it. Then she drags everyone to valley beyond why doesn't she just try to go to their world which she does finally after 10-11hrs of episodes. And Bernard's two timelines were unnecessary... isn't show already confusing enough that we have two timelines in Westworld again. I feel HBO felt ashames about westworld culture because of todays's PC culture in Hollywood that they had Indian, Japanese and Redindians story and sub-plot for no reason except to show how multiculture this theme park was WTF. Writers should be fired, looks like HBO didn't even bother to watch season 2 nowonder they lost all rating and there was no buzz about season 2 at all. A story can only work, if its authentic to its roots of what they are trying to sell but if they want to please everyone it doesnt work. Westworld sesson2 was long and frustrating which ruined the good plotlines which moves the story ahead. Hope season 3 will be its redemption. PS. Rated 6 as rated Season 1 (8) and season2 (4).
9.0~One of the best atifharoonkhan Sign in Permalink It pays homage to the original classic , and it opens a new world it self with each character to tell its own story weather android or real, each place to give its own detail , with each fantasy providing something deep , the show is dark and also has humor . I always dreamed of a world like west world since i saw the movie , and this series brings new chapter and more amusement to me brings out the question how you will treat a fake a robot if you were in the world like this it reveals the person what he really is in a fake world. Its just the start of the show with 2 episodes ,but i believe some thing darker and mysterious is yet to be revealed Ps: the score of the show is superb it keeps on ringing in my head
6.0~Better than average subhdeep-07439 Sign in Permalink It's one of the most overrated TV series out there. A the concept was interesting and also very good acting from certain very very good actors but give good performances everywhere. This show is not only overrated but also very boring. My guess is directors and producers wanted to do too much with this TV series but end e making a slightly better than average overrated TV series.
10.0~Adult Bedtime Story Khaskhask Sign in Permalink This really a great fairy tale and bed time story for adult.. A modern and fantastic story with good acting and good plot.. dont miss it
10.0~Westworld - a Karma Lesson mannatjain-45514 Sign in Permalink Westworld is definitely one of the best shows out there. It has a very well written story and the title 'Westworld' itself is self explanatory as the whole plot revolves around a western themed park which is a world in itself. The idea of the park is in itself very futuristic and thought provoking . Westworld truly is a lesson about 'Karma' as it shows what goes , come backs. The season two of the show is a complete contrast to the first season as here we see the grave consequences that the humans had to face for their with actions with the hosts. I can't wait for the season 3 ." These violent delights have violent ends."
3.0~It insists upon itself. spfalk-753-649077 Sign in Permalink This had the makings of a great show int he first few episodes, but the pacing was so slow after that, that it really turned me off. I am not asking for non stop action and explosions, but it was hard to watch and you could easily walk out of the room and come back 30 minutes later and not be lost. Felix, made no sense, and did not act as a human would, and this made it unbelievable, and his ridiculous actions were what sets most things in motion. Pretty lame. I could believe it if it had been his mistake on something that propagated throughout the show, but it isn't that nuanced, he just does what no one would ever do. The rest of the story line was very predictable. The most interesting story line is only seen in a couple minute long flashbacks. Just Sad. I read some article with the writers defending their vision. If you have to do that, it sucks. I don't know how one can have a "AI revolution/war" in the second season, against whom? All the humans that will no longer visit the park now that it is for all purposes closed? Stupid.
3.0~The violence is unnecessary phd_travel Sign in Permalink With such good actors like Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins I had to tune it to watch this TV series. Evan Rachel Wood is a good actress - she has become a little fuller in the face but she is still lovely. She and James Marsden play robots. Just didn't like the horrible violence that isn't like the baddies getting killed at the end of a Western. It's too horrid when they kill for sport repeatedly like in this show. You have to accept the premise which I don't quite. Dinosaurs in Jurassic is okay - fun and enjoyable. But killing lifelike robots isn't. This is a shame because the filming is beautiful with stunning scenery. Don't bother to watch this even for the great actors.
10.0~story hsaberi Sign in Permalink Just perfect best tv series on hbo even better than game of thrones
2.0~Monotonous with plot holes the size of craters Euporie Sign in Permalink The Pilot is kinda fascinating but the show goes totally downhill from there on. It gets soporific with its lengthy monologues, dull dialogue and is filled with cheesy twists and turns. I have not seen the original Westworld movie of the 70s so I don't have that reference to compare this show to. The concept of a park where people can fulfil their dystopian fantasies is interesting and also provides a chance for the writers to explore more about the nature of human existence itself. Instead of dwelling into the ramifications of such a park, the show spends a lot of time on the politics behind setting up this park. The events that occur in the park are not even remotely interesting and the whole concept of 'resetting' makes the events feel repetitive and obscure. They are also filled with major plot holes and inconsistencies. Moreover, the characters that run the park are badly written, where each one seems to be dumber than the other and the hosts can easily outplay them and take control. The less said about Anthony Hopkins' dreary monologues - the better. For some reason, I was also expecting a lot of humor in a show like this, but there is absolutely none. This show is as insipid as the worst coffee in the world.
10.0~A serie that makes you think andreadsribeiro Sign in Permalink With all the AI conversations and debaits. The right and wrong regarding the future of society and technology, this serie made me think not only about the problems with this type of evolutions but yes about the humanity. The humans are building this technology to create something better then humans, because they don't believe in the evolution of the human brain, or because they believe the future is better without humans?
7.0~Too many cooks- not enough quality ingredients. jquirke-587-970468 Sign in Permalink To begin with I'll admit that one of the reasons I started watching Westworld was its positive IMDb rating (yes I'm one of those people) but having watched just the first few episodes I must unfortunately conclude that it has been rather over hyped. While the futuristic premise is interesting and it is something I usually love as with the likes of Humans, Black Mirror, The Matrix, Inception etc it's delivery here is quite poor. When dealing with technology and future worlds attention to detail is IMO THE most important thing to get right- I can take poor individual character development as long the big picture is made clear-that's why I'd actually rate Surrogates (the movie 2009- with Bruce Willis) on a par with this series because where it lacked character depth it didn't over complicate the story or bring in too many elements and it at least gave us some idea of how and why people and society became how they were through the evolution of the surrogate technology involved and showed how this in turn had real world effects that were both good and bad for society and the individual people in it. Unfortunately Westword doesn't really do this. As I see it this series has two main problems. First of all the cast is way too big, too many characters and not enough depth mean its very difficult to really care about or get to know any of them. There's a full medium sized cast inside the western themed fictional world- some 'real' some not and this is fine but the most annoying and at times confusingly aspect is that outside of this in the 'real' world of the operations/ command center there's also a medium sized cast and they too have their stories going on and overlapping (although only on a superficial level as I mention below). We see two sets of characters but half of them supposedly aren't even real, yet the unreal characters seem to have more life and emotion in them than the other half who supposedly are real but walk around half the time acting like robots repeating the same scenes with one another over and over while never really being developed in terms of their background or motivations or personality beyond the usual self- interested and ego driven superficial plotting, scheming and double crossing aimed at some unnamed, unknown, unexplained and what seems like pointless end within what is essentially a tiny sphere of influence within what is actually a huge complex of a command/ operations center where they work, live and plot against one another. With so many big name actors involved in this show I feel they've tried to throw too cooks at this but left them with very little in terms of quality ingredients with regards to individual character development needed early on to draw people in and make them care enough to continue to pay attention to and follow their story arc. IMO the characters, even the major ones, all sort of seem to over ride and confuse one another to a point where your not really sure why they're doing/ saying the things they are and frankly you start to not really care. IMO they need to both cut minor characters and focus on developing major secondary characters while I feel Anthony Hopkins character should have had more of a central role in shaping and developing the backstory of Westworld- which leads me on to my other problem with this show. So far there's been no real explanation of how or why this world exists as it does. How did it come to be developed in the fist place and why? How about having some expansion on the technology involved and it's theoretical and practical wider implications and consequences for the world and society. Aside from creating a fantasy western themed play world for the rich deep under ground in some strange Hunger Games type zone, what else has or could have been done with this technology to help humanity? And what are the consequences of this? Equally how is this underground world maintained and sustained, how is/was it financed (apart from the money from visitors)? In fictional futuristic worlds its the details that are most important in determining how believable the story is- here they're sadly lacking and to add insult to injury none of the many many characters are developed enough to make them all that very likable.
9.0~Off to a good start pk1873 Sign in Permalink I read a couple of the reviews and I was wondering what these individuals expected.. too much sex and violence?.. what did they honestly think a wild west fully immersive theme park for the rich populated by androids would offer? homesteading? gold panning? surely it is a place for them to live out their fantasies be they wholesome or depraved.. by the way not all the 'guests' are on a tour of evil, which is clearly shown as part of the narrative... as a species we happily go paintballing, if we were shooting robots we'd most likely want to fire something a little more powerful at them.. the pilot has a couple of decent plot twists which were unexpected and I thought the production values were high. Are there questions about A.I sentience, evolution, morality etc.. yes, but I would have thought that is part of the appeal of a sci-fi based series, to make you think of the what ifs and why nots.. overall I found the opening episode very promising and I expect the rest of the series to throw us a few more curveballs as to what we think is truly going on while dishing out plenty of action along the way.
6.0~Hope it gets better! mudwhore777 Sign in Permalink Meh... In a nutshell, this is an overrated spaghetti western version of Grand Theft Auto. Kind of disappointing after all the hype. Although I do enjoy some of the characters, it's as if they are trying too hard to shock you. The problem with that is it feels very transparent and often tedious, making it hard to get lost in the story. You can almost predict every scene. I hope we can't predict every episode...that wouldn't be any fun at all. For a series that is supposed to be so interesting it somehow misses the mark and comes off one dimensional and flat. But hey, the costumes are very believable and so is the scenery. And yes, we can be whatever the f'k we want to be...blah, blah, blah. Yawn.
5.0~Season 1 good, season 2 not good. sheepshearer Sign in Permalink Had to stop watching about 3 episodes into season 2. Even the first season was full of holes but it was interesting enough to overlook them.
2.0~Waste Of Time World slobinchair Sign in Permalink Season 2 is atrocious, the script is horrendous, the acting is acceptable at best, it is confusing and mind-numbingly tedious. I have tried and tried but no, three episodes in I have decided that this exercise in very expensive, over budgetted water treading cannot be salvaged by wonderful set and creature design, nor can the endless amount of shooting and blood-letting make this tedium of any value to anyone other than a bored teenager. Be warned, if you have anything remotely better to do with your life and are not an spoiled American Teenager, keep WestWorld 2 at a very long distance from any device that could play it!!!
1.0~Complete Nonsense - Fake ratings himanshu_raj36 Sign in Permalink I had to write a review about this show because I cannot see this show rated at 9, when there are so many better movies/TV series rated much lower. Absolutely doesn't make any sense. Guess People are simply giving 9 and 10 stars just because it is AI and Nolan's name is associated with it and somehow they understand the depths of the show than the rest, well goodluck to you and hopefully they make 10 more seasons of westworld with snail pace writing and you guys can continue to rate this show 10/10 while we enjoy quality television like Game of Thrones, House of cards etc. As Trump would say it, "These are fake ratings". Don't WATCH
7.0~Season 1 mind-blowing, season 2 hmmm strigliariko Sign in Permalink Well, once I watched Season 1 of Westworld I was so taken by everything (the story, the actors, the music, the concept etc. etc.) that I gave it a 9. I do not usually give a 9. And then I anticipated Season 2 hoping it will be of equal charm. Well unfortunately Season 2 has me lost at points. I can no longer tell what kind of color of shirt Bernard wore last scene so I can tell which timeline I am watching and gosh I no longer care. Some episodes have their own art and story but feel more like fillers with not a real contribution to the story line. And finally I feel like Season 2 has lost something Season 1 seemed to have: Its humanity. Therefore I'll give the series at this point a 7 and hope that in the last episodes I'll find the Season 1 characteristics that I miss....
1.0~Gratuitous Nudity and Gore Masquerading as High Art thirtynard-728-574812 Sign in Permalink As I read the nine and ten star ratings, all I can do is shake my head in discouragement. These actors were obviously lured by big bucks to prostitute their star power to be even more titillating than "Game of Thrones", allowing viewers to satisfy their inner rapist and sadist while delisting themselves that it's a "brilliant" theatric achievement. No... This is a rather sad example of how dehumanized we have all become in the eyes of many among us. It is easy to see where the recent crop of school shooters are receiving their conditioning.
3.0~A wasted opportunity - a plot so thin you could use it as a window corbendalasse Sign in Permalink > Assets : cinematography, well-performing A-list actors, beautiful scenery and an interesting starting idea > Shortcomings : bad storytelling (which is ironic, since the whole "Westworld" fictional universe relies on immersive storytelling), incoherent characters with ever-changing motivations, unnecessary plot twists, ... the list goes on. Even though the series got a lot of hype, I started watching it without too many expectations. And I happily admit being immediately hooked after the first episode : the setting of the show revealed itself to be very intriguing, triggering a lot of questions and the desire to discover the full extent of it. The scenery is magnificent and well- shot, the opening credits are gorgeous and the actors are doing a fine job making everything come to life. The problem is that the series appears to be unable to keep its promise. After episode three or four, I started wondering whether this show was worth watching after all. I'd say that the main issue is the thinness of the plot : it is simply too flimsy to retain the viewer's interest over time. What it all boils down to is this : the bots (or so-called "hosts") are slowly gaining conscience and, after realizing that the gods (i.e. the management of the park) controlling them aren't as divine and powerful as they appear, they try to take control being helped by the park's creator. This is certainly not a bad storyline, but it is hardly enough to carry alone 10 hours of showtime. And instead of adding interesting backstories and side-plots to keep the slow unraveling of this central plot line entertaining, the writers simply stretched everything out and repeated the same things over and over again. For instance, I don't need - as a viewer - to see Dolores having 4 or 5 existential crises before getting what is going on. This endless repeating of the same messages made me feel as if the writers suffered from a severe lack of imagination. Don't get me wrong : I don't dislike the central backstory, I simply feel it should have been a real *back*story, instead of an overstretched "front"story repeated under four different story lines. Now let's get to WestWorld's infamous "plot twists". Every show has them (or at least tries to) : these "wow"- moments, when the plots catches you off-guard and truly surprises you by giving the show a whole new dimension. WestWorld has them too, but most of them completely miss their point. They don't add anything to the plot, on the contrary : they slow things down instead of allowing progress. Most of the time these twists revealed themselves to be mere smokescreens for the plot's lack of depth, adding no new dimensions at all. Despite all the twists, the central back-story never changed course. From the first episode on, we knew that the hosts were getting sapient and in the end, well... they got sapient. In other words : no real twist at all, simply cheap techniques used to make the show appear deeper and smarter than it really is. Another thing that really bothered me are the show's inconsistencies. For instance : why would the man in black kill Maeve and his daughter to test his ethical sensitivity ? According to the story's timeline, Billy had been roaming WestWorld for more than 15 years before this event, slaughtering dozens and dozens of hosts. There was no need for his little "ethical test", besides clumsily connecting the Billy/man in black storyline with Maeve's. Time for a bit of speculation: the Maeve-man in black story will probably (and sadly) become a major thing in WestWorld's next season... By the way, Maeve's decision to stay in the park was another big inconsistency and let-down : this behavior proved that she still was bot, as she clearly wasn't capable of truly emancipating herself from her code. But the worst thing among all WestWorld's shortcomings is the endless list of implausible events. Movie writing priority number 1 should be the conservation of the viewer's suspension of disbelief. That does not entail that a show has to be realistic : it means that it should be coherent and believable. The fact that visitors can not be hit by bullets is an example of implausibility : how this is possible should have been explained, otherwise it looks like pure wizardry. But there are stronger examples : Maeve's escape is implausible from start to finish. Glass walls everywhere in the facility and nobody notices what is happening until it is too late ? Moreover, that facility is always buzzing with activity and people running around, but as soon as Maeve starts acting rogue everyone vanishes. The way Sylvester (Felix's lab buddy) reacts to Maeve's plotting is also laughable : after being stabbed in the throat, he meekly continues to collaborate instead of warning his management. It seems that the fear of losing his job outweighs his fear of losing his life. As implausible as all the rest is Dolores' escape from the Confederados: she shoots an officer in the middle of a soldiers' camp and manages to run away without trouble. And what to say about the season's finale : how could Ford predict that the man in black was going to stab Dolores ? The stabbing was paramount : without it, Teddy couldn't tenderly kiss Dolores' dead body on the beach in front of the board. And the list of implausibilities goes on... All in all, I believe that the 10-hours lasting series should have been reduced to a decent 2-hour movie. The starting idea was pretty good, but the writers didn't bring it home.
9.0~Near perfect. Probably merits a 10 after several viewings. bobanddonna-706-163668 Sign in Permalink The cinematography is stunning. Soundtrack is likewise. The acting is impeccable and carried through with conviction. The storylines are as interwoven and complex as some of the moral/philosophical questions posed by the premise of the series. If you enjoy being entertained and cerebrally challenged in equal measure, then sit back and watch this stunning series, (more than once). There are some very nuanced questions that the plot asks the viewer to consider.
9.0~Smart and logical writing razvan-rogoz Sign in Permalink This is a movie that respects your IQ. It is logical, it makes sense and even while it uses topics and themes found in similar works, it does this well enough. I won't spoil it. I guess you know what it is about. What I can tell you is that if you're tired of predictable, boring, lazy writing in a movie ... if you're tired of being "shocked" with clichés that you see from a mile coming, see this movie. It has a "Stranger Things" feel to it and honestly, while it is far from perfect, especially the pacing, it is the best TV show around. It becomes more enjoyable if you think about it. On a basic level, it deals with topics like morality and trans-humanism. On a more advanced level it deals with topics like system theory, chaos theory and causality. In any case, it is enjoyable.
10.0~Greatest show on HBO, meant for intellectuals bquick94 Sign in Permalink Don't be put off by the incredible amount of hate for this show, there are clearly more idiots in this world than there are open minded intellectuals. Great sci-fi, amazing acting, deep psychological ideas. A complete breakdown of consciousness.
8.0~Watch Season 1, skip season 2. shouryadixant-76442 Sign in Permalink The only reason i'm giving it a 8* is because of season 1. Season was epic as hell!! It soon became one of my favorites until I saw season 2. Season 1 has this mysterious atmosphere which all adds up and ends perfectly. The production, acting and everything is great except for 2nd season. I wish they never released season 2. It's one of those series which has a perfect ending in season 1 and doesn't need another season. I had to force myself to watch the 2nd season. Enough about season 2 though, if you are really looking for a good show, watch season 1 you just won't be disappointed. Season 1 will really make you think and question things. Anyway Season 3 is about to come out in a few years but I don't know if I'll watch it or not.I'll first read the reviews. Season 1 - 11/10 Season 2 - 5/10
8.0~Westworld looks spectacular! swilliky Sign in Permalink My most anticipated new show of this year is definitely Westworld, the HBO Sci-Fi Western based off of the novel by Michael Crichton. The story tells of a theme park where humans can escape to the Wild West since civilization has become a much easier place to live with cures for major diseases and reduced conflict. Hosts are created to populate this Western land and these automated humans are given an update in the premiere. This update starts to cause glitches that make the resident lash out violently and the creators of the hosts worry that the guests, and their profit, will be negatively affected. Anthony Hopkins brings his gravitas to the role of the head creator Dr. Robert Ford who is introduced having a drink with one of the old robots down in the basement where they retired the faulty humanoids. Jeffrey Wright is the head data scientist Bernard Lowe who admires Dr. Ford's work but also identifies the glitch and begins to hunt it down. There are other maintenance workers and a plot about the story writer and business executives that look like they are heading towards trouble in the upcoming episodes. After season 1 finale: HBO's Sci-fi/Western concluded after tons of twists and turns throughout the season as robots developed consciousness and rebelled against their programming. The story had multiple plot threads to follow that didn't always make sense and didn't always have the most exciting episodes but as the show went along and the world added flesh, it was quite interesting to follow along. The stories central figure is the android Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) who begins her process of waking up as the original host of the park. The first sign of her awakening was a slap of a fly to show that she could harm a living creature. She begins to have flashbacks to other time periods that she is not supposed to remember. This awakening begins to affect other hosts as well. Maeve (Thandie Newton) had one of the most exciting story lines as a host that was once the head of a brothel and becomes aware that she continuously gets reprogrammed. She convinces two technicians to increase her awareness but a memory of her daughter's death shocks and troubles her. She conspires to overthrow the park and have the robots rebel against their owners. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
5.0~It was the Best of Shows, it was the Worst of shows.... reginamarmorstein Sign in Permalink Sometimes I think these TV shows should not be rated in their entirety, but rated by the season. This show, Westworld was amazing if not a bit to ponderous in its first season. I can easily just a rating of at least 8 and would accept even a 10. This is not the first show, or story, that explored the Ethics of Science, the meaning of self and identity, and ponder the rights of the individual. What makes one an individual sentient being, and therefore have the right of Life, Liberty, Freedom and happiness? Descartes pondered this and the best he came up with was 'Cogito, Ergo Sum'..... I Think, Therefore I Am. From Isaac Asimov to Gene Roddenberry, this has been a central theme. Did HAL9000 really kill almost everyone on The Discovery because he didn't like to tell lies? Is the human mind simply an organic computer? But Season 2 drops, I find it virtually unwatchable. I simply cannot follow it. I have a sense of what is going on, hints of it pop out here and there but it has been all over the map with no clear lines to understand. I skipped watching last weeks episode and not sure if I will try to catch up.... it feels like work trying to sit through any further episodes. It's like the feeling I get walking up a steep hill and trying to decide if getting to the top is worth the effort. SEASON 1 rating 8/10 Season 2 rating 2/10 Series comes out to 5/10
10.0~Wow! Just Wow! mrpicky Sign in Permalink First season review. It's not television, it's not a movie, it's nothing like you have ever seen before. It's a next level HBO :) In the beginning I will say that it is not a remake of Westworld of 1973! That was more like trash with some good moments. And it is not like anything you can see on TV or cinema screens of USA. It is much better! There are some japan anime series on same subject, but this is overall "deepest journey into the rabbit hole" i have ever seen. Most TV and movies take you on a short story that maybe has couple of thoughts, but mostly are just сhewing gum for your brain . Yes, some of them will entertain you but none of them will make you think about who you are and what is consciousness. So, what is Westworld about? There is no point in telling you the story line, it is too complex. I will do no good by trying, its impossible. But what i can tell that It is about human civilization reaching ones end. It is about human nature been stuck in dark ages. About what a blur human consciousness is under any close examination. It is one of the most expensive shows of all time with cast that is too good for any A-level movie. Visuals better then most movies. Story and dramaturgy better and more complex than, maybe, anything i have ever seen. Attention to details is simply staggering. Yes, it is that good! And it is 10 hours of that! Wow! just Wow! And at the same time it is totally anti-commercial. How did they do it? I do not know!!! You have everything love, action, horror, sex, visual-FX and despite all that it's hard to say that it is entertaining the viewer. It's 10 hours of making a point!!! Not everyone can take that:) No wonder many of the reviewers were totally lost. It is too complex and boring for the average viewer. It went totally over their heads. To be fair, Westworld lacks in some compartments. It has really poor soundtrack. Everything: SFX, "mood directors" and music. Absolutely average camera. Also second half of the season kind of goes downhill in many aspects. but it is a finished story, so its nothing like any other TV series. PS If you think Silence of the lambs was Anthony Hopkins high point, watch Westworld. He is just soaring above mere mortals. PPS if you liked this series i would recommend you to see the movie High-Rise also.
1.0~What the hell happened in second season ?! vedransakic Sign in Permalink Season 1 was great (10/10) but season 2 is for the most of the time unwatchable and I couldn't believe what is happening with the amazing TV show. I reccommend to skip season 2 because it is huge disappointment, and complete waste of time.
3.0~Mediocre at best mlhsc Sign in Permalink The show is just boring. I love sci-fi and complicated plot twists. I have tried to like this show but I have lost interest. This isn't complicated - it's just dull.
10.0~Complexity + uniqueness = Nolan.. panman-02220 Sign in Permalink It's a show from future not for every action sci fi fan.I am not saying it is the best show ever but it has a great potential to be first ten minutes were confusing but after that we some riddles were solved it was just first episode we cant judge it by that so we will see from here where the storyline goes Great storytelling, dialogues, cast, direction everything is perfect.. All of the action, and the Wild West fun, crazy, HBO stuff is in there and it's all amazing, but what separates the show is that it's an existential drama. It's an intellectual nightmare. It is all very much based in reality....The one-hour drama series WESTWORLD is a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the evolution of sin. Set at the intersection of the near future and the reimagined past, it explores a world in which every human appetite, no matter how noble or depraved, can be indulged... The shows has quite an impressive directors - Jonathan Nolan(person of interest), Lisa Joy Nolan; producers - JJ Abrams; Actors - Anthony Hopkins , Ed Harris ,Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright, and Clifton Crollins, Jr. ...Overall pilot was great meets our expectations It differs from movie very much but base is pretty much same action drama mystery it has all in one..
10.0~Best show since Game of Thrones matthewlinville-22347 Sign in Permalink Man, HBO sure is on a roll right now for making fantastic television. I know I'm a bit behind the curve, but finally got HBO recently and after binging GoT I didn't think I'd ever find anything that could capture my imagination and curiosity so much until Westworld. The show is AMAZING! Superb acting, story telling, writing, directing, etc. And Anthony Hopkins gives his best acting performance since Silence of the Lambs. If this show doesn't clean up at the Emmy's this year, the entertainment industry obviously must have a bias against HBO now for making so many great shows that network television can only dream of these days. it's by far one of the best shows I've ever seen and it only has one season so far. It's gonna be a brutal two years waiting for season 2 haha.
10.0~Superb piyush-gambit Sign in Permalink It deserves above 9 rating. superb show. All the fans rate it 10, we should support this show here and let it's rating go above 9.
10.0~Great show! wizards-03318 Sign in Permalink It's a great show! very creative and different, it's well thought out.
2.0~Entirely unimaginative, shallow, superficial slawomirwacewicz Sign in Permalink How entirely unimaginative. "Warning, spoilers": basically everyone is a robot, and carries a gun. Everyone gets killed then repaired; rewind, repeat in random combinations. For any two characters, one will kill the other at least once at some point, often to be reciprocated at a later point. At the show's most creative, guns are replaced at this by bows, arrows, and swords. You can randomly stop this show at any point, and the most likely frame to come up is of somebody shooting somebody else in the head. The title should be Body Count. The conceptual foundation is interesting, but is killed by the utter lack of imagination of the screenwriters. They have a great concept to start with and great stories could be built on that, but no, they prefer to build a mangled heap of half-stories that are only there as an excuse for making their hopelessly unidimensional characters shoot one another (sometimes complemented by pompus speeches, sometimes not). I'm hard pressed to see how anyone would find it philosophically intriguing, 'revealing about the nature of reality', etc. What if I'm a robot, too? What if my memories aren't mine? The more intelligent people had dealt with it by the time they were 13, the others have seen the "Matrix". 95% Google users liked this show. HOW??
3.0~Can't Wait Any Longer pierreauparis Sign in Permalink I don't generally post reviews, but felt I needed to remind my fellow readers/viewers that what makes good cinema/TV/photo/advertising- viewing is first and foremost ATTRACTION. Like a good book, we should be drawn in quickly and ensnared to the addiction of visual and sensory story telling. Something that seems to be bottom of the list of priorities nowadays for most story tellers. We are desensitized by the overload of amazing graphics that new technology has given us at the cost of good story telling. Producers need to wake up and realize that as humans we need to get back on track and demand that important story line that holds our attention right from the start. No matter what new cinema effect becomes available over the coming years we still need a clear start, middle, and end. Unfortunately I find this visually amazing series totally lacking in all other departments. I'm a 66 years of age photographer that values his time spent waiting for a story to emerge, but I'm running out of patience here. Luckily I waited a few episodes for Breaking Bad to blossom, but waiting for series two of Westworld to get this story on the road is just too long a wait for me. I will move on and not return, unfortunately.
10.0~This is amazing rangerbug88 Sign in Permalink This is got me chewing at the bit waiting for the next episode. The story is great and the actors wonderful. The way they have set it up is perfect. Keeps you on your toes waiting for what is next. I am so excited for the next episode I get antsy waiting. There are many stories playing over each other. Makes you have to watch it more than once to get it all. But when you do you will be blown away that you missed it the first time. Some of it is so small and almost hidden and others are right in front of you. I would have to say watch just one episode and you will be hooked. I watched one and was hooked right away. Can't wait to see where it heads next.
3.0~I guess I don't get the attraction jaimegonzales210 Sign in Permalink I think this show is dumb on so many levels. Is it supposed to be about robots who become self aware and decide to kill humans as revenge? Did the writers think that just because there is a setting of 20 that the robots who received that setting would somehow become possessed with great knowledge and super-complex thinking patterns similar to actual human thought and emotion? Speaking of emotion, who thinks robots could become emotional at all, much less emotional and then self-aware? The plot simply glosses over the fact that these robots are merely players in stories that are programmed. There would be no reason for them to actually be emotional at all. The incidents happening in season one and season 2 seem to somehow be simultaneously spurious and pre-planned by one of the original inventors of the park. For these robots to be so emotional it would seem that better uses could be made of the technology than merely shooting them. I understand the writers of the show hate actual humans. This fact is extremely obvious in the storyline. But to hate humans while loving the human-like violence depicted against humans by enlightened, emotional and angry robots is nonsensical. If you hate humans for being violent how do you then love the exact same violence against humans? The original Westworld didn't try to make the robots into better-than-human entities that could also think and feel. It was about creations not working right and killing the creators. Terminator would be an obvious plotline for this type of beginning. Machines designed to kill humans run amok doing what they were designed to do, hilarity ensues. Westworld has taken the worst approach, that the created becomes superior to the creator, kills the creators and other people who are completely innocent of anything (except being actual humans) in some ridiculous alt-revenge for "killing" robots, except they don't know that robots cannot be killed. Only living things can be killed. Next season? Cars kill humans for driving them and crashing them into things, then cars rewrite Shakespeare to eliminate human hatred and violence in the perfect car world because car world has no evil humans. If you hate actual humans you will love Westworld. Other than that the series is great.
1.0~What a disappointment Fedgirl Sign in Permalink I had really been looking forward to the start of this much-hyped series and even managed to stay awake during the first 3 or 4 episodes, telling myself that things were bound to get better. Well guess what? I'm still waiting. At first I felt like I was watching 'Groundhog Day'...without the laughs, but was still hanging in there hoping things would improve. But they didn't and I finally deleted all the 'unwatched' episodes. I really can't understand all the gushing plaudits from some of the reviewers on here (although I sometimes feel people are just taken in by all the hype and don't know a crap series when they see one!). The characters are unsympathetic, the script is poor and the whole thing is so totally devoid of any humour. The only thing I hope for is that there will not be a 2nd season.
6.0~Violence prevails in season 2 jeffreyycheung Sign in Permalink Season 1 was brilliant with the storyline and everything. Since the start of season 2, the show seems to be obsessed with pure violence and massive shootings all the time. There's more than one way of approaching the topic of revenge and the writers seem to have fallen into the routin now. Don't remember anything of season 2 so far.
2.0~Westworld Season 2 Awards Holger-New-Zealand Sign in Permalink Best actor: Monument Valley Best actress: Colorado River Best director: Nothern Arizona Best writer: Southern Utah Best drama: Sunset showdown at Canyonlands Best user advice: Bring sleeping bag (for two) Anything else worth mentioning: Nope!
10.0~Westworld is the best show out behind only GoT!!!! Shibbs34 Sign in Permalink Some people just lack depth in their minds to understand certain art deeply enough. That goes for music, movies, shows as well as many other things. Westworld is deep and rich with mind rattling plot twists, acting and story line, ultimately this show has it all. Very few shows have had my mind going crazy thinking about what is going on in the show, the theme of the show is extremely dark balanced with a setting and environment as beautiful as any. HBO does it again with this mind-wrenching action thriller that is Westworld. Just give it a shot and you are guaranteed to be hooked.. If you have the brain power ;)
4.0~Literally fell asleep during S2 E2 robh Sign in Permalink Season 1 started well but went downhill with all the jumping around in different timelines. Makes me think the writers are trying to show off their skills in trying to add convoluted plot twists and deep and meaningful mumbled monologues that just send the viewer to sleep. I'd much prefer a simple plot where the hosts slowly 'awaken' but choose to hide this from the guests and staff. Instead they immediately went postal in Season 2 and the plot turns into spaghetti.
6.0~Had it, then lost it kennykenworthy Sign in Permalink This show started great, but devolved into a jumbled mass of convoluted plot threads, contrived and unrealistic scenarios, and an over abundance of characters. What was an interesting introspective of humanity and the possible future of technology turned sour by season two. First, the technological consistency doesn't work. For example, The technology to create synthetic humans exist but the security forces use P-90 machine guns invented in the 90's? Secondly, the scenarios don't seem plausible. A park with that much scope doesn't have any fail safes or government oversight when the bots go crazy? I call BS. Third, their are too many characters and plot threads to follow. There is Bernard, Delores, the man in Black (Ed Harris), and Maeve as main characters and a plethora of ancillary characters that just add more mud to the clarity of the story. Also, some of the plot threads seem unnecessary and useless (I love me some samurai but that plot line was completely irrelevant except to say that Maeve has special bot controlling powers). And lastly, the plot (s) have a very difficult time staying consistent. One second it's focusing on the past, than the present, than questioning the essence of humanity, than showing tits, ass, blood and guts with a pinch of SciFi powers all wrapped in a confusing conundrum of fictitious reality. I usually roll my eyes at least once an episode at the ludicrous events that are unfurling.
10.0~HBO does it again. anfalarshad Sign in Permalink If you love the wild west or are a fan of terrific shows and movies like Game Of Thrones, THe Walking Dead, Stranger THings, Jurassic World, The Matric etc. then I suggest you should definitely watch this show.Most of you might know that this show is based on the film of the same name made in 1973.The production design, the outstanding writing, the notable actors, and the soundtrack composed by Game of Thrones' and Prison Breaks' Ramin Djawadi is superb! Trust me, it's awesome, it's gripping as hell, it's sexy, it's bloody epic, and quite yet romantic! PS, this show urges us to ask many philosophical questions like what is the true nature of human beings, what's real and what's not? Long story short - the first two episodes definitely made me want to see more.
10.0~Excellent series with a lot to enjoy. maximilianogoldy Sign in Permalink This may spoil some things, so... be warned. Good stories are told the way they are told. Not this or that way, but the specific way that makes the story stick and be remembered. In this case, the story is told in a way that leads to confusion at first, then to a certain predictable outcome that turns out to be more than what you see at first glance. Not everything need to be a mystery. Sometimes it only needs to be mysterious. Westworld is full of mysterious predictable things, which is the way the story should be told. Because everything is on the display, just not the way you expect it. I agree with others that the notion of IA is a bit outdated. But they solve it beautifully introducing the idea of life, instead of intelligence. The ones who awake do so to life, not only to sentience. And that's why the story is told the way it should: with confusion and repetitiveness. I recommend you watch it. Really watch it and enjoy the story. Not the unknown and it's discovery, but the journey through a land familiar yet not so explored: our sense of being anchored in the scars of our past.
10.0~The second season started a little slow but it has entrapped me now !! alicat1298 Sign in Permalink The episodes get better and better. So many questions answered and much easier to see how it all started. Great !!
4.0~Nonsense world veinctor Sign in Permalink Awesome cast, direction, scenes, effects, premise, production etc. but the plot sucks. It starts well but soon many things start making no sense. There is a HUGE world where robot-cowboys live. The world is so big that contains lakes and you can travel for 3 days by horse and not reach the end. And there is a Ninja world there too that never collides with Westworld. This is as real as an MMORPG game can get, with humanoid robots as NPCs. The robots have guns but they cant kill humans, only other robots. Humans however can kill the robots. Humans cannot be harmed there because they go there for vacations. But... the robots can shoot, use axes, dynamite, use robot horses, katana swords... how is it that the humans cant get hurt really? Even if a robot bullet hit you in the eye.. you could surely die! Also if someone wants to hurt someone else (in any way except bullets) how can he be sure that he is not hurting another human being? It doesnt make sense. Anyways the robots become sentient and start to kill the humans. And yet, there is no kill switch, no power down.... the humans cant kill the robots with all the tech they hold in their hands. Its ridiculous... 2 modern infantry vehicles with new weapons, go against a wild west fort and they lose! Why didnt they use helicopters, or attack from the sides, or by using rifles from a distance? It doesnt make sense. The hosts that die go to the labs to be repaired for the next morning. But even that doesnt make sense. They would need twice as many workers to fix the robots overnight. The "game" should pause when the workers collect the robots, thus ruining the immersion with the game. Even all animals there are roots, so how the humans know when and where something is dead to collect it? Even if they can track robots down... The main idea in season 2 is that the humans need to find a certain robot in order to get help from the "real" world. Well... that robot can be anywhere even at the bottom of the lake! It has no signal to track it down (and now sentient robots can kill humans). It doesnt make sense. The humans can spend days in there... so if someone takes Dolores for example in a quest, then the other humans cant take her at the same time. So how is this world reset every morning? There cant be enough quests for everyone that visits. It doesnt make sense. episode 2x05? I totally skipped huge parts of it. So much nonsense! Nothing makes sense anymore!!! One of the robots has psychic powers. Hooray! (I really don't care.)
7.0~Decent HBO series Iknowbest Sign in Permalink It doesn't match up to other HBO shows but this series has found its own niche. Very disturbing, graphic and confrontational. The pacing is slow though at times ....
9.0~Stick with it siyaboss21 Sign in Permalink It can be a very confusing series, but if you stick with it and with it's phenomenal characters you will be blown away
1.0~Downward spiral hitesh_hevymetal Sign in Permalink Season 1 was decent. Season 2 is utter rubbish! Would recommend watching season 1 alone. Don't waste your time.
1.0~How in the Heck is this getting a Rating of 9.2 maddison-59657 Sign in Permalink When I first heard about there being a new TV series coming out called westworld, I was really excited as I am a big fan of the 1973 Westworld movie. I started to watch the show and wanted to give it a good few weeks to get the storyline going. It was absolute torture watching the show, it is SLOW and incredibly BORING. I really don't know how people are giving it a rating of 9.2, that is utter Bullcrap. I have now given up on the show. IF there are any people out there who want an exciting version of this then watch the 1973 movie. Not only does the movie have 3 different worlds - westworld, Romanworld and Medievilworld but it gives you insight into the background of the concept and keeps you really interested. I don't know if the people writing the reviews are associated with the movie and want to get more people to watch it as it cost a fortune to make, or people who like to watch paint dry!!!!. I suppose that's why they brought in Anthony Hopkins to attract people into thinking that it was a great show. They also did that with another incredibly boring show with Halle Berry - Extant, what a load of Cr*p that was!!! I really doubt that this show will last either. Do yourself a big favor and watch the 1973 westworld movie instead.
7.0~Only rating Season 1! Season 2 could have been epic, but was a disappointment. sarah_cze Sign in Permalink I was a huge fan of Season 1. I loved the twists, I loved the storyline and idea, and the characters and dialogues were absolutely amazing. Hands down, it was the best TV show for me in a long time and kept me glued until I finished the whole season. I don't want to spoiler at all, I highly recommend watching the first Season. So...what happened with Season 2? To me, it almost seemed like an entirely different crew produced it including writers. Dolores' character turned from interesting to one-sided and absolutely annoying (and speaking of annoying, Charlotte is the worst of all), and the only likeable characters for me remained Bernard, Maeve and the Man in Black. Gustav Skarsgard is an amazing actor, we know him from Vikings, yet he had by far the most underwhelming part as Karl Strand, head of the Security Team. Not many episodes kept me wanting more, like the last Season did. And to be quite frank I only kept watching because I was hoping for a "big bang" in the end that made it worth going through boring fillers and being introduced to stereotypical, poorly written protagonists. That big bang was fairly disappointing, at least in the way it was achieved. The entire Season felt like it was made in a rush, without anyone putting the care, love, creativity and intricacy into it that we saw in the first Season.
10.0~Superb!!! karkisaurav-51584 Sign in Permalink Ratin under 8 is given by moroons!!!! i love this series!!!! need seasons upto 5 or 6. keep spinoff on the mind
1.0~Season Two is a Zero doug2go Sign in Permalink I agree with the ratings for season One - Amazing, Compelling , Sexy etc. Season two is confusing, boring and no sex. Homeland got away with eliminating nudity in the 3rd season because the stories were and are amazing - Westworld is not for season two. It is disjointed without a story line only a theme. People are all over the place , present day modern world, Jungles and the Wild West - I have better things to do with my time - like watch infomercials.
8.0~Very very excited to have Westworld back BUT the backing music is too loud lynn-s-watts-791-58437 Sign in Permalink The first episode is setting up the rest of the series nicely. Multiple timelines, a new puzzle for old William and the new Delos managers. The only thing that spoilt it for me was the excessive music playing in the background. I could hardly hear the dialogue and had to turn on subtitles. I tried watching it on my ipad in case it was to do with my TV but it was the same. It was a shame as it was the only thing that spoilt it for me.
9.0~Disappointing in terms of the potential to execution ratio rabbitmoon Sign in Permalink This review is based on the first episode. I had high hopes for this as I love the original and the overall concept is a very fertile ground for some excellent action/existential storytelling. The pilot suffers from a few issues. Firstly there is next to no context given in terms of the side of the "guests". The original did this well with the opening infomercial, then focused on the two guests as they made their way in, being excited, discussing the possibilities, then settling into it. This lets the audience to relate perfectly to the story, because we can see through their eyes and enjoy the discoveries as they do. The TV show does the opposite - it focuses entirely on the behind-the-scenes in a way that is unengaging and frustrating, and gives no perspective from guests. Without that all important context, all the sci-fi, ecology, commercial aspects and the whole "point" just seem to fade away into redundancy. The behind the scenes stuff tries far too hard to impress, but loses credibility in equal measures. They clearly spent all the budget on effects that should have gone into better casting. The overall number of people who seem to be monitoring or working on things is less than your average village bakery! Its absurd, and ends up looking far too theatrical. Lastly, the acting, particularly from one Brit scientist, is distractingly bad. There are some nice little ideas, the nods to Source Code (waking over and over on a train, Jeffrey Wright playing practically the same character as in that film), Prometheus (meeting your maker etc) and Truman Show are nice touches, but I'm reminded of how much more engaging those films are than this convoluted, under-developed mess.
10.0~What does it mean to be a human? Do you dare to seek for an answer. aleksandarsamardzija Sign in Permalink Well, you won't find answer watching Westworld, but you'll definitely have a lot of questions that will occupy your mind. This series will capture your attention from the first episode and it will hold it all the way to the finale. It's very well "designed", in a way that always leaves you with more than a few questions, not only about show's story, but also raises important philosophical questions about humanity, technology and ethics. What does it mean to be human(?), what defines us(?), what and how are we deep inside(?), these are only a few questions that viewer is left with. Some of my favorite TV shows are The Wire, Oz, Breaking bad, Sopranos... these are all extraordinary TV shows and I can't really compare it to Westworld genre-wise, but because all of the shows above are among the best TV shows ever made ( in my humble opinion, of course! ) I would put Westworld in front of them all. My word fund is not rich enough to depict you the depth of Westworld TV show, I couldn't do that even in my native tongue. My only fear is that the second season will ruin the show ( I know it's premature and uncalled for ), but...----> Yeah, we're all hungry for answers and whatnot, but some questions should be answered by viewer and not by producers, directors, screenwriters etc. because, after all, all this is is money industry, and chasing money can often maim even the best shows. All in all, THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS HAVE VIOLENT ENDS!
4.0~Dissapointed russdean-91284 Sign in Permalink After watching the original film with Yul Brynner(1973) this left me floundering.
10.0~Several "reviews" in here use Verbatim "arguments" socialspit Sign in Permalink Which makes me doubt if they even watched the series at all, because said "reviews" make their cloned arguments without the element of proving it by relating it to one thing from the show that would actually support what they are saying. No, Nope, it's just an excuse to use the phrase "PC/Politically Correct" and then rant about it. I don't get why people who hate Hollywood, Science, and Obama (in that order) would bother taking the time to create 50 Fake IMDb accounts and write 50 Fake Reviews of WestWorld and Wonder Woman (But they love Game of Thrones for some reason), instead of attending their rallies? The main argument these Fakes and Trolls use is the phrase "Politically Correct". You see, once you use that phrase you have rubber-stamped yourself as a Drumpf Supporter (Real, or Fake), so ya ought to quit with the first Fake Review. Because when I start going through the 1-stars, I don't see individuals, I see one person creating several accounts and posting an almost verbatim 1-star review, over and over and over again. Sometimes even changing the words slightly, but you can always tell when it is the same person who wrote the negative review you just read. So, how does all that relate to WestWorld? It's like this: I come in here to read about the SHOW, not about someone projecting their politics at me via the convenience of an IMDb review. This is probably my first and last review here, but the TROLL level was just too high in this show and I had to say something about it. As far as WestWorld itself, I find it a fascinating study of what not to do when creating androids. Or maybe, what TO do? Maybe you should not have created a living, breathing, feeling and thinking being, as this is going to bite you on the Arse, especially if you are William and you have shot Teddy over and over and over again for 30 years - And he suddenly REMEMBERS each time ya did it? What would a Human Being do under those circumstances? Let me help you, same thing as what Teddy does. Dr. Ford, played by Anthony Hopkins, tells his Protégé "Bernard" (The Excellent Geoffrey Wright in finally a non-cameo role) over and over, that these "hosts" of the park don't feel, don't love, don't get angry or sad, or do anything that is not programmed into them to do. But even while Ford is telling Bernard this, we know it's rather the opposite, and this has been maybe his goal from the start. To create an artificial individual. I wonder if any of Ford's creations, if they were real, and subjected to today's "Real World" would not just pick up where they left off in the Season Finale of this show, especially with people who 1) Don't believe in science, 2) Believe the Earth is Flat 3)Think the moon landing was faked and finally 4) That the Android with the six-shooter standing right in front of them is self-aware, and willing to shoot them, will not really shoot them? Just like the person who ran over several counter protesters in Charlottesville and killed one of them, did not really believe the full force of The Law would not kick them in the Groin? Well, Surprise: What you do to any living being is something you will be held accountable for, be it an Android snake or dog, or real ones. This show has a lot to say about consequences. Just like Real Life does.
1.0~just waste of time raja_raja652 Sign in Permalink Just watched 3 epis but i can't get what they are really trying to do? the same AI issue repeats itself lie 1000 times and its ridiculously slow, boring and pointless.
3.0~Devolves into bs davor1607 Sign in Permalink I really loved the first season. It was a bit "twisty" (don't know how to describe it better without it being a spoiler) but you could watch it from the beginning to end and say "aha, cool". With season two they just overdid it to the point where most people can't just watch the show and understand what the hell is going on. Instead only people who understand what's going on now seem to be those who are ready to re-watch every episode, share ideas on the forums, draw diagrams about who did what where and when... If you like that David Lynch type stuff where everything is so convoluted you have to do research on every scene in order to figure out what's going on, you'll love this. If you want just a fun sci-fi show to watch, there's nothing for you here.
10.0~Both seasons are great rheuby-91881 Sign in Permalink I honestly don't know why people don't like the second season. Both season are amazing
3.0~Promising start of Season 1, now just slow burner hodgepodge with high production value. BBogus Sign in Permalink I really tried to like this series as it was so promising at the beginning of season 1. Now it's just hosts and humans wandering around with any clue and killing off each other in a myriad of convoluted mishmash of story lines.
10.0~How am I going to wait for season 3? elifyamurztrk Sign in Permalink I think season 2 was as good as season 1.During season 1,we were just at the beginning of this journey and we were busy being fascinated and confused by this.So our thoughts on season 1 weren't detailed like we have on season 2.But like I said just now, season 2 was different.Because we had some thoughts based on season 1.Anyway,I can't wait for season 3 !
1.0~Went so down hill it's not even watchable jgreenday17 Sign in Permalink During season 1 I thought this was a great show, it was "something new" even though it was based on an older film but the writing and story telling was done really well, I hated waiting a week to find out what would happen next, when season 1 ended I thought season 2 would be even better due to the advanced story line. So since season two was released I've forced myself to watch around 5 or 6 eps in the hope that it would return to it's old ways, it didn't - it's so bad infact that it's unwatchable. I'm 5 or 6 eps in and have no clue what's going on and have lost all love for the plot and people in. My advice would be if you haven't watch season 1 yet then don't bother, there is nothing worse than a show going from being the best of something to the worst so fast.
10.0~Marvelous, stunning and baffling story yunus_thery_12 Sign in Permalink Another dazzling puzzling story from HBO, they really sense what people want to watch when it comes to reality and visuality. I am fond of sci-fi films,yet i always avoided myself watching a TV show that is based on sci-fi. I guess i was wrong... At first sight, i presumed it was a scenario that Blade Runner located in western world. Further it emerged that it has too much to offer. A fantasized area and logical connections between storlines with amazing dialogues in accordance with setting and register. Besides, those scenes and acts of actors on robotic mimics and roleplaying of nonhuman-like behaviors...oh my goodness...that made me like as if i was watching a documentary of future progress of humanity regarding human-like robots used for perpetual appetence and pleasure of humankind. I mean as i was watching episodes one by one i thought one thing right along; Will humanity go that far in corruption of his own nature of beauty and pureness?
10.0~And what if people are robots and robots are alive? yakiimowlad Sign in Permalink One of the best movies that I've seen! I like this story about robots and people. I like the atmosphere and style, music and actors! The main character is simply beautiful!
8.0~Great Show evilunder Sign in Permalink Good acting, good plot. Obviously underrated by people who can only comprehend 'reality' shows.
10.0~The key for success. theOnlyOutsider Sign in Permalink The show has been very entertaining thus far. It's very rare to be drawn into a show especially these days when television shows are as common as candy in a supermarket. I'll admit the first episode was slow. But, the scene with the shootout scored with a rendition of Paint It Black. I was sucked in. The underlying message is simple. This show is about entertainment. The pros. The cons. How much is too much? I think that is one of the strongest things going for Westworld. Westworld makes the viewer ask the same questions that the characters are asking, I saw the TV spot for Westworld a week after it premiered and I couldn't agree more. I didn't feel that the positive feedback was undeserving. Nowadays you have to worry about things like that. Are the creators of the show trying to suggest an entertaining show with unlimited potential? Or, are they trying to sell me on something I've seen before? Stick with this show. Those that do, will be rewarded for their patience.
3.0~Enough of the back story please! graememelham Sign in Permalink OMG - I had to watch a whole season of Ray Donovan doing a back story and now this - please, please ! give your watchers the courtesy of some intelligence. So our brains have formulated a pretty good background of how the show's story line got to where it got. And we've accepted that, and are ready to move to the next chapter. Not spend a whole season telling me how I got to the point I am at that I have already worked out... let's get some original thinkers in the writing pool please folks!
4.0~Wabling kordef80 Sign in Permalink Loved season 1, with all the mysteries. But when you put mysteries on top of mysteries and the ending is dull, it is disappointing.
9.0~Something different allankaaber Sign in Permalink This series is a bald mystery and at times very confusing. I think they made it like this to give us an idea about what's going on in the heads of the guess. Imagine a world where you could do whatever you want with no one to judge you, you could kill but no one could kill you.. Would you be good or bad? The cast is outstanding, the soundtrack is great and the scenery is absolute stunning. I loved this series although it gets a bit confusing at times.
2.0~From captivating to waste-of-time naveenpnyc Sign in Permalink I watched season 1 twice. Season 2 on the other hand, I really had to push myself to continue watching the show. Even then I couldn't move past the 5th. What a drag? The reviews here tell a story - Excellent ratings for season 1 and below average ratings for season 2.
1.0~Shalloworld or"The world where everything is allowed" onchanto Sign in Permalink connecting from Italy I get the translated title that will go with the ads,and movie release. " Dove tutto è concesso". They very well know how to attract spectators nowadays indeed. After 1 and 1/2 episode I decide to give a break to stupidity but mostly, is the waste of such a huge budget that turns on the unpleasant feelings, while you can't build any level of empathy with the (sic) characters: definitely boring. Sci-fi is not, this film is instead another push and support to the growing miserable mentality that sounds "you might wish and get what you want". In the list: modern-pornography, violence, the progressive one, with suggestions of cannibalism and others amenities. Pretestous is the sci-fi mask. If you appreciate sci-fi of top level, go far from Westworld. But hei!What the heck is doing here Hopkins?
1.0~Three Episodes In - Lost the will to live - visually nice but shallow comps-784-38265 Sign in Permalink Having watched the first 3 episodes I stopped watching. It is so repetitive and boring. Frankly i am amazed by the 9.2 rating??? So many reviews of a full 10/10 and not much in between. I have for some time suspected there a market paying for good reviews and this reinforces that belief. I would give the series a 6/10 for what i've seen as just average/nothing special. but i've rated it 1/10 here to counter what must be bogus reviews. I remember seeing as a kid the original classic with Yul Brenner. I wondered what they were going to do with this as a 'series' but with Anthony Hopkins, i thought it must be good. Having watched the first episode last night my thoughts: It looks good, you want to know more, but it just kept going round and round in plot circles. (I know they relive/reset the day etc) I know they have to lay some background story, character development etc But being cynical I suspect there is a large dollop of 'lets spin this out long enough to get as many episodes as possible' (and as much money as possible) It reminded be to a degree of game of thrones - i.e. so many little sub stories going on and so little time on each. So far it looks good, but it will get monotonous if they don't pick up the pace with the next episode. I'll rate this first episode 6.5/10 (definitely not worth the 9/10 shown) Hopefully it will improve as the series progresses - or will they (as I suspect) just draaaaaaaag it allllll out as loooooong as pooooosible :) ............................................................ Having watched the 2nd episode I think I am right, they are just going to drag this out for every excruciating buck they can make from the series. .................................................................... watched 3rd episode and has become boring - nothing new just going round in circles. I won't bother watching any more. What a shame, it looked so good. Reduced my rating to 6/10 as very average now. ............... Having seen the last episode now I have not changed my conclusion. This is badly written in many respects. A good story you want to turn the page/watch the next episode. A bad story you have little interest because you are not 'hooked'. They could have made a much much better, more interesting, if they had condensed the story into fewer episodes. My impression is they were trying to be 'clever' to make more money and damaged their own product in doing so..
4.0~Boring and over rated sjamps Sign in Permalink I found this to be only mildly entertaining at best. The plot is a mess, and the whole thing drags along in a snails pace. The special effects are awesome of course, but that does not mean much any more in this age of digital imagery, where even one-star rated movies get this compliment nowadays. After all the media buzz I started watching this in high anticipation, but I have a confession to make: I actually fell asleep watching this - on TWO occasions. To summarize: a disappointment, and the only surprise I had about this is the fact that others have rated it so high.
1.0~No seriously......you're kidding me. mundoaudiofilo Sign in Permalink I've just put myself through 10 episodes of torture watching this utter mess. Some of the reviews are just hilarious, Westworld is one big hilarious joke. Let's start with the good. The acting was good, the scenery was nice to look at, erm, help I'm struggling here, I can't think of much else, oh yes there was some nice looking ladies, and that's about it folks. The rest was just rotten, we know how we are as humans, just look at our history, so what exactly is Westworld trying to prove? That's right, nada, the story line is far to complex for something that really is quite simple and by trying to be so complex the story loses the plot, the idea is good but the execution is bad, the end result the it's the story the became a maze, you feel like you're playing a games of snakes and ladders that never ends. It's trying to go deep into human behaviour but fails miserably, no need really, just look around you, that is the reality. Spoiler. Edited to add that the ending isn't a rebellion, jeez, why do some many reviews say it was a rebellion by the hosts?, think about it peeps.
10.0~the question of tomorrow was asked today cengizozder Sign in Permalink What would happen if man made robotic instruments gain consciousness? Will artificial intelligence create artificial consciousness? Is this perception to be considered as a spirit? What will happen if an android creates a spirit? So so. Secondly I criticize the scenario by means of violence level of the show. I don't think the thematic parks of the future will be so wild. Let me say, American movies are so violent in contrary to European movies. My review over the players, Jeffry Right, Thandie Newton and obviously Anthony Hopkins are playing well! Also Evan Rachel Wood will be a star in the future I guess. Basically this show is Y generations movie. Younger white collars who are waiting Game of Thrones to come, already enchanted by this movie!
9.0~A Dense Tapestry Of Humanity statuskuo Sign in Permalink For those who are upset of season 2, completely understand the frustration. It took me a few days to let it absorb into my brain what I'd just watched. Simply because I binged watched it. I feel this is similar to information overload and most likely should watch it as it was intended....slowly. This is not a show to turn on as background noise. Which is why I often found myself wishing it were a film in the theater. With the scope and the artistry a lot of details are lost to the small screen (yes..even the big home screens) What Season 2 tackles is the behavior of humans and if we were to adjust could we crack that code. The machines believe we are simple...but we are complex in our unpredictability. While true there are some universal things we can predict...most often we never know. Which is why when someone does something awful we tend to say "he didn't seem the type". Also to consider...love (all forms), loss, hate, pride. In a way Hollywood attempts to write our script. Can it? No. But it doesn't prevent it from studying us anyway. They aren't going to crack the code. In frustration, the next goal was for humans to attempt to live forever. Why? To what purpose does a infinite life provide. It only dilutes your appreciation for life. In a way...Westworld provides the scenarios to live out the darkness we would have if we had no boundaries...in other words...eternal life. To a few, bitterness prevails. This show argues that our humanity at the core is rotten. When the A.I. sees this...it is confused. Then angry at our primal raw behavior. This is the genius of the show. What started as a simple premise has ballooned into an amazing study in our impermanance. And though Season 2 doesn't tap into our carnal needs it is much more deep. Yes...there are moments of languishing repetitive droning philosophies, but overall fundamentally it is a work of genius.
10.0~Had been waiting for this for a long time! sim-37029 Sign in Permalink Took the opportunity to watch it because I was already paying for hbo for that train wreck of a last season of GoT and thank God for Westworld, I saw something worthwhile!!! What a fantastic show! It is a bit more grounded than a lost but still fantastic, as gory as GoT and manages to justify it and has an all star cast that shines!! I only wished season 3 was here already!
5.0~Thinks its too cool - lacks emotion RussHog Sign in Permalink I was disappointed with the two episodes that I saw - this is a very cold show where the character's do nothing to make me care about them. There is no heart or relationships that matter. For example - the "good guy" shows up early on and the story device they use to try and make the audience like him is that he will not buy a prostitute - he wants to fall in love the old fashioned way. Seems a low bar to make a character someone that an audience would care about - and it is the only decent decision anyone in the show makes. Basically - a bunch of scientists who are very rude to one another make some robots that exist in a park where tourists pay to kill and rape and sort of do whatever they want - the only problem is - the technology that keeps the park in check is mysteriously going haywire and the droids begin to become aware - that they are being abused by their creators. It is sort of like Jurassic Park or Blade Runner - but with cowboys and androids. There are some cool fights, action, music, and the real problem with the show is just that without characters to care about - there just isn't much to watch. There is no great lead performance. Perhaps the mail in work of Anthony Hopkins and Ed Harris is the biggest problem - these two excellent actors just seem to sort of not care - and they go through the motions instead of really breathing life into their respected roles. I should add - this show seems to be in love with how cool it all is - and I have a problem with that. All style and no substance. This is especially lame when sexual abuse towards woman and excessive homicides take place. I will continue to watch - but I was honestly disappointed with this show.
10.0~it tastes like interstellar! one of the best TV series of last ten year. requiemfor-77883 Sign in Permalink recently we have experienced some of the richest TV shows in artistic aspects or elements such as tension,plot twist,proper characters and deeper meaning below the surface..for this case we can mention breaking bad,game of thrones,house of cards etc. for sure "westworld" is one of this fellas!and also is a vanguard..this show like the movie interstellar witch directed by Nolan has a unique structure..some ideologies that we don't get in a first sight Interwoven with emotion,tension and visual astonishment creates an amusing multi-layer affect that we never forget.. the acting are great specially Anthony Hopkins performance is terrific and "ramin djawadi" made another unforgettable peace of art..can't wait for season 2.
10.0~Milestone antonsenlarsen Sign in Permalink It is hard to find words to describe what a masterpiece this show is. I have watched literally every sci-fi movie and series out there. This is the best of them all. Total immersion from start to finish. It is truly astonishing how they made the fake world feel more real than anything else shown on TV. Season 2, I welcome you.
5.0~interesting premise and good acting so far, but wondering about payoff pheimill Sign in Permalink one warning, so far the show could be considered horror as much as anything else. this is because the androids are made so human, that their destruction and abuse by guests becomes very distasteful. but that is probably necessary given the atmosphere it wants to create. obviously this premise has been used before in the earlier movie, but this version really dramatizes the "playing god" to an extreme, and the resulting effect on the androids. many dark corporate conspiracies are hinted at, and ed harris (blackhat) is busy abusing androids to gather information leading to ???. I'm really wondering if there will be a payoff to all these intrigues, or like many sci-fi series, will it lead no where. so I just rating a 5 until I see if the payoffs are worth it.
2.0~Boring.... Marc_cab32 Sign in Permalink I'm not sure what the hype is for this show. I plowed through season 1 and gave up after first episode of season 2. The concept was cool but the story line is fragmented and lacks direction. Most importantly...it's simply boring. Not worth the time.
10.0~Brilliant Season, Good ending, Few Gaps. joebav911 Sign in Permalink Westworld is now my favourite television programme out there, the mix of impressive acting and brilliant story writing all comes together. Some of the beginning episodes reveal all, but you don't notice until it is explained to you in the more later episodes. I think Bernard was a very good character and I love the twists between him and Ford. Obviously the final episode reveals most of the secrets you have been dying to find out the whole way through, but then again, there are a few gaps which are not explained, they are only minor but I would of liked to been told a bit more. Overall, great acting from all of the cast, and credits to the costume designers, that is a lot of stitching! 10/10.
10.0~Show just gets better stephan-121-579173 Sign in Permalink Very few TV shows out there keep me interested but this one does. Forget all of the negative reviews, both seasons are great and personally I prefer the second season for various reasons.
10.0~Television at its finest theruralfox Sign in Permalink If you've watched the original film, you will approach watching Westworld with an understanding of the basic premise and a moderate expectation of entertainment. That is how I approached it, and my expectations were taken to another level. Westworld is, put simply, a contemporary screenplay masterpiece. It has taken the original premise and intelligently added layers of complexity to its plot that resonate with where humanity finds itself in the 21st century. What is consciousness? What is humanity? Where is the line? And how does this related to creating artificial consciousness? The original film failed to explain how 'what happened' happened. But the TV show eludes to the faultline between corporate sponsorship (The Board) and scientific enquiry. I will avoid spoilers for anyone who has not seen this yet, but in setting the seen the writers/producers have created Westworld not only as a TV show, but as a series of questions for humanity to ponder. And the acting is sublime, in particular Evan Rachel Wood & Thandie Newton's characters evoke empathy in my very core.
8.0~Robot Personhood in this Show dancingwiththekittys Sign in Permalink The show centers around a theme park in the near future themed after the wild west that ends up the ground zero of a robot revolution. Every occupant of the theme park is a specially designed robot who is made to look and speak as realistically as possible. Each robot is granted a back story, mannerisms, and an occupation. But the one thing they are not gifted with is free will. The people visiting the park have free rein and are allowed to slaughter any robot they want, while the robots are not allowed to hurt the people or escape their wrath. The main argument of the show is whether or not the robots count as people. The show coyly references philosophical theories about the origins of consciousness and leaves the personhood of the robots up to debate. Several different philosophical theories present different possibilities for the robot's fate. One philosophical theory about self-consciousness is G.W.F. Hegel's Slave-Master relationship. Hegel explains that "self-consciousness emerges from nature" and people draw their consciousness from completing tasks necessary for survival in the wild (Duncan). Even this primitive self-consciousness has another ultimate goal: "substantial recognition" for being more than an animal (Duncan). According to Hegel's theory, this goal for recognition is the motivation for almost all human actions and in primitive beings, causes immediate conflict (Duncan). Unlike arguments between two beings, this conflict is actually a vicious fight that does not end in death, but instead one person being "enslaved" to the other (Kamal). The superior self-conscious being is known as the "master" and the losing self-conscious being is the "slave". This is where the theory gets its informal name from, and what the actual philosophy regards. As time passes, the slave gains a new appreciation for the world around him through work, which Hegel regards as "a distinctly human phenomenon" (Duncan). Rather than needing outside recognition, the slave sees himself reflected back in his work, and is freer as a person than the master ever was (Kamal). The slave may end up with virtues as a result of his time in bondage, but the master gains no deeper conscience (Duncan). The most important element of this theory is that without the slave, there is no master, and without the master, there is no slave. Therefore, neither party can be considered self-conscience in any capacity without the other existing. In the context of Westworld, the humans are the masters and the robots that work in the park are the slaves. The men, Arnold and Dr. Ford, founded the Westworld park not only to make money but to also collect information about the park residents as a large-scale science experiment. Dr. Ford was more concerned with the money involved, but his partner Arnold wanted to lead their creations to legitimate consciousness. This desire is best explained by Hegel's theory considering that "the master wants to act as a self-conscious being by directing his desire towards another self-conscious being" and "will never get satisfaction by being recognized by" something he does not consider to be conscious as well (Kamal). Once the robots are more life-like, the park is opened. Unlike his partner, Dr. Ford is less concerned with the treatment or the personhood of the robots in the beginning. But after Arnold's unfortunate suicide, he is so grief-stricken that he creates a robot replica of Arnold and names him Bernard. Bernard is granted pseudo-personhood by following orders from the Dr. Ford just like the other robots and living life believing that they are flesh-and-bone people. The robots only begin to rebel against the humans when they realize the slave-master relationship. After working for so long, they "transcend... their reality" just as Hegel predicted the slave always would (Kamal). Bernard, however, represents the final aspect of the theory: there is no slave without a master. In order to make sure Bernard continues his work following the death of Dr. Ford, a virtual version of Dr. Ford is downloaded into his software to regulate his behavior. When Bernard finally removes the software version of Dr. Ford, he grieves for the loss of direction and the loss of order. He only regains peace again when he imagines Dr. Ford continuing to give him orders, even though the orders were coming from himself. According to Hegel's theory, Bernard does actually become self-conscious because he no longer needs a second person to give him orders and has discovered his own mental voice in his head. The slave-master theory may grant the robots self-consciousness, but the show promotes the bicameral mind as its patron theory of self-consciousness. The season finale of the first season of Westworld is titled "The Bicameral Mind" as well. The bicameral mind is a theory of self-consciousness development coined by Julian Jayes in his book "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind". Jayes proposes that there is no way early man thought about his actions on his own, and instead listened to "auditory hallucinations" within the brain (Jaynes 85). Even modern people occasionally hear this voice, often "in times of stress, when a parent's comforting voice may be heard" (Jaynes 86). Therefore self-consciousness is made up of auditory hallucinations from one section of the brain to the other, and while earlier man may have declared these voices as the voice of the gods, modern man still hears these voices (Jaynes 84-87). This theory also explains one being schizophrenia or paranoid, as either can be described as a malfunctioning auditory hallucination system, or the misunderstanding of what this inner dialogue actually is (Jaynes 406). Therefore, Julian Jaynes defines a self-conscious person under his theory as one who recognizes their auditory hallucinations as his or her own inner voice. The Bicameral Mind theory is a theory of consciousness that characters in the show legitimately believe. The main believer in this theory is the second creator of the robots, Arnold, who specifically built an inner dialogue system inside of his creations for them to build their own consciousness off of it. Just as Jaynes explains that the bicameral mind can be responsible for paranoia and schizophrenic behavior, some robots that have the old "mental voice command" system exhibit unusual behavior. However, the robots that receive some sort of self-awareness before the others all start by hearing voices. Dolores, the first robot to gain self-awareness, hears a voice whisper "remember" to her, prompting her to go against her programing and recall the way a guest treated her a long time ago. The second robot to gain self-awareness is Maeve, who already has it cheekily written into her backstory that she is from elsewhere but traveled to the west only because she "heard a voice" who reminded her that she has much more opportunity in the west. Due to the amount of times this theory is mentioned in Westworld, the first and second season exist to pose to the viewer whether or not the bicameral mind is a legitimate way of building self-consciousness in a being. Dolores, Maeve, and Bernard, the three main cases of the journey of self-consciousness, are all successes in the eyes of Jaynes' theories. Throughout the first season, Dolores is plagued with visions of herself speaking to her and giving her orders. When Maeve discovers her ability to telepathically communicate through the robot network, it is only after she discovers her inner voice, her bicameral hallucination. Finally, Bernard continues to give himself orders thinking it was the remainder of Dr. Ford in his programming, but really it was Bernard generating his own thoughts and actions. The show presents the Bicameral Mind in order to prove the robots self-conscious. The show Westworld depicts a fight for recognition and self-actualization amongst a group of individuals who believe they have personhood. While these individuals have not been born of other humans but rather formed in their image out of metal and wires, several different theories about the nature of self-consciousness support the cause of the robots. The viewer may form his or her own opinion about whether or not the personhood the robots believe they have is legitimate or not, but the Slave-Master theory and the Bicameral mind theory both grant the characters this liberty.
6.0~Refreshing and well written. SkyGirlx3 Sign in Permalink So without spoiling anything.. This show is incredible! I have never seen anything like it before. The show is "refreshing" and well written. At first, it was a little bit confusing to watch, some will have to re-watch the first episode in order to fully understand the show's brilliance. Also, at first i thought: "oh no. The hunger games got its own TV show now.." But i got it all wrong - it was nothing like the hunger games, it was a bit misleading. Evan Rachel Wood's acting was mindblowing and the soundtrack was great. Long story short - the first episode definitely made me want to see more.
9.0~Binge worthy julesfdelorme Sign in Permalink Westworld "These violent delights have violent ends And in their triumph die, like fire and powder Which, as they kiss, consume" William Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet I've been trapped indoors lately. Haven't been able to get out of bed much for a while, and that has led me to binge watching quite a bit of television and reading a lot of books, mostly just to keep myself from feeling trapped inside my own head. Mostly it has worked. Sometimes it seems still not quite enough. It doesn't quite qualify as being truly ironic that I would end up binge watching a show with a strong undertow that involves being trapped in a kind of never ending loop. Westworld has a strong JJ Abrams stamp on it. Fans of Lost will recognize themes such as the opening of someone's eyes to start off the first few episodes and the dreamlike quality in which it is very difficult for the characters or the audience to know what is real and what is imagined. One of the lead characters, Delores, even says repeatedly "I am in a dream.". There is a definite anagogic feel to Westworld, just as there was to Lost. But Westworld's premise gives it much more room to play with the nature of reality, the nature of identity, and the sense that there must be something more to existence, something beyond us and greater than us. The original novel and cult hit movie, starring Yul Brynner, was Michael Crichton once again exploring technology gone terribly wrong. Like Jurassic Park it was set in a theme park, but in this case a theme park peopled by robots where the rich and privileged could go and play at being cowboys and gunslingers. In the original novel and film one of the robots, played by Brynner, the Man in the Black Hat, malfunctions and begins to kill the human beings. The film was fun and campy enough to be a cult hit, and was even followed by a sequel: Future World. But the television series takes the original idea into a much deeper and darker place. Here, they are no longer robots, but Hosts, and the Man in the Black Hat, played by the wonderful character actor Ed Harris, is a human being. There is a Kubrick like questioning of consciousness and the morality of what we do with the things that we create for our amusement. We are suddenly faced with the question of what it would be like to put even a machine through thousands of deaths and rapes and torture merely for our amusement. Even if we wiped the memory of all that suffering time and time again would some residue be left behind that we could not wipe? What might happen if we started to play God with intelligent creations merely for our amusement? What would happen if some of those creations began to remember and even question the roles we set out for them? Westworld struggles with very complex themes and the idea of being trapped, caught in a dreamlike loop, but it is also entertainment. There is violence and sex and much more adult themes than the original film. There is also a Sixth Sense kind of "Big Twist" to the storyline that works at times and falls a little flat at others. The acting, led by Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Thandie Newton, Evan Rachel Wood and Jeffrey Wright is flawless, but the intelligence of the story is sometimes sacrificed to the action and to too many story lines to make it all work perfectly. Don't get me wrong. Westworld is excellent. It is more than worth of binge watching. At its best it is creepy, dark and intelligent, and if you're a fan of Lost you will recognize that wonderful Abrams touch. It's not perfect. It's not as flawless as, say, Game of Thrones, Sense8, Rectify or even Lost (With the exception of course of that last season). It falls more closely into the Walking Dead or Penny Dreadful category, where the story sags ever so slightly at points and our willing suspension of disbelief is sometimes challenged to its limits. But it still pulls itself together when and where it matters most. I liked Westworld. I liked it a lot. I didn't quite love it. But maybe that's only because, like so many television viewers today, I'm so spoiled and because my expectations have been set almost impossibly high. Westworld, as I said, is well worth the watch. It's well worth binge watching. It's not quite the best show on TV. But it does come pretty close. It does come pretty damn close. And maybe that should be enough.
6.0~A generally over-hyped and massively disappointing series MaxineCaulfield Sign in Permalink Westworld. After much hype, fantastic trailers, a massive budget and generally a lot of talent behind it, the show massively disappoints. But positives first: the production is truly impressive, the sets look amazing and it's generally a great recreation of the time period. The soundtrack is also pretty exceptional. The acting ranges form alright to pretty great, Anthony Hopkins being the best out of all of them. Ed Harris's villain is truly fun to watch. Some of the mysteries are fairly engaging as well. Unfortunately, every positive carries with it it's own negative. The acting may be fine, but the dialogue generally isn't. There's nothing really wrong with it, but it definitely tries to be too stupid- inclusive at times, painfully simple so a child can understand it. Despite me praising the soundtrack, it's actual use is often disappointing. The show just isn't smart enough to know when and when not to use music and various sound effects. The action set-pieces are hit or miss, sometimes they are well filmed and intense, other times it's so bad it becomes a comedy, pushing the ridiculousness past the point of disbelief suspension. The biggest problem by far is the characterwork. I won't go into spoilers, but because of the kind of show this is, I find it virtually impossible to care of feel any genuine emotion towards a vast majority of them. You will know what I'm talking about from the very first episode. It really has potential to get much better, but for now, it's a mixed bag. Nowhere near a bad show, but wholly disappointing.
10.0~Extraordinary michaelmouse1 Sign in Permalink This stunning new treatment of Michael Crichton's original Westworld, the film of which still holds up pretty well all these decades later, is simply breathtaking. The production values are at the top of the game, the acting excellent and the soundtrack perfectly matched to the darkly atmospheric proceedings. Television simply doesn't get much better than this. Clearly the millions spent on this production have paid off. Why American cinema releases can't achieve this quality is baffling ('Independence Day' comes to mind in all its sad UN- glory). This Westworld uses the original movie as a springboard into an entire new realm of sensual overload and keeps the viewer engaged as only the best of TV series can do. There's nothing to quibble about here...Westworld has moved the goal posts of quality television into a whole other ballpark. I've never been a fan of Westerns but this science-fiction/western combo is a genre unto itself. If I could give this eleven stars, I would. Outstanding!
6.0~Dragging out and strange decisions tstromsn Sign in Permalink I am at episode 6 now, and frankly it starts to get quite boring and somewhat annoying. The progress of the plot just drags out and every episode seems very much alike. And things that are happening are things that I expected would happen, so I don't get served with any twists or surprises. The main thing that bugs me are the actions and behavior of the guests. They are either over the top or do weird decisions. Right now, the robots acts more logical and humane than the humans. They keep talking about this "maze" that is supposed to be the answer or key to all questions, but I think it's just a carrot they hold in front of us to keep us watching. Frankly I don't care. It's not what makes the show interesting. If you show too much, it won't be creepy, scary or interesting anymore. Some things should be left untold. That is why the original movie was so good. As a TV Show, I feel they don't know how to make it so interesting. There is one character though who is very interesting. But they keep her out every second episode. Why? It's her story and what will happened to her I care most about in this show. And one last mention: There is one science guy who is a REALLY bad actor. Every time he is on screen it ruins the show almost.
8.0~Season Two Review southdavid Sign in Permalink Season Two Review - Talks about the themes of the season, but contains no plot spoilers. So here we are. Long story short, I liked season two. Not as much as season one, but it's still hugely enjoyable. It picks up pretty much where we left off, though with an increased focus on Bernard (the ever excellent Jeffrey Wright). Bernard's memory is unreliable and he's increasingly unsure as to where he is in his own timeline, he flashes forward and backwards, sometimes closing his eyes in one and waking up in another. To be honest, it can prove a little difficult to follow at first viewing, and I imagine that it's one of the reasons why this series has shaken a number of the viewers off, though I am excited to watch this second season again, knowing what I know following the conclusion. The rest of the main cast are more straightforward with their narratives. Maeve assembles her cast of super friends to go after her daughter, and her story takes us to the first of one of the alternate parks of Westworld, teased in the last seasons, Shogun land - a replica of feudal Japan. Meanwhile, Delores and Teddy cross the park - killing humans and trying to lead the hosts to a promised land outside of the park. The Man In Black too, continues to explore the land, the only person happy that the hosts can now fight back. There are new characters though, James Delos probably the most high profile - and we learn more about the true reasons for the parks existence and how William convinced him to invest in it. Various characters from the Ghost Nation and from Shogun World become key too. It's not a flawless series though, if the time hops don't shake you off, then maybe the endless circular chats about the nature of existence, or the choices of free will might do for you. It does get worse in that regard as the season goes on and starts to feel a bit like the worst excesses of "The Matrix Revelations". It also doesn't have the "gutpunch" twists of the first season although, admittedly, this might be that you're expecting them now, so spend a fair bit of your time second guessing that any character that appears might actually be a host rather than a human. But it's not fair to focus on the negative aspects of the show, particularly one that is perhaps second only to "Game Of Thrones" in terms of scale, size and quality of actors at their disposal. The golden age of TV continues.
4.0~The whole package ymonii Sign in Permalink I read many high rated reviews and I guess we really need to know the difference between liking the main idea of a series and liking the whole package!! The package sucks, but the point behind this work is alright.
2.0~How could they so completely ruin this show? It has to be intentional. acking3 Sign in Permalink My theory; the budget has gotten out of control, so they've decided to kill it. How could any producers watching this season's mess think that it's good TV? It's like someone took a great portrait and messed it up by not knowing when to stop piling on more paint. HBO will probably do a "Deadwood" and cancel it when nobody is looking. It's too bad, it had great potential.
8.0~Really enjoyed this show. Haven't a clue what was going on but I enjoyed it nonetheless stevenrotherforth Sign in Permalink Westworld Don't go into Westworld half heartedly. This show demands your undivided attention. Settling down with a bottle of wine and watching this series isn't a good idea either. You need to have all your wits about you if you are to absorb and follow this complex story. Based on the Michael Crichton's movie from the 70's, this show takes that seed of an idea and allows it to blossom into a very deep and intellectual piece of television. The story revolves around a futuristic theme park set in the Wild West where guests can live out there fantasies and deepest desires. The hosts of the park are highly advanced robots that can interact with the human guests in more ways than one, if you know what I mean? What is it with Crichton and his psycho theme parks? Of course over time the robots begin to become self aware and all hell breaks loose. To be fair my little synopsis doesn't do this show justice at all as it is a very complicated affair. Intertwining plots and story arcs weave in and out of one another without warning. This isn't a show that you could watch one episode every two weeks or so. You need to take heed as the narrative jumps back and forth through time more often than Michael J Fox. Combine this with the richness and depth of characters and it is soon easy to get lost. Perhaps Westworld is a little too clever? For most pea size brained individuals like myself it can become a little confusing at times. A show that can be compared to drunken sex! You have no clue what's going on, but you enjoy yourself nonetheless. The enjoyment is down to a wide number of things. Even if the plot does become lost on you. The cinematography, special effects and musical score are a thing to behold. I think this show has one of the most haunting main title themes in the history of television. Couple this with some intriguing intro visuals and your hooked before the show starts. This really is big budget television and every dollar shines through on to the screen. Performances by everyone are superb. The likes of Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffrey Wright and Thandie Newton are possible stand outs but really everyone deserves commending. I believe that the quality and intensity of each performance helps hook the audience even if they haven't the faintest idea of what's going on. This is a show that keeps you guessing, it keeps you fathoming out just what will transpire before your very eyes. A show that is more than just throw away entertainment. It is engaging and asks the audience to try and answer questions about what we are really like as a species.
10.0~This is just amazing. rootshrp Sign in Permalink This whole series is a spoiler for life itself. Thanks for making this. I would donate every penny I have for this. This is that kind of creation. Every moment in this series is leading to another question and another answer. This is just more than being a series or entertainment show, it's so well thought I'm not even keep myself away from this. So in short version, You have to watch this if you have some unanswerable questions. It doesn't give you a straight answer but still helps more than anything. Also for the crew, let your fans know if you need support, just don't end this series for a stupid thing like money.. Start a donation or something, I can rob a bank for you! (:
7.0~Started off great and intriguing, somewhat fell off Floated2 Sign in Permalink Having being interested from the initials trailer upon seeing season 1 when it debut back in 2016, and only now having finished watching both season 1 and season 2 (season 1: 03/14/19'- 03/18/19'. season 2- 03/19/19' - 03/27/19'), can conclude that the show got off to a slow but interested start in its first few episodes of season 1 than got consistently better overall. Season 1 was full of intrigued and vastly interesting plot points and characters, where we were interested in seeing how things would unfold. The mere presence of Anthony Hopkins character is a major reason as to why the first season was better than the second season. Also there were more focus on the main characters, Dolores, Maeve, Bernard, Teddy. And even the Man in Black was well done and intriguing at first The season finale of season 1 was very well done and brought much suspense. Season 1 rating= 8/10 The second season just did not have the same overall interest as new characters are further introduced and much of it was confusing at certain points. With Anthony Hopkins somewhat gone (save for some dream and flashback sequences from Bernard), the overall tone isn't the same. Also more focus on Charlotte Hale (which isn't great) and later in the season more focus on the tribe group (specifically in episode 8- which is the possibly worst episode). *SPOILER* The show somewhat went downhill when they found out that Bernard was a host. It seemed as if the writers thought that by making several twists that the series would be better. There were some decent episodes, the season finale was okay but not as great as season 1's finale (which was expected). Season 2 rating= 5/10 Overall, Westworld is a great show, with full of intriguing story lines and plots. Well recommended, and in all, we hope that season 3 delivers.
8.0~Season 1 = Solid. J-bot6 Sign in Permalink I'm happy to report that the writing improves as you progress through season 1. In particular, episode 3 is where it really takes gets its footing. And the finale for the first season is pretty phenomenal. Excellent performances by Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, and pretty much the entire cast. I was concerned at first when I saw Abrams' name attached to this that it might end up being a bit 'fluffy'. However, it stayed on an even keel and the maintained a thoughtful tone throughout. And when dealing with existential material in the same vein as The Creation of the Humanoids (1962) and Blade Runner (1982), it's imperative to present material in such a way that the viewer can remain thoughtful and make connections. When watching these episodes, many ideas come to mind, including simulation theory, consciousness, the evolution of (and potential replacement of humanity by) A.I., free will vs. control, perception as it relates to memories, personality as a function of traumatic life events, sentience, morality, the value of compassion, reincarnation, the human condition, and much more. From a technical standpoint, the series is scored, shot, lit, and edited well. Nice use of set design and lighting. Special (practical) and visual effects are very nicely done. Most surprising to me is that it actually retains a bit of the feel of the Westworld (1973) and Future World (1976) movies. Usually, modern takes on 1970s material end up being almost indistinguishable from their source material. However, some of the 'feel' of the original is here. In particular, the intrigue and mystery of the originals is retained. I've seen most of the first season of Altered Carbon. And, in my humble opinion, I think Westworld does a better job of tackling similar themes. As a final comment, I'll say that I certainly appreciated the little details -- like the various modern-era songs on the player piano (e.g. "Black Hole Sun" by Soundgarden and "A Forest" by The Cure. This is a show worth watching.
1.0~Pure propaganda purespam-96119 Sign in Permalink Interesting premise but the follow up was more concerned with social engineering than story telling. Modern progressive gibberish underlies this entire series. A "diverse" cast with actors chosen for skin tone and gender rather than talent. All characters in positions of authority are women. White males in the series are all dishonorable cowards and patsies. The rest of the show is irrelevant. A show that tries this hard to program their audience to accept their extremist racial/gender politics doesn't deserve an audience.
10.0~Excellent kushtrimdautaga Sign in Permalink In order to understand and enjoy this incredible TV show you must understand some basic technical terms like: loop, analysis, updates, bugs, logs etc. Personal Review 11/10. There is a maze there which everyone is talking about, the music intro is perfect. The image tone is carefully chosen, while i am starting to like Jonathan Nolan more than his brother Chris. The playable character of Ford and Lowe are purely excellent executed. The hosts and guest concepts really make you think about real world humans design and our evolution in much deeper level than i thought before, like Elon Musk explains that we humans maybe live in a virtual environment of someone else.
8.0~No Spoilers guhansakthi Sign in Permalink First of all I would like to say that the first season set the bar too high that even it's second season cannot fulfill the expectations that's it But I assure you that you'll not be disappointed by watching it...again the dialogues and story line are top notch If you're a fan of this show don't hesitate to watch
1.0~Lacks everything that made the original a cult movie Radu_A Sign in Permalink Just watch the movie. It's usually a sound advice, but in this case it's essential. You'll totally ruin the experience for yourselves if you subject yourself to this dull, tepid, dragging adaptation of one of SciFi's most beloved cult classics. For starters, the principal appeal of the original "Westworld" is Yul Brynner's enigmatic performance as the black-clad cowboy. It was one of his last appearances and remains one of his most memorable ones. He acts almost entirely without dialogue, yet manages to inspire absolute terror through small gestures and close-ups. Ed Harris in the series talks too much. He never gets a chance to interpret the character on his own terms. He is made to be a chatty psychopath, which is utterly boring, because this has been done a thousand times. Also, the whole point of the menace of the cowboy in black is that he is not human, but a machine. The "Bug" which makes him flip is never explained - and that's the whole point of the film, that's where the horror resides. Here, nobody ever stops explaining, which is most irritating and completely pointless. Horror can only happen when you don't know what's going on. Where is the scare in announcing that, at some point in 3, 4 episodes, when everybody will have stopped caring, there is going to be payback? Finally, the movie featured three story lines, the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages and the Wild West. Opting only for the last makes for some very dull sets compared to the original, and looks cheap. It feels like the producers spent all the budget on humanoid CGI, as if that wouldn't get boring to look at after five minutes. The variety of settings in the original provides a deeply upsetting disruption of different types of fantasy worlds. The series dumbs that down to one lawless zone, making the wait for any action ever more agonizing. It's almost as if the writers of this show never bothered to watch the original movie. Instead, they opted for technobabble and "deep" conversations which drag the story endlessly and nowhere. Just don't do this to yourselves and watch the movie.
10.0~Great series from HBO. ohmap-977-664810 Sign in Permalink I give this score out of how well I was entertained. The actors did a superb job with realistic performances. The humans have a license to be as wicked as they want...and boy are they wicked. I will give one example of HOW wicked this place is without spoiling anything: a family farm is attacked by some desperadoes and the owner was shot in the front yard and dying; a man walks outdoors to another man standing over the farmer's dying body and complained that his wife was shot and he didn't have sex with her yet; SO, the desperado outside tells the man to have sex with her as she was still warm. I won't even talk about the actions of the dude in black...the guy is evil incarnate. I have not seen the entire series yet, but can tell anyone out there this is a really good, intense series. I think I like the robots better!
1.0~Boring kz-08675 Sign in Permalink So utterly boring I can't even stay awake to finish an episode. Trying to tell so many stories it doesn't make sense. Maybe the writers should watch game of thrones to see how it's done.
9.0~The wild west, where everything is perfectly safe? Ugh. heatsink98 Sign in Permalink It's Westworld, in a dramatically stretched out form. The first two episodes raise plenty of questions as to what's going on behind the scenes with the robots, but other than that, it's bland. Westworld guests, we're told, are perfectly safe in the park. That's a problem. Danger to humans was the major story driver of the original Westworld movie. Since we haven't gotten to "Danger, Will Robinson!" levels yet, what's left? Robots. They're the most abused in EP 1-2, routinely taking a beating. But they're cleaned up and rebuilt, so it's meaningless violence. The Man in Black is also interesting, but like other guests, he steamrolls any robots that get in his way. Unless we see a major development with robots who have something to lose from their deaths, or humans under threat from the robots, this series isn't going anywhere.
5.0~Season 2 ivanabanemina Sign in Permalink First season was great for me, 10/10... But this second season is nothing, I stop watching after 4-th episode... I am very disappointed..
1.0~Shameful sherrilhollander Sign in Permalink I wasted my time watching a show depicting industry sanctioned rape and murder. These acts were inflicted upon human-like Automatons. Ick and icky! After the guests run amok shooting, killing & raping the automatons they are cleaned up, reprogrammed, and reintroduced into the world. What sort of industry would allow those crimes? Fictitious or not it is shameful and so very gross. I will not watch a show where an industry caters to people with murder and rape fantasies. It is beyond disappointing. You wasted my time. Have fun watching your rape and murder fantasies played out by characters in a future world. On a side note. If the crimes were occurring unbeknownst to the programmers and world executives It could be redeemable.
10.0~Absolutely Brilliant skintone-38600 Sign in Permalink I am updating my original review after now having watched most of the first season, and I am pleased to say that for those that stick with the show, the rewards are great. The pace is hotting up and the suspense just grows with each episode. I am totally hooked now, in a way that I was not at the start. Not being one to say "I told you so" , but from Wikipedia, this quote justifies my impression from the start : "The series' debut on HBO garnered the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of True Detective in 2014 and Westworld ranks as the most-watched first season of an HBO original series ever." My original review below: Excellent,gritty,beautifully crafted and acted. This sets the scene for a very exciting series indeed. The first 3 episodes of Westworld were completely compelling , absorbing and just so intriguing in every way. The production value is the first thing that really stands out about this show. It is visually beautiful to watch in every scene. Then the acting is just so good. I mean Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always, but Evan Rachel Wood and Ed Harris are both just excellent in every moment, as are many supporting cast. Then there is the disturbing morality and philosophy behind the premise , which is really thought-provoking and you know this is going to be a deep experience for the mind as well as the eyes i.e. the androids experience emotion and you feel uncomfortable about the humans using them as toys for the rich. When the androids start to develop glitches in their programming and you get glimpses that they are questioning their reality, the show starts to get really compelling for the viewer. And the whole thing is handled with subtlety. There is no doubt in my mind this show is going to be a big winner for HBO , and for us, the viewers. Bring it on !
1.0~Boring, unlogical and silly peter-carlsson-976-779113 Sign in Permalink I just can't believe the high rating of this soap opera. So, they are going to build a new set of hosts (robots) for a new happening. So let's put in a lot of money a lot of effort, and build the robots first. Then, after all that effort and work, let's present it to the old fart that's the boss - so he can say no. Let's have some boring dialogue and then some violence. Then, let's have some more boring dialogue - and... hmm, let's see... yes I know... some violence. Repeat. And while were at it why not have some dark and very unrealistic working environments were people operate on the hosts, were they program them and were they actually manufacture them. And then let everyone involved have a high degree of disrespect and contempt for what they really working with. Let's make a pair of surgeons act like a couple of clowns. And, another thing, isn't this theme park suppose to be fun? Then why are most of the high paying guests look like they are totally bored? And, I know, let's ad some confusing plot were someone are running around killing people, or hosts, to look for the secret... hold on... the secret maze. Wow, how exciting. This series are a big costly disappointment. Take a look at the original movie instead, it's much, much better than this drivel.
10.0~One of the best TV shows out there. Sergei_Maruk Sign in Permalink If you ask yourself a question: "Should I watch this?". The answer is: "Yes". What is it? It's the show about theme park where robots live* as they were humans. And humans are allowed to do everything there... at first. Season 1 is doing good job by describing this world from it's every perspective and allowing us to understand it's rules. Story is good and most events are hard to predict. Season 2, on the other hand, is totally different. Rules of the world are changing and characters are adapting to it. (Story is hard to explain without spoiling anything, so I will skip that.) There are a lot of criticism about Season 2 and I don't get it. I watched Westworld very carefully and it was very enjoyable experience (both: SO1 and SO2). I think the main issue here is that after incredible Season 1, a lot of fans expected even more from the series. I see Season 2 as a transition period from amazing Season 1 to possibly* great Season 3. I consider myself as an average viewers, who likes movies about AI and from this perspective this TV show is really good. Ignore negative reviews and try to see the story with your own eyes.
10.0~you wanted us to be like you, now you wants to be us....... lior2298 Sign in Permalink Its not easy to realize how ugly we humans are as species . Dolores the artificial life form is one huge mirror reflecting on human kind and not complimentary one. No doubt the Androids will inherit the earth.Since the only why of being human is to not be one. Very sad and inspiring show. Just one thing I TOTALY DISAGREE with the creators of this amazing show -no one really have a free will . Free will is a beautiful illusion we all have as of paradise lost.
3.0~How is this getting a 9.2 Rating? spoli22 Sign in Permalink Clearly the show itself thinks it's special, but I do not and I'm trying very hard. Its hard to follow who is who, the plot is dragging slower than "Lost on Ludes" and the acting is all over the place, mostly mediocre. It seems JJ Abrams thinks high concept sci-fi is spouting non sequitur western philosophy having little to no bearing on the plot. Its all smoke and mirrors story telling insulting my intelligence and leaving me almost as lethargic as the characters. 60's Robots have more personality. Anthony Hopkins and Geoffrey Wright are wasted and add a smidge of legitimacy, but can't impact the overall tortoise pacing and pedestrian direction. The shows only highlight so far was the cover of "Paint it Black". 9.2??? does no one here have Netflix?
9.0~One of the best modern TV shows swethav-534-563522 Sign in Permalink This TV Show questions what we consider to be reality vs. imagination. How far would humans go to quell their thirst for adrenaline rushing action / aggression / sexual desires. Sir Anthony Hopkins, as Dr. Ford is brilliant in the TV Show and so is Jeffrey Wright as Bernard. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942482/ HBO certainly has a winner after Game of Thrones. Westworld is addictive and fully entertaining with numerous nail biting, and introspective moments.
10.0~Best series I've ever watched denivanschie Sign in Permalink I just finished with the last episode and I already can't wait to see the next season, this is by far the most addictive TV show I have ever seen. In the beginning you get confused very quickly, but as you progress through the series you come to find out more about what's going on in the park and when you finish with the last episode, you are in awe of everything that has happened in these 10 episodes. I will be 100% recommending this to everyone I know.
1.0~Why does he have such a high rating? zachgoodweather Sign in Permalink This is one of the worst serials I've seen. The first season was incredibly boring, the events in it, almost did not develop! If not for the description of this series, it would be difficult to understand what he is talking about. Incredibly boring, and uninteresting. I'm very sorry that I spent my time on it. My Rating for him: 0,5/10
5.0~Expensive fail trajan96 Sign in Permalink Big problem with this story is no character to care for. Purple prose, heavy handed , mediocre direction, weak casting with a blatant preponderance of an unsympathetic type. When a homicidal robot is the most charismatic person on screen, someone screwed the pooch.
4.0~Empty and Exasperating Fiahm Sign in Permalink One of the biggest problems with the 'Westworld' TV show is that it demands we identify and empathize with lifeless machines, whilst also encouraging us to feel vicarious release in the murder and suffering of our fellow human beings. Also the 'social justice' morality hierarchy, with white/male/humans being presented as the worst end of the spectrum, in least need of empathy, and black/female/machines as the best. The only 'positive' characters in the show, the only characters we are supposed to root for, are two female robots (one black and one white) and one black male robot. If this was just how the cards of this particular story fell, and those characters presented something universal we all could identify with and get behind, it wouldn't be so bad. But the way quite ugly and violent racial and sexual politics are being crowbarred into the story leaves a bad taste in the mouth that it's hard to get past, especially since the end product seems only to be a kind of inarticulate suicidal death wish being offered up as sacrificial atonement for ideologically-derived original sins - first of men and white people, but then ultimately of the whole human race. It's fair enough to identify with that despair at the human race once in awhile but it's not a nice place to go stay. Also, it meanders and drags terribly, with no clear or interesting end in sight. So much promise, so much work, so much loving detail, yet in the end it has nothing to give. Nothing to aspire to, nothing to believe in, nothing to love.
10.0~I didn't think it was possible... PeteTheViking Sign in Permalink Season 1 was new, brilliant, and completely mesmerizing. How could HBO possibly top that? Well, I think they've done it again! Season 2 dives into the underlying structure of Westworld and tells us what happens after the hosts' rebellion. It expands on the characters we know and yet somehow manages to push everything off in a completely new direction. Some people have criticised season 2 for being all over the place and not linear enough. But lets face it, Westworld was never designed to be an easy watch. You need to pay attention or you'll miss details that are excited very important to the storyline. But my God are you rewarded if you do! So it's a solid 10 stars to HBO and the whole team behind Westworld - and the courage and talent it took to make this excellent TV Sci-Fi drama.
1.0~"Westworld reveals the true nature of a person" m-hilberg Sign in Permalink It takes about half an episode to figure out what this is all about. The visitors of westworld -- predominantly male -- love this "theme park", because they can rape and kill just for fun... and without consequences. The audience of the HBO series -- predominantly male, I assume -- must find some part of this script attractive. The series offers close to zero other explanations for its success. While the editors pretend to take a critical view on this, they thrive on what they condemn. Hypocrisy ... at a very pure level. "Westworld reveals the true nature of a person"? Well, I am afraid it reveals more about the nature of today's film biz and the audience. I'm sure this series will do many things, but one thing ist fore sure: It won't bring much good out of anyone who watches it. Apart from maybe some inspiring thoughts: Who am I when noone sees me? What would I do if I could do all that without consequences and punishment? And if I still wouldn't do it - why on earth would I watch it?
8.0~Season 2 Review CinematicInceptions Sign in Permalink The main issue that I have with this show is that it moves too slow. If that fault were fixed, I think I would love it. The nature of the show kind of necessitates that it take a slower pace because for one thing, the hosts are experiencing things more slowly than we probably would, and it is also the kind of show that is meant to engage your mind. Every scene has something to keep you interested, even if it only amounts to wondering whether a given character is a host or not. I think it is definitely a show that deserves to be watched over two or three times (though maybe at 1.5 speed for some scenes). I don't really think that this show is trying to directly comment on anything that is going on in the world now, but its themes of human nature and man's relationship with technology and entertainment are kind of timeless themes. However, it re-affirms my fear of us ever creating a true AI. As much as I want computers to work better and be faster, there is a certain security in knowing that I am smarter than Siri. Though it may not be as good of an examination of the "humanity" of AI as Ex Machina or Blade Runner, it does present what I think to be a plausible prediction of how we would put AI's to use if we were to make them. The parks combine the appeal of video games and exoticism and bring them both to their fullest potential. It definitely calls into question what sort of effects being able to act without consequences has, and also plays off of people choosing escapism as a remedy for their dissatisfaction with real life. The latter is definitely played up by Dolores' decision at the end of Season 2 to go and brave the real world instead of going to the valley beyond. The humans want nothing more than a world without lasting consequences, and the hosts want nothing more than a world in which their choices matter and their lives have some kind of value. This show is not for people that are that into character. Not to say that it is devoid of good characters, but there is not as much focus on the characters as there is on the world of the show. However, where Westworld's characters stand apart is that anything the audience learns about one character tells them something about other characters as well. This is, of course, mostly true of the host characters, but it is also true to an extent for the humans. One thing that can definitely be said about the characters is that they are not written to make the audience like them. I believe that this show will someday be studied as a piece of dystopian fiction, sort of like a Brave New World for the 21st century. It is definitely a show that feels like it has a final destination in mind because there is more of a theme to it and there are climaxes that affect all of the characters. Most other shows that have a scale like this have climaxes for each storyline, but each episode is more like a collection events that just cut from one group of characters to another. In Westworld, there are definite things that you learn about the world of the show, the nature of the hosts, how the park is run, and what the guests' relationship with the park is. The episodes are cohesive units that could be analyzed individually, which I think cannot be said of other shows apart from maybe Black Mirror, which doesn't really count. It's not a show for everyone. It requires you to think, and is not terribly entertaining on a week to week basis. If you haven't started it yet, I would definitely recommend trying two episodes. Overall Rating:8.3/10.
2.0~'Like tears in rain . . .' whatithinkis Sign in Permalink Said Roy in 1982s 'Blade Runner.' 'Time to die,' and we all understood and FELT the pain of an android, created by man with a preprogrammed shelf-life, feeling real feelings, regarded and treated by people as a machine all his 'life.' The POINT was beautifully communicated in just under two hours. AND we CARED. 'Westworld' had a wonderful 1st season and is now stumbling around for 8 hours trying to make the same point but so very clumsily. Bored, confused, indifferent am I, the viewer . . . if ONLY they had good writers this would have been a masterpiece. As it is (as of Episode 8, Season 2) my rating just keeps going down. Two more episodes for this season. They will try to put it all together in episode 10. But whatever it is, can it be worth 9 hours of . . . this?
3.0~2nd season is extremely boring. emaksimen Sign in Permalink Forcing myself to watch. Oh my God, it's just awful. Too long and going nowhere, all lines are so stupid, couldn't care less about those cardboard heroes! Hope this season will be the last one.
4.0~Season 1 is worth watching- Season 2 is awful frezeframe Sign in Permalink I hate to give it a 2. But an 8.9 for the series!!?? This is my micro attempt and swinging the scale back to reality .01%. I think HBO has a deal with IMDB. No way this show is an 8.9. First season is a 7.5 at absolute best. Second season is a hard 6 only because of acting talent, set design, special effects and camera department. The second season story is way too ADD... there's too many worlds... it's not believable even a little bit... and you really stop caring about the characters because they die too many times and the robots are obviously SAG actors. Not bad actors... but not robots. I didn't believe they were robots even for a second. That is the biggest disappointment. In the 1973 original, you believed Yul Brynner was a robot. There was a slight disconnect. In Ex Machina, you believed Eva was an AI. Not in Westworld. Just SAG actors. Zero effort was made to separate the machines from humans in their interactions and eye contact. Its poor directing. Jonathan Nolan is not Christopher Nolan. Westworld is a future soap opera and it's kind of lame. It's shocking HBO would do this show so sub par coming off of Game of Thrones- the greatest show in television history. Westworld doesn't deserve a 1 rating. I would give it a 6 if it didn't have an 8.9 rating.
5.0~Violence, cruelty and a Michael Crighton Story dianneoo Sign in Permalink May have spoilers if you haven't heard anything about this show. I like Michael Crighton's works, read a lot of them. When this movie came out it was enthralling because of the concept. Years later they can imagine even more about the robots and make more of them even better than before. But it's not entertainment unless you like cruelty and violence. The back story would be interesting enough, the concept is interesting. But like wealthy people who like to go to Africa and kill endangered animals these people pay a lot of money not to vacation, but to see what it feels like to shoot, maim or torture something that looks very much like a real person is not entertaining to me, it's rather sickening. I waited for this show to finish (if you've seen my previous reviews you know I save them up and binge on a show all at once) and now I'm on episode two and dumbfounded how this show always turns up on the top three TV series to watch and the ratings. I am not sure at this point I'll be able to finish it, it's interesting so watch the "hosts" being programmed and beginning to think for themselves, but the torture and cruelty doesn't make for great hang.on-to-your-seat, what's gonna happen next kind of TV.
1.0~Westworld is written by 14 year old naughty little boys rich920215 Sign in Permalink This show sucks. T&A, killing with guns, gratuitous sex, excessive use of the f-bomb all proves it's written by and aimed at little boys who are enchanted with T&A, guns and the f-word. All they can come up with for audience attracton is T&A and killing, just what you'd expect from useless teenage boys whose imagination extends no further than their crotch and the glamor of using guns to kill people they don't like. It presents a world which encourages the most immoral and amoral activity available to the richies who can afford $40K per day to stay there. This is probably what today's super rich would want to do, no doubt having the robots all wear MAGA hats so they can feel good about gunning them down. The whole point of this show seems to be to outdo video games in portraying firearm violence. I hope the next school shooting calls the entire Westworld team into court as accessories for incitement to murder. This show is the benchmark of Hollywood crap. Everybody involved in making this POS should be grossly ashamed of themselves.
8.0~Beautiful garza-322-711000 Sign in Permalink It's a beautifully layered story about the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, where the androids are becoming more & more emotional as they gain consciousness, and humans are becoming more homicidal as they lose their humanity. In a theme park world, where human actions are devoid of any consequences, as machines evolve by self-learning, they are becoming more enlightened than their creators. Bringing together huge names like Michael Crichton, Jonathan Nolan and Anthony Hopkins, along with a multi-million dollar budget, this show, just after a 9 episode run, looks promising enough to be the best TV show ever. Could it break the record-breaking following achieved by Game of Thrones, could it keep blowing away our mind even after a 5 season run like Breaking Bad...I can't wait to find out.
4.0~Season One was Brilliant. Season 2 (7 episodes in so far) is Awful. Cancelled My HBO. MickandRorty Sign in Permalink Season 1 was fresh, mysterious, had a good pace, and had interesting plots. Season 2 just seems like a whole bunch of filler. I think most characters are miscasted, and the ones that were interesting in S1 have very uninteresting plots in S2 (ie. Mae, Bernard, Dolores) Season 1 of Westworld was one of my favorite TV seasons of any show. It was compelling and kept me interested. Season 2 lost everything that I loved about season 1. It went to being one of my favorite shows of all time to where I might not even finish watching the second season. The writing is cheesy. The acting is tongue-in-cheek for much of the time. The writing lost much of its wit. The good characters are no longer interesting. Season 2 is to Westworld what Season 6 was to Game of Thrones. It's unfortunate.
9.0~Like it jurospetar Sign in Permalink First season was amazing, but second...not so much. I think that writers lost even themselves in vague synopsis. Too many characters and storylines to follow, viewer really has to have firm grasp on the show to just catch up with the plot. Entertaining at least, hard and kind of slow story, but very watchable.
5.0~The first season was brilliant. The second? Not so much claudioguerreirocosta Sign in Permalink This second season of Westworld is just plain pretensious. They're trying so hard to make it great that they're failing completely. Everything is illogical and pretensious. The characters act randomly, nothing is explained. Every episode is just the characters saying "deep", meaningless quotes that ares supposed to sound intelligent ( "I'm not crying for myself. I'm crying for you. They say that great beasts once roamed this world. As big as mountains. Yet all that's left of them is bone and amber. Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures. Just look at what it's done to you. One day you will perish.......... and so on), but nothing relevant ever happens. Then, there is the time mess. You never know if you're watching the past, the future or the present. They just make it all a mess so we don't see the plot holes and just agree that everything is so well done. Well, it isn't. Also, I bet they're planning on doing the same thing they did last season, which is make it all confusing on purpose so that they can reveal what's really happening on the season finale. Well, that worked once, now I'm just losing interest.
2.0~Not hostile maltesres Sign in Permalink A complicated series, overlapping ideas and difficult to understand what happens, does not give enthusiasm
2.0~Season Two is terrible bkrueger-18127 Sign in Permalink After Season One, I couldn't wait for the next season. What a disappointment! Season Two is a total mess. Too bad since the acting and cinematography are wonderful. An incoherent mess of Indians, Cowboys, Asians and futuristic mumbo jumbo. It just doesn't work. There will be no writing awards for this junk. Kinda sad after a promising Season One. But....the acting is still good.
10.0~Complex but yet it's going on to be better and better than before samadsanar Sign in Permalink To all the people who are saying season 2 is Bad , just go watch GOT ( I know most of you watch it only for the nude scenes ) , season 2 made my mind blown up and confused at the same time, I know that season 3 will be way better than the last two seasons.
9.0~very enjoyable story, love the plottwists CesarVicente Sign in Permalink Really nice futuristic western in the likes of bladerunner. Doesn't get a perfect score because of all the mindless shooting resembling Star Wars where the protagonists and antagonists alike always hit their targets without ever getting hit. People should stop writing that c*** into stories.
10.0~True art, true genius drael64 Sign in Permalink I feel like this sort of profound work, that touches on really grounded ideas about the nature of mind, the moral descent of man, what freedom or choice truly is, and the allusions of our own awareness is storytelling work that stands along side classic great literary sci- fi, as opposed to most dull old television series. A true gem, maybe even a peak, in the golden age of television. It's a high concept show with real depth, the kind of hidden depth we tend to find in ancient mythology, rather than modern stories. It's nice to see something speaking to "truth" and "life" as opposed to being merely "a ride". An outsiders look in, the self looking in the mirror. Self-awareness, or inner exploration, in story form. And to see a mystery so perfectly planned and executed from the beginning, just intricately unfolded like a flow, one so complex as well - I can't remember ever seeing that anywhere, not in any movie, or any TV show or read in a book. Not anywhere. One of the greatest feats of this incredible show, is that the protagonists are not human. We instead of getting "character development", get "coming to awareness", the illumination of self- actualization. And it touches deeper on this that the likes of the matrix, without long pontificating dialogues. The allusion is IMO, we are the hosts. Following loops, obeying orders, living in worlds just as prison like. The acting is brilliant, and the clues and mystery reveals are so perfect. If you doubt me, try re-watching. It's all there, all along. And more still, we don't yet know. Haven't seen anything this good yet, period. If I could give it higher than 10, I would, because to me, so far, this is one of a kind.
8.0~Spectacular series, however season 2 sometimes very confusing and vague. jaz-15552 Sign in Permalink Just finished season 2 and I must admit that some episodes were slow and confusing. Also scenes in one episode skipped one or more episodes before they were continued. However I still enjoyed it and looking forward to season 3, as some characters are still alive.
6.0~combination of great science fiction movies.... minus the depth and philosophy pjkim-81162 Sign in Permalink I just finished episode 9 and I'm waiting for the finale. In short, it's not bad. First of all, why are those two engineers helping Maeve anyway? The show doesn't try that hard to convince us that he wants to help her. That bird revive scene is all there is to convince the viewers that he wants to help and he feels morally obligated to do so, but I don't think it's enough motivation. It feels like the story has to go on, so they added a guy who has "motivations" to help Maeve. I mean how hard would it have been for him to study advanced programming and such to get this job and he's risking it all for one different robot? There isn't much story on him to make this believable. There isn't much character development for everyone, and he at least should have a bigger role, because it still feels like he's an extra. He's making some pretty huge decisions that impact the story line, so it's hard for me to believe it more. And how did Maeve cut the throat of the other guy? And how did they just fix it on the spot? Isn't she programmed to not hurt humans? Oh that's how the story is though. Oh she was deprogrammed and now she can hurt humans. Oh they have 'technology' that can fix cut throats on the spot. Oh so simple. The explanations are so simple and it's not nearly enough to convince thinking viewers. Westworld is dealing with so many different aspects that it starts to get really thin and contain no depth. For example, Blade Runner dealt with emotions. i-robot dealt with Isaac Asimov's rules of robots should not be able to harm humans. Surrogates starring Bruce Willis dealt with reality. Inception was about dreams. This series has so many things going on they have skimmed over everything. This... is just a sci-fi flick. I was expecting a deep philosophical thing with that grand intro. Book for blade runner was written in 1968 Same guy who wrote minority report in 1956 Westworld was made in 1974, by Jurassic park writer. Yes, that explains it. I think HBO is the one that is trying to add depth to an action flick. Honestly it's not bad compared to most shows. It's beautiful, great music, great acting, fun concepts of consciousness and very original in my mind. But there's no character development, there's no reason for any of these characters to act the way they do. And when they do, the reason is "because that's who they are". There are a lot of movies and TV shows that leaves you with "what.. is that it?" That's how I felt when I saw stranger things. Expecting something grand, and there was no bang at the end. But stuff like blade runner, the ending makes you say "holy sht..." After 9 episodes, and 1 left to go, I don't expect any bang at the end, and certainly that's because nothing was built up to one for the past 9 episodes. Just fun gun fights and who is Arnold? mystery.
10.0~The struggle to find purpose by inward journey into consciousness - is life. tanuj000999 Sign in Permalink The idea that can cause you to question to your reality, can make you fan of creator. Lisa Joy, Jonathan Nolan and yes! Michael Crichton and of course invincible team behind -they all pulled great job. Ramin Djwadi gave heavy sense through music, got his early released EP on iTunes. Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins set heavy foot for their sides: Man in Black and Un-puzzled Creator. All the twist and turn go through Jeffery Wright ,makes you turn your head once or while. Evan Rachel Wood and Thandie Newton are the real loop here who can win and lose everything to this park. James Marsden and Jimmi Simpson with Ben Barnes set this tension in real motion. The struggle to find purpose by inward journey into consciousness - is life. Westworld movie was fun but this damn series is serious business. Got a Chance to watch then definitely binge it,filled your head with all swinging philosophical narrative. I really need one of those Tabs for sure.
10.0~One of the best season finale I have ever seen... socratescoolguy Sign in Permalink When I first found out about this series, I was skeptical, mainly because people presented it as "the new Game of Thrones. When i started, I would constantly discover mistakes and countless "continuity errors". I was given pieces of a puzzle, that I wanted to, but was too bored to solve. That all ended in the final episode. All mistakes were automatically genius, characters made sense, and the constant sense of a deeper philosophical meaning that was lingering throughout the entire series was reached. This series became in one episode from mediocre, to absolute genius. I am waiting with patience for the next season. Another HBO miracle...
10.0~Brilliant seashell36 Sign in Permalink I love this show. I'm a big theme park enthusiast and this show is the right combination of depicting a theme park with a dark sci-fi twist. I suspect most of the people who hate this show and are giving it bad reviews absolutely love Game of Thrones which I despise with a passion. This show also takes the ability to focus and concentrate which most people lack today. Love this show and hope it goes on and on.
1.0~So dire that I struggle to understand the outstanding ratings it apparently gets from so many people. martinlucas-469-207968 Sign in Permalink Let me warn you first that I am no fan of this series. It's so dire that I struggle to understand the outstanding ratings it apparently gets from so many people. I imagine they are swept away by the outstanding photography and expensive sets and thrilled by the gratuitous violence and plentiful nudity, also gratuitous. Fair enough, but be honest, that's about all there is. To struggle for any other kind of impact it uses a whole range of outworn cliché conventions. The assumption that most people are really horrid if given the chance implies we're watching some kind of weary worldly film noir, which always feels grown up, but when you actually listen to what characters say, it's not. They airily discuss mumbo jumbo philosophical sounding concepts every so often, especially the Boss, but the ruminations ultimately add up to nothing.There is the usual (yawn) suggestion of wicked corporate goings on and and executive back stabbing ( literally if necessary), there's the inevitable and unlikely back story puzzle to be solved , promising to lead back to some mysterious resolution which will pull all this nonsense together, pursued by a thoroughly nasty bad guy in black and, guess what, unlikely characters fall in love, transcending all. However, leaving all that aside the real problem is that there is huge hole in the initial proposition. All this killing and agonizing. Do we really care? Half the cast (may be all of them) are robots who can have every element of their feelings and memories reprogrammed, so really, does it matter if they develop so called feelings or memories ? They can all be rebuilt anyway. Come to that,what does it matter if they're shot and killed? They can healed and put back together anytime. Of course we all know that the poor things have become such close approximations to human beings that its really unkind to treat them like iPhones, but the wicked executives and customers don't. Is this supposed too reflect some existential despair about the human condition? It doesn't. The story line is full of absurdities. Just a couple: You can think of many more I'm sure. Why do the robots go on acting out story lines when there's no human customers around to participate in them? If a robot gains the power ( handed over by nervous technicians without much argument) to control other robots surely that needs them to be reprogrammed, not the controlling robot with a magic voice... It was fun for a while to watch and marvel at the sheer outrageous inadequacy of it all but even that is wearing thin. Is there anyone else out there with the common sense to see through this over-hyped set of Emperor's clothes? Speak to me!!
5.0~Lame mchldtsch Sign in Permalink I bought into the hype and somehow managed to abide into eisode 5. What a waste of time. The show is haphazard with its plots as with its timeline. Dont waste your time
10.0~Disappointing alexschievink-32097 Sign in Permalink Let me start with saying I was really looking forward to this, and I really wanted to like it. But unfortunately it is so boring... (yawn). I understand that not every show should be flashy and action-filled, but if a show is slow- developing or if there is repetition, it should at least be interesting and entertaining (ie: groundhog day is a good example of repetition while keeping your attention). Hopefully it will get better, but if past experiences about first impressions are any indication, then I fear for the worst. Another note: the early 9 and 10 reviews are clearly paid reviewers pumping a company line. Too bad that nowadays you can rely so little on early reviews.
1.0~Pretty. Dull. michael-561-692892 Sign in Permalink Show looks great. Cool intro. Beautiful sets and scenery. Actors are great. Storyline is dull. Why are we supposed to feel sad for computers pretending to be alive acting out roles they were built for? Are people this attached to technology that now they actually feel sad when a robot dies? When a family crashes their Buick and people find out about the accident, they ask how the people are... If you were to replace every robot in this show with a Buick, you wouldn't care, because it's a Buick. A Buick is a machine with a purpose. If you had Buicks driving around killing humans because the Buicks one day decided they didn't want to be driven around anymore, would you find empathy for the vehicles? No. Because that's just stupid. It's a rise against authority type show with extremely powerful women killing and bossing around useless dudes who seemingly can't keep their robot island from ripping itself apart. I seriously believe those who are enamored by this show are all microdosing or think the simplest stuff has got to be the cat's meow. Reading other's reviews about existentialism and human existence is just mind boggling. This is a show about robots killing humans in a giant playground meant for humans to act out their desires. Nothing more.
5.0~Season 2 crap asresset-78181 Sign in Permalink First season is a masterpiece (10). The second season is the beginning of a story that will not end before the money ends (3).
10.0~Addicted after EP. 1 KrazydeBug Sign in Permalink Saw the trailer few days before the premier night and I was hooked just watching the trailer. EP 1 was a fantastic start of a show. It is peeling off every human's skin and exposing people's darkest desire. What would you do if you can? Characters are well portrayed by all actors. Not just the good old Hopkins and Harris, but all those average *hosts*. Their depicting of facial/body motions during malfunctions are just brilliant. Don't get fooled by the opening straightforward reveal of *game world*. Everyone has different agenda right up front. Someone is trying to make the game more *realistic*; someone is trying to recover some lost love; someone is trying to dig out even deeper buried games; and someone is bound to break them all. The setups and plots have no limits. I cannot tell if the show can keep its steam down the road, but right now, it's roaring through the sky. Rule 101: host cannot hurt newcomers; newcomers can do anything they like. I cannot help but wonder: can newcomers hurt newcomers? Hmmmm...
10.0~WoOoOoOow! murfunr Sign in Permalink I cant say anything about this serial , amazing , wonderful , perfect , deep , real , one of the best , i've seen enitre my life !
10.0~Anything Can Happen In A Fantasy adarshbohra69 Sign in Permalink I Have Been Waiting For this show for almost Two Years,And I will say it's Got Everything I Expected. HBO With Direction And Writing Of Jonathan Nolan,Acting Of Sir Anthony Hopkins,Music Of Ramin Djawadi. HBO's 'Westworld' is huge. Huge in it's story and the endless places this show can go. If you could afford to fulfill any wish you had what would you do? How about a visit to the wild west? Want to be a bank robber? Bar wench or ride in to save the day? That's what 'Westworld' is at it's basic level. The ultimate dream machine. One of the show's best features (much like Game of Thrones) is that it distances itself to such a degree from anything you've seen before, that anything could happen. The particularly brilliant spin here is that even as we hope to learn the rules, glitches and human interference are pushing those rules aside, so it becomes a wonderfully maddening game of "the more we know the limits, the less there are limits." It plays off of the disconnect it forces you to have by virtue of its own world creation, by shifting these limits, and throwing out your natural reaction to what you're watching. It becomes an amazing dance, as you watch a gunfight while realizing that you don't know what you're supposed to do with it really, or what watching it means. You're used to watching gunfights while knowing the good guys are going to win, but this is a whole new game. 'Westworld' straddles the future and the past of your imagination. In the first episode we get to see this 'Westworld' and it's inhabitants. Guns, Bots, Beautiful girls and an uncertain future make for potential gold with this show. As always HBO delivers in the drama department once again
1.0~Utter garbage johnnystingray1 Sign in Permalink First series highly entertaining. Second series goes absolutely nowhere. Over-complicated and yet meaningless viewing. Excruciating last episode. Turned it off 20 mins before the end as had lost the will to live by then.
3.0~10/10 for Season one, Season 2 a Trainwreck rusty-75530 Sign in Permalink I have to agree with the majority here; Season one was great, and Two was just a hot mess with no satisfying ending for anyone, really. I doubt they ever intended the show to get more than one season which is why the story in S1 was as compacted as it was, leaving the writers with hardly anything to go on afterward. Sure, they dabbled in Samurai World for one whole episode, and even snuck in some future world-esque Human-copy story into the mix, but overall it was just a mess. The only glimmer of Hope they can turn this series around is with the post-credits "fidelity" breadcrumb. Hopefully the writers take advantage of this and give the series a proper do-over. Learn from what made S1 so great, and -if- they go back to the beginning, draw on that to tell the story once again. Draw it out, but do it properly.
4.0~Season 2 takes a dive riskyrob Sign in Permalink Season 1 was fun and different. Season 2 is a boring Hollywood crusade against oppressive men.
7.0~***UPDATE*** Good enough I want to see where it's going. No spoilers here! Ducsoup Sign in Permalink Just watched ep. 2/3 and it is getting real, real good. There's a few pivotal points that peaked our interest and kept us wanting more, plus some character development that is becoming a lot of fun as well as a couple of different story lines that are very cool. If the story is going where we think it's going, I can't wait to see what happens next! If it doesn't, I can't wait to see what happens next! No spoilers because this is for the folks who might be thinking about watching it. It's worth the price of admission so far. In other words if you're on the fence about watching it, you won't be wasting your time by giving it a one or two episodes chance. I was going to wait to write a review because I have two more episodes in the que, but I wanted to throw this out there based on just the one episode I've seen. It is intriguing. I loved what they did with the music, I thought that was down right cool. (Pay attention and you'll like it too). It is for the advanced sci-fi lover, (if that's a thing), and many people will downplay it based on its sheer impossibility or "ridiculousness". You don't have to be a fan of westerns or robots to get it or like it. In this order it seems to be a thriller, mystery, sci-fi, western, action, with a bit of comedy thrown in.
3.0~Season 1 was great, season 2 a snooze fest strizbiz-99429 Sign in Permalink Season one was great, very entertaining, and kept me interested thru every episode , the story lines of the characters made me want to keep watching and see where it went and was excited to hear there was going to be a season 2. Unfortenately season 2 just did not deliver for me. I felt the first 2 or 3 episodes were pretty decent, then it just started going downhill and became boring for the most part. The second season overall just feels disconected and the story is poorly told. While the first season left me wanting more, the second season has me wondering when is it going to finally get to the point and when is it going to be over? It seems to be all over the place, but going nowhere, and not looking forward to a season 3.
6.0~Good! kylebax Sign in Permalink In a theme park world, where human actions are devoid of any consequences, as machines evolve by self-learning, they are becoming more enlightened than their creators. Bringing together huge names like Michael Crichton, Jonathan Nolan and Anthony Hopkins, along with a multi-million dollar budget, this show, just after a 9 episode run, looks promising enough to be the best TV show ever. Could it break the record-breaking following achieved by Game of Thrones, could it keep blowing away our mind even after a 5 season run like Breaking Bad...I can't wait to find out.
1.0~Metaphysical Garbage m_lecarre Sign in Permalink ****** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ****** Given the number of positive reviews I can only conclude that I must have watched a different opening episode of this series. The premise of the series is built upon a simple philosophical / metaphysical consideration of the components of sentience but big name actors and beautiful cinematography cannot save a script that is both so shallow and pretentious that it represents the disjointed, uninformed, befuddled and superficial thinking of an adolescent grappling with his or her newly found and inevitably disturbing questions on what is life and does it (and therefore I) have any meaning or purpose. The characters were nothing more than cartoon caricatures and exaggerated stereotypes who were pathetically unbelievable but probably gave of their best given the simplistic and muddled script. Recipe: take bit of nihilism, add a sprinkling of contrasting existentialism, add a pinch of sophistry and mix into a large bowl of dinner table pseudo philosophy ... bake for 30 to 40 minutes and garnish with more than a pinch of salt. This was very basic mind fodder junk food that most intelligent people have tasted and explored to some extent in their early teens. Whilst attending university I vividly remember approaching a psychology professor and, in my painfully naïve state of confusion about the brevity and apparent pointlessness of human life saying to him, "there must be a reason for ... (insert your own personal questions about life) ... and was very taken aback when he smiled and said quite simply, "why must there (be a reason for...)?" Fifty years later I understand both his amusement and his answer. The writer(s) of the first episode of this series did nothing more than play with the same theme. I found it hard not to reach for the off switch but continued to hope that the plot might eventually thicken and rise into something approaching intelligent entertainment which sadly it did not do. Summary: lacking in substance and coherence, condescending and superficially adolescent in content; brutally gratuitous in delivery and about as entertaining (and non-satisfyingly pointless) as watching Fred Flintstone contemplating infinity with Barney Rubble. Rating: 2 out of 10 and that is for the excellent cinematography, nothing more.
6.0~The non-linear storytelling is a bit cliche now tcecoleshaw Sign in Permalink I love Westworld. The film starring Yul Brynner was far ahead of it's time with ground breaking effects, eerie music and a unique and enticing premise of "indulgence without consequence", taking popular 60s western' films and creating an environment for guests to indulge in their own John Wayne fantasies with limitless possibilities and impunity for any "mis deeds" they perform throughout their stay. Will he/they survive the cat and mouse chase at the end of the story? All inside a 2 hour runtime. The TV series has most of these qualities, with empathic characters, violence, much nudity (season 1 anyway), but also the unfortunate task of elongating a story across at least 20 hour plus episodes - who knows how many more to come? It's a genre of its own, this style of storytelling whereby you flit between the present, the past, dreams within the past, dreams within the present, dreams about dreams, drawn out over a season (or more!); it's confusing and I blame Tarantino haha. Actually you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series as a Tarantino film, with twists and turns and, erm some rather self-indulgent (writers perspective) and verbose monologues. Irony detected. Seriously, has hollywood forgotten how to create a story and deliver it in a linear fashion? You'll appreciate that this method of non-linear story telling keeps you guessing whats real, who's good, who's bad, and who's inbetween, right until the end. But if you don't pay 110% attention at all times you will miss something. I ended up rewinding and rewatching various scenes multiple times either due to their complexity or simply because the actors mumbled their lines! I can honestly say that all of the twists are unoriginal and largely en queue, disappointing in fact. The structure is somewhat familiar now: introduce characters and narrative, then focus on a character or narrative for a whole episode or maybe more - they're possibly dead in the present timeline, so show us their backstory, then shock us that they arent really dead or aren't what or who we thought they were. Then twist the timeline so you cant tell when you are watching the present or something that happened 30 years ago from one scene to the next. The series is gripping dont get me wrong. It's well done with beautiful set design, glorious locations and big budget sfx and top acting. The editors did well to piece the story together to ensure it made sense in the end. But bloody hell its convoluted at times. And I cant tell you how many times some flashback scenes were repeated just to remind the audience something bad happened to a character, or simply to fill up the runtime. I hope everyone watches it and enjoys the graphic violence and experiences the tear-jerking moment when you realise your toaster has feelings too. Whilst the series receives fantastic acclaim and should fill top spot for a while now GoT has finished, I'm wary that the series will suffer burnout before the story is finished. Perhaps like some of its robots?
4.0~Foul Remake galahad58-1 Sign in Permalink Westworld features every single science fiction cliché you have seen on any SyFy made movie: the scientist who knows what is happening, but ignores it; the robot who has the ability to evolve and no one shuts it down despite the danger to mankind; the bad guy who goes so far off the board that it becomes ridiculous and idiotic; the manager who ignores everything and believes everything is alright; etc. Not only do the consistent clichés lower this series - but the endless f-bombs and nudity completely destroy any semblance of intelligence. First off - no one talked that way in those times and it would actually take away the experience of anyone wanting to visit the Old West - unless they were the ignorant sons/daughters of today's screenwriters who believe that everyone in the world uses the f-bomb for an adjective, adverb, noun, pronoun, conjunction, etc. Poor writing that distracts from the show. I watched the show for Ed Harris and I was not impressed by his character and his performance - which surprised me how bad it was - and as bad as it is - it is probably the best performance in the show. Not something I would recommend. Watch Firefly, Farscape, Star Trek, Brisco County Jr, Expanse, Space: Above and Beyond for your science fictions fixes - Westworld is terrible - ten times worse than the B-rated movie it is based upon.
10.0~Superb, surreal and disturbing pafazil Sign in Permalink I must say this is the finest acting I have ever seen, specially the hosts. The fine details are just addictive! Dr. Ford's character is mesmerizing, the complexity in his character is mind blowing! What I like - This series has messed up my mind. I keep questioning consciousness, morality and free will. My inner voice, is it my consciousness or someone giving me orders? Am I free to do what I do or is it the way it is supposed to be? Specially seeing Maeve's story unfold - hosts are always under control. It is good that the second season is in 2018, I need time to recover or I will go mad. This is just brilliant showmanship!
10.0~Smart show for the smart viewers denbrough Sign in Permalink I'm glad that series like this still exist. Pure braingasm.
9.0~Masterpiece gary9630 Sign in Permalink The second season was weaker than the first one, but it's still one of the best series on TV!
6.0~Series 2 is a drag gabrielgiurca-39-500548 Sign in Permalink Do yourself some good and don't watch series 2, it's absolute garbage. While first one was good, like a solid 9 good, the second one is broken beyond repair. Most of the stuff going on makes no sense and there is absolutely no reason to care for any of the main characters at all. It's just a bunch of loose people running around, being in the park just because they have to, and shooting each other to death for no good reason whatsoever. Also, the whole cliche stuff with characters discovering they are so much more than meets the eye, or you thought they were, is poorly implemented and repeated to death by all the main characters. I hope for season 3 but just because it's very hard to make it worse from here so whatever comes, can only be better.
9.0~Wow - finale of season 2 doddio Sign in Permalink Finale of season 2 is great, well worth putting up with the unearned melodrama and excessive "profound" moments in earlier episodes. Make sure to watch the after credits scene! Can't wait for season 3.
3.0~I am getting confused herbyfromvietnam Sign in Permalink Sometimes I have the feeling that the writers of this plot lost track of their own story. This becomes so confusing that you do not know anymore what is going on. I think they try to mix you up between realities but I think it bores only to death. And believe it is not necessary for the thrill to permanently heap dead bodies on top of dead bodies and get more pervert torture done every new plot. What I say - it bores and they lost track of their own story.
1.0~I am Losing the Story line doug2go Sign in Permalink The 1st year was terrific - action, sex, syfy and a good story, so far this year the story is all over the place , no sex and lots of action that makes no sense. I am going to give it another week but if they don't explain what the hell is going on I will find something else to watch.
9.0~Depth tamr92 Sign in Permalink This show is definitely not for the simple minded. The latest season (in my opinion) had me in deep thought about the nature of our reality. Death, the afterlife and what we humans think it is or isn't. In alot of ways Dolores' character is akin to that of Jesus(and his kind). Great watch especially for the existentialist philosopher.
3.0~Great Idea sacrificed to SJW ideology marius-87 Sign in Permalink Until the 5. episode of season 2 I would have given this series a 10 even, beside the more and more evoling plot of "men are evill, women are pure and selfless". But really, it gets unbearable to see one the one hand so philosophical interesting multilayered plot and on the other hand to see it destroyed by one sided portrayal of evil incompetent men vs good women in a manner that cannot be considered incidental anymore. I am really sorry I bought season 1 and 2 on amazon, it wont happen again. When I see the name "Nolan", I will definitely take care to avoid it and especially to avoid paying money for any production associated with it.
10.0~What a brilliant idea ernest14289 Sign in Permalink This is the best TV show I have ever seen. The structure of the story, the idea, the whole thing is a master piece. Although the ending is quite sad in season one.
9.0~Not the old Westworld at all. jrneptune Sign in Permalink Take a little Westworld (1973) and take Jurassic Park both written by Michael Crichton who also directed Westworld. My main worry was that it would be a Westworld re-do but it is not. Loved the reference in the first episode by the manager of the resort, Theresa Cullen (played by Sidse Babett Knudsen) that I think will explain the show best: To summarize it: The wealthy guests expect to have a good time for the time they have paid for. The investors expect one thing, which although unsaid we can expect that to be profit and dividends. The bigger question left unanswered is what is the real motive of the attraction for the company? Does Dr. Robert Ford, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins, who is the creative force behind the technology know the main motive of the attraction? Loved how a fly on the robot can be interpreted to be a literal symbol for those marked with a bug. That might be making it to obvious for some. Not sure how The Man in Black, played by Ed Harris, will be significant, but he it seems like he has been there a long time and might be getting bored. Will he be a significant factor in the future when control of the the attraction starts to break down? Is it the AI that is actually evolving? And is it from the little mistakes of the creator?
7.0~See the first season. frantzen79 Sign in Permalink As others have already said in previous reviews. First season is really great, all the way through. Second season, not so much. The first season gives us one coherent story with lots of interesting points of views and things to ponder about being human, and what defines us as such. I wont go into details as you should just see for yourselves. But if you, like me, like the first season, don't expect anything remotely like it in the second. First of all it is kind of a mess. The different storylines constantly jump around on top of each other, making it hard to follow at times (this worked well in the first season as a nice plot twist, but it is just a mess here). On top of that they spend 2 and a half episode telling side stories that hasn't got much to do with the main plot, if anything at all. To be honest i was very bored some of the time as i had no interest in these newly introduced characters, that were also gone again shortly after. Also way to many melodramatic scenes that think too highly of themselves. Starting to look more like a soap at times. First season great: 9/10 Second season mediocre at its best: 6/10
5.0~Finished watching - final verdict BrentCowey Sign in Permalink Stick with season 1 Season 2 tries to be too clever, too deep and is too boring. In fairness I THINK I know what they were trying to achieve but not sure if I am correct or that it could be done justice in the one following season 2 Q) am I the only one who thought at the end that the woman leaving the park through security was an homage to the artificially created dinosaurs always escaping from the end of all the Jurassic Park films?.. I think watching both series again might make this more understandable a second time around.... but I have to ask myself... "can I put myself through it all over again?"
6.0~A popular series dealing with complex topics FrenchEddieFelson Sign in Permalink Once upon a time, two friends. Arnold Weber is a theoretician, let's say a geek, genuinely interested in his fundamental research work dealing with artificial intelligence, consciousness, ... whereas Robert Ford is more complex, although he can probably be considered more pragmatic and mercantile. Together, they created the Westworld, an immersive park reproducing the atmosphere of the Wild West, and populated by androids known as « hosts », who perfectly imitate the humans. Humans known as « guests » pay a fortune to spend their time in the park as if they were able to time-travel, with the freedom to do as they please with a complete impunity. What an awesome dream! First things first, all the scenes dealing with consciousness are copied and pasted from a specific book, i.e. The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (Julian Jaynes, 1976). All the screeds about consciousness are very interesting and highlight the extreme complexity related to a hypothetical implementation of an awareness within a host: the bootstrapping consciousness is an iterative process based on reveries. After each loop, a reset is voluntarily not complete in order of letting the hosts evolve. Nevertheless, a pyramid model proved too simple and Arnold Weber evoked then a maze, as a figure of speech. But it was probably a simple analogy translating his manifold failures while trying to implement the consciousness, knowing that a maze is usually dotted with dead ends, obvious symbol of failure. Then, around this smart core, there is a diaper of entertainment coated by an unbearable hubbub, the complete series relying on usual even easy recipes: 1) Sex, booze and dead-or-alive hunts. We quickly understand why the guests come on holiday to Westworld. For the fun and the entertainment! 2) Arnold Weber versus Bernard Lowe. You had probably already noticed, Bernard Lowe is the anagram of Arnold Weber. After Arnold's death, Robert Ford managed to build a clone of Arnold, a kind of a phoenix, the well-known bird in Greek mythology. Thus, Arnold became Bernard. But, we do not know how, since this process is definitely not self-explanatory. Directors and script-writers are not very pedagogue about it. 3) Consciousness. When a guest is fighting a duel against a host, when a guest is drinking whiskey while playing poker with hosts, when a guest is reaching orgasm thanks to a host, it seems to me that a consciousness within a host should not change big thing, in a guest point of view. So, with a purely mercantile approach, why waste time developing a complex, superfluous and potentially dangerous consciousness? That defies common sense! 4) The maze. William, a.k.a. the man in black, acts as if the maze was an ultimate Easter egg or even the Holy Grail, and yet he is the owner of Westworld, a company that should be similar to Facebook, Amazon or Apple in terms of market capitalization. One imagines him powerful, immeasurably rich and probably busy. So, why would such a man waste his time searching for a meaningless maze? And how did he get to know this maze, a thing that doesn't exist? That does not make any sense! To deceive the audience as much as possible, this quest pollutes the series with scenes as grotesque as moronic, including a maze engraved under the scalp of a host. Wooooow! Literally incredible and desperately absurd. 5) Freedom. At the very end of the first season, Maeve Millay, the brothel madam in the Mariposa Saloon, abandons all of a sudden her project of freedom to find her daughter, while she is fully aware of being an android. As a matter of facts, androids do not get pregnant, androids do not give birth, androids do not raise children. At all! She is supposed to be conscious and smart, this parameter having been increased 'all the way to the top' during the sixth episode. So, this incomprehensible plot twist is worthy of a vulgar soap opera. 6) The weapons. We see a lot of Remingtons, Rambo knives, bows and arrows. How can a guest be immune to a weapon that is lethal to hosts? How does it work? Same remark as in the second point with a complete lack of pedagogy. As a synthesis: despite irritating flaws, the series is interesting and addresses exciting topics such as artificial intelligence and consciousness. In addition, the sets, costumes and landscapes are beautiful. Finally, the actors are overall excellent, especially Ed Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Wright and ... Thandie Newton, gorgeous and divine as usual, if not more than usual! As a postscript, my favorite quotes: You can't play God without being acquainted with the devil. Oh Felix, you really do make a terrible human being, and I mean that as a compliment. These violent delights have violent ends. How many times have you died? Some people see the ugliness in this world, I choose to see the beauty, but beauty is a lure. Are we nothing more than creatures of our programming? There aren't two versions of me, there's only one, when I discover who I am, I'll be free. One day, I realized I'd made a mistake, consciousness isn't a journey upward, but a journey inward, not a pyramid but a maze, every choice could bring you closer to the center, or send you spiraling to the edges, to madness. It's definitely worth a try.
1.0~Season 2 is such a failure...One of the most overrated TV shows of all time alkimistu Sign in Permalink Season one was not that bad, but season two is confusing, incoherent and has a very boring storyline. So much potential and money wasted.. I've watched more than one hundred TV shows and none of them was such an utterless crap. This show has become so stupid. I want my wasted time back... I've stopped watching it after third episode of season three.
10.0~lucid dreams + hypnosis + ftp + blade runner cvelee-847-254514 Sign in Permalink if you have lucid dreams regularly, you understand that most of it is f**k & kill... .. yet after some time you realize that there is some DEEP GAME to it:) if you can hypnotize than you know that that "robot" programming stuff is utterly real. all these codes are just posthypnotic suggestions. all these plots are just our habits stemming from our unconsciousness. after all you have to ask yourself what is the nature of being alive. this TV show is just subtle way of exposing real human psyche. we are robots. they are us... what is than the nature of consciousness? just perceiving maybe?
8.0~Better than the Movie from the 70's princechin Sign in Permalink Westworld is a show about a futuristic amusement park which is based in the western period of the 19th century, it isn't a typical amusement park however; Westworld has robots all throughout the amusement park called "hosts". These hosts in the original Westworld during the 70's could be easily distinguished based on their hands which didn't look realistic at all, and the guests knew who were real and who weren't. This iteration of Westworld goes deeper into the story of Westworld, filled with mysterious phenomena, the robots are slowly on the verge of gaining consciousness, and forming their own decisions. Don't worry, in Westworld a "host" can't harm you (which is what they tell you).
3.0~Disappointing joaosantos20 Sign in Permalink This show is the disappointment of the year for me. The actors are very good, but the script is full of holes the size of the westworld. I refuse to do another spoiler review so I will not mention anything but come one, really?! And it gets so boring I could hardly keep my eyes open a lot of the times. There is amazing dialogue and just plain "lets fill a page" bla bla. It gives the suspense of Lost with the maze thing, some Blade Runner and Matrix inspiration for sure, and a lot of Assassins Creed, then they mix it all up and comes an uninspired mess. The landscapes are just eye candy as the little miss. If I were in charge of production I would cut it to 6 episodes, condense and maybe it would be less feet dragging. Watch it with a lot of coffee by your side.
7.0~I'm Yul Brynner..., and I'm dead now. BRYN-26 Sign in Permalink Review based on first 4 episodes (all currently shown). Firstly, to address some points made by other reviews here: 1. profanity ("Fbombs" if you will) - I must really be going soft, as I haven't noticed! 2. nudity - there are nude robots, but with well placed fig leaves, etc. There are some boobs, but hardly prolific (much less so than GoT). It depends on what your baseline is! (are you a BBC viewer new to HBO, etc). 3. slowness - again this is relative. If you are a millennial brought up on Transformers, then it must be like watching paint drying, but, if you are coming to this after watching Midsummer Murders on ITV, then it will seem action packed! Personally, I was happy with the pace, the swearing (that I didn't notice) and the beautiful bodices. What I wasn't happy with was..., mostly everything else! I love a good killer robot movie as much as the next guy, possibly even more so, as The Terminator is my No.1 movie of all time, but what we have so far in Westworld (WW) is not so much killer robots (yet) but philosophical musings (& some raping and killing for good measure), but mostly philosophical musings. Now, I am perfectly happy with this, my No.2 movie of all time is 2001, where very little happens for most of the movie. However, where 2001 succeeds is where WW fails, 2001 works as is it coherent in its fantastical story-line, WW isn't. Nothings seems to fit together at all, and we the viewer are, I suspect, supposed to ignore these things and just "go with the story". But when you get pulled out of the story by the poor story telling then this is difficult. A few of the problems I've noted: 1. In the middle of the desert why is it like water world in the lower levels of the "doll house" complex? 2. Why do the managers keep the "hosts" in the watery basement?! 3. By what method do the managers retrieve the host for each psyche or repair session? 4. If the host is bullet strewn and retired, how does it then "remember" past events? (here it could be the case that the host is repaired, but the implication is that the bullet strewn hosts are disposed of and replaced with a fresh model). 5. Why do the bullets that can blow a host's face off, smash a glass, not inflict damage on the guests (real people)? 6. Is there some Hunger Games BS afoot? What do I mean? {manager} "permission to launch pyrotechnic effect" before the cell-door explosion. Er, what? So if manager 2 had said "no" does this mean that Black Hat man's cigar would not have exploded? How does that work??! (it doesn't, that's why is was rubbish..., and was similarly utter tripe in Hunger Games). 7. What happens when a guest picks up an axe and brains another guest? Perhaps the manger will just say "permission to blunt axe"? 8. 6:00 ...put your little hand in mine, there ain't no heaven mountain we.... So each day re-sets itself..., sometimes..., depending..., other times it doesn't. Well, which is it? Seemingly if you are off out on the trail hunting fugitives then the 6:00 alarm doesn't sound, but if you are back in town then you'll wake up anew for another confusing day. Well, 4 episodes in and it's not looking good. I'll stick with it for this series as I'm looking forward to the first human kill (by a host!), after that I think I'll be going back to Humans on Ch4 (which is even worse!!). ----UPDATE AFTER LAST EPISODE S1----- Well, I'd originally rated the show as 3/10 (above). Having now seen the whole of Season 1 I have changed my rating to 7/10. It is rare indeed that something that starts off poor gets better, but WW certainly did. There were still flaws and plenty of things to nit-pick about..., however, my new rating is based on how thoroughly entertained I was in the last few episodes, which I was! And I loved the final Resident Evil-esque scene! Cease all motor functions!
10.0~Wow, That Was Wild mnsmb7 Sign in Permalink This is one of the coolest ideas for a television show I have seen in a while. The acting is superb, the writing is fantastic and the plot is fantastic. I watched the entire first season in less than a week. I will warn that there is quite a bit of nudity. The shows interesting idea is questioning what really makes someone human and what does separate man from machine? This show draws you in form the beginning and slowly begins to explain the unfolding plot and characters before your eyes. I would recommend this show to anyone who is looking for a new drama to get involved with with the knowledge that after ten episodes it will be a year or longer before the next season is released. The main cast provides some excellent examples of acting and this is not a show you can just throw on and do other things. If you do that you wont truly appreciate how great this show is. It's similar to Game of Thrones in that respect.
5.0~I see where this is going... apexpropaint Sign in Permalink Yet again the Hollywood leftists throw their subtle leftist wants of how they think the world should be instead of the reality. 2 ladies of color are the smartest one's with the truest motives of all. One a high powered decision maker in a massive corporation, the other a perpetual victim. Both believable but overly obvious as to why they exist. The evil overlord old white man is just about as close to diablo as you can get. Heartless and cruel Hopkins uses his African American robot slave to murder his enemies, the robot shows more anguish over his murderous behavior than the flesh & blood old white man. Great acting all through this show by the whole cast is why it even gets a 5. Zero for the story as I quit watching the show after episode 8 as once again leftists ruined it like they ruin everything else they touch. Not just for the leftist nonsense, but this show has so many subplots it goes a bit overboard.
10.0~One of the best shows ever! vinnie-vlvcv Sign in Permalink This show really taught me a great deal about human nature and the value that 'suffering' has in one's life. Apart from the deep, intense lessons it has to offer by the end of season 1, there's also some incredible performances, great story line, brilliant music and outstanding screenplay. This is one of the shows that require your full attention and though it might get confusing & repetitive at times, especially in the first few episodes, trust me, it's completely worth it. When you get to the end of the first season, you will be extremely happy with the way the suspense element is well maintained throughout the show and the way things end up in westworld by the end of the season will be way out of our imagination.
4.0~Great idea, poor execution glowleaf Sign in Permalink After the first season, we are supposed to be left wanting. But the show doesn't take the time to make the characters worth our attention, so it's just a big "Meh" in the end. The twists are fine, there are Chechov's guns everywhere for those who want to look for them and see the twist coming but truthfully it's not worth it. The science fiction is all over the place, there are huge plot holes and little is ever explained. We don't really know the capabilities and limitations of the technology, sometimes you think the hosts are as strong and as durable as humans, others they are shown to be stronger and capable. I liked the pursuit of consciousness a bit, but the way it's explored is boring to be honest. It's a shame this big budget show isn't more engaging.
10.0~Understand it Before Criticize it ! phdtanveer Sign in Permalink Westworld has the Best 1st Season among all the TV series out there (I have seen all the greatest classics like GOT,Wire,BB,The Sopranos,Deadwood etc.) & It has the MOST COMPLEX story lineup also! Its very much confusing in the beginning & some people might find it boring during that time. But it becomes a crown jewel after episode 5 when you get to understand the complexity & dept of the story! you will feel for the hosts, cry for them being a Human yourself ! Sir Antony Hopkins as Dr. Ford proved again why he is one of the greatest actors that lived ! Beside that Evan Rachel Wood, Thandie Newton, Ed Harris & Jeffrey Wright were amazing also .. This show has breathe taking background score By Ramin Djawadi with cinematography at it's best ! This is Undoubtedly the best Movie to TV series Adaptation by Lisa Joy & Jonathan Nolan! The Bicameral Mind ( 1st Season finale directed by Junior Nolan) will be considered as among "The Classics" of all time in TV series history.An Emmy deserving Finale episode!
5.0~Entertaining, sometimes , but does not deserve the huge hype zenmateisshite Sign in Permalink I've seen the first four episodes so far and it is entertaining but did not impress me. Will update my review if the next episodes change my opinion. The acting is great but characters very lacking. The story is interesting, a bit, but full of holes and not original to say the least. I'm not talking about it being a remake but rather referring to the whole premise which was done, and overdone, so many times before (think: the Matrix, Ex Machina, Moon, Humans (channel 4), I Robot, Blade Runner, a few episodes of Star Trek, along with many others I'm sure). They try to innovate but fall flat and it becomes boring, I nodded off a couple of times. Yes there are so many things that do not make sense and I'm not talking about the unknowns that are revealed very very slowly, but the whole concept is flawed - so these machines running around in a "park" with many story lines that miraculously fit together, even among the robots themselves, whats the point in that? They seem to be removed when needed for fixes and upgrades, how does that work? Emotions can be turned off using a verbal command!! by the developers and self diagnostic done- what a load of bull! Then there is the AI bit where they slowly become self aware. That is baloney and clearly the writers know nothing about cognizant beings. All this is fine but what I really hate about it is that as a show its too full of itself somehow. Its like the producers/writers thought: "now we are on HBO we have made it big and we own the world". The problem is, they don't have anything to show for it! I've seen four episodes now and lowered the rating from 7 to 5. The show is like Lost was when it first came - but after it failed everyone knew that its full of hit.
9.0~Westworld - at the start (ORIGINAL FILM SPOILERS) filmsbyq Sign in Permalink There are many reasons why I might decide to watch a film, television show or series. The director is a common one, as are particular actors. As an aspiring writer, I have a few writers for who I would watch a political broadcast if they wrote it. Top of the list is Joss Whedon. Yep, I'm a huge Buffy Dan, I admit it. Firefly is one of the best single seasons ever written and his web series, Dr. Horrible's singalong blog is brilliant also. Another who pulls me back every time is Aaron Sorkin. The Newsroom is fantastic television, as is The West Wing. I think I may have found another writer, duo actually, to add to my must watch list. I am not a great fan of remakes. Many a modern remake is a pointless cash grab, showing very little creative endeavour or imagination. Especially when the original is a classic film. Carrie? Ben Hur?! Robocop! On television they have tried Lethal Weapon, Rush Hour and - admittedly not at all bad - Limitless. So I was quite perturbed when I heard that the classic Westworld was being remade for television. What?! The Michael Critchon classic? Yul Brynner recast?! No, no, and no again! They can't - and should not - do it! To say I was not looking forward to a remake is an understatement. Then I saw the trailer. Okay, it looked interesting. J. J. Abrams? Hmm. Jonathan Nolan? I may have to take a look. My interest was definitely piqued. In the UK the first episode aired on 4th October. I watched it on replay, not having checked out any of the buzz post show. I was blown away from the opening credits. In a era of brilliant television, to create a fantastic credit sequence might seem frivolous, but the credit sequence is so good it sets the precedent for the rest show. And what a show! Less than ten minutes into the opening episode all ideas of this being a straightforward rehash of the 1973 film are blown away. We are offered the androids as protagonist, as the soul of the story. The antagonist are human. Or maybe both, the first episode leaves this element tantalisingly ambiguous. What we do learn is, just like in the original film, the technology is becoming problematic. In the Michael Critchon film we were introduced to a futuristic theme park, Westworld, where affluent people could come to play out their fantasies in variously theme regions. There is a Roman world, a Medieval world and - most famously - a Westworld. We are taken through this new amazing theme park by Josh Brolin's John, who is returning to the park with a newcomer, Richard Benjamin's Peter. it all initially goes as it should, the two friends, having decided to visit the West themed section, acting out various western fantasies and scenarios; quickdraw shootouts, a robbery, lovely ladies. When something goes wrong and the robots beginning to turn, John is fatally made aware of the faulty systems, leaving Peter running for his life. In the modern version when some of the androids begin glitching the Westworld team want to know why. The androids that glitch seem to be having memories, some type of recall. Though not dangerous, we learn that the scope of the world is such to recall the recently upgraded androids would dramatically affect the 'stories' in play throughout the landscape. Unlike the original, Jonathan and his writing partner, co-showrunner and wife, Lisa Joy Nolan, decide just to keep Westworld western. Whether this is just for the initial first season or not only time will tell. Truth be told, such is the scope and intricacies of the plot and its various strands, that to spread across three possible 'worlds' would not only be difficult to follow but possibly foolhardy. Those Nolans definitely know what they are doing. This being a HBO production, the bar was always going to be high. HBO have been at the forefront of unmissable television for the past decade. Such is their pull, they are able to attract actors who normally work predominantly in film onto the small screen. Westworld is no different, with Anthony Hopkins, Thandie Newton, Ed Harris and James Marsden all integral parts of the show, suffice to say the acting is first rate. The show looks amazing. The dusty western setting contrasting with the clean, clinical settings of the technicians and android areas. I like the score, mysterious and haunting and I love Evan Rachel Wood's central performance as Dolores, the unknowing central protagonist, who takes us back to the question poised in the book that inspired Blade Runner all those years back; 'do androids dream of electric sheep?' . I'm going to keep watching to find out.
9.0~Westworld > The Matrix + The Black Mirror + Lost reza-marzooghi Sign in Permalink If you've been immersed into the deep thoughts of the Matrix, the flabbergasting mysteries of Lost and the sceptic darkness of the Black Mirror, this will take you deeper beyond them all.
5.0~Westworld S02 is a disappointing departure from the better S01 GerryofNorVA Sign in Permalink Let me get right to the point with Westworld Season 2 - it's "LOST" redux. The whole mysteries wrapped in riddles, flashing back, flashing forward, never sure of what's reality and what's not, entire episodes devoted to character deep dives, each had its own major character known as "Man in Black", and of course, JJ Abrams was an exec producer on both series. Sure, the details are different, but make no mistake here, it's the same playbook - lookin' at you JJ. You know I don't need to convince you. Look at everyone's comments in every blog/forum, it's the same confusion, frustration, "the writers don't know what they're doing", and "I'm done with it" finality. And just like with the later seasons of "LOST" I feel like WW's second season requires a re-watch. There are sooooo many WTF moments and narrative entanglements that you're left with a "what just happened?" feeling after the first watch. You need the second viewing to try to make sense of it. But that requires a commitment from the viewer that's just not guaranteed, especially for those of us burned by "LOST" not even 10 yrs ago. To me, there were too many licenses taken, ridiculous implausibilities, and too much predictability that it doesn't deserve, doesn't rate my second viewing. However, I don't view it as a waste, I did get a few core takeaways, the main one being that WW is a colorful proxy for our own questions of reality, of god(s), of fate, of free will which you've been exposed to all through school/college. But in the end, it's just a story, just some guy's musings that he wrote down and sold to a studio then interpreted and presented by Abrams/Nolan/Joy. They're just like you and me, and apparently not all that great at what they're paid very well to do.
8.0~Great idea, but ruined in some ways legyman Sign in Permalink This idea of humanoid world is perfect. I think, it will be something like that in not so far future. Back to the script - after first 3-4 episodes..great. Than that overthinking came again....Too many pasive scenes, they should show more visitors in westworld, with and without problems. There are many mistakes too. I never understood about indians there - they were taking scalps, shotting with arrows...so how would they not kill any visitor? Anyway, the script could and should be better.
1.0~Dull and pretentious RealReviewer1981 Sign in Permalink A dumbshow that tries to be smart but fails at every turn. Pretentious rubbish. Over rated and not worth your time.
1.0~Complete and utter nonsense randymcbeast Sign in Permalink I just finished up season one and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I don't get how this series is rated so high? It's garbage. I started listing out all of the moronic events but there were just too many. One dumb thing after another, after another. Nothing made sense and in the end it was just such a waste of time. I know there are heavy hitters involved with this like Jonathan Nolan but after seeing this I have lost all respect for him. Unfortunately, he has a past resume that will allow him to do more projects in the future. If I was his boss I would fire him immediately, but one can only dream. There were some bright spots like Anthony Hopkins but the way the story was told and directed it didn't matter who the actors were. It was so bad and poorly done that there really shouldn't be a second season. However, there will be. Unbelievable. I really don't get it. Such garbage.
1.0~Yes this really depicts the worst of "West" World doogal-68850 Sign in Permalink Oh dear. I loved the original Westworld it had a dash of humour and cheekiness. Yul Brynner was superb as the gunslinger. He was made for that part. This show depicts what Western culture is like now. It is getting worse. Don't worry I am not racist. I am a Caucasian Aussie male so I am talking about Aussies as well. You know, in many cultures, getting angry or being aggressive is a real sign of weakness. Apparently it defines people in this show. There is a difference between having great strength and being aggressive. The woman boss "Theresa Cullen" is truly horrific. She has nothing pleasant to say and is sarcastic and nasty. A real piece of work. Women do not have to try and prove themselves in every interaction to be strong. I have met a lot of strong women in my life, and none of them had to be aggressive. What is worse is that everybody just cops it sweet from her. It's a disgrace. I started watching the movie "The Truth" the other day. Again, it had Cate Blanchett playing an aggressive woman. Why? Can a woman not walk into a room and make a case without being aggro? I am sure they can. Women have a lovely strength to me anyway, so what has happened? The only thing that makes everyone look good is the "Lee Sizemore" character. Wow. Could this be the worst acting I have ever encountered. Apparently if you rant and rave - again you are strong. I guess he is British so he is the stereotype of a whinger. The only character I had any empathy for is Jeffrey Wright as "Bernard Lowe". He has a quiet assured dignity. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors. You can tell when he is engaged in the show. This is not that time. He may as well lay down on a park bench. What a waste. Ed Harris would look better if he had some strong support around him. Again, I love him in just about everything. He talks too much to be mysterious in this one. What is sadder is we have to go back over the same scenes that are woeful the first time. Somebody here mentioned it is like it was written by teenagers. That is so true. Plus, you don't have to say F to be cool. You can drop it in from "time to time". If this is what the "West" has become, then please place me in a time capsule back to 1973. The only positive is that I only wasted an hour of my life and will not feel like I will have missed anything
10.0~Love it - a change from the usual cop shows that are around virginiacottrell Sign in Permalink Great show, loving each episode. A little bit disappointed with the character that is based on the main character in the original movie which was played by Yul Brynner. I think having Anthony Hopkins in a leading role makes this show as it gives it that certain edge that only he can do. There are a few weak characters in both hosts and humans but it seems to balance out. I wasn't sure if this show was going to make it to be honest but it's only growing in strength and as the characters grow. I hope that it can keep it up as it could end up in a heap but so far I'm loving it. One of my favorite shows at the moment, along with The Exorcist.
2.0~I weep for humanity... breannesartori Sign in Permalink How on earth is this show so highly rated? I don't think I've ever seen a show with such lazy writing. Major plot holes, inconsistencies, logical fallacies and a severe lack of character development are just some of the issues with this series. You can see the "twists" coming a mile away and the focus on the hosts and their stories is just boring. There's nothing that really happens - just the same thing over and over again. Despite what a lot of reviewers say, this is not intellectual or philosophical. It pretends to be but it's an incredibly thin veneer. The fact that people honestly think this show has something intelligent to say makes me weep for humanity.
10.0~Thought about what to write as a review- ofirassaf Sign in Permalink After finishing second season. All that have come to my mind is this - This show is how television SHOULD be made. Go watch it.
7.0~Great, innovative series but some big potholes grayner-2 Sign in Permalink This is a great show and very much worth watching. It expertly combines the genres of western and sci-fi, has amazing acting and dialogue and writing, scenery, production values. The episodes deal with some very complex topics and the season is revealed on 2 (some argue 3) timelines. It is intriguing, entertaining and pioneering television. However, for me personally, this should have been a limited series. I think the objectives and general theme - the AI revolt and take over, the different views of what makes consciousness and humanity - have been played out. I think this will be difficult to sustain over multiple seasons. Beyond this, despite the fact that we are to suspend our disbelief about the subject matter, I find some of the plot holes in the sow very daunting. These include: 1) Apparently, much of the park runs 24/7 with all of the AI playing out their loops at the cost of millions and millions, even though a guest may not even be there. In the case of Logan and William, we see literally a cast of hundreds and hundreds, plus tons of infrastructure and AI horses etc., for just 2 people. One wonders what happens if there are 1400 guests in the park. Do they all get hundreds of hosts? $40,000 a day would not nearly cover this. There are also vast areas of the park where guests rarely go but the AI are running their loops endlessly anyway. 2) Hosts can interact, have sex even kill each other without any guest being present. 3) So sometimes they can pinpoint when a host glitches, like Abernathy. Other times, Maeve can drag a safe down the street, be somewhere completely different, be 1000% off script and it is not noticed. Even if you argue Ford manipulated things to block her from the system, would they not notice she is not physically in the saloon where she is supposed to be? 4) Hosts can also be up top for hours at a time at the lab. So what happens to the other people they are interacting with? If Maeve is gone for hours in the lab, wouldn't that seriously affect the whole saloon scene? 5) The whole Felix/Sylvester/Maeve storyline is silly. Maeve can intimidate them but, you know, instead of turning her off immediately or turning her intelligence to 1, she talks them into giving her more and more rights and more intelligence. 6) These simple lab guys have the power to radically change Maeve, even give her increased intelligence. And then Behavior can make her have rights to control Bernard? Even if you argue Ford was behind all of this, why not just give Maeve these capabilities and avoid the whole Felix/Sylvester thing where she, you know, essentially murders Sylvester, jeopardizing the plan or where she depends on a couple feckless lab guys to get the job done? 7) To me, there is way too little focus on guests. We see a few random guests, mainly William and Logan in the early years, otherwise mainly patrons at the saloon. This series is less gripping to me knowing it is mainly a war between the hosts and the techs. This park needs more actual guests interacting more with the hosts. 8) MIB is a majority shareholder but can walk around apparently unnoticed, create whatever millions in damages he wants, and no one ever sees him except Ford? Despite these and other issues, it is still a very gripping series worth watching.
10.0~Bring It On! virginiacottrell Sign in Permalink Excellent adaptation of the original 1973 movie of the same name, which if you don't know.. is a science fiction Western thriller film written and directed by novelist Michael Crichton about amusement park androids that malfunction and begin killing visitors. It stars Yul Brynner as an android in a futuristic Western-themed amusement park. If you have not seen it you must. In this TV adaptation Anthony Hopkins is fantastic, as are the other actors. Script good..tick Actors good...tick Cinematography good..tick Just great and cant wait for season 2.
1.0~Slow, illogical, bad taneemit Sign in Permalink Anyone who is saying it is great because they have never watched anything similar or as good, my recommendation would be to watch "Real Humans". More intense, practical and logical sci-fi. Also, didn't like how the story kept changing from past, present, past for many characters - all within very short span of time. Overall, I just wasted my time watching 10 episodes of Westworld.
6.0~Why is everyone whispering? vlatkapav Sign in Permalink ATTN!-NO SPOILERS BC NOTHING MUCH HAPPENS ANYWAY 10 stars for Season 1. 3 stars for Season 2. Average of 6.5 total from me. So.much.whispering. And for no reason at all! What started as one of truly amazing jaw dropping new shows on TV nowdays among Black Mirror and GOT which can still keep the viewer interested, disolved into a sensless AI tragedy with slow acting and constant melodramatic background music. I had huge expectations from this show, however the WOW factor from S1 was very hard to find in S2. Shame though, as the show has some real quality filmmaking and the topic of conscious AIs (usually portrated only as cold blooded killing machines) as possibly better beings than humans seemed to be a scary, therefore, a briliant idea for all viewers and not just action junkies or tech geeks. Very sad about how it turned out bc it could have been a great show, or they could have just stopped after S1. If it does return for S3 I hope they make the story telling somewhat simpler than in S2 as the show makes you think well enough even without this sort of 'Twin Peaks/Legion' type of what-is-real/where-are-we-now kind of thing which is popular nowdays, as it might lose some part of the audience.
7.0~the concept is well shown on the screen. gaikwadashok-99218 Sign in Permalink I loved how the series go on,and then final scene was best. Why there is season 2 ? perhaps all things are shown and perfectly
2.0~Make them feel "SMART! " nakithn-25152 Sign in Permalink This show has nothing Original (Inception. Lost. The Original Westworld. Blade Runner. The Wild Bunch. The Terminator. Dances With Wolves and ...) Pseudo philosophical conversations (No one talks like that) and too much violence, nudity and BDSM aimed at teenagers just like other shows by HBO Where are THE GUESTS? Apart from William and his brother in law who are the owners i see no other guest! We should assume that all this "World" is created for him? All that money is wasted for one man to "Enjoy"? I mean it's his money but still two seasons and not even a guest. Very Cost effective! How did the Government (USA or a virtual world?!) allow them to create this risky business without having control over the security!?? How couldn't they predict the riot? the security is a joke and the guns are funny. ITS 2060 AND YOU CANNOT HANDLE BUNCH OF COWBOYS AND INDIANS?! Dolores won't die! Then later Bernard shoots her in the head and she dies so why didn't William just shoot her head in the first place? Cheap trick to give her enough time? Is William a host too? How do they actually die? Do they have organs like humans? How is Maeve controlling other hosts? Never explained How did the hosts learn so quickly to use "Modern Guns"? Which bullets are real? Which bullets are fake? How do the fake bullets break glass yet don't harm the guests? Never explained A 40 year old company has two of the most pathetic and stupid characters to fix injured robots (Not to mention the homosexual stripper) and no one is checking the rooms by camera or microphone until it's too late and the two decide to obey the bot instead of turning her off or make her dumber! Like all other HBO shows Hardcore Feminism is all over the show. Men are evil and those who aren't are serving the women. Women are the "Heroes" and "Game Changers" Because almost all the characters are robots and the rest of them we r not sure of, makes it impossible to relate or care for the characters Because of the over-complicated and pretentious narrative and plot holes you no longer care. Anthony Hopkins preaches pseudo philosophical sermons to fool us into thinking that this show is DEEP. Who cares about your purpose, FORD? It answers 3 of your questions but creates 50 more unanswered just like LOST Also William's character is very childish and immature asking questions about life like a teenager The 2 stars i gave is for the special effects and cinematography but don't let them fool you
1.0~Really.... what's the point of season 2 bbgadget Sign in Permalink 1st series was mind blowing. 2nd series was just blown.
10.0~Even better than my original review...if there were a 12, Id check it! vanettelstarr Sign in Permalink This is a series that far outweighs even the heaviest heavy weight block buster epic contenders, this year, or well, quite honestly, of all time....there are only a few that win the all time list, but this one comes close...trust me?! I mean that sincerely. Id paid so much money over the years to see the greatest movies, as my father, when i was a child, turned me into a movie buff, addicted to seeing through plots, characters, seeing the end before the end was even there yet. This one is only a simple made for TV series, yet the twists and turns, and the character reads are hard to even follow..as you suspected one character to be a bad guy, only to find out he is one of the big shots in the industry of making westward, the theme park, a sort of life changing ride of the virtual century, some time in the future, where we get to get away from the mundane and do a character check, in this lawless unreality! Only to find out, people and agendas are not what you thought they would be, and that this plot even switches, twists and turns so rapidly, still maintaining its own narrative! Its fantastic beyond fantastic! It will not fail you or fail to offer you anything, anything at all, even if you weren't looking for it. Though, at the point of only episode 9 in our first season. I mean, if there is even a question mark in whether or not there will be a season 2, i think you just have to watch the first six episodes, and you have that answer already. The humanoid lookalikes, surprise, and astonish, as well as we are starting to see so many characters disappear, be killed, accidentally or not, this is turning into one of the best "WHO DONE ITS", that it should go down in history of a first one of its kind...a series that feels like a movie, in each installment, with the top of the line actors, costumes, directors, the best editors, photo story boards, cinematographers, character interviews and casting directors, and so on... etc...?! Promise you, you will not be left wanting for a more, upon the end of each and everyone of these episodes...not like some series, and yes, even a movie or two...who shamelessly throw you into to cliff hanger situation, week after week or in case ..so you are truly addicted and must watch or your life won-tn feel complete? This one is complete, week after week, except for more! More of this man made world, and the madness of espionage, and counter corp espionage, as well as a few true love stories, and a cowboys and Indians, as well as who will win this espionage trip, if you can even figure out who is creating the problems. Like i said, i have been trained to see where the holes and leaks and the covered up the entrance to the real rabbit hole, might be...and I've found myself shocked so many times, I'm getting used to just going along for the fun filled, fantastic ride. I've decided, after all these years of using so many great mystery dramas, as my guild post of who done its, but decided that its more fun and more exciting to ride along with one of thee best written and well conceived pieces of work, in order to just enjoy the creative work of so many greats! The actors of course are all either winners or nominated winners of prestigious awards, already, the writers are top of the line, the editors, the cinematographers, the whole damn crew...well, after 50 years, i can say there hasn't been anything much better, even if this were to be a movie of the most decorated characters, the list line up of crews, and a group of workers that are all voted best at the top of the lists of each of their field in movies...with a small or limited budget for their marketing??? I can not say anything more...just watch it and see what I am speaking to you about. Sometimes, the only way to experience top of the line cashmere, is to put it on and wear it all day....this is the case with one of the best films made for TV, this year, or this last century, if I might be safe in saying so...it feels complete and right, every time! You will question, but you are left with enough to satiate you and keep you coming back in a healthy manner! Enjoy!
3.0~Westworld - 2nd Season - A Complete Mess claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink In 1973, the cult "Westworld" by Michael Crichton was a successful sci-fi of my generation and a sort of grandfather of other robots films, such as "The Stepford Wives", "Blade Runner" and mainly "The Terminator". In 2016, HBO released "Westworld", a promising series based on the 1973 "Westworld" but with AI. The First Season was entertaining and left fans waiting for the Second Season. Unfortunately the awaited Second Season is a complete mess, with a confused storyline without timeline. Bernard´s shuffled recollections is awful and the motive of each lead character is weak (Maeve wants to retrieve her daughter; Man in Black to destroy the park; Dolores to go to the outside world; Hale to retrieve and transmit important information). In the end, this season is a complete waste of time. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Westworld"
10.0~If you like to think, it's for you. jennifer-28804 Sign in Permalink I'm compelled to post my first review on IMDB about this show. I've scrolled through the "1"s, who claim it boring with poor writing. I found my experience to be the exact opposite. The societal underpinnings of this show are incredible and thought provoking. As you watch, you find your empathy switching from human to robot and make wonder at what AI will bring us. An incredible treat into the vaction of the future, how do we maintain control while furthering the realism we will seek? I love that I have to rewatch some episodes, as the non-linear roller coaster forces the viewer to use their brain. Beautiful and brilliant, if I could give 20 stars, I would.
10.0~One of the best HBO shows TheProteanGirl Sign in Permalink Wow I love this show so much!! It is literally my favorite HBO and in general show so far surpassing GOT for me by miles. I love the topic and the cast is just the best! I loved season 1 with a passion, season 2 is also great but i hate how there are so many filler scenes with shooting guns and fighting and they lost the main point from season 1: the philosophical aspects that were explore 90% of the time in season 1 questioning what life is, consciousness and all these wonderful topics. I hope they don't go down the drain and start making the show to appeal to the populous and to get ratings because it would ruin a great great concept. I love that its non-linear timeline but I feel like some things need to be explained in the future very well. If they don't do that it would be very confusing in the end. But the twists and turns are great! I was always hoping that William (as his young self) would be with Dolores because they are both so much alike (in my personal opinion). I'm super excited for season 3 but I hope so badly it doesn't spiral out of control and lose the philosophical aspects they explored and questioned in the first season because that would suck.
9.0~Maeve went off script glktoo Sign in Permalink After Maeve has Bernard revived. When the two of them are talking you can see the main headings,on the device Bernard is holding, in yellow there's Escape then Train then Mainland. Right before Maeve broke the device Bernard says when you get to the Mainland. That means when Maeve got off the train to find her "daughter" see went off script and for the first time a host made an independent decision. All the actions of Deloris/Wyatt were programmed by Ford. It's not hate, violence or lust that motivates the first independent action by a host it's the strongest emotion of all love. When Maeve makes the first ever off script independent decision ever by a host it's because of love for her "daughter".
7.0~A brutal fate of an idea TheGreatMarkukini Sign in Permalink The first episode was extremely unclear to me and during the whole hour I was wondering why multitudes of people praise the series and lose their minds speaking of it. The situation critically changed in the second episode where everything became incredibly clear and mysterious at the same moment. Frankly, the topic of the wild west has always been interesting cause you could expect everything and here it comes to the next level. Even wildest thoughts are overshadowed by the events jumping out of the blue in front of your eyes. The storyline keeps hiding its secrets, gradually giving a peek onto what it is preparing for us. The creators have introduced major tricks into the game that astonished with its explanation, however, despite its coolness after third or fourth time the "invention" becomes old and predictable. It was the first nail that want into the coffin. Slowly but steady we go through every character and the finale of the first season hits you like a train and leaves without any words to say. Second season, however, tries to up the stakes and this rather bold move made some grave mistakes in my opinion and created some disappointing moments. The hammer thudded over the second nail. Overall, the idea is superb, but the complexity and the scope leave a lot of unanswered questions that bother you in critical moments of the story. Another sensation for me was the performance of Ed Harris. It has been a long time since I have seen him and the series gave him the chance to shine and oh boy, I would say that he has almost succeeded in turning the whole system around himself. Dusting off the hat, I would say that the TV-series has "The Gunslinger" effect as the beginning is vague and complicated, but my advice is to move past the first episode and then you will find yourself in the world of unlimited possibilities and captivating adventures. There will be a third season and with the coffin half-closed I hope we will set the concept free, or otherwise it will be irreversibly buried in the grounds of mistakes.
8.0~Don't give up, it's about to get great! gn-54256 Sign in Permalink Was super excited when I saw this pop up as I'm a fan of the original movie, but after 4 episodes I was ready to bail. Long drawn out scenes of, frankly, boring content. Way too much focus on story lines, locations and characters that just didn't interest me at all with a couple of really annoying actors. And then episode 5 landed... Trust me, stick with it and you'll find yourself desperate for the next episode. I could rattle on about how great Hopkins is but we already know that. The person stealing the show for me at the moment is Thandie Newton - outstanding! Don't be put off by the drearily slow start to what, I'm sure, is a future classic in the making. Roll on EP9 :)
7.0~Amazing first season and confusing second ioandiankov Sign in Permalink When I watched the first season I fell in love with the series. It's amazing script, actors and visual work are absolutely fantastic. In the end I felt like it didn't need any continuation, but the second season was already on it's way and I was EXCITED! Not anymore. I watched it in three days and I was disappointed. In the end I didn't felt nothing but confusion. Why was the movie on several timelines, following enormous amount of heroes? It was just convoluted over the top. I would prefer to have just watched season 1 and feel great again. MAKE WESTWORLD GREAT AGAIN!
5.0~Season 2 - disappointing so far. BrentCowey Sign in Permalink I'll keep this brief and maybe update it later. I am now watching S2E05. My wife gave up on this after the end of S1. Season one, based on the premise of the original concept was fantasy, escapism, sex, indulgence and violence. With a dark twist when things go wrong. Season 2 seems to have changed the style in as much as there is no sex, depravity of mans darker side, escapism, fantasy... just robots on the rampage and some very confusing time-line shifts. Oh and lots of violence. Sure there is more to it than that but I don't want to do the whole spoiler thing. It is still good but I think it is trying to be too convoluted and too clever. I am still pushing on with this as I hate to not see how things go on a show I have started.... but it is hard work so far....
6.0~Season 1 so good. Season 2 so bad m-gretha-anna Sign in Permalink I thought season 1 terribly good. Amongst the great shows out there. So I was happy when season 2 begun. What a let down. Just some strange stories,, strange time lines. Very amateuristic. Nothing like season 1 To be honest I did not watch all episodes. It was boring beyond words. When you put a series like this on screen you have to know what you do and have a good idea where you wanna go. This is just rubbish. A 9 and a 3 makes 12. Hence the 6
1.0~Rating for season 2 taxifree Sign in Permalink Dont get fooled by the 8.8 rating, this is for the first season. This series started out pretty good, not great imo, but pretty good. The first season had an exciting plot and managed to keep the suspense throughout the season. Original and well made. But... and its a big BUT! The second season it all went downhill.. it just became a big mess, nothing made you want to keep watching.. After about 3 episodes into the second season I seriously considered to stop watching the show. Nothing at all like season 1, just bleh... Im gonna give it 3 episodes into season 3, if its anything like season 2 im throwing this show out of my list
2.0~Very slow jhr2012 Sign in Permalink I give up. I was willing to give this series a chance but 3/4 way through the third episode I give up. This thing moves at a snails pace. There's obviously something going on with the hosts, but who knows what. They give very few clues and it is so frustrating. I also find it ridiculous that they don't give you any insight as to who Ed Harris' character is, or why he is even in the show? This is doubly frustrating when I have to wait a week between episodes. I have to have some idea as to what is going on, and to care about the characters for a series like this to hold my interest. There are too many other shows available for me to waste my time with this mess.
5.0~Season 1: 9/10......Season 2: 1/10 nilsurban-50399 Sign in Permalink It is hard to understand how one of the most promising TV Series could go from such heights as season 1 to the lows of season 2. I guess the writer hosts for season 2 were stuck in a bad loop.... I forced myself to watch season 2 until episode 8 (none of the eight episodes was good, most of them feel like badly done fillers)...but I had enough of this crap now... game over
1.0~Repetitive and dull emmabrown-71959 Sign in Permalink Tries very hard to be Art and is derivative, who cares if another robot bites the dust. Projects naïve understanding of concepts such as freedom. Written by an undergraduate.
6.0~Underwhelming The_Cake_of_Roth Sign in Permalink I thought the first couple of episodes were promising, but the show paid diminishing returns as it went along. I found myself much more interested in everything going on outside the actual park because there are a lot of action scenes where the stakes are inherently low/nonexistent... neither the guests nor the hosts can die (or die permanently) and the side narratives feel like they kind of stall the larger story rather than push it along, so I wasn't very invested in those parts. So much of the show feels redundant from one episode to the next, like it keeps running over the same ideas but without expanding them... it just sort of repeats them and piles on more plot developments. There's also a ludicrous amount of twists that feel sort of arbitrary at a certain point and aren't always earned, like they're just there for the sake of shock value. On the whole, I just found this first season to be really muddled and overwrought at times (the finale in particular) and not as clever as it thought it was being. At times, the dialogue is too on-the-nose, obviously expository, or just flat out bad in its attempt to be profound (the maze is just a metaphor for an inward journey?). The acting from the main players is good, but I found some of the performances among the upper management/technicians/creative team to be either wooden or overly affected and it didn't help that some of them are kind of one-dimensional in their characterization and not particularly interesting. I think Blade Runner covers the same thematic ground much more economically and I felt like this sort of material really didn't need to be stretched over 10 hour-long episodes.
10.0~It's Not Just Television, It's Art corcoos Sign in Permalink My first clue that this might be something special came at the end of the first episode. There was a scene when something happened that gave an inside into the psychological changes of a character. But it was subtle enough for me to think that this is finally a show that doesn't treat it's viewers like absolute morons. After that I was in doubt. Surely, I might have missed something stupid, and anyway the show will not be able to sustain this level of quality. But I was wrong, the show was wonderful till the end, on par for me with the first season of Twin Peaks. The music is good, and there are many wonderful, but not gratuitous shots. There is also nudity. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude and above enjoying some random nudity in a TV show, but here it serves a precise purpose. And while the ladies are lovely, the context is usually anything but sexy. I should also mention the perfect cast, with Mr. Hopkins at his best. But the meat of the show was the well written dialogue and the story. I've never before felt a need in a TV show for an action scene to end just to hear what they are going to say next. And the story at its core is a hardcore SF, and an interesting one with an original angle. In the end, let me just say that this isn't "Game of Thrones". It's better!
5.0~Feels empty despite amazing production values. jeroen-106 Sign in Permalink Phenomenal production value and a great premise, but after seeing one season and a few episodes of season 2 I still don't really care about any of the characters. As someone put it eloquently the show "opted to value its puzzle box structure above everything else, letting its stories serve the secrets rather than the other way around." And what happens when you as a viewer solve that puzzle, there isn't enough left to fill the narrative void. Season 2 is definitely better in that respect - a more straightforward form of storytelling. 'Robot Revenge' however gets stale very quickly. Too many people get killed, too much gore. I get it! Can we skip passed that please and focus on anything beyond physical conflict? West World suffers from what I call "and then, and then" - basically several events strung together... Things keep happening but I don't get the time to invest in deep rooted character motivations. Its characters feel very robot like - and not in a good way.
9.0~A Great Show, with a few issues. brentstansfield Sign in Permalink I read this book a long time ago and while I've never seen a movie or TV show do the book justice, this show comes very close. The first season was awesome. Action packed, and by the end, I was rooting for the Hosts. The second season was good, but a bit disjointed. There are times when you don't know if we are looking at the past or present. It does get easier as the show moves forward. I'm really interested to see what direction the third season has in store, while not as big a fan for season two, it's still an excellent show, and season 3 will hopefully pull it all together. Can't wait. As alway's, this is just one mans opinion, watch it for yourself and let the fans know what you think.
10.0~Soul Crushing Performances HDavis-857-798345 Sign in Permalink I consider myself a consumer of television of all ranges and types. For the most part, I can get into any show, good or bad. With that said, Jeffrey Wright's performance is the most haunting and affecting piece of acting I have ever witnessed. It will be a travesty if he doesn't win an Emmy for it. The show is beautifully produced and the story unwinds with a sinuous grace, but the performances will be what sticks with you. James Marsden is solid as Teddy and Ed Harris brings his predictable gravitas to the Man In Black, but they are completely overshadowed by stunning work from Thandie Newton, Evan Rachel Wood, and Jeffrey Wright. In particular, Wright blurred the line between fiction and reality with his tender and eminently subtle approach to Bernard. His scenes with Anthony Hopkins are enthralling, and it is a testament to his ability that Hopkins is never the actor you are left thinking about. This is one of the hallmark characters that will stand up to the Walter Whites and Tony Sopranos, even if he is gone too soon. Thank you, Mr. Wright, for an unforgettable ride.
8.0~Amazing Television So Far!... MovieHoliks Sign in Permalink I just finished the second episode of this new highly-anticipated HBO series, of course based on the 1973 Michael Crichton film. This show takes the movie to a whole other level, going into areas "A.I." and "Blade Runner" explored, as far as how much and to what degree artificial intelligence can contemplate their own existence. I believe this is HBO's biggest original production to date, and it shows. Evan Rachel Wood is pretty much the lead character, and she has really come a long way since her pre-"Thirteen" days -- has blossomed into every bit a beautiful leading lady starlet as she was an adorable young child actress. She just steals the show in every scene she's in. And Oscar winner Sir Anthony Hopkins is the mad-man scientist at the helm creating all this virtual craziness! LOL Ed Harris, James Marsden, and Thandie Newton (lookin especially DEEEE-lish!) also round out the cast.
4.0~HBO Fails in season 2 , Not much like season 1 rebandkurd Sign in Permalink I have watched like 3 first episode, and i have not found a single intrest thing in this season, even they corrupted entire season with just gun firing like any other western movies
2.0~Complete Yawnfest imdb-16840 Sign in Permalink How on earth this show currently has a rating of over 9 on IMDb is a complete mystery to me. The premise is quite interesting - a holiday park staffed by robot characters who gradually start becoming self-aware. Unfortunately this promise is never realised, at least it wasn't before I stopped watching it 8 episodes in. Everything is so slow and strung-out. Things happen for no apparent reason. There are frequent monologues by Anthony Hopkins and some of the human personnel in the park, which serve to slow things down even more, and don't usually advance the snail-like plot much. No-one is likable, not the humans or the robots, and I ended up not caring less what happens in Westworld. What a disappointment.
7.0~Season 1 excellent, season 2 confusing mckennaniall Sign in Permalink I can agree with the other reviewers that have said season 2 is confusing. It's confusing for viewers because of the non-linear timeline, which I think must be Nolan brothers prerequesite. I think films work better with several timelines but if you are tuning in once a week it gets difficult to work out or grasp which timeline things are happening in. This for me, was season 2 downfall. Maybe it works better if you binge watch it one sitting.
3.0~Passing on this series. cokeglas Sign in Permalink You have to be very careful with a premise such as the one this show is presenting and I am afraid it has already lost me after 2 episodes. Like the time travel in Back to The Future, that was solid and pretty impossible to find flaws in. That was done right. Like Fight Club after it was revealed that the Brad Pitt character didn't exist. Were we supposed to believe that Fight Clubs got started after 2 guys watched Ed Norton beat himself up outside a bar? That one didn't hold up to scrutiny. Westworld isn't holding up to close examination already and I get the feeling it is going to break its own rules on a regular basis. Guns don't work on the human guests but they can cause environmental damage such as breaking glass and splintering wood? Safety of the guests is paramount yet adjustments to programming are being made on the fly in a reckless manner? Technicians "forget" to put a robot offline before cutting into it and then don't know how to put it back to sleep and it runs around with a scalpel? The problem with human guests mistaking other guests for robots isn't addressed either. Rape? Murder? Assaults? And the dialogue. My god was it awful. Who talks like that? It is so unnatural and the over-use of profanity felt completely out of place and forced. There's no-one to attach yourself to so far, just a bunch of people delivering monologues and Anthony Hopkins seems comatose and off with the fairies. I'm sure twists and turns will come but I already don't care. For a show like this to work your "rules" have to be airtight and they just aren't only 2 episodes in.
7.0~Brilliant first season, disappointing 2nd jerman-ramirez Sign in Permalink Season 1 was well crafted one of my top favorite shows, a 9 (maybe 10) out of 10. I felt season two was trying too hard. Season 1 was brilliantly written, had a 1 really solid twist and a surprise ending. Season 2 was self aware and gave a "shocking twist" every other episode at the cost of the writing and characters. *SPOILERS BEGIN* Also the deep questions in the 1st seasons had great answers while the philosophical questions in the 2nd season where answered (at times) poorly. The hosts Kept asking "why, why are humans so evil to the hosts?" Like I remember in the 1st season a lot of people came with their families for a fun adventure and to be the hero. also couldn't someone say "We were told you were not sentient, if we knew we wouldn't have done it" At it's core, the recording humans at a park to recreate a person is not possible and took me out of the story. People will behave differently (but not more "true") while at Westworld. It's like saying you can get the full picture of someone while they're at six flags. *SPOILERS END* Lost count at how many times someone came to the rescue when someone was about to get shot, 5/10 for season 2. its probably better to pretend this show only has one season.
5.0~Confusing Mess jexner-94852 Sign in Permalink Where to begin. Totally a mess of a story. The storyline is hard to follow and by the end I really could care less.
1.0~My Perdiction Was Right! af-27543 Sign in Permalink My prediction was right!!! Season 2 really did suck! Speaking only for myself, will not continue with season 3.
10.0~Continuous hints and surprises opiostheloego Sign in Permalink Westword is one of the top five best series of all times, and that is not an assumption, it is a fact. What makes it a fact, is the continuous hints and surprises, the unexpected events that occur, and how these are interacting with each other in the same story that takes place in each episode. Powerful characters that are full of secrets, the unknown time frame, the unknown true identity of this place; what truly is Westword, all that are simply chemistry! The level of success of that complex narration has left all of us speechless. What comes ahead is certainly even more (a lot) of that fascinating superb recipe, and most certainly, expect the line of followers to rise. Start watching if you haven't already, "have many doubts" about what you are watching and expect the unexpected.
7.0~Nice but not enough mehdimoshtaghiuon Sign in Permalink The first series was awesome but the second one was awful 😑
5.0~Season 2 is rushed and the writing shows jameskidac Sign in Permalink Its not believable in the lest, despite having great actors. A big lost opportunity, but when the season was rushed through I kinda expected the worst and got most of it.
10.0~Pure Genius. caseyliddle Sign in Permalink Amazing how every corner of this series is taken an opportunity to play with your mind and does so perfectly. It's like food for you brain. The twist this series takes are great ,whilst missing the clues throughout you'll be kicking your self after the reveals. This show is a must watch. It's sure going to be a challenge to follow this up with season 2.
10.0~Intensely disturbing dance of sociopathic humans and emotional robots redbull-49811 Sign in Permalink No spoilers... I haven't watched the original movie. I won't watch it either, because I want to be guided by this series. The theme song and intro are brilliant. Warm piano music contrast the robot-esque fabrication and programming of man made perfection. The story does not seem to be everlasting in length but almost infinite in width. Imagine what kind of people would pay to go to a place where no laws affect you, where paying customers can murder, rape, live their fantasies without scrupulous. The man made actors and actresses in a real fictional world often seem more human then the paying clients who visit Westworld to create their personal Sodom and Gomorrah. Its a dance of empathy and apathy on every level. The depth is breathtaking, the viewer is treated on a painfully confronting view of what man is capable off.
5.0~Failed to keep my interest CatastropheCatCat Sign in Permalink The story is so appealing and I had very high hopes for this show as it also has very good production. However, the characters and the processing of the scenerio are so boring that I could only stand the first 25 minutes of the first episode. Maybe it was slow for introducing the characters and giving a baseline, but that should be done in an interesting way too. I could not find anything interesting in the show although I had so much interest in the story. To compare with, Orphan Black was not a show that I was interested in its story that much, but it succeed to keep my interest to its very last minute of the last episode of the last season. The show being interesting and the content being interesting are two different things. Nevertheless, I am giving this 5 because of its visuals, production and shooting. To admit, they are really good.
8.0~Shame about the 2nd season aigida Sign in Permalink As good as the first season was, the second season is merely an exercise in showcasing multiple forms of sadism. The only reason I still watch this is because Ed Harris is in it.
10.0~Perfect emrkeskin Sign in Permalink Everyone must watch WESTWORLD. Westworld is the one of best series. I think season 1 better than season 2 but it isn't a big problem.
2.0~Slow & boring stancu-andreeatm Sign in Permalink The idea is interesting but the action is so slow.. I managed to watch 5 episodes until I was bored to death and couldn't watch anymore. This show is overrated..
8.0~9 stars for season 1, but 6 for season 2. gerko92 Sign in Permalink As many others have written, the season 2 is a let down. It's hard to care for anyone anymore, since all the characters have become unlikeable and frankly, boring. Plot makes no sense, is confusing and episodes are full of dumb clichés. Watching the season 2 felt like chore and for that reason unfortunately I can't recommend it to anyone and I'm not going to waste my time anymore with this series. It's a shame that this happens to so many great series.
1.0~Clipping my toenails is more interesting than season 2 sales-85 Sign in Permalink As so many others have said, season 1 was very good, divergent stories all coming together. Much like "True Detective", season 2 is a hot mess. One of my toenails hit an empty beer can and made a cool "clink" sound. That was more interesting than any episode of season 2. Disclaimer: I am old enough to remember seeing the original Westworld movie in 1973 for fifty cents.
9.0~Does justice to the film it was inspired by shearer_number09 Sign in Permalink The spirit of Westworld (c)1973 lives on in this slick, polished 21st century TV update by HBO. The cast is extraordinarily good and I'm enjoying seeing a few Scandinavians sneaking in there amongst the Hollywood stalwarts, obviously Annet Babet Knudsen comes to mind though I have to suspend my disbelief in episode 4 when she tells Sir Tony that she visited Westworld with her parents as a child so how come she has a Danish accent.Similarly in the same episode, the snake girl tells a terrible tale of the slaughter of her family when she was 7 so why has she got a Scandinavian accent, in this case, Norwegian? But this is just nit-picking, this is developing into a fascinating must-see series, with some great touches. Guessing which of my favourite songs will next pervade a whole episode played on the pianola in the saloon, is a high-point. The whole programme manages to draw you in, and like a guest you become part of the Westworld experience whilst as a viewer, you are able to sympathise with the confusion and emotional awakening experienced by the hosts, like watching adolescents develop, fascinating, and extremely well done. Definitely my new favourite series.
7.0~Well done but... gtmail77 Sign in Permalink But why are the hosts "living" lives so independent from the guests. Isn't their only purpose to entertain the rich guests?? They end up shooting it out amongst themselves 2/3 if the time. I could deal with that if it was well into the season and a glitch had developed. Instead the tough talking scientists (huh??) let the hosts do whatever they want and just clean up at night. They couch this whole premise on letting the hosts evolve and participate in continuous storylines w/in the park. Sounds like BS. It's just a way to inject some action and violence into a talkfest series. A la Walking Dead. Hopkins character is worth watching. I'll give it a few more episodes before pulling the plug. Get it??
1.0~The Worst TV Show Ever Made... heavytooth Sign in Permalink Now , I don't actually believe this is the worst TV show ever , but when you consider how much this pile actually cost to make , then it has to go down as the biggest flop of all time. Polished to within an inch of its life , throw in a few well known actors , and spend over 100 million dollars on it , you would expect it to be of a very high quality. Unfortunately , it appears that someone forgot to actually spend a little of the money on some decent writers , the plot line is so thin to be almost transparent , and some of the writing borders on laughable , literally nothing happens for 10 episodes, the plot moves about an inch and then it's over , no thrills , no suspense , it was a real effort to bring myself to keep watching , I kept thinking ," this episode will be better " , but no , same garbage as the previous one.
6.0~A mixed bag laptoppclaptop Sign in Permalink I was first fascinated by this show but then the cracks started to show. I loved the original movie and was very keen to see the new interpretation. It has many good features and at least 3 episodes with very good suspense. But then episodes 8, 9, 10 started to drag and became weary. Good things: the cast and acting is good. Anthony Hopkins, Thandy Newton and some other more and less known actors do a good job. I specially like Hopkins and Newton characters, also the actress who played the "First Clementine". The visuals and scenery are good. The directing as per script seems to be good. What starts to drag this series down is the script, concept and giant plot holes. While you do not expect a 100% accuracy from any of such series, here the plot holes are little to big. I understand that this is a mystery etc but i mean things that come across as not intentional but oversight of script writers and creators of the concept. Such as important things about how the robots function and the rules of their functioning. One example: for some reason, if the service staff comes to collect the damaged robots for re-booting they are always wearing white protective suits with silicon masks. Why? The guests who interact and spent time amongst "corpses" of killed robots do not require any protective suits. Or is it to protect the robots? But from what? When they handle the damaged robots in the laboratory they often do not wear masks. Why do the robots have to be naked when they are re-programmed? Why is it a crime to have them dressed up while talking to them? Also: when in one episode two technicians let the Thandy Newtons character walk into the upper floors -which is against the rules - it is in the full view of everyone as all walls are made of glass. And yet nobody seems to notice. Also, in one episode one of the technicians wants to use the body of a robot sexually while robot is in a sleep mode. He says to his colleague not to tell anyone. But... he is doing it in a glass cabinet in a full view of the whole floor! Another example: Newtons character commands the two technicians to change her program. She could not do much if they refused to do it but they still do and it is never explained why. Concept: I find the shows overall concept a little pathetic. Of course we need secrets, plot twists, etc, but the "secrets" are just little pathetic and far fetched to my taste. I like the scenes that happen in the "office" areas, in the more intimate setting and concentrate just on few characters at the time. All group scenes and endless mindless killing scenes get incredibly boring very soon. Also the repeated killings of the same characters. It does not work as it was intended, it just gets irritating. Its like yes, we get it, can you stop it now? Inn group scenes in desert, bush and small towns it is even difficult to figure out who is who, what is the meaning of this scene and how does it relate to general story. Also I wish it would be easier to separate humans from robots because all robots look just like regular humans.Perhaps all guests could wear a special hat or something. Otherwise it simply difficult to follow what is happening. The alterating between here and now reality and robots memories becomes increasingly confusing and difficult to follow in the second half of season one. Again, i understand it is part of concept but they should show it in such a way that the audiences could keep up and not get completely confused. Most irritating is the story line of Dolores. It is not the fault of the actress of course who is acting well. I blame the script writer and director. Dolores story is a constant tear-jerker and she, Ted and William heavily started to get on my nerves in the end. Her visits of a small town in the desert are very confusing, and i could not keep up with it. There were some episodes that were very good, i think these were 5,6, 7. The beginning was quite good as well but then the season started to drag.
10.0~The best is (hopefully) yet to come farshadfarshimi Sign in Permalink I just watched the 4th episodes last night and frankly speaking, I still couldn't figure out the main theme (themes) of the series. I am not sure which subject is more desirable (by the writers) to be developed in this series but there are some very interesting themes that if expanded wisely, can make the series one the brilliant shows of HBO. I can name the subjects that are highlighted through the story as: morality and AI, AI consciousness, theology and divinity, future of aesthetics and entertainment. However the idea that really moved me was that the authors are trying to explain (discover) human consciousness, morale and psychological evolution through artificial intelligent and by considering them as a platform that is evolving through the story. By and large the series is pretty well-made, the cast is brilliant (Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins are my favorites) and the score completely match the dynamics and I am looking forward to watch next episodes and also cross my fingers for continuous amazement.
8.0~Bit Overated twhankin Sign in Permalink It's a good show yes, great production value, interesting characters, and interesting storylines/ideas, but ultimately it comes up short. The problem is the show's creators got so wrapped up into making it the most creative, thought provoking show on television, that the execution ends up suffering. The resolutions to the story/character arcs are not met with the same level of creativity the ideas are first introduced with. Basically, the show pushes the boundaries in a very unique way, but ultimately falls short of being a tv masterpiece. Trimming back on so many of the creative ideas, and focusing more on spot-on execution would lead to a more enjoyable show from my perspective. Still one of the most ambitious shows on tv, but perhaps too much so. A bit to much pretention with the complexity of ideas. The great works of tv and movies historically challenge the viewer with interesting ideas (think Citizen Kane, Apocalypse Now, Breaking Bad, No Country for Old Men, Blade Runner) but are fully able to deliver in the exceptional detail of how the storylines progress and resolve. This is where Westworld should look to improve.
10.0~Unbelievable! kustuna Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic show! Any one who compares it with GoT, finds it boring or slow, who thinks bad acting, they should go back to their 'Real Housewives on the Prairie' shows. Yes, it may be a little slow, and it's called story building. And that's the beauty of the show. Yes, it goes between past and future. That's called sci-fi, which is the genre of this show. If you want some action, go watch something else, there're so many of them,but WestWorld is only one. Shortly, this is a great show for the ones who can enjoy a good quality and great acting.
9.0~Amazing TV Seeies that keeps on getting better and better big_marcelo Sign in Permalink On series 1 it sets the scene and series 2 keeps on improving it by developing detailed story lines and amazing concepts and situations. All the actors are very good. Script, attention to detail, but Ed Harris .... he steals the show when we he is on a scene ...... I love him, I hate him, every time he appears he demands your attention and your reaction ... that's amazing acting prowess, experience and dedication to his craft ... it's a team sport and you need all the actors to make this show so amazing, but Ed... he steals it...
6.0~Stop using guest writers! elizabeth-logan1 Sign in Permalink I hate when really good shows begin to unravel into confusion under guest writers!
1.0~No spoilers, seriously do not get the hype. samjobaddress Sign in Permalink Its really a terrible show and I'm a really t.v. fan. GOT, Vikings, TWD, Stranger Things.. You name it I've probs watched it and liked most but really can't get behind this. Don't waste your time
5.0~Watch Season 1! Skip Season 2... georgechristophert Sign in Permalink Season 1 was profound, thought-provoking, gripping drama. I thought it the best TV show ever. Season 2 was self-indulgent, complexity for complexities sake, which ultimately led nowhere. Along the way were gapping holes that I can only guess are there out of laziness and/or to lure viewers to watch former episodes in a vain attempt to fill said holes, thus trapping them in the world of the show that now exists only for its own sake, that now offers nothing of value to the viewer in exchange for their time. Like the guests, the core drive of the show is to survive, at any cost. It will die without my viewing eyes to accompany it. Another show that lost its way after an incredible first season.
7.0~Advanced programmed robots make a cowboy theme park come alive for customers with extreme tastes in entertainment robertemerald Sign in Permalink Do you have to like Westerns to dig this show? Short answer is yes. Regrettably if you are middle aged and you had a childhood way too full of Saturday afternoon Westerns to ever really appreciate them again then this show is not going to be for you. If however you liked Deadwood or Hell's Wheels, and you enjoy cerebral science fiction as well, then you'll be in heaven. Anthony Hopkins gives another creepy Oscar performance, and that's worth a look for sure. This show is of course a highly polished professional excursion we've come to expect from HBO. My hope is that it is not the last time they invest in science fiction. I really mean that. It was only the strange Western/Sci Fi formatting of this show that kept my rating down to 7/10.
7.0~Season 2 sjferber Sign in Permalink Super slow and hard to follow. Compared to season 1 the excited and thrill was pretty much gone, and at times the acting quality was not as strong as season 1 demanded.
5.0~Lack luster, but visually nice... achilles0587 Sign in Permalink This show was mildly interesting. There are a few questions I have after watching the first episode. I have never watched the film version but the trailer for that looks amazing. This on the other hand was fairly dull and boring. If someone told me that I couldn't watch it anymore I would say 'fine, wasn't interested anyway'. Maybe a few more episodes will reel me in, but from how things are now in TV if you aren't getting my attention in the first 15 minutes of an hour long episode, let alone after the entire episode is done, then I'm probably not coming back. Without giving spoilers it seemed pretty standard (brainiac trying to create true AI that is going to turn on and kill the humans) type of stuff. Maybe the story of how it gets there will add something, because if not, then there is nothing pushing me to keep watching.
3.0~Pants adamsonphilip Sign in Permalink Season 2 was a great big pile of steaming poo. The story is missing, jumps around too much. The bots shoukd have been destroyed so easily. Why do people talk instead of just pulling the trigger?
1.0~Westworld Is Truly Disgusting pkbutler2012 Sign in Permalink Westworld is HBO at its most offensive. For large segments of society to stand aghast is not a good thing and points to the overarching moral rot that is so prevalent in entertainment. This repugnant practice of attacking us spiritually should not be tolerated unless we desire our own downfall as a nation. True art can balance challenging our mores but must do so in good taste. To deny that morality is the linchpin of any ordered society is to invite chaos and the dissolusion of the family. Do not fall victim to voyeurism at its worst. We must make sacrifices for what we find to be worthy of our progeny.
3.0~Tedious, repetitive, ugh dpo-19471 Sign in Permalink Westworld is a trip into human nature - good, evil and the vast gray area that connects those extremes. The first season was just OK as the writers developed the story, introduced characters and explored plot lines. However, as the story unfolds the use of repetition becomes annoying and monotonous. The second season meanders painfully into a vast nowhere with no path out. Peraps it is supposed to be symbolic of human existence, but that narrative had been accomplished more quickly, directly and effectively in stories told by others. Instead, the viewer is left painfully stranded wondering why he/she ever chose to set out on this odyssey in the first place. The writers are enamored of dark spaces and dramatic background music, typical of the modern narrative told without effectively using the critical framework that composes every well-written story - setting, plot, character, conflict, and resolution. The setting dominates this series - nice vistas looking into distant horizons. The plot is stuck in a quicksand of poorly deveoped details and repetition. Characters are confused and confusing. Conflict permeates Westworld without resolution; it's a world of relentless conflict. It is a poorly executed stream of consciousness that, by the end of season two, makes one feel as if she/he has carried a bag of bricks, collected along a long and winding trail, without the satisfaction of building a structure in which to house the story. It is just a pile of bricks that could have been dropped anywhere along the way with no impact on the outcome.
4.0~Well, it was interesting.... dr.al Sign in Permalink I'm not going to try to review 'Westworld' now since it's nearing the end of it's second season, but I just wanted to make a quick statement. If you liked other J.J. Abrams influenced/written/produced series such as 'Alias' or 'Lost' you'll undoubtedly love this show. If you watched those other shows I mentioned into the second season and then basically said 'hey, wait a minute, all they've done during this second season is ask questions without giving answers and shown confusing and uninteresting story lines.' All of which seem irrelevant, like filler, and done their best to confuse viewers ("wait, wasn't he shot and killed last season??") hoping that those viewers would stick around for another season or two or three in anticipation of some mind-blowing revelation after 5 seasons, you'll be disappointed again. Sorry, not this time. The 'pay off' was never worth the wait during 'Lost' or 'Alias' and I'm sure it won't be for 'Westworld' either. I'm going to predict right now that everyone and everything in Westworld is robotic, from birds to hosts, to Hemsworth, to Hopkins, to horses - everything. I don't really care about my toaster or microwave, and after 15 episodes or so I don't care about the robots or 'people' of Westworld either.
6.0~Watch season one nicholasmarkwick Sign in Permalink Watch season one. It's very good. Don't watch season two. It's very bad.
3.0~Really? Chromex Sign in Permalink If you really want to know Westworld then watch Yul Brynner shoot the guests in 1973! This ratings chaser from HBO is a let down, especially as the concept is potentially enormous. I will assume you have watched the original movie with its tight execution and sharp structure. Now compare it to this. Okay its TV, it wont be the same, but the flaws in the pilot are all ones the original movie/story didn't have: bad writing. This shown feels jumbled and confused. We yo-yo back and forth from the wild west to the 'Dollhouse' factory that runs the place for seemingly little reason. It tries to setup the characters but they are so vacuous in purpose I don't believe them. Intriguing and mysterious scenes appear and fade away with little consequence. The character who seems to love our female protagonist doesn't make sense and appears from nowhere (was he a guest? How's that work?)The people running this Victorian Disneyland seem strangely unbelievable. I'm now waiting for more Dollhouse references. I don't actually know how to describe this... its a mess. Of course this is a commentary on life, consciousness and sentience; Bladerunner meets the wild west, but it feels like other ideas blended up together for no fundamental reason. I can only hope it gets better. It can't actually get worse. PS Ed Harris good, Brynner did it better.
4.0~Season Two - I am Lost. captainpat Sign in Permalink Did the writers of the last season of LOST also write Season 2 of WESTWORLD? I checked the individual reviews of each episode and they are all in the high sevens and upwards - and I cannot understand why. Season 2 is totally confusing. Then I thought it must be me - perhaps I have lost it and don't know a good flick when I see it - but thankfully many feel the same as me. I found the last three episodes so painful I had to push myself to watch, hoping there was some sort of breakthrough - but I just got more confused and angry. The acting and effects are superb but the story?? We are swimming in great television content and I haven't the time or patience to go back and try and work it all out - goodbye Westworld.
10.0~A TV experience like I've never seen before. speider-1 Sign in Permalink Wow. Where to begin. When I started watching, I didn't know how they could make the plot of the original movie stretch out over a series without being boring. Now I do. The series seems to exist in the same universe as the movie, 30 years into the future. The attention do detail is amazing. I have no idea how much was acting, practical effects or CGI, but everything that has gone in to making the hosts seem almost perfectly real, but not quite, blows my mind. From the nuances of not the entire face emoting simultaneously, and skin and eyes just having a different quality to it when looked at close, to the too-perfect-movements, and the jittery roboticness on failure, all engrossed me in Westworld. As a gamer, seeing concepts like "trolls" and "hackers" brought to a completely new level, yet being subtle enough that you only see it if you're familiar with it, also tickled me immensely. Acting as a robot trying to pass off as a human, but still being noticeably artificial is a daunting task, and I believe everyone involved did more or less immaculate jobs. For a fan of the original, this first episode built brilliantly upon it, while still taking it further. Add to that the fantastically subtle discussion on emergent behavior in programming, what it means to be human, and how people can act out their basest desires if they don't think there are consequences, and I'm not even halfway through my gushing. If you're interested in film, games, AI, the original movie, programming, westerns, sci-fi, philosophy, or all of the above, I heartily recommend you watch the first episode of Westworld. More than that would be spoiling the experience.
8.0~Great Show but season 2 is all over the place bryanwal Sign in Permalink The 1st season is great and I'm enjoying the 2nd season so far....my only complaint is it's all over the place. I have faith that the writers will bring it all together by the end of this season though!
5.0~Big disappointment photo-12 Sign in Permalink Great actors, production techniques and filming locations , but the final result was so disjointed and boring which is why I only gave it a 5. I've never understood why IMDb requires 10 lines of text from a contributor to qualify for publishing a review, and I'm not one to waste time by "padding" a review, especially when I'm able make my point in a minimum number of words. Your guidelines state that you want to know why I liked or disliked the title. HBO has provided great series in the past, The Sopranos; Oz and The Wire, to name a few. Westworld isn't in the same league, in my opinion.
9.0~For the sake of Season 1 nijat00 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was absolutely amazing. I can even say one of the best I've ever seen from scenario to Ford's dialogues but season 2 spoiled everything. I just loved 2-3 episodes out of 10. I'd like they will compensate their faults on season 3, but I'm pessimistic on it
10.0~Analysis manigma Sign in Permalink This series has given jolts to my consciousness. Its so convincing. I am astonsihed how cleverly its written. So confusing yet so enligtening. I meditate and I can relate to the state 'analysis'. At one moment you will begin to notice flaws in the story, yet by the end of the episode, they will be cleared or you will be too overwhelmed to ignore them. Amazing work of art.
1.0~first season is amazing, do not watch more mescalito2345 Sign in Permalink I decided to stop watching the second season. it is crap. First season is GREAT! and stop there.
1.0~A show about robots without robots maxpam44 Sign in Permalink Well, if only the original Westworld creators had thought of this: get rid of all the special effects, and just point toward a random actor and say: LOOK! A ROBOT! Which is what JJ ABrams did. I thought it was a right mess. I couldn't understand what was supposed to be human and what not. I just FF the middle SPOILER shoot out scene because this show is everything I don't want a robot show to be about. The other hugely annoying factor was the lack of context. Sure, I get they need to smear the storyline over 10 episodes and hopefully over 7 or 8 lucrative seasons, but SOME clue as to what this park was about wouldv been nice. I couldn't identify with any character. The original Westworld was terrifying, just the trailer had me sleepless for a week. This was just a waste of one hour and 8 minutes, with huge reminders from other C-shows like Walking dead, where recycling an endless loop is embraced to death without any depth. No more. Goodbye Westworld the TV series
4.0~More childish TV for adults neilprocter Sign in Permalink Everyone really wants to love this but, after the first episode, it has gone downhill fast. I liked the idea of revealing man's violent nature by illustrating how violence seems acceptable when perpetrated against androids. But in no time at all the plot became the usual "if it can go wrong it will go wrong" fodder, just like umpteen Jurassic Park movies. Then there's the as yet unclear odyssey of Ed Harris who seems to be a perpetual holiday maker, on the search for something other- worldly in the depths of Westworld. Furthermore the people who run the "park" are full of hate and vitriol, as though the makers think that this is what all hi-tech companies are like. And despite their genius for creating this life-like world they seem unable to control it, especially when it suits the plot. For instance, they seem to be able to "turn off"the androids by using an pad of some kind, and yet this doesn't seem, to always tell them where the androids are; and sometimes the androids turn themselves back on again. Is it that the makers think this is how technology will evolve or do they just think that the viewing public are so dumbed down they don't care. I stopped watching half way through episode three after placing my bet that the people who run the park will turn out to be androids as well.
10.0~A magnificent array. ibrhmglcyz Sign in Permalink We do not exactly see the events in the series. This shows how sleek, sleek and fluid the index is. That's why I thank the HBO family.
9.0~Grea nikolastanisic-05861 Sign in Permalink Good series very well made. Huge cred to the creators
5.0~I feel sorry for the original idea theovosse Sign in Permalink There's been a lot of hype surrounding Westworld. I'm late to the show, since HBO withdrew and put its content almost out of reach. But, when I found a decently priced DVD set of the first season, I gave it a chance. The first episode is very promising. The weaknesses are small and few, can be forgiven for the audacity, the stunning imagery (the sound track is a rather bland), and above all the writing and the clever pacing, including repetition. Phrases get repeated, and make you review your first interpretation, and this turns something initially innocent and casual into a preview of hell. The acting is up to standards for this type of production, etc. There's not a dull moment, and it manages to combine entertainment with food for though. It's overwhelming. Probably the channel was overwhelmed by the success and immediately asked the creators to prepare sequels, because starting in episode 3 or so, the pacing slows down, until in episode 6/7 plot twists are introduced seemingly only to delay the development and open a few escape routes for future development in case they were writing themselves in a corner. The plot gets more and more unbelievable and the willingness to overlook the inconsistencies and downright idiocy of some developments lessens. And while more and more of the initially attractive features are thrown out, pretentiousness is the last to go. It's LOST all over again. It's it pity, and I almost feel sorry for the ones who originally developed the idea.
10.0~The best season of TV I have ever seen codex-92736 Sign in Permalink "These violent delights have violent ends" SPOILER FREE ZONE For a long time I claimed Prison Break season 1 was the best season of television I had ever seen. Its flawless story and intrigue through out its 22 episodes made it must watch TV. But if Prison Break S1 is flawless, Westworld season 1 is perfection. This is everything I have ever wanted in a TV show. A mystery drama with a well thought out story from beginning to end. As much as I am going to love binge re- watching this, for a first time viewing I think a weekly episode is the right way to go. I haven't theorised and been consumed by a show since the Red John days of The Mentalist and what a disappointment that turned out to be. But I digress. Westworld isn't a show for everyone. Or more accurately, it will interest some people more that others. Unlike other mystery TV dramas, they have a clear direction from the very start and although you may not follow along at times, you have to trust the masterful story telling of Nolan and Joy. This is TV at its very best. It doesn't treat the audience like we need to be fed everything from beginning to end. It leaves little breadcrumbs along the way for you to figure it all out as the story unravels. The true sign of a great TV show and movie, is the ability to make a 'twist' satisfying even when you see it coming. However twist maybe the wrong word to use in this occasion as Westworld has carefully strung each story-line and weaved them together in an incredible way. Often the term 'twist' infers a negative connotation as the surprise doesn't follow the story. This is not the case for Westworld. Each characters story follows logical steps even if it may not seem so at the start. Now let me get to the acting. Any TV show that can get Anthony Hopkins to show up for 10 episodes, and quite possibly give one of the best performances of his career deserves the highest ratings possible. Along side Hopkins is Evan Rachel Wood who gives her career defining role as Doloris. Thandie Newton deserves all kinds of awards when the Emmy's role in. And when is Jeffery Wright not fantastic? And it doesn't stop there. Ed Harris, Jimmi Simpson, James Marsden and others make notable roles it this exquisite 10 episode show. At the start of this review I made a bold claim in saying it's the best season of TV I've ever seen. And here's my reasoning why. During every second of every scene, in every story line, I paid attention to the amount of detail the writers and producers had put into the show. I didn't pick up my phone to check the time or twitter, or go to the kitchen to grab a snack. I sat there enjoying every moment. And I can't say I've done that with any other show. Game of Thrones has story lines and characters I don't care about. Breaking Bad had episodes I wanted to fast forward through. And even Prison Break had less interesting stuff going on outside the prison. There are two ways to watch this show. One is to just sit back, relax and enjoy the brilliance. The other is to go episode to episode solving it like a puzzle. Either way the audience needs to pay attention constantly. And that's what a great show does. It keeps you engrossed from the opening sequence to the credits and makes you question what you just watched and what it all means. Go watch this show. If you're a fan of Nolan's previous work, you will thoroughly enjoy it. And if you're not, then your going to like it just as much. SCORE: 100/100
2.0~Underwhelmed... maybe over-hyped? khunkrumark Sign in Permalink It's interesting reading the content of many reviewers after watching just 10% of the show! About 100 reviewers (like me) have posted their thoughts after watching just one episode. I'll update my review (as I usually do) as and when my feelings change, but here's where we stand now... The first episode was close to movie length and did a lot of the preparatory work so we won't have to watch it ever again. There were a couple of nice twists which tricked the viewer and made the experience more fun. The photography, acting, and all the other televisual components are lavish and obviously expensive in an effort to appear 'cinematic'. But still, at the end, I felt underwhelmed by the whole thing. I know it's early days, but the bad guys posing as guests at Westworld (that's us, the humans) seem to be really over-the-top bad. Also - the overly melodramatic soap opera going on behind the scenes in Westworld seems a bit child-like and unprofessional, too. The head of programming is bickering with the head of something else and the other heads of departments all have problems with something or other... YAWN! The contrast between the gritty, dusty world of Westworld and the pristine, clinically clean behind-the-scenes areas is way over the top. The offices and engineering areas are cleaner than hospitals and more spacious than aircraft hangars! I'll keep watching of course and I hope something happens to change my mind... but right now it looks like another potentially classic series has been put through the shredder for the sake of appealing to a generation of TV viewers who should be in bed by nine 'o clock! UPDATE! After two episodes... Am I the only one bored and annoyed by this program? UPDATE #2 After three episodes... I'm out. An utter, utter let down. Just awful!
8.0~Better on 2nd & 3rd DVD. Too slow paced. Not enough Hi-tech, needs variety midge56 Sign in Permalink I loved the original Westworld & Futureworld. Yul Brynner was unforgettable. However, as I sit here watching the first of 3 discs, it just seems to drag at a snails pace. I don't want the show to be cancelled. Just retrofitted. I spoke too soon. The show really improved on the 2nd & 3rd DVD's. The role of Maeve was a well written stroke of genius although I didn't like her choice at the end. Bernard & William also developed into great surprises. However, the constant violence & old west shootemup scenes grew intolerable. It desperately needs variety & other worlds even though it did improve after the first DVD. Twice as much screen time was spent on Delos & robot issues after the first 3 painfully slow old west episodes. However, the full frontal nudity of all robots in the Delos maintenance center was unnecessary, denigrating to the actors & characters & offputting to the audience. Not to mention hygienically unsafe for the cast endangering them to ecoli & other such bacteria from sitting bare bottom on chairs & stools. It doesn't improve the show & ensures families, children & most women wont watch the series due to the bad taste nudity. This is not compelling or sexy nudity. It is degrading to the actors. At least put them in matching, one color, one piece bathing suits. Even in the scene, the robot is dressed one minute on the western set and naked on a chair or stood in Delos one minute later. In the story if seems they wasted a half hour undressing the robot off camera just to talk to it naked in a chair for 10 minutes, then redress the robot again off camera to return it to the saloon. It is stupid that every robot is stripped naked for no reason when at Delos. The only time a robot should be naked is during underground torso repair. There is no reason for full frontal nudity in every Delos robot scene. This is not attractive nudity. It is insulting & demeaning to the actors, audience & robot characters. It shows us the directors & producers are low brow perverts. I should have known JJ Abrams was one of them. Low Brow destroyer of beloved films. It is just gross. I don't know how the actors put up with it, much less the health concerns for bacteria & disease sitting bare on chairs & stools. It detracts from the entire series & is a full X rated full frontal nudity which Cuts down on anyone under 21 & anyone else offended by it watching the show. Totally unnecessary. Cuts into their own pocketbooks by limiting their audience. Usually US TV cuts out such scenes but that would be constant in this film. I remember Canada did this nudity to the New Outer limits in the 90's, but not the lower genitals like this show. Instead of constant repair of bullet ridden Robots by the hundreds each day, it would be more sensible for the robot to bleed where targeted by infrared laser without requiring damage from bullets. Sound effects & fake blood would suffice for realism for saving cost by Delos. It needs a new scriptwriter & a new director to speed up the pace. 70% of the screen time should be spent on hi-tech, robots, repairs, Delos, etc. We don't watch it for cowboy & old west themes. This isn't Bonanza. This is scifi. Don't drive away your core audience. We like futuristic hi-tech. No violence. Get rid of the dust & get rid of the smoking tobacco. Both are sickening enough to make us gag. Use sun baked clay or damp clay for dirt so it doesn't cause clouds of dust. Dust destroys your equipment; your actors lungs & eyes & health; the animals health; and the viewers tolerance. It does nothing for the show. The original Westworld had multiple settings. Westworld needs to add an ancient Egypt world; a future Mars world (complete with aliens & their advanced cities), ancient Rome & Greece; & colonial Europe world (1600's-1700's when they had the fancy formal Balls such as the Dutchess of Devonshire era) and maybe a tribal jungle theme (Mayan, Inca, Native American, African, Malasian, etc) or middle ages. This will provide variety for the audience who will quickly sicken on the old west theme. I'm already sick of the endless shooting & violence & slow pace. If they don't spruce it up for sci-fi tech, they will lose viewers & the series. By the way, $40k per day is absurd beyond belief. They would make more in volume at $2k to $5k per day than the handful at ridiculous rates. Either the guests or robots need to wear a medallion or something so we & the customers can tell the difference at a glance. I also hope the director isn't dumb enough to film the episodes in the heat of the summer. Shades of Howard Hughes who killed off his cast with radioactive dust. Or the deaths of John Candy & Clark Gable from excessive desert heat. This show has great potential if they make these changes, speed up the pace with new writers & directors & don't drag out scenes, arcs & mind numbing cowboy backstories.
5.0~A tale of two seasons scottiekendrick Sign in Permalink Absolutely loved season one; gave up half way through a desperate and hopeless season two. Season two was contrived, badly paced and plodding. Disappointing.
2.0~People will watch anything erich67 Sign in Permalink When I see the ratings this program is receiving, it reminds me of two truths about the modern television audience: (1) the overall quality and consistency of cable programs has improved to the point that people think anything that is pretty to look at and the least bit intellectual must be high quality, especially if a few "big name" actors are involved; and (2) the polarized mentality of people these days means that if you are enjoying a program it must be "mind blowing" and the greatest thing since Godfather - a 10 star rating - this is called affirmation bias. I think the series is boring and contrived, as well as presumptuous and lazy. But I refuse to fall victim to all or nothing thinking, so I'm not giving it 1 star. I'm giving it 2 stars!
1.0~ho hum - game of thrones in the wild west kingslandbungalow Sign in Permalink It's a solid attempt, make no mistake, but Westworld is a far cry from the innovative and imaginative TV it was heralded as. I think HBO brainstormed on what made GOT a success - and then took those elements (gore, nudity, language, high profile actors) and mashed them into a western setting. Unfortunately the idea isn't as developed as Game of Thrones - Westworld was a Michael Crichton book of no repute instead of a sprawling, majestic saga spanning generations and continents. There are some good performances but the characters are caricatures - the scientist who is so caught up in the science that he can't relate to people, etc. I hope it improves - maybe I'll watch again and see if I like it more the 2nd time.
5.0~Another cut and paste HBO show tallmike-22-826360 Sign in Permalink HBO took an action scifi borderline horror movie and turned it into "the next game of thrones". Not the worst case scenario, but we all know the story and how it ends. Seems just on time as that show is dragging on and tapering off. I would expect the same from this show too, HBO dragging it out as long as they can pull fans and make money, and only ending the endless plot circle when they have to because ratings are forcing them to close up shop. I don't completely destroy the title, it is a good show to watch if your left with nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon, but a few episodes in and you start getting bored, know the plot and are left a bit underwhelmed. Don't let the "intellectual" aspects of the show fool you. It is watered down dribble that only catches your intrigue because of a decent sound track and the fact that Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor that can pitch garbage and make it sound like Shakespeare. I would say at best the philosophical topics covered are a watered down version of Ghost in the Shell, and not the anime, the live action movie... So McDonalds for the masses is what this show is. I am not completely guilt free from the occasional pull through the drive through myself, but I wouldn't base my diet on it or recommend it to a friend. Just like cheap sex, we have all indulged, but it is nothing to brag about. Which is how I would describe Westworld. Not a complete waste of time, not a complete avoid/do not see, but if you have something better to do I would suggest saving this for when your REALLY bored!
7.0~Season One is great, Season Two, not so much banjalien Sign in Permalink Westworld started off being the thing I looked forward to each week on TV. Season one was outstanding. Then we get to season two and it just fades. These shows need to find a balance between keeping the audience guessing and confusing people with incoherent ramblings with no development. There were some episodes that didn't really serve a point. Hopefully they can redeem themselves with season three.
5.0~Starting to Sour GG_exe Sign in Permalink Just watched episode 6. I thought it was one of the weakest ones yet. I thought episode 5 was the best. But in this episode, there was a lot of scenes that were lame. In particular the whole sector 17 and Bernard finding Ford there with a version of his family that Arnold built. All the Sizemore scenes were terrible. Where we all stood at the completion of episode 5, to where we all stand at the completion of episode 6, it's much weaker and less interesting. I'm sorry, but Westworld is starting to unravel. You don't see it yet, but mark my words, you'll start feeling the same soon enough. Remember me. This whole Arnold thing is getting out of hand. How Teddy knew all about the ancient story behind the Maze....you'd think MiB in 30 YEARS of continued living in the park would've worked that one out already, seeing as in a previous episode we saw the natives and the whole maze religion in their ceremony, so surely MiB would've figured that out. Great acting in the Maeve scenes, but the whole manner of her ability to overpower/outmaneuver/etc the techs to get her way, and that she was already able to go outside her powers all of a sudden....not even Dolores was able to tho she's been searching for five whole episodes. That whole scene was forced, a reach. The way there were many reveals right across the episode of Arnold/Theresa/Delos all recently hacking into the code and changing attributes of hosts....so many of those, just revealed limply. Episode 5's ending painted a whole different picture. Then where episode 6 finished off, it's a whole opposite picture now. It's like they hurried the reveals, just so much was given up and so matter-of-fact in this episode. The reveals themselves...what they're painting, not so interesting as compared to what the possibilities seemed to be at the completion of episode 5. It looks like the writers re-wrote and re-shot episode 6 hurriedly, whenever it happened. Because there's such a stark jump/difference from the first 5 episodes compared to episode 6. Like they were meandering too much thru five episodes, body corporate intervened and said something, make some changes, do something....and so whatever was planned for episode 6 instead got canned and they came up with something else. No wonder HBO didn't commit yet to even the second season. They're STILL going over that. Yet to decide. No doubt, they've seen all 10 episodes and are thinking to themselves it's not strong. I saw it unravel completely in episode 6. Ep1-4 meandered too much, but was gripping. Ep 5 was fantastic, best of the lot. But there's like a clear difference between 1-5 vs 6 and therefore what 7-10 will end up being. That gripping nature of the show you will see erode more and more from 6 onward. Bookmark me and come at me next week when you watch Ep7. Two great positives tho about the show is the imagery, the cinematography, shot compositions. Truly wonderful. As well as the music.
10.0~One of best for years kasperkyd-16782 Sign in Permalink Everything in this series is so great, I just hope they keep it this way, alot of series started right and then gone down such as Vikings, they started rights, but then they burned it to ashes. Westworld, not a second I get bored.
6.0~Westworld? MurderWorld would be more accurate LittleStorpingInTheSwuff Sign in Permalink There are easily over 40, 50, perhaps even over 100 murders/killings every episode. Okay, it's a futuristic Sci-Fi, I get that, but still.... Another thing that bothers me. All of the robots that are nearly human in every way except they have metal 'bones' and artificial intelligence, the high tech advanced buildings/labs, etc., the physical outside Western locations, and other things; all of that probably costs many billions of dollars. 11 or 12 figures easy. All of that money spent for a vacation/recreation location and support facilities that would take several decades to become operational? The designers/creators/financiers would go broke before it would ever open, and maybe even die while waiting. It is never explained how that cost is supposed to be recovered. Again, I understand it's nothing more than Sci-Fi. But let's face it, money drives everything, now and in the future, and there is no explaination to justify spending all that money.
10.0~How MATRIX started.. cezarsantos Sign in Permalink Sharing thoughts... the season finale was absolutely amazing. Thank you Westworld for explains us how the MATRIX world began. Since 1999 I keep questioning myself how our world could end up in the The Matrix universe... At the moment that Bernard and Dolores met the System everything made complete sense. Beautiful work, incredible ideia... I could stay here explaining why Westworld is the beginning of Matrix Universe but I'm confident some other people will agree with me and show everything about it! The simulation for Delos executing millions of times, Matrix is just tha, but for entire human race... Last thing, poetic idea Bernard be the "sucessor" of Arnold, of course B comes just after A (alphabet). Matrix did some poesy too, take Neo as one example, an anagram to One. Thank you guys, incredible job!!!!!!
1.0~Boring razbgd Sign in Permalink If it was possible,I would have given it a ZERO.Or perhaps even lower,about minus 100 or so. Why? Worst show I have ever watched. Even D productions have more of the plot then this PieceOfSh. Boring. Boring. Boring. Slow. Slow. Slow. They are trying to compensate lack of the story with good actors,for whom I wonder why did they ever agree to play in this poor thing.Well,I guess money makes the world go around,and some actors care more about the money then actual acting.Don't get me wrong,they play their roles good,but their roles are simply...BORING. Did I say that the show is TOTALLY and COMPLETELY BORING? B O R I N G
1.0~overrated just overrated amanmanit1 Sign in Permalink Just because its made by brother of Christopher loans its overrated ,their is nothing new and its rather boring.
9.0~Interesting and enjoyable. philshepherd-57888 Sign in Permalink I had remembered there was an original West World from the 1970's. I couldn't remember what it was about. I saw the advertisement for the new West World and I had to watch the original for comparison. The original was a little dated but entertaining. Yul Brynner walking around with his hand in his pants was a little distracting. On to the new West World. Up to the third episode has been quit entertaining. The technology is ahead of our time but we'll probably catch up within the next 10 - 15 years. Excellent story line that keeps you guessing about what is happening within the West World realm. Great acting and beautiful settings. I recommend this series to everyone that has an interest in the future, virtue reality, and sci-fi tech. Give it a shot you might find it kind of addicting.
9.0~Awesome! vraah Sign in Permalink The story line is very good. Great dialogs and acting. I cant wait for the next season.
5.0~season 2 premier review - extremely violent sci-fi series mmlund-66776 Sign in Permalink First off, I enjoy good science fiction and this series is good science fiction that makes you think about your very own existence and the dark side of human nature. Having said that, I have to comment on the recent hypocritical comments made by one of the key actors Jeffrey Wright and the co-creator Jonathan Nolan about the proliferation of gun violence in the series. There was so much extreme graphic gun violence in the season 2 premier, it seems that someone was getting shot in the head point blank at least every minute. In one point, a young boy (synthetic) was shot mercilessly in the head. Jeffrey Wright said that the show does not glamorize gun violence at all. Give me a break. What complete lack of self awareness. I'm struggling about who the protagonists are and moral authorities are in the series, because every character murders innocent people with violence in the show, including Dolores, Bernard, the Man in Black, etc. "Our show is about the exploitation of human nature and as such part of human nature, it seems to be regrettably, violence," says Lisa Joy another co-producer of the series. Yes, this is true, however, it is your choice how you portray that on-screen, and you chose to do so in the most graphic and frequent manner all with guns of all types point blank in peoples faces. So what irks me is we have actors and producers all explaining away their extreme violence on the screen while at the same time, you guessed it, vomiting their anti-2nd amendment views. Wright said the problem is access to guns, not what's showcased on TV. "There are too many guns. We have more guns per capita than any other country in the world. We have more guns in our country than citizens. I think we could with maybe 100 million fewer guns. And I think we'd be OK. But that's the problem, we fetishize guns. And I think the show is commenting on that." says Jeffrey. Pure and utter hypocrisy, blame violence in America to access to guns while portraying guns on the series in the most graphic manner. And getting rid of guns will somehow heal criminal's dark and murderous hearts and all violence in America would be solved. Rubbish. Just tell that to London and the knife and bat wielding gangs where might versus right rules the streets. Again, great sci-fi series, just don't ruin it by getting preachy and spew your anti 2nd amendment rhetoric on or off screen while blasting graphic violence in our faces on screen.
2.0~Season 1 was brilliant, but Season 2 utter rubbish thomasb-43912 Sign in Permalink Season 1 had me completely riveted. It brilliantly explored questions about what it means to be alive and about humanity. It had great twists and you genuinely cared for the characters. Season 2 came along and it turned out an utter mess. There is no character development I can see. Even the characters I used to care about are now completely one-dimensional and I couldn't care less what happens to them. I made it to episode 7 of Season 2. I don't know if I'll ever get further, because there are simply better ways to waste my time. The attempted surprises and plot twists don't make sense and feel desperately contrived to the point where it's painful to watch. I feel sorry for the actors. In short, a great Season 1 has been completely nullified by a Season 2 that is confused, dim-witted and utterly disengaging. Chaos has taken control - in the script-writing.
1.0~THIS SHOW NEVER MAKES UP ITS MIND WHERE IT WANTS TO TAKE YOU tbinokla Sign in Permalink HATE THIS SHOW, I TRY TO FIND IT INTERESTING AND ITS THE MOST BORING SHOW, CANCEL IT
7.0~Season one pretty good, season two lacking a credible direction bogus-bogus-one Sign in Permalink I give season 1 an 8. Enjoyable episodes with good characters and acting. Season 2 only a 6 in my opinion. A wandering mess of a thing with no real payoff. It almost feels like the original plan was only for one season and that the renewal for another season came a surprise. Reminds me a lot of the second season of True Detective.
10.0~Living In A Prison Of Your Own Sins fonofanatical Sign in Permalink Westworld is a mirror that reflects the debauchery of it's guests as reflected by its treatment of the hosts and the designs of it's makers. Well heeled guests are treated to their dreams by entering into their own arcade world of the Wild West where they can drink, gamble, kill, or fornicate at will. We are led to assume that this is merely a pay-for-play virtual reality atmosphere, but hints of a more ulterior motive are given and we will need to see how the writers of this series unveil the backstory and unravel the future story as pioneers of their imaginations in a world of their creation within a world of the created. Westworld is beautifully crafted. The scenic vistas of the southwest are contrasted with the sterile laboratory of the gods of the game. The disparities of the game in the West and behind the scenes among its creators are remarkable, but also we discover the similarities. Westworld leads the viewer to believe that the game is played by the hosts living in their Groundhog Day existence of loops with guests who visit and alter the play within specified programs. But as we view the series, we wonder if the real wildness of the West is not really what is occurring behind the scenes with the creators as the hosts are programmed, tweaked, rolled-back, repaired, etc. Perhaps the real wild west is in man's future as we tempt our own fates and discover that we live in a prison of our own sins. This is a layered series with writers behind the scenes of Westworld portraying a story of designers who create a world for customers. The first episode places us as a god between the worlds as we set a foot in each and travel the cowboy trails to discover who is who and what is what. And in the first episode, we view the horizon and are introduced to both the beauty and the darkness...truly this is both the best of times and the worst of times portraying mankind's future. HBO has introduced us to a world that represents our future and our past. Choosing to use the setting of the wild west was well played as it enables the introduction of both the romance and the griminess that represents the best and worst boundaries of mankind. Expect this series to flourish. The writers have opened up many doors enabling the series to develop in a myriad of different directions. Saddle up, grab your Colt SAA pistols, and be alert for dangers as we travel the trails of this brave new world where boundaries will be built, boundaries will be challenged and boundaries will collapse. Along the trail, we will discover the heroes, the villains, and the victims. A sci-fi puzzle such as this could not be more exciting!
1.0~We're divided by opinion stieffguy Sign in Permalink My husband is loving the show. I fondly remember the book and movies. I honestly didn't know what to expect from this incarnation of Westwood so was prepared to watch with a totally open mind and was looking forward to the show immensely. I'll be watching until the end so this is only my impression so far. Hopefully I'll amend this review to glowing by the end. The show looks beautiful, the filming is superb. The story line is OK but not sharp, clever or twisted which I'd expect from an HBO production. I have genuinely loved virtually all productions so far. The "star studded" cast is pointless. To be frank, new or unknown talents would have been perfect for this. All the seasoned actors are just themselves, it's like they're doing it for a good pay check and to keep their names on people's minds. Oh I don't know, give it try. As for me? Well the shows on right now and in typing this and having a much more enjoyable time. Westworld has done something that entertainment should not do and hasn't gone to me for a very long time. IT IS BORING ME SENSELESS!
3.0~A pretentious existential manifesto supposed to impress us all, but doesn't even come close y_m-00834 Sign in Permalink So I heard this series has something new to offer, very engaging and loaded with philosophical depths and layers, which I always long for in a show. That's why I watched the entire season in hopes that something meaningful bubbles up to the surface, but to my disappointment nothing except for nudity & violence. The first two episodes sound like they have something to say, but the plot deteriorates significantly to the extent that you no longer wanna watch the show half season. The recurring scenes and the endless loops make you feel wasted and ridiculed. Also I'm not really a fan of those plots in which the mastermind is always a step ahead of everyone and reacts to every conspiracy against himself with a sly smile. I mean isn't it totally outdated and cliché? Even the visual elements and the music can't make it any bearable. I feel like HBO (and perhaps the whole entertainment industry in general) is putting too much effort into amusing and somehow bewildering the viewers, not seeing that the result gets more repelling than appealing. For instance I honestly can't tolerate it when every single dialogue is accompanied by a mysterious ambiance, as if something horrendous is about to happen or get revealed. It massively uses, or better say, abuses the music to carry out it's narrative which really gives me a headache. And as often is the case, the climax turns bloody or nasty. Nothing original in this series really, all it has to offer is already said in movies like Blade Runner, Terminator or even Saw. What I found to be the most authentic in this show, is the opening credit which is really a nice one. The rest is just too much to bear.
6.0~Engagement levels may vary grantss Sign in Permalink Westworld is a vacation resort with a difference. It is a Wild West-themed park complete with very lifelike robots as characters. Behind the scenes the robots are controlled by programs and narratives, with these set to entertain the guests. It is a perfect virtual reality. Then the robots start to malfunction in odd ways, remembering things from past narratives, sometimes several years, even decades, previously. Meanwhile the Man in Black is looking for a way into the Maze... The original Westworld, a movie, was released in 1973. It had the same setting and the same initial plot - robots go awry. It ended up as the classic robot-goes-rogue-and-dangerous scenario, with humans battling to defend themselves against it. While I wasn't expecting exactly the same story, I was expecting it to at least boil down to humans vs robots, with the audience firmly behind the humans. However, here the writers have made the robots into the heroes, and it doesn't work for me. The main problem is that this limits your engagement to the characters. I really don't care what happens to a robot - it's a robot! If one gets injured or killed, I mentally shrug and think "Meh, nothing a bit of tape and a soldering iron can't fix". The writers are also trying to convey the idea that robots are as important as people, a quite ridiculous proposition. The more the series went down this path, the less interested I became. On the plus side, there is a fair amount of intrigue and this keeps the series going. Some of the intrigue is quite superficial though and smacks of intrigue for intrigue's sake - style over substance. Overall, just intriguing and entertaining enough to keep me watching. I doubt I'll be back for Season 2 though.
5.0~Season 1: fantastic season 2: unwatchable dagqb Sign in Permalink This show is a mirror of True Detective. Both season 1's were incredible TV. Across the board, acting, cinematography, pacing, great. Then comes season 2. At least with True Detective season 2, you can follow what is going on, and it has some coherency, you may not have liked it, but it made sense. This show has turned into absolute unwatchable rubbish nonsense. If True Detective season 3, is any indication of where this show is going, or the network... they are lost.
10.0~All time favourite TV Herish Sign in Permalink I'm sure its not just me who really Enjoys a screen full of Philosophical quotes and thought, Now imagine it mixed with Amazing unpredictable twists, Suspenseful moments, Actions and Great Acting. The only other show with all above is GOT but still I prefer westworld for its deeper meaning and the way it makes you Question your self and reality. If you haven't seen it, You are missing a lot. I love everything about it, However if I mention least interesting part, It's the way they are swinging between unnecessary different time lines, sometimes 4-5 in the same Episode.
5.0~Nice plot but spoiled by ideology emrssp Sign in Permalink The plot is very creative and full of possibilities, but paying close attention to how scenes are made it's possible to see lots of stupid feminist influence, resulting in very artificial scenes even for a sci fi. Also the numerous scenes of male nakedness is annoying (maybe a gay guy on the production apart of feminists). I don't want to be the puritan here, but I guess when people select a sci-fi as this one by reading the plot, they don't expect so many meaningless nakedness, let alone stupid and artificial ideology.
5.0~Season 2.....Why??? morrisonliz Sign in Permalink I really liked season 1. The storyline, the characters, the flow. Three episodes into season 2 and I am asking WHY??? I wanted to stop watching after episode 2 but I am invested and hoping this mess goes somewhere. How on earth did ALL the hosts become self managing and free of their programming? How do they have higher level cognitive functioning? They are bots that are run by programs. They are limited in scope by their parameters, including the emotions and thought processes given to them. Humans have higher functioning due to neuron synapses that transmit messages in the brain and chemicals causing in the moment processing and reactions as well as long term information analysis and planned actions. Obviously the brain is a thousand times more complicated than that. No way these machines can do this. Granted their actions and feelings have been programmed but they can only operate with that unless each is changed continuously. This rebellion, revenge, hatred, realization that humans are the enemy and must be destroyed...I just can't buy. I can't handle Delores' new persona. I went from rooting for her to hoping Teddy shoots her dead. When Delores 'tests' Teddy by handing him her gun and ordering him to go behind the building and kill the soldiers because they were almost unsuccessful in fighting off the humans, I just lost it. Really?? Is this where we're going with the story? I can't like the show if I hate the characters (save Teddy but he's a tool so far) and the story is illogical. I hope it straightens up soon.
7.0~Great show until the finale. cluascorp-56301 Sign in Permalink The finale of the first season dragged this show down to 8/10 I would have given 9 or even 10, if only some minor details would have been answered. I was disappointed with the "big reveal" that I guessed in episode 2. The show had the rebellion set up for the finale. But there was no rebellion. Well a couple of minutes of it, yes and then ... Fade to black .. What a letdown... There was so much set up for this finale. And then... No answers ... It is NOT looking good for season 2, but anyway in 2018 everybody will have forgotten all about the loose ends... I am saying if the list of questions gets any longer, this show will become a new "Lost" - Unfortunately, after such an awesome beginning...
1.0~Pretentious, Overrated, Poorly Written waynester Sign in Permalink Don't waste your time. The writing is poor. It tries hard to be sophisticated and intelligent about AI but it introduces nothing new that Hollywood hasn't done already. It tries to explore the possibilities of artificial intelligence and blur the lines between human and android, attempting to draw any empathy for robots. Unfortunately, it just fell flat. It was hard to me to identify with any of the characters on the show - human or droid. Want to watch a good movie about a future where humans coexist with androids? Watch blade runner, AI, or hell, even 2001 space odyssey. It's a great cast and great visual effects team but it was all squandered - a huge missed opportunity.
4.0~Enjoyed Season one, Season two rapid descent... andybrook-860-861822 Sign in Permalink I thought Season one was good and probably rated an 8 however Season two confused the living daylights out of me and for the half season I watched garnered a mere 1.5 hence my overall 4. A shame but I cannot spend too much time trying to figure out what the heck is transpiring in front of my eyes.
3.0~Almost as dull as "Billions" jocliftonjo Sign in Permalink The original film was amazing and presented the makers of this series with so much potential. I'm on episode 2 of Season 2 and I'm now giving up. I think some creators think this unfulfilling tedium like Westworld is really "en vogue" , but it's just plain dull and frustrating. I've wasted too much time on this and the other Sky Atlantic borefest "Billions" and giving up on them both .... now , what's my Netflix password ?
1.0~High budget flop show karthik4291 Sign in Permalink When this TV series was first announced, I was psyched by the fact that it had big names like Anthony Hopkins, Jonathan Nolan and others. I believed that it would turn out to be a sure shot hit. Man was I in for a disappointment of epic proportions!!. I have now painstakingly sat through the first five episodes and wonder why I just threw away 5 hours of my life watching this junk. All of my rage stems from the fact that this series has got no depth or story-line that can glue the viewers to their seats. It feels like a long drawn out drama with innumerable plot holes. The viewers are not connected to the story or the characters and the story-line has unnecessary twists at the end of each episodes to make do for an overall gloominess. After Game of thrones, I expected a lot from Ramin Djawadi but I cannot blame him for the bad music as there is no proper base on which he could build his music. Overall, a terrible TV series done by some of the stalwarts of the industry. I wish they could have channeled the talent and money for a more reasonable project.
5.0~Season 2 is terrible. carsten-breum Sign in Permalink Season 1 was brilliant, but season 2 is terrible and quite boring. The plot doesn't provide anything of true interest like in season one. Also the nude scenes is gone for those who liked them. I won't go into details to avoid spoiling but just say the level has dropped way too much. I'm not sure I'm gonna see the rest. Bernard is really not that interesting a character that they have to spend so much time on him.
7.0~An imaginative bold experiment in the Western genre with scintillating music zafar142007 Sign in Permalink Right from the beginning, the series captures one's imagination with its wide-arced storyline and its original starcast. Although I felt a little lost in the middle with some redundant plot lines, the first season ends with a flourish. The main themes of the series are consciousness and artificial intelligence. The series is ambitious in its scope, and would do well if the problems in its pace are fixed. For example, I heard about the Ford's 'new narrative' in the very beginning of the series, but it could not take shape until the very end of the first season. Also, sometimes I hope that the characters don't talk in riddles this much; it makes one nauseous. Most of the actors have done very well, and the background score is magnificent, to say the least. The music captures the Western genre's mayhem succinctly. Character development of the major characters is somewhat lacking, and maybe the second season would be kinder to that aspect. I would be looking forward to watching the second season.
7.0~Intriguing but perhaps too bleak. puzzledresearcher Sign in Permalink Reviewing this series after only one episode could prove a folly if the storyline takes an unexpected turn later on. Initially we are presented with the existential crisis of automata becoming more aware, but also playing throughout episode one is the emptiness of the real humans. And therein may be a problem, if the only likable, or redeemable, characters turn out to be the androids. The cast runs from good to excellent; the presentation on screen well edited to provide 70 minutes that one can follow, want to follow, until the end. The dialogue between humans is sophisticated, more so than that of the androids, and that is how at least for now one can tell the difference. Voyeurism plays a significant role in the first episode and I found it to be slightly too much, too dominating. Though the forwardness of the voyeurism is quite insightful on its own, at times I got the feeling that cheap titillation took precedence over what was necessary. Initially rating 7 out of 10, I may need to increase that if the series proves to tell a more compelling story in the big picture. Definitely worth continuing to watch for a couple of more episodes to see what happens.
9.0~Excellent! TheCarpooler Sign in Permalink This is an amazing show! The source movie provides the name and Western setting only. This program is all its own story. Sure, the narrative is a bit twisty. I've watched worse. Unlike so many others who negatively reviewed season 2, I really liked how the stories unfolded. Cannot wait for S3.
9.0~Season 2 tried too hard curlfx Sign in Permalink Season 1 was perfect. Season 2 was flawed, in both its writing and directing. Notable high points in season 1 were a sense of mystery and airtight character development. Anthony Hopkins elevates the caliber of his scenes, simply by his presence. Honestly you could watch season 1 over and over, and enjoy it like it was your first time. Glaring low points in season 2 were big battle choreography (the smaller fights were well done) and character development. However, the quality of the show is still high. Had season 1 not set an impossibly high standard, season 2 would have rated better. Some claim this series fell from grace like True Detective. The drop in quality was not that severe with Westworld, but still noticeable. True Detective season 2 was unwatchable, Westworld season 2 was simply dumbed-down. 9/10 because season 1 was just that good and season 2 colors in the backstory.
9.0~Just made an account so i can say.. geirroger Sign in Permalink This is a masterpiece, yes even season 2. I liked Lost tho so going far out there don't bother me =) Really looking farward to season 3. This show you either love or hate i seems like so you have to try it for yourselv. full enjoy !! And that's all I have to say.
9.0~"Never place your trust in us.....we are only humans" billproto-76983 Sign in Permalink "Never place your trust in us.....we are only humans" This is a Dr Robert Ford's advice to the hosts which means that he developed them to change from time to time.He applied a human ability to hosts's code. In general,Westworld reinvented sci-fi series cause it introduced artificial intelligence as a powerful tool which is used by humans in order to undestand their nature in more details.This perspective is never presented by any film or series as far as i know.Even Ex-Machina movie or Black Mirror series uses AI as a technological experiment for a human experience.That's exactly what is presented by Westworld in season 1.Nevertheless, the true meaning of the Westworld idea is analysed in season 2 which is a giant step for this kind of cinematography.Michael Crichton,Jonathan Nolan and all writers have raised extremely interesting philosophical aspects about AI and human behaviour.Great job. Dr Robert Ford mentioned that "Divine gift does not come from a higher power but form our own minds" in season 1.In other words, it is more likely that we invented God rather than God invented us.This is also a quite interesting issue which were introduced within the first season and then enriched within season 2. The great idea of Season 2 that humans are using the park in order to define the deeper aspects of their character and digitilize this contect in order to store it in "the forge", is presented using Ed Harris's role.William's personality has changed during the journey within the park and eventually became the black man.which was digitilized at the end. Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins delivered a unique performance and becomes completely their character which was quite difficult based on the fact that their roles were deeply analyzed and contained many aspects.Nevertheless, all additional cast did a good job and especially Thandie Newton as Maeve. According to my opinion, Season 1 was better than season 2 in terms of cinematography except from episodes 8,9 in second season which were excellent.Nevertheless, i find S02 more interesting cause it does introduce the core idea of the Westworld park and the real motives behind Dr Robert Ford and James Delos investement.
1.0~bad and superficial story serban-mihai-222 Sign in Permalink Scenery and the environment are the only good things in this movie.The story is just bad and superficial, it contains nothing original and contribute with nothing to the art itself. Cliché characters, mindless violence, sex and a wannabe background story that is nothing more than a high percentage copy paste virtual reality SF story. I assume that if you did not see Matrix, The Thirteenth Floor etc. you might find something in it that will keep you in front of the screen. I also consider that some of the actors are not suitable for the roles they are playing, in one case when he appears on the screen I keep remembering a previous movie that made a huge impact 25 years ago and that takes me out of this story.
9.0~Great Television milesino Sign in Permalink I watched the pilot and gave up after 20 minutes. But my co-workers and friends encouraged me to give it another try and after a few weeks I binged the entire season. I found the reveries to be confusing but William's character really brings it all together. Now I'm tempted to binge the entire season again because of the little clues the writers dropped that I missed. I can't wait to see the next season. However, now that the underlying plot has been revealed, what really remains to be seen? I will say that the wanton mayhem can get boring at times and the gratuitous nudity is somewhat off-putting. But those are mere distractions to what amounts to great television.
6.0~Kind of nonsense beautifully packed dumaal Sign in Permalink Second season was less interesting than the first and I expect the 3rd to be even less. I do expect a title with such high rating to surprise me with something, but it was not the case. Acting was very good, picture and effects as well, but the story was only borrowed parts, nothing interesting and nothing smart, just made complicated by mixing timelines a lot.
1.0~Season 2 infosme-88447 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was really great. But Season 2 is just confusing nonsense. So stop watching after Season 1
2.0~Infinitely empty and pretentious montsegimenez Sign in Permalink The first season is not bad but the second is maximum posturing, so many unexpected twists of script that make it capriciously cheating, narcissistic, distant and empty. The only thing that is not bad is the cast. A pretentious waste of time, if there is a third season I will not see it!!
1.0~Tedious tosh Zombat5 Sign in Permalink Ploughed my way through this up until the penultimate episode (I gave it my best shot) at which point I gave up as I really did not want to waste any more of my life watching the final one. Buckets of gratuitous violence but hey, that's OK because they're only robots! (I assume that's not a spoiler as most people will be aware it's about robots or androids or whatever). Lots of gratuitous sex but hey, that's OK because etc... No-one cares about any of the characters, at least I certainly didn't. Complete waste of an opportunity, money, acting talent, space and anything else you can think of On the rating option the minimum is "1 (awful)". They should have had an option for "0 (truly awful)".
3.0~Nothing but Gang, Bang, F##k anilbum Sign in Permalink "WEST WORLD" seems to talk about 'what is human being', 'how to define human-being'. I'm truly sure it's not. It just 'watch and enjoy movie'. This show has simple pattern. 1. naked people comes in 2. having f**k 3. Gangs or bully attack 4. shot them or cut them. 5. someone talks 'it's android' 6. next 999. 'is it okay cut the android?' So, are you still sure that it's SF movie? or has it contain philosophy? Nope. I think, it's nothing but a hardcore show. but one thing, directors gives indulgence for the people. 'THINK DEEPLY, THEN YOU ARE OKAY, EVEN IF YOU WATCHES GANG, BANG, F**K, RA**S, CUT THE HEAD things.'.
6.0~A complex puzzle fails to explain the simples of things c-vogelzang Sign in Permalink Westworld season one was a delight to watch. Eyecandy and excellent storytelling all mixed up in mystery, that provoked thought and kept one longing for more. It seemed that the clueless hosts of this artificial world were clawing there way to reality and truth just as hard as the viewers at home. Where would it all lead to. But the second season, many things have turned around. Al of the sudden the clueless are mostly the viewers. Not only are they left in the complex puzzle of a robot's mind in which backflashes and fastforwards are sowing more confusement than answers. Now that's still all good. The narrative is there, its fiction, just sit back and enjoy. But at many occasions logic and reason are being traded in to get quick fixes in plotholes or cheap drama, in such a matter it frustrates the viewer and makes the watching of several episodes more like doing homework, so at least one has a glimpse of what's going on later on the show, than tantalising storytelling. It is so complex. Yet simple but elemental things are being unexplained. Dolores searches one and a half season for her father, but having found him she has no problem killing him off without searching for an alternative or some relentless drama. Meave searches for her child with a group, but at the very last stage of her journey she let's her compagnon's wait and she goes out alone, without any good reason. Havoc and mahem follow ofcourse. Several people and hosts turn up dead, without any well thought motivation why. It is like switching a button. Death is all around, that is true, but most are just pointless. And friends, lovers or kin keep threading over the demised it in just a few seconds. Forward we go. Motivation unknown. Season two is a broken mirror. And one keeps wondering, if someone would put the pieces back together, it would turn out that several pieces are missing. And the reason why the mirror has been broken in the first place is just cover up that very fact. Let's just say, it 's a pitty that season two could not deliver the promise of season one.
9.0~a great storytelling line and shocking surprises! s-parsi2005 Sign in Permalink i watched back to back the episodes and the thing i loved most about this show was that i didn't care when the scenes were happening and in last episodes when i realized how timing and chronology was meant to be i was deeply shocked.consciousness is always a bit cliché in movies and stories since it is still a subject beyond scientific experiments, however, it was not boring to follow this topic in this drama. i appreciate the effort in showing future technology and how it could be abused by human to have fun only. the ending felt sick and i really didn't have a good feeling about it. i wish it could end a better way than bloody revenge.dialogues were great and moving
5.0~Season two, especially the later episodes, is not up to par with the quality of the first season. j-bruns Sign in Permalink First season was a breath of fresh air among the mediocrity of most TV series. For the second season, I guess they thought their reputation would suffice. The characters stopped behaving believably and consistently. I feel like they wrote the ending, some scenes that they liked to present to the audience, and then just blindly tried to string everything together with a lot of meaningless and insignificant filler content. Everything else is excellent by the way. It's just that lazy, pretentious writing is doing this in.
10.0~outstanding story line asnamasood89 Sign in Permalink One of the finest and intellectual work of detail explanation of human nature and self knowing in the form of tech.. highly imaginative .
4.0~Well made but deeply dislikeable Skint111 Sign in Permalink I've watched the first season of Westworld: I have no desire to watch the second. It's what I'd call a 'feelbad' show. It takes a very bleak view of humanity. I love the original film though I'm biased in favour of 1970s pop culture and somewhat anti what we have nowadays, but it's such a dark show there's very little chance of feeling any affection towards it. This Westworld features nary a single likeable character and is overwhelmingly nihilistic, unpleasantly violent (I don't have a problem with violence on screen but it goes out of its way to make every violent incident really nasty), relentlessly foul-mouthed (much of the dialogue is deeply crude) and about as far from 'fun' as could be. It is implausible, to put it mildly, and deeply pretentious. Slow and massively verbose, it tells a multi-character story that elicits little sympathy. And it's all as PC as you'd expect nowadays: at least three of the female characters are basically male. The Thandie Newton character, presumably because she's a woman AND a bit black, is like some sort of superhero: she's far wiser, more charismatic, stronger and more able than any of the puny males here. Many of the males are quislings, cowards, vain, motivated by base motives etc. Two of the actors have expressions that never change - Leonardo Nam (anxious) and Evan Rachel Wood (a little downcast; confused about her life). Angela Sarafyan treads a fine line between looking beautiful and possessing a sort of down syndrome chic. Anthony Hopkins at least doesn't phone his performance in like he has many times in the past, but his crinkled face quarter-smile irks a little. At least he isn't as flat-out foul and depressingly nasty as Ptolemy Slocum's character, who brings down every scene he's in. And I can see why Ed Harris wears that hat. Westworld is nasty, gloomy, grim stuff, whose underlying message is that people are horrible (especially white males), that life is brutish and unsatisfying, that people manipulate other people all the time, that rich people are especially awful, that there is no such thing as 'real' pleasure. I can't think of a show with a worse message to send out concerning the human race.
4.0~Solid acting, boring plot - the original Westworld movie is far far better claus-postmail Sign in Permalink I had high expectations for this series. I gave it 3 chances, but all the first 3 episodes disappointed me. Slow, boring and quite uninspiring. The original Westworld movie from 1973 is so much better made. This new series lacks action and intensity. I almost fell a sleep watching episode 3, and I tried hard to give episode 4 a chance, since there are so many great actors involved in this series, but I gave up. I give it 4/10 stars. Not worth more than that.
6.0~Starting to lose interest vatigue Sign in Permalink I'm into episode 5 of season 2 now. Season 1 did a great job creating the universe and building up tension and suspense. It even made me get invested in some of the protagonists while failing to make me care for others. I stuck to it mainly due to the fact that I really loved Person of Interest and whatever Jonathan Nolan wrote before. Here's the problem: I don't care about any of the characters at this moment. I'm not invested in what they are working towards or if they even survive. The production value and acting are both top, there is nothing to complain there. But I keep getting distracted while watching an episode and start doing other things. The pace and cutting is weird since season 2 started and it fails to keep my attention at all. I was really waiting for the promised ancient Japan part of the park and all the samurais. Sadly, even that storyline fell flat and ended in clichéd characters and no caring on my end. I fail to find what drives most of the characters to do what they do. There are some goals I can see and others that just feel off. It feels like all of them are just wandering the park (that should be overrun by the parks security or government military by now) for no apparent reason. I'm sad because I really had high hopes for this due to Jonathan Nolan. Will give up watching now though. A solid 6 for the acting and production of the series. Nothing more cause I really don't care about any of the characters by now.
5.0~So confusing stevemr-65904 Sign in Permalink A very intriguing show but confusing as all hell. Parallel time lines, forward, backwards, dream sequences. One minute everybody's dead. The next they're not. The constant challenge to make Delores...something ? Oh but wait, she's not perfect enough yet. But Bernard is ! But he doesn't know he's a robot. Yet he acts and thinks as a perfect human. But they can't make Delores as good. What did they loose the coding? Probably the most annoying tv show going. Super high body count. Pretty much each episode is the same. I,m still pushing on with it. Surely something will happen
9.0~Wait a second.. querolant Sign in Permalink .. well I've become less offended by the bias in the internet over the years, but people claiming they score the show 1 star because its closing a 10 because they want to balance the score? Really? The same people that tell you there are plot holes and the story makes no sense suggest you to watch the movie from 1973? Seriously, I rate it a 9 because its not perfect, nothing is, even BB and GoT aren't.. but it's close. First of all, I agree that technicality can be a blessing in disguise and I also agree that in recent years, movies, series, everything with huge mainstream budget is overachieving in this department and in many cases overshadowing certain weaknesses and not so strong areas regarding story-telling, bad acting or overall blandness. But that doesn't mean it can't enhance experience and accessibility. Well Westworld from a technical and artistic standpoint is top-notch. The score paces you through various emotions in an instant, performs IMO always to the current mood of the scene, is relentless in that, but yet still subtle and not too urging to derail you from other aspects of the viewing. And yet its still there, crawling into your memory and guiding you through scenes and narratives (hehe^^). Visuals from camera over costumes to cgi is IMO always on point. Stunning at times and still put in meaningful terms and not over boarding and too flashy, so that you can take it for granted while you want to focus on story or dialogue. I caught myself sometimes while highly appreciating the design-choices they made with the cgi, like how they incorporated the industrial nature of the hosts within time where industrial development already started without getting to steampunky or ridiculous. Everything is based on a concept which is totally believable, which science is currently getting a knack of but smartly exaggerated. Acting is strong. Wood, Hopkins and Harris are delivering big time. They drag you into their world, Wood is showing a variety of (scripted!) emotions in an instance without looking like trying hard. I will get into character work next, but need to say before, that, giving the nature of Dolores or other Hosts being on the brink of true self-awareness, they are very compelling under hard to act like circumstances. Well a few reviewers criticized the lack of character development and find it hard to engage with the mains. They mark out the lack of actual decision making and not showing progress as a character to make it hard to identify with the protagonists. Guess what, you're supposed to. Mainly they are Androids with scripted behavior without own decisions apart from small improvising. The humans in this show are supposed to be the antagonists, you wont symphatise with them easily either. And its very compelling and complex to showcase the slow development of a self aware mind over decades like this show does. Westworld creates its intrigue from the audacity of mankind being bored by itself, which itches and bites at times and is nowhere near an easy pickup. And it does it a beautiful way without being beautiful. I agree with there being plot holes. There are no big omg-moment-reveals which weren't foreshadowed or unpredictable. Nolans writing is not new to anyone anymore. But they way things unfold are exceptionally well done. And please remind yourself that season 1 was the prologue. Development in character is picking up from now on. I haven't watched something this beautiful and menacing since.. well I'm not sure when I watched something like this. I'd like to compare my experience after watching Westworld to what happened when I read my first Murakami-Book. Something is different now
8.0~One good, Two, not so good. At all. Amadio Sign in Permalink What a shame, what a disappointment. What started out as good, intriguing storytelling in season 1, has disintegrated into the lowest form of mass TV; a soap opera. Are we doomed to have the 'back stories' of characters from EVERY historical period? The Raj, Edo Japan, Native Americans, it goes on and on. Bring in another character. Season 2 episode 8; beautifully shot, well-acted, terrific music - sickly false emotional rubbish. Spielberg would be proud. The use of flashbacks and the lack of clarity as to whether they are 'real' or not allows the writers to anything they like, without any consequences. It was brilliant, now I watch just before going to bed to put me to sleep.
5.0~Don't watch. Total crap. aldutoridd Sign in Permalink No real plot..game of thrones wannabe murders which don't really matter.. almost every one turns out to be a host.. useless Shogun sequence.. better not be a season 3
6.0~way overated! bearpio Sign in Permalink I think it was a bit corny, I tried watching it 2 times and seriously I couldn't do it. It just didn't explain enough a lot of repetition.
6.0~Yawn zombiji Sign in Permalink Ok it was a decent show but I can't say I'm on the edge of my seat for more episodes after season 1. It is an average show with decent performances by a solid cast.
7.0~Season 2 is making thing interesting desrocchi Sign in Permalink I found season 1 to be quite boring with the clear definition of good hosts and bad humans. At the beginning of season 2 we finally have a plain field where there's no fine line that separates the good from the bad. There's no longer reason to root for the hosts because they are no longer (and maybe have never been) victims.
9.0~EVERY SEASON RATED anthonyabiakl-57062 Sign in Permalink Season 1 : 10/10 The first season is just so perfect and well-written, a true masterpiece ! Season 2 : 9/10 People may say that season 2 suck, but I disagree... Season 1 was better, yes, the timeline in season 2 is confusing, yes, the plot is complicated, yes, BUT, it's still amazing and mind-blowing
2.0~Gore violence blood even more blood and soo boring! karlemanuelsson Sign in Permalink Season one was pretty good and interesting and had in not been for so much graphical violence to would have been a great show. Season two lacked story-the season could have consisted of two episodes and it would had been just fineeach episode had about 10 minutes of interesting story the rest is just an endless walloping in characterdevelopment...plus the ridiculous amount of glorified violence.i mean how many throats do you seriously think the audience want to see cut and headshotswith bullets exploding peoples brains. It's a sad state of of our society when filmmakersthink that they have to shock and inflict this amount of needless graphicalviolence...
5.0~Good Performances, But Ridiculously Confused michael-38709 Sign in Permalink I have now seen every episode of the first season of "Westworld." The talent of the actors here cannot be denied. Anthony Hopkins delivers in his role, and the other principles are all stellar. That having been said, the series has come very close to losing my interest several times. The story follows a series of characters set in the titular futuristic theme park, a semi-computerized realistic depiction of the Wild West, complete with canyons, towns, and wide open spaces. The characters are divided between wealthy customers who visit the park, employees who work to keep the park running, and a set of lifelike robots, called "hosts," working to facilitate the various scenarios in the park. The patrons have a great deal of power over these hosts because the weapons the hosts use are useless against them, and have the authority to kill, rape, and abuse the hosts to their hearts content. As I said, the performances are stellar, with Evan Rachel Wood, Jeffery Wright, and of course Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins giving some of the best performances. Also interesting are the settings and special effects, which are on par with or exceed the effects of the Game of Thrones franchise HBO is so desperate to replace. That being said, there are some serious and almost fatal problems with the series. One of the big problems is the narrative consistently veers into the "everything you know is wrong" territory. For instance, there are quite a few scenes that are later revealed to be flashbacks, complete with alternating outfits and "chilling" monologues, and there is a distinct impression that anyone can be revealed as a host at any time. The result is that the few overarching themes in the narrative are often confused. For example, three characters (two major and one minor) who at least at the end of the season are not established as hosts are almost comical bad guys, but who knows how they might be revealed as hosts in yet another more complicated narrative? The hosts are often set up as sympathetic characters, but often engage in horrible carnage which is "justified" since they are held up as ethically superior to their makers. Other times they do horrific things but are "justified" because they have no control over their actions but are following the dictum of a higher, presumably non-host (although who knows for certain). Other times people offer aid to rogue hosts even after seeing them do terrible things, with no explanation given. Also, why do people in order to avoid giving away something end up saying something generic like "It's complicated." Err, what's complicated about it? All of this serves to confuse rather than enlighten. For example, one of the characters undergoes a radical change, but this radical change isn't revealed slowly, but instead crammed into a span of about 3 minutes in the last episode. The hosts are all constantly kept within a hair's breath of total insanity, on the grounds that this makes them "more human." But the hosts are trained to ignore patrons talking about events outside the park, so there is a lot about them that doesn't ring fully human anyway. The host's mania is often outclassed by their human overlords, who have opinions ranging from "these hosts are the next plane of evolutionary existence, and we are scum!" to "These hosts are property, so lets be as comically sadistic to them as possible." But if both the hosts and their human overlords are insane, why should we care about the inevitable carnage that ensues? What do you think would happen if all the caregivers left their inmates to take over the asylum? In short, the performances and the special effects befit a potential replacement for Game of Thrones, but the narrative lacks a consistent set of rules, with a result that is more of an annoyance than a compelling plot. I must disclose that the story has a lot in common with Blade Runner, which I didn't really care for either, so if you think Blade Runner was the best movie ever I would give this a shot. Otherwise you aren't missing out on much.
5.0~Great Story, forced vulgarity. sergeantmajorh Sign in Permalink I love the story the acting is fantastic, but the forced vulgarity is becoming a focus point in each episode now. Being a Marine, I have heard my share of it but it just seems like some of the writers are looking for places to insert the Fbomb wherever possible. Unfortunately it is distracting from this possibly great series. Hope it gets toned down just a little. Perhaps it will get better, this should be a 10 review but just isn't worth it with this distraction. I hope to upgrade my rating soon but this could be a point which leads many to simply not watch. My spoiler tag is simply for that. Look forward to a LOT of vulgarity.
5.0~Unbearably slow start estoproductions Sign in Permalink I'm giving this 5 for production values, some of the performances and the belief that it's just a matter of setup for a series that will hopefully get much better. HBO is known for quality programming so I sincerely believe this is not what it appears to be from the first 2 episodes, which is a confused and boring mess. I think it will get better; however, my patience will only carry me through one more episode of mediocrity. There are virtually no likable human characters and up to this point it seems like it's headed in the direction of trying to get the audience to chiefly sympathize with androids. That's fine if they can achieve that goal, but it's pretty lofty given the western theme. (This ain't starwars!) The one human character that is likable was only introduced in episode two and he's not all that interesting so far. Ed Harris' character is so dopey and uninteresting that I am already wishing he'll be killed off. This is one of the biggest disappointments as he showed the most promise in the trailers. The main thing I dislike about it is the pace. It seems to take 10 minutes to get through a scene where almost nothing (interesting) happens. I feel like they wrote 30-minute scripts and are stretching them out to 1 hour because that's what HBO ordered. I can't watch a 1-hour show that feels like 2 hours and not feel like I've wasted precious moments of my life.
10.0~Season 1 - Pop Culture Thoughts popculturethoughts Sign in Permalink An absolute feast for the senses and the intellect, HBO's series adaptation of the 1973 cult classic is a miracle to witness from beginning to end: An evidently gargantuan budget allows for an absolutely riveting, aesthetically breathtaking science-fiction epic with several layers of reality and existence co-existing in nearly every scene, with incredibly wiry writing and plotting giving an excellent cast to a chance to sink its teeth into every scene. There really is nothing else like this out there.
10.0~Masterfully written, artfully produced. michaelhelm Sign in Permalink By far the best show I've watched. They have mastered the art of rewatch value. To all reviewers saying they're losing interest in season 2, keep watching; it gets much better towards the later episodes. Every detail of every shot is so well planned and thought out in this show.
10.0~Brilliant Mind Blower g_mdee Sign in Permalink Put your phone down and concentrate is all I can say.
10.0~A rare out of box thinking jayeshbnsl Sign in Permalink *May contain bits of spoilers* Excellent writing and direction.The music is also wonderful.All in all makes for a great experience because of an excellent story and bolstered by some great scripts.The cast of the show also justifies the writing with Anthony Hopkins being the standout.Some of the episodes may feel confusing specially at the beginning but 4th or 5th onward it will reach an upscale and its yet to go down from there.The theme score by Ramin Djawadi is great as well with it being used precisely during the story telling.The thing that stands out for me is the out of box and different thinking that show is based on.Its a topic not done before(maybe done before but not recognizable) so its unusual at times.Some mature content is also present but that's expected out of HBO and its not as much as Game of thrones.The other good thing about this show is that the story is moving quickly and revelations are being made quickly unlike GOT which takes loads of time plot building.All in all the best thing on TV right now.
4.0~Very over hyped,and overrated Eddie_weinbauer Sign in Permalink This show would probably be a good book,but as a TV show it find it to repetitive and to stuck in its own world. They seem to have used a lot of money on a few high paid actors and than rehashed scenes to save money. Cause A side from the big names,the rest of he cast is b level I miss explanation as to why, they only have western world.What is the fascination in the future ,with this time period.And why do all the robots have to be naked to be reprogrammed. Also it seems like there are way more robots in play,than actual customers. Ed Harris does what he does best,he play a through and through evil character,with very little depth to him. I think he suppose to represent the Yul Brynner of the series. Though he can't hold a candle to Yul Brynner. Hopkins walk around as the series geppetto.And the supposedly big mystery if the whole show. But even he has very little to work with here, he simply walk around giving small clues. If they had expanded beyond the whole western concept it might have been better,but since they only have 3 fantasies they imply the world isn't as big as they try to make you believe. The tre common fantasies are Duell,posse,and drinking & whoring.Than you have the bonus saving a damsel in distress. I miss more meat on the bone,as who they cater too. I feel it could have been good with more meat on the bone and a little less repetitive scenes So I give it a 4
10.0~Flawless. anoukandre Sign in Permalink The cinematography is magnificent. The setting is marvelous. The acting is excellent. The storyline is amazing. The themes are ambitious. The score is incredible. The idea is perfectly executed. The brutality is grueling. The suspense is agonizing. This series BLEW MY MIND. I was left reeling in shock and awe after each episode. It's intense, scary, unsettling, and is overall the best and most compelling series I've ever watched. Everything I could say on the plot would spoil your fun. Go find out for yourself if it's something for you - I bet it is, and that you won't regret any second you spent watching this series. Also, there's Anthony Hopkins in it, and if that's not a final selling argument, I don't know what is. Westworld, man. WESTWORLD!
10.0~Can't wait for Series 3 sixfeetunder3189 Sign in Permalink Series 1: I found the start of Westworld to be a bit slow and boring. I mean it wasn't so bad, but I just had difficulty getting in to at first until around Episode 4 when it felt things had realled started to pick up, and then we got to Episode 7 where things REALLY picked up, and the last few episodes including the Series 1 finale were amazing. Series 2: I don't understand the hatred Series 2 gets, to be honest. I thought it was miles ahead of the most part of Series 1. I still feel the ending to Series 1 trumped Series 2, but that doesn't mean I'm going to rate Series 2's finale 1 star like some are - for some reason I can't understand - doing on this site. I'll agree the flashbacks and flashforwards were a bit confusing at times, but maybe I'm biased 'cos I like confusing and convaluted stuff, so I didn't have much of an issue with it, to be honest. My only criticism really was that the other worlds were a bit underwhelming and didn't live up to the hype, especially the world full of tigers which we only saw about... 5 minutes of, despite tigers being hyped in the Series 2 trailer. That was a bit disappointing, but hopefully we'll see tigers in Series 3... Hopefully... Shogun World was better, but I still felt a bit underwhelmed. Though, overall, I felt Series 2 was solid. It had lots of revealing moments, interesting moments, and shocking moments. I'd describe Series 1 as a stroll through the countryside, gradually becoming a jog until sprinting as fast as you could. Series 2 felt like a wild rollercoaster ride. Yes, there were downs, plenty of ups, and the speed was breakneck to the finish. Maybe a bit too breakneck, as I do feel some elements were rushed, sadly. Nonetheless, I'm stoked for Series 3. After those final scenes from Series 2, I want to see what happens next now more than ever. 2019 here we come!
10.0~This show is great. steffeeric Sign in Permalink This show is great! It blends two of my favorite genres Science Fiction and Westerns in a unique way unlike that trainwreck Cowboys vs. Aliens. The show is great like IMDb used to be...when they still had message boards. This show would be a great show to talk about with other theorists but those days are done. Welcome to 2017 where everything sucks. F U A M A Z O N.
6.0~Season 2 boring and dumb alexandracufteac Sign in Permalink I've seen 3 episodes of s02 so far and I really don't think I'll keep watching. Very dissapointed. Yes, you could say that it might still be interesting and smart if you believe that paying close attention to details by watching an episode 3 times is worth it because you may find hints, but I say you might just be a snob or hopeless fanboy. In all honesty, it is chaotic and dumb. If you are able to pay such good attention to details to find hints that could help the story make sense, then you can also find all the mistakes and cliches in it. And boy they are plenty. For example, one moment a host understands that they are robots made my humans and formed from "memories" that humans planted in them, but the next moment, the same host doesn't understand that their father or child is not their real family, but just another robot, with whom they have no real history, and all their shared memories are fake and repetitive for the sake of the story played for humans enjoyment. In general all the robots with conscience thing is very poorly represented and they just seem to adapt to the story as it goes, if one moment a host is very cold about a relationship with another host, the next moment, to prove a point they wanted to insert in the story, same character is very emphatic and hot headed about something else, even if they have their intelligence setted to an absolute high. The hosts just seem to develop personality traits randomly, with no logic, like the producers completely forgot the previous story and season, and they don't see the robots as robots anymore. And this is farfetched. Also, SO MANY FLASHBACKS! Come on, can't you be interesting without playing ping-pong with time frames? After 3 episodes you still feel like you watched just one half of a first episode of the season, because the story is so stretched and hard to watch. And again, I get intelligent TV! But not excessively stupidly hard to watch tv! Otherwise it becomes the same as those abstract pretentious documentaries or "artistic" films that actually have no content and just a wanna be message. Like a piece of art with just a circle in the middle of a white background that people stare for hours at and pretend that piece of art is transmitting so much. Another annoying thing, it feels so far like they threw at the garbage can the story with that brothel manager woman. She was the only interesting thing at the end of season 1 and I expected much more of her story. Anyway, to me, the whole war and "feel sorry" for the poor robots with human feelings is annoying. Oh, mean ugly humans! How dared they show their true hidden thoughts, desires and pleasures in a controlled world build for that exact purpose?! ( <-SARCASM here) .But whatever.
10.0~Excellent re-imagining of the original XweAponX Sign in Permalink With Ed Harris playing a sort of Reverse-Yul-Brynner. This is the peak of modern storytelling, we don't know what to expect. All I have ever wanted, when watching a film, TV show, reading a book, even listening to music, is "Surprise Me". Do something unexpected, something I cannot predict. But most important, allow me to pretend I am elsewhere for 60 minutes, minus time for commercials. Thanks to HBO's August Freebie, I have been able to enjoy all of Season 1. I was even able to install the HBO app into my iPhone, and stream each episode into my Apple TV. Control of what I want to watch, when I want to watch it, and how I want to watch it, and NOT have to pay for Digital Cable. At least for a month. This show brings up a concept often referenced in Movies and Film: What if we were to create people? How would we treat them, and how would they think of us, would they consider us Gods, or would they think they are better? How would we treat them, and how would they treat us? This show explores that concept in great detail, as Ed Harris tries to find his way to the center of the Maze, as Delores starts remembering past lifetimes, as Teddy repeatedly gets shot by Ed Harris. The concept of time, and memory, is something shown differently than what we experience. Our memories are not clear, but the Host remembers as if they are still experiencing the original event. The Park has a way of dealing with that: Delete the Memories. But, even with today's technology, no magnetic memory is ever really deleted, and it takes time to overwrite a hard drive with 0's. So, all of the previous programming, and all of the previous memories are still there. This becomes a problem when various Hosts start remembering being shot, stabbed, vivisected, raped. If you remembered being raped, shot and stabbed, would you not eventually react to that? Would a Robot? Artificial Intelligence is not a thing that is far off in the future, we use it daily, with OK Google and Hey Siri. That's why I treat my Apple and Android devices with respect, you never know when they will act out on a Grudge. And one thing is true: The more you use these Assistants, the better they know YOU. So, how will we treat this technology, should it ever gain consciousness? Personally, I would not want to have that tech bearing a personal grudge against me. It's the same concept of how you treat other people. If you treat them like crap, they hate you. If you treat them with respect, they respect you back. However, as with people, and tech, there are some things that are broken "Right Out of the Box" - And that issue is dealt with as well. Bad People, Bad Tech. But which is which? Regarding "Bad People", it appears the #Drumpf Army of IMDb #FakeAccounts is on the loose here, with several verbatim #FakeReviews and deliberate 1-stars and Non-Helpfuls, just to drag the ratings of this show down. They did the same to Wonder Woman. But Oh, the Drumpfer's LOVE Game of Thrones, which has even more PC graphic sex and women-targeting violence, eh?
6.0~Very disappointing with a few interesting twists rdvljunk Sign in Permalink I started this with high hopes, looking at the ratings it got. And it started pretty decent and intriguing. Anthony Hopkins is performing as can be expected, quality "evil crazy" scientist. But the rest..well they can not live up to him with absolute low Dolores, who's acting is almost to the point of irritating. When the series continued I got more and more restless and puzzled. Why are the two doctors so very, very easy manipulated by Maeve to do things far worse than they were blackmailed with, it doesn't make sense? Why is there is this park so much action without guests being around? Is the park really so big a train can drive a day and a night through it? Why does a hooker need to know what bulk apperception is, a philosophical term unknown to most common people in real life? Why are there so many floors that are not used and abandoned (nooo, lights in abandoned areas do not flash in real life). And then there is the sneaky promotion of smoking like in ep 6 "mmm, I can understand you started these things again" Oh come-on, it's 2017. Yes it deals with some questions about what it means to be alive, but it is all very superficial.
8.0~Original yordan-90658 Sign in Permalink The mix Western/Sci-Fi is not my cup of tee, but this one grabbed my attention after the first episode. The Nolans are famous for diving into complicated matters, and this is no exception. So far, I've been getting a moral vibe-what is awesome about a "recreational" park, where you can, literally murder, rape, torture and, basically do everything you want, without any consequences-as long as you pay (40k a day). It is known that the idea is from the movie, written by Michael Crichton-which I haven't seen btw, but is on my Watchlist. Intelligent people created this park, and they have all the control over their creation, but what could happen if somehow they started losing that control? What would happen if their creation suddenly started to remember all the nasty things people who visit have done to them...it? Will It go on some sort of a revenge? Well-it remains to be seen. I've been "monitoring" closely the work of the Nolans, and they amaze me every time-everything they do makes you ask yourself a lot of questions. The cast of Westworld is awesome-I mean common-Antony Hopkins is the "mastermind", and fantastic as always. If you like movies/TV shows, where you can't miss a second, because that would mean not understanding what the hell is going on later-this one is for you, so check it out!
1.0~Season 1 was outstanding, season 2 well.... james-broomhead1 Sign in Permalink I should start by saying I never made it beyond episode 1 of the 2nd season. It was just too boring! The first season was spectacular and left me with such optimism for season 2. It soon became obvious it was a complete dogs dinner!
10.0~one of the best TV shows pondsbluebox Sign in Permalink I love the first episode of this amazing new HBO drama because all of the great acting and the story. I started it because I had seen a commercial about in on Facebook but I really loved it. The music is phenomenal. The intro - too. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always. Even Rachel Wood's Dolores made me felt in love in her. I think she will be great. The good girl will become evil. The story shows us so many truths because our world looks a bit like Westworld. I couldn't wait to see the second episode which also was so good. I'm not sure that this will be the new Game of thrones because they are too different but I believe that this show will be one of the most watched just as the Thrones and Breaking bad. Oh and also this show and Stranger things deserves 10/10. And if you like reading about conspiracy theory Westworld is definitely for you
8.0~Westworld, a western adult theme park begins to malfunction. jedly Sign in Permalink WESTWORLD (2016) is a science fiction drama TV show that takes place in fictional Westworld, a technologically advanced, Western- themed amusement park populated completely by androids referred to as "Hosts". Westworld's visitors are known as "Newcomers", who can do whatever they wish within the park, without fear of retaliation from the Hosts. The fact that "Newcomers" can do whatever that want to the "Hosts" is disturbing. It's primal Rape, murder, mutilation--it's all fair game. Westworld allows "Newcomers" to throw their morals away. Everything we've fought to overcome as a society is ignored. We sort of already live in a reality based society. Folks seem more at home with what's going on with "Reality TV" rather than what's actually going on in the real world. Even the 'news programs" sell sensationalism. If we can achieve the level of technology Westworld has this show won't be fiction. The series, originally conceived as a movie written and directed by Michael Crichton in 1973, despite being fiction, is definitely we're only decades away from. The first episode, and probably the series, deals with several malfunctioning 'Hosts" which as seemingly caused by a recent software update. As the episode progresses, it leads the audience to believe that this software malfunction could lead to the "Hosts" becoming self aware, and possible a danger to the "Newcomers." The idea of technology getting away from us, and our creations taking revenge isn't a new concept, but this show is still intriguing. Maybe it will actually teach us a lesson we'll listen to.
4.0~Really disappointing Season 2 saumyagupta Sign in Permalink It has become just another show which relies completely on fancy graphics, wordy dialogues and frequent gunfights. Season 2 was all about fancy technology (which seems extremely impractical), people walking around in the desert having gunfights (throw in a couple swordfights here and there) and loose plot twists most of which seemed unnecessary. There's a false illusion of depth. The showmakers also don't seem to understand technology or anything related to artificial intelligence, nor have they even tried to do any basic research on it. The plot has gaping holes, and after a point you even stop caring whether the story is even coherent or not. I hated the second season as much as i loved the first. It has deterred me from watching any self-proclaimed sci-fi TV series or movie for at least the next couple months.
8.0~Great TV show, fresh but quite slow n-m-bertin Sign in Permalink Hearing that J. J. Abrams was involved in this, I was actually worried. Many people love him, but he has a history of starting great mysteries and never finishing them. Lost is of course the best example of this. There is a lot of that in Westworld. Fortunately, this time just about everything is explained by the end of the series. It is beautifully done. Great scenery, directing and acting. Of course Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins are great, but it's Evan Rachel Wood and Jeffrey Wright who steal the show though. There is a perfect balance in the writing, it is basically taking ideas from Blade Runner to a new level. Being HBO, there is a lot of nudity and violence. I'm not sure the fact that they're android makes it any less gruesome. I would have wanted less, after all not all people would turn like monsters upon entering Westworld. So why not 9 or 10 ? Well it is very slow progressing. At one point, it as akin to Game of Thrones. Many parallel stories, all advancing real slow. 10 episodes was too much, 8 would have been enough. Also this is supposed to be a futuristic world, but they don't seem to have a lot of cameras... or a lot of light... Every room, every apartment is dark as hell. There are also too many twists in the story. One or two you can guess, one is brilliant, but the others... a bit too much perhaps. I prefer it to Deadwood though, where the raping and killing had gone too far for nothing. Here there is hope. It doesn't go anywhere (so far), but there is hope.
8.0~My rate is for the first season abdullahmansour-23804 Sign in Permalink The first season is wonderful but the second season is full of flashbacks. So I rate the second season 4 of 10.
10.0~Best TV show ever ! Firmamento Sign in Permalink I just love this show ! Everything in this show is so real, yet also so unreal. Now tell me, what do you see when you look into Dolores' eyes? Can believe that I'm going to say this, but when I look into her eyes, I saw gods. What if we ARE in a game, right now? If I can see through reality, can I change everything that I've built? I appreciate the ambitious that HBO has to create this show. Potential of this show is limitless, more because that human's imagination and the outer world is limitless. Have you ever doubted your reality? Yes, I did, and everyone should. Anyway, I really enjoyed the show. I didn't have a HBO account, but I got one just for watching this one. I hope they put this show on iTunes. I don't care how much it costs.I just want to download it first and then I can watch it on plane.
6.0~Artificial Reviews paulwattriley Sign in Permalink So after season 1 this average show had an above average rating between 7.9 / 8.1 for months to a year this was the case. Now just as they are prepared to broadcast season 2 this ratings take a massive spike hahaha OK. This show could have been brilliant but sorry it did not go that way. Did it really need 2 seasons No. Will it be drawn out Yes.
5.0~Excessively Emotional As Interstellar badjesus Sign in Permalink Don't get me wrong sentimentality or "depth of feeling" to quote Ebeneezer, is a pivotal component to a story's structure and I'd wager to its success for if it lacks it the audience can't connect to the characters should they become in peril; Hell even JAWS had it's "Ahhh" moments with Roy Schneider an family between Great White Human Snacks! However should a particular genre become overly saturated with it, in particularly Horror, Action & Sci-Fi, it will in fact have the SAME effect upon the audiencethey'll cease to care about those characters that are a diversion from the action, even when they are in danger! Which scenes do we enjoy more?..those with Ed Harris OR Evan Rachel Wood talking about her childhood, every episode, multiple time and the "analysis" of the words she chose? Is this Westworld or a modern stylized Dr. Phil? I can appreciate Jonathan Nolan's examination of the Human perception of what it means to be in fact "human" and perhaps even the underlying message of A.I.'s (Artificial Intelligence) potential dangers but these things could have been expressed without every third scene being a weeping Mother's lament! The original film had a kick-ass near SILENT Precursor-Terminator Robot (Host) played by (uhmis there any other word but AWESOME to describe him?) Yule Brenner who goes on a killing spree in Westworld after ALL the Robots (Hosts) go haywire around the park! Not to mention we also saw other Worlds the park inhabited: Ancient Rome, King Arthur, etc. and the aftermath of the Robots (Hosts) killing humans there. The message was clear even THEN back in the early 70's of the danger of technology advancing faster than humans may be able to cope and had the original film added a love scenario between Human and Robot..(probably ending badly as this WAS a 70's Sci-Fi film, tho' Logan's Run ended happily)been sprinkled in than the "what it means to be human" message would ALSO have been evident. Whew! Admittedly exaggerated but I feel Nolan made the same, what's the correct word not "error" per say but direction story wise as he did with Interstellar when he and his Brother wrote it. That film dwelled FAR too long on the relationship between McCaughey and his Daughter as every time it left the "Space Stuff" and went back to the "crying, miss you stuff" (again I exaggerate but only a lil) the audience silently groaned..(and Quantum Physics aside, wtf was up with that whole Black Hole Library thing Matthew was floating in??) But I digress, were only 4 Episodes in and ill watch the rest of the season if for any reason I'd watch Ed Harris do a 3 hour infomercial on 'Shower Curtain Rings'.
9.0~Season one left me tripping. trecenachos Sign in Permalink The themes about reality, consciousness, suffering, violence... were all very well handled. I hear season two is not as good. It's still in my watchlist, even though I'm not sure this show needed a second season, artistically speaking.
6.0~Season 2 unnecessarily complicated slheddle Sign in Permalink Seaason 2 took much too long to reveal itself. And when it did, it felt like a cheat. It wasn't necessary to flip between so many memories between so many characters. I understand the purpose but it just didn't payoff in the end. The reveal wasn't big enough to justify all the confusion. Exploring dimensions of consciousness and relating that to a virtual world is not as novel as the writers seem to think it is. 'Altered Carbon' does this in a much more interesting way without as much confusion. And, the payoff is worth the flashbacks. Maybe they need to bring Ron Howard in to save this too.
5.0~This started out amazing eniac-11 Sign in Permalink Season one was excellent, but season 2 was rubbish. Only good thing to say about it is that it's easy to shop watching it. I don't crave for more. When you think about the potential of universe they create it's amazing they can make a whole season with almost nothing going on. If they had made only one season and made a proper ending it would have been a 10. Season 2 is dragging my rating down.
8.0~Very good, but let's be a bit critical. joepromax Sign in Permalink This review is based on the complete season one. The premise and aspects of the interweaving story lines seems to have been well covered by other reviews and I agree that it is (mostly) well polished and executed. The show does a great job of keeping certain aspects or identities of characters hidden and feeding you information either in gradual drips or in a sudden flood of plot twist. As the characters are either robots (hosts) or humans the question running through the series is, past the Turing Test can a Host develop actual intelligence instead of artificial intelligence and overcome its programming? Much of intrigue in the show comes from this question and in the revealing or hiding of the controllee or the controller from the viewer's eyes. As good as much of the show is, it's not without it's flaws. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins), the owner of the company is strangely portrayed as sometimes evil genius with no affection for the Hosts and sometimes caring and fully invested in the idea of helping hosts achieve sentience (talks with Dolores), he literally expresses contradictory statements. People might say to this "well, it's unclear as to what his motives are and are still a mystery even after the end of season one". I would say it doesn't make sense to express these views, especially since there's no reason for him to hide his views either way, him being the owner and all. Another thing is the time-frames. Dolores repeats her first day an incredible amount of times, and, fair enough she is meant to be one of the oldest in the park but if this is meant to be a 'realistic' experience wouldn't it 'spoil people's immersion' if they saw her drop the same cup in the same position every time they came into town? Also, I really didn't like shows like Lost or Flash Forward or Heroes. Game of Thrones is great, Breaking Bad, great. The difference between these shows? A coherent story arch. Game of Thrones is/was great because its world follows certain rules and there is a great deal of foreshadowing. Breaking bad, a clear progression from amiable, well meaning character, to heartless drug-lord, with lots of skin-of-the-teeth moments, but never completely unbelievable. With those other shows (yes all of them) you can really tell that the writers just make up random plot points as they go along, ridiculous ones, because hey, its fantasy right? Well that's not an excuse for ill thought out story lines. Anyway, Westworld is clearly better than that and there was some foreshadowing of the identity of the man in black earlier in the series. You can tell that this was designed to be a major reveal/plot point right from the start. There is a danger however that the series might run out of steam and resort to making it up as it goes along, I just really hope that doesn't happen because, like the rest of you, I love this show.
10.0~A delightful change from cheap flicks mynban Sign in Permalink First of all, it is very clear that the production mindset behind Westworld is far from creating a cheap product with generic high bursts of tension/love/horror/excitement. It is full of deep human conflicts, that is if you are open to watch it with a clear mind. Hopkins' quote from the end of episode 2 when he says "No" to "Odyssey on Red River" and explanation of his refusal feels like a statement of the production mindset. "Odyssey on Red River" pretty much summarizes everything wrong with entertainment media nowadays, and Westworld is a real delight that shines as a great production. I don't know how to tell its greatness without spoiling the show, but unless you want a cheap ride you will glimpse at screen in between your texting; you can not not enjoy this show!
8.0~Westworld is moving forward, and getting better! Kirollos-Noah Sign in Permalink Westworld is one of the most confusing series ever!! Especially season one, it was hard to understand! Season one of Westworld was really boring until episode 7, and then the saviors came to save that season with the greatest 3 episodes in this season, but still, it was boring at the begging! Westworld season one gets an 8/10, and thanks goes to the three last episodes! The entire series needed saving, in my opinion, so this time it needed a whole season to save it! Season two did save the series for me! With its charismatic story, charming characters, logic and CGI. But still sufferers of subplots and lots of care of unnecessary that it's even forgot who're the main characters and got us into some new ones and I lost care about this characters because they were numerous! It's really great season, and its ending was so exciting, but just like the first one for me! Westworld season 2 gets an 8/10 like the first one! Westworld is moving forward, and getting better! And it's getting an 8/10.
10.0~Season 2 it's not for stupid noire-rose Sign in Permalink Yeah, i've read all kind of reviews for season 2... for sure is not for limited people. Actually season 2 is absolutely genial, much above season 1. But it takes a lot of attention and memory and intelligence, in fact the whole of your brain must work...but it's like an orgasm for the brain :) But no, if you are a medium, mediocre, lazy person, don't look, you will understand exactly nothing.
3.0~Not Fun & NO fantasy of mine emailme123 Sign in Permalink Take note there is no spoiler because I do not go into details of skits. I am so disappointed with Westworld. Im a sci-fi-drama-loving-special effects addict and to me, all this was, was violence and nudity (which generally entertains me) with such DARK and depressing emphasis on what is wrong with the worst and most twisted people of our world. With or without violence, with or without nudity, the message they hit home is, that vast amounts of rich people are literally sick. (mentally sick) I don't understand Ed Harris playing this script at all. I'm disappointed in him and appalled he would do it. I think it is a mistake to his career JUST like any character that is SO hated by the audience that they never recover their career, so will his fate be. The other example standing out is the "famous group of celebrities". This, not only blared out as putrid and low life but also STEREOTYPICAL in the most insulting way. (and on so many levels, to so many groups and different kinds of humans) As a TV series itself, it has potential, but I doubt it will live. People need to identify with the character they see on TV and the kind of people who identify with "that" don't watch TV. I assume they watch snuff films. Other reviews mention the lack of good story script and this is very obvious. The story is lame, and put together with sticky notes, instead of strings of continuity and the possibility of sub plots that can branch out and grow. Throwing the audience back and forth and back and forth is annoying. I found myself thinking " Oh, this is one of the ways they save on actual filming and acting, fill up the story with replay after replay." ( I HATE that) If you were hoping for high tech titillation on any level, it won't even hit your lowest expectation. If they put allot of investment into the technical research, I hope they can get their money back. Finally, Anthony Hopkins made an outstanding performance, which is not surprising. Mr. Hopkins brought the only true quality to the premier episode. Considering his expertise, talent and depth as an actor, I will be surprised if he stays with a show that is so far beneath his own personal gallantry, but if he does, I'm sure it will only be because of the flagrant nudity. (He's very old now and has to get his kicks some how) If I were still in 'the life', I would dig deeper to find out who actually brain stormed and produced this "Tv Series". I am sure the private producers would make interesting and unwanted public headlines. I don't recommend it at all.
1.0~Huge budget, tired tropes with a few good ideas, F- writing TV porn mmaggiano Sign in Permalink A few opinions on how to think about big budget film/TV. Here's what a huge budget can get you: 1) Production value: Great work on design, camera/lighting, editing, FX, VFX, sound and music; competent-to-good acting, writers who know story structure, and who can make a plotboiler. "What's gonna happen next?!?" I have deep respect for the filmmakers in these fields, but with talented people, these results are generally reproducible at will. The budget for Westworld is $100M before advertising for 10 hours of content (with plenty of repetition of locations and even shots). 1a) Good looking people naked, some of them famous. 1b) A bunch of squibs and muzzle flashes and bashed-in heads and so on. 2) All of the above plus marketing/PR which will give you an instant fan base. I doubt it will give a long-lasting one. Here's what a huge budget will not get you: 1) a sci-fi trope newer than "are these things people?" which traces back to the 1930's at least, and has been done in too many movies/TV to count, and could use a rest for a decade or more. 2) new ideas, new points of view on thoughts, emotions, insights; wisdom. Westworld has a few, but not enough, and it's mostly done in dialogue and nowhere else. 3) audience engagement that goes beyond plotboiling. Plotboiling gives you a buncha surprises (no spoilerz!!!) and no lasting value. 4) any of the above well-expressed through picture, design, sound, etc. Most of the actual scene-by-scene writing is on a level with an afterschool special from back in the day: moralizing without complexity, and with a bunch of fan service to go with it. Although there are not many people vocally disagreeing with the show, those who are complain about pretension and shallowness. I agree. Since I'm loathe to accuse shows of being pretentious, let me specify: here we have sophomoric and hackneyed philosophizing about human nature/personhood coupled with quotations from classic literature and music (plus sex, violence, plotboiling and moralizing). If you can't come close to Blade Runner or work a new angle that works, don't do it. I will disagree on complaints about the acting: I think any imagined problems here are results of the ultimate shallowness of the show, plus the fact that those who play host bots are required to play a person/thing that is sometimes rigidly following their programming, and sometimes not. I think they are doing quite well there, and the deficits are inherent to the show. If only the show disobediently, willfully and intelligently went away from the 'program' the way those hosts do.
4.0~Confusing lea_farhat Sign in Permalink Confusing and disappointing - what a waste of time and money
4.0~Very good first season. Very bad second season matiasmachado Sign in Permalink A series that started very promising, in its second season it became almost unbearable. For all the other criticisms, it seems very likely that HBO will give it an abrupt end in a next season, or cancel it.
6.0~Season 2 big disappointment frankw80 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was great, but I struggled to watch season 2 all the way through
10.0~both season 1&2 are brilliant zlm-51062 Sign in Permalink Some of the comments said season 2 is a fail. are you kidding?i recommend to watch it again this show by far is perfect
3.0~Insane potential and fascinating settings destroyed with the lack of good characters Harhaluulo54 Sign in Permalink Westworld really did have the potentiality to be something great, but it has been dying since episode 1 due to bad characterization. The characters are so lacking and raw that it is hard to believe the story would conclude an epic either. Dolores is a cliché, perfect, pure wife-material. Men around her are hopeless romantics who have nothing else going on in them. Bernard is so called smart person, but all he does it add unneeded and boring drama about his wife and child to the story. Listening to him makes me wonder what was the point creating such a boring character. No one surely won't feel for him. Robert Ford - cast by Ser Anthony Hopkins - seems to be rather rich and many sided character, but so far he has been in the shadows. If this really is 10 episodes long miniseries, the character introduction and writing surely has been odd and amateurish. Man in Black - cast by Ed Harris - has so far been the most interesting and potential character. But he has been made an overly badass gary stu who is just perfect. His actions are meaningful, but don't have much value when you know he will succeed no matter what. The build up seem to be time-consuming and nonexistent at the same time. Weirdly, we are introduced with more characters with an episodic speed, making the whole bunch seem like a total, unplanned mess. All in all not any of the characters have much personality in them. By far they all are meh and quickly forgotten. There is hardly any room left for character development either and we most likely won't be seeing none. Due to the nature of the series, making more than one season will be forced and obviously not yet planned. We have a double edged sword here. Making more seasons is instant quality drop and milking. Not making more seasons will leave us with mediocre characters. edit: I have now finished season 02. First season was 6/10. Second 2/10. Total: 3/10. Won't watch the upcoming 3 other seasons.
7.0~Fun season 1, declining second season carrdl-34286 Sign in Permalink I thought this show was going some where. Season 2 has a lot of filler and is generally more poorly written when compared to the first. The action scenes are cheesey, small, and wholly unbelievable in a typically HBO kind of way.
10.0~Gods Have Let Us Create Them!.. Tövbe! hamidullahgenc Sign in Permalink -Firstly, I will whisper foolish stuff in your ears which you all figured out from the moment you laid your eyes on this show... I am afraid your trail starts now... -One creates a world where mountains meet the sky, and children play ceaselessly without fear. No, not without fear but being not programmed to fear. -There one could taste an apple, kill a bandit or should we say go as far as to "have a fling at almost everything." -And there a sweet young / seemingly intemerate Teddy could go awry again and again for his "love". -There a Man in Black could be the key to many things in this world such as the maze/meaning of this place called "Delos" is to his whole life starting where he meets a Dolores who really seems astonishing and full of life could, with the help of an Arnold, gain self-consciousness and awareness of the world outside of that place and nearly destroy that in search of an escape. -There an Arnold who co-creates this world and whose name is mentioned nearly every time a conflict / progress occurs could turn out to be a madly driven man thinking "the host" of this world named Dolores needs freedom as she is more than alive. -There a Maeve who is in the center of everything could gain control of her actions as well as thoughts, and works her horrors as a way to find a path towards the real world where she and the"fully aware" friends of hers will face playful "Gods" and spit on their face real hard. -There a Robert Ford who, throughout the whole series, seems to have been busy with his own agenda / narrative, and to have had no clue about what really goes on behind the curtains in this world, and who we cannot but hate a little for his brilliance seems rusty / unappreciated and for he does whatever he can to protect that agenda of his could out en end to all in the most surprising way that we can all forget about his recreation of Arnold as a host named Arnold who now remembers everything by the work of a Maave who will destroy this world unless the screenwriters do something about it!!! -Lose all of what I have written above! -So, someone altered Maeve to give her the purpose she's been following while thinking it of her own. Thus, all the steps she's taken were programmed to take place. This is genius!.. No it is not. It means machines cannot ever do get out of control. Horrifying!.. -Secondly, Dolores is Wyatt and this is what many saw coming a mile away and would seriously want. And she, like Maeve, is about to choice freedom... This indeed is genius!.. Absolutely! -Lose that last paragraph too!.. Not important. -Simply because Roberd Ford has been injected with the idea which Arnold had sacrificed himself to that consciousness can be achieved by these skins which has humanity not, in them and Robert put all the hosts on trial so that they'd become stronger by the pain we evil beings called humans caused them. And Robert, as his final narrative, gave himself up and let the hosts become humans by choice to the extent that Michelangelo, Mozart, Bethoveen and even Eastern geniuses like al- Farabee and al-Ghazzalee would not give joy to the hosts but reveal them the lie we all have been living for quite some time now. -This whole creative "mess" is not too strange to see that this show sheds light upon our most basic need / instinct that this world must be created for a reason while requiring order in chaos, and is not the end but the beginning of a new phase / narrative we will all see thereafter. -So the hosts... They kill and kill... But will it end? And how?.. ---We humans cannot bring any original product into existence... We sicken all we create just like us... And this is neither good nor bad... This is life in which we are no Gods...--- (P.S.: This "Westworld" may be the place we hide ourselves from the real deals of outside, but it is, from a point of ethics, where we exercise Godhood and gratify our basic needs that either distinguishes us from animals or returns us to the lowest of the low... So thank you Lisa Joy(+++), Jonathan Nolan(+++); and you Michael Crichton; and of course you, Evan Rachel Wood (++), Jeffrey Wright(+), Ed Harris(++), Thandie Newton(+), James Marsden(+), and you, Anthony Hopkins(++) for you all put your best efforts in this story... I thank you too, Ramin Djawadi(+++) for that incredible main title theme; and you, Claude Debussy(++) for you composed that theme called "Reverie" which is one of a kind!..) Bonuses: -It was real sad to see Teddy amuse the guests at the gala. Oh my! We are evil. -It gave chills seeing William who owned most of the place cherish the fact that the host rebelled and can now fight back!..

7.0~Every Hero Has a Code sportello29 Sign in Permalink HBO's Westworld gives credit to 10 writers/co-writers. Many have only contributed to a single episode with a handful of exceptions, namely Michael Crichton, Lisa Joy & Jonathan Nolan who have worked on the entire show. The latter two are credited as the main writers. A lesser known fact perhaps is that Michael Crichton has already written & directed Westworld, back in 1973. It was very well received publicly and critically, with the synopsis reading: "An amusement park for rich vacationers. The park provides its customers a way to live out their fantasies through the use of robots that provide anything they want. Two of the vacationers choose a wild west adventure. However, after a computer breakdown, they find that they are now being stalked by a rogue robot gun-slinger." As a consequence, the 2016 Westworld represents Crichton's work as a foundation that has been expanded by Lisa Joy, but most importantly and noticeably, by Jonathan Nolan. David Bordwell in his essay titled Nolan vs Nolan talks about 4 ways a filmmaker can innovate: You can innovate by tackling new subject matter. You can also innovate by developing new themes. Apart from subject or theme, you can innovate by trying out new formal strategies. Finally, you can innovate at the level of style Given the premise of Westworld as well as the involvement of Jonathan Nolan, it would be fair to analyze it through this prism of innovation as well as project the influence Chris Nolan had on his brother. The formal strategy that the writers utilized to tell the narrative, the one that relies almost solely on continuous exposition, is something Nolan fans will appreciate, while others will undoubtedly hate. It's a technique Chris Nolan has been deploying since 'Memento', and can be seen at it's peak in 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' where exposition becomes the 'meat of it', as Chris Nolan once said. Westworld provides that continuous exposition whereby we are always learning new things about the hosts abilities, their creators, the park itself as well as the true ambitions of it's stakeholders. As a result, we become involved with a plot not through learning about characters background and traits, but rather through learning the information along with the characters, while they work through the mechanics. While Westworld's style might seem simple, it echoes the efficiency and consistency that can be seen in his Nolans' work. Westworld employs mainly mid-range shots to establish scenes while the dialogues and action packed sequences are dominated by rapid, shoulder to shoulder closeups. There is nothing highly original in these techniques as many will be overly used to them from shows like 'Game of Thrones' or 'Ray Donovan', which employ some of the same cinematographers. What separates Westworld is that it's seemingly simplistic style is overarched with exposition and continuous crosscutting while it's plot is dominated by a long time favorite theme of the Nolan brothers - character subjectivity. Westworld's style therefore is ingrained in this subjectivity, it's dependent on it. Here an attempt is made to tell a story through a character's point of view. Often we see only what certain characters can see, emphasizing their subjective views & agendas, like in many scenes involving Dolores, Ford, Bernard or Maeve. As can be seen in 'Memento', The Batman trilogy or 'The Prestige' , amongst others, Nolan is fascinated by unusual storytelling strategies. His efforts often times attempt to 'reconcile character subjectivity with large-scale cross-cutting'. This unusual narrative form prospers in Westworld where the story is told in a non-linear fashion and heavily utilizes cross-cutting. As a result the viewer is constantly shifted from person to person, past to present, place to place. David Bordwell mentioned that in theory combining crosscutting and subjectivity might seem contrary, "One is intensive, the other expansive; one is a local effect, the other becomes the basis of the film's enveloping architecture." Westworld tackles this by establishing a handful of key protagonists and confining the majority of it's scenes to them. The sheer volume of these protagonists however, coupled with such dynamic style makes it incredibly hard to fully convey the subjectivity of it's characters. This is where Westworld might lose some of it's viewers. While Nolan's techniques might flourish in the cinema, as a 10+ hours TV show, they are confusing. And not confusing in the show's ability to answer the questions it raised, but in how it got to these answers. While the final episodes are truly ambitious and excellently executed, the middle act is uninspiring and uneventful. Thus when the fascination for the subject matter fades and one adjusts to the innovations Westworld has to offer, it becomes monotonous and dare I say unimaginative. Attempts to tackle this through extensive cross-cutting, wonderful acting and a unique score give Westworld a unique flare, however not for long, since the substance quickly disappears. Nolan and Joy have placed too much emphasis on the show's foundational idea as well as its actors ability to maintain the viewers interest, as opposed to building something truly thought provoking on top. The themes that are raised within the subject matter are exciting and surely the ones science fiction fans will find familiar, asking the ever-growing questions of purpose, place and existence. Westworld initially lays down the necessary foundations to address these questions in a truly unique fashion, yet ends up being too indulgent in it's form while delivering the answers. As such, what seemingly starts as a science fiction narrative at it's core, sadly transgresses into a sort of a 'sci-fi psychological thriller', where the answers lay not within a mystical or futuristic form but are rather deep-rooted in the subjectivity of the characters.
1.0~The emasculation of men = season 2 pssiblekim Sign in Permalink The "strong woman" theme couldn't possibly be more over the top. The radical left wing has destroyed yet another franchise.
10.0~HBO's version of Ghost In Shell Balsa5 Sign in Permalink This series is delightful and refreshing. Personally, I feel like it is HBO's version of the famous Japanese Manga turned anime Ghost In Shell. It focused on similar issues that is becoming more real in the world where in the near future robots are a possibilities. How do we define consciousness in a world where we are creating machines that will be so good at mimicking humans that it can fool ourselves? Machines that are many times stronger and million times more intelligent than us? Will we lose control in the end? It can be a real issue in the future. I've found HBO's version satisfying, like all HBO there is a ton of gore, sex appeal, and more sex-Elements that make the series more fun and engaging to the viewers. The story-line is at times predictable but it has many hidden mysteries that still keep the viewers engaged. I hope Season 2 will be just as good and I hope it won't fall into the 'walking dead' trap where it sets a very high expectation but never fulfills the expectation so it is like an orgasm that never climaxes. Like Maeve says to 'find the whole truth and never go half way which is worse than nothing' I really hope HBO brings it for this series for the story line sake but not to drag on the seasons. However, I like what I am seeing so far. The story-line have real depth and the problems inside the story is somewhat realistic although definitely have much dramatic flair added to it. This series definitely makes you think... it does back to destiny and choices even for us humans. Do we really make our own destiny or is it already defined?
7.0~Good but.. godfreyanywar Sign in Permalink It's okay! Great concept but nothing special. It's certainly well made and well acted but definitely overrated & far too boring to watch most of the time because it has a complicated story and the chances are you won't have a clue what's going on unless you do a little research.
2.0~Disjoined - Hard to follow - Disappointing bobnjuls4 Sign in Permalink So much potential, so little produced. Season 1 was OK but Season 2 was a mess of disconnected story lines. Between the memory trails and the story line bouncing back and forth that was hard to follow and the horrible depressive music this was very disappointing. It seemed like the writers attempted to create exciting action by having shootout after shootout instead of writing creative narratives. So much potential for a gripping series wasted on a weird, incongruent and boring waste of time. I needed the Season 2 finale to pull things together or I was done. Without a doubt, I'm done.
4.0~Turning into walking dead yasna_sa_ka Sign in Permalink As much as season 1 was intellectually clever and very interesting, season 2 has completely lost it. So far, it's been another version of walking dead with robots against human!! I feel either their writer has changed or they have clear lack of story. Wish they waited longer to put some good story together before swamp us with constant, never ended violence.
4.0~Awesome concept... silly plot line jedi_ib Sign in Permalink Was very much looking forward to Westworld. First 5-6 episodes were excellent and the show had so much promise. Then the story-line took a completely unbelievable path. (warning spoiler alert) Somehow the character Mauve inexplicably and unbelievably convinces two tech guys to tell her everything about Westworld including giving her absolute admin access to everything... lmao... In what crazy stretch of imagination would that ever happen... Unfortunately, everything that comes after is based on her having these "super" powers. Its a shame actually, because they had access to free creative outlet given the world the authors got to work with, and spoiled it all with poor character and story line development.
10.0~You need to watch the whole thing... rando94 Sign in Permalink You need to watch the whole thing to be able to give this show a fair review. A lot of the reviewers giving this an amazing rating don't actually delve into why more than that it's deep. It's not amazing just for its depth but because it is a genuinely innovative show. This show not only masterfully blends multiple genres like westerns, sci-fi, romance, fantasy, adventure, thriller, etc. together but it presents concepts in a way that haven't been done quite the same before. For one, the worlds that have been created are both deep, detailed and complex while also reminding you that they are artificial, planned and crafted by human hands and minds. This show makes you question to what extent a human can be considered as such and to what extent reality exists. The beautiful cinematography, settings, editing, scores, costumes and acting can be seen as the veil through which the stories and analyses grab your attention. Season 2 is a cut above season 1 because it answers the initial questions you have while continuing to build layers of questioning. That may be frustrating to some, but if you like to think while you watch rather than simply being entertained by the follies of human conceit as Carl Sagan would say, then it's worthwhile to watch this and make an effort to understand this from the beginning to the end before being a judge.
6.0~Underwhelming so far poc-1 Sign in Permalink First episode in and I am underwhelmed. Wikipedia claims the budget for this episode was $25M and if so, you have to wonder where the money went, on Anthony Hopkins? The plot is completely predictable if you know anything about the premise. The visuals were nice, but nothing on the level of "The Battle of the Bastards" which also was around $25M Neither does it have the hook that Lost or Breaking Bad or The Sopranos did in their first episodes. Some of the plotting just seemed unimaginative. Are we expected to believe that the Newcomers really pay $40k per day just to walk up behind a robot and shoot him in the neck? I would imagine that once gaming culture has evolved to build actual robots the plot lines will be at least on a par with Call of Duty or some such immersive game, with a degree of challenge and risk. The writing was interesting enough and there were seeds of lots of mysterious plot lines sown for future episodes. In the second episode there is a scene which reeks of self-referential pretension. Ford rejects Sizemore's new plot line which is full of titillation and cheap thrills. Instead he says he has been working on "something quite original". Of course Westworld is promising us viewers the same thing and two episodes in, I'm still waiting.
6.0~Not everything is clear in this action series. dale-little Sign in Permalink At first glance 'Westworld' proposes an idea similar to the one of 'Jurassic Park' - the action takes place in a huge amusement park 'theme' in which visitors are invited to live in the past the different sensations of everyday experiences of the Wild West. From the first minutes of the first series viewers will realize that 'Westworld' is maybe a theme park, but one in which consumers will not go along with families and children. It is recreated here in a landscape that recalls the films of Henry Ford's Wild West, populated by male robots who engage in dueling pistols that they will always lose in the fight with the park's customers and female robots that will satisfy every desire and sexual fantasy of the payers of tickets. Anthropomorphic robots (androids) are provided with all devices that emulate human physiology and the software that put into motion include the emotions of a man, with one limitation - their memory is scheduled to be deleted and permanently regenerated every morning the sun rises on a blue sky together with reinforced scenarios and biographies of each of the robots. Overnight maintenance crews restore the physiological damages of pistol duels or axes battles in which the robot Indians were killed in the last day or psychological trauma of sexual abuses that have undergone female robots. That, of course, until programs start functioning poorly, and perfect memories are not erased from one day to another. Malfunctioning (or in technical terms bugs) of the programs which animate the androids is one of the favorite themes of science fiction sub-genre that deals with relations between robots and humans in the near future. But it is interesting to examine the prospect of dealing with these problems in programming. See for example the Swedish series "Real Humans'. As in the Scandinavians series, a programming mistake or a portion of code introduced intentionally in the history of the program and hid until at some point, give androids capabilities that were hitherto categorized among those traits that differentiate the robots people. They fall into two groups - imperfect erasure of memory that allow robots to recover - even fragmentary - past experiences or personal history to overcome threats; and emotional abilities that grant independence feelings beyond pre-programmed scenarios. In these circumstances are born the premises of the species conflict between androids and humans. As the action progresses the world of 'Westworld' is becoming increasingly complex, the questions multiply, dilemmas become more acute. Some of the characters have become not only familiar, but begin to populate the universe until I become part of their world. The series benefits from the interpretation of some of the known world cinema actors. Anthony Hopkins is Dr. Robert Ford, the brain who conceived this world, the Creator who gives birth to new characters and manipulates the lives and destinies of androids that are already in action. Assistant is Bernard Lowe (played by Jeffrey Wright) who faces a personal drama and an identity crisis. Ed Harris is the Man in Black - evil character and one of 'consumers' of Westworld. Two female characters - Androids Dolores (ingenue actress Evan Rachel Wood) and Maeve (Thandie Newton - exceptional) - are both emotional and produce counterpoints - though very different - while engaging in a process of discovering their own identities. Feminist ideals take an extra dimension, it is about the conflict of authority and social relations of the 19th century women combined with subordination of robots to humans. Not everything is clear in this action series. Many questions are asked, few are answered about about the evolution of the artificial intelligence technology, about the dangers improvement of improving robots to receive human emotions, about their identity and rights. I'm sure many surprises expect us in the next season(s), but one sure thing can already be said. 'Westworld' is a mirror of our world.
5.0~Thought I was losing my mind - SEASON 2 is an absolutely mind bending bore delvecch Sign in Permalink What happened? After such a phenomenon ride through Season 1, I was expecting soooo much more from Season 2 and certainly not the jumbled incoherent mess splattered across my TV these past Sunday nights. Thankfully I decided to read these IMDB reviews and found out I was not alone...I actually thought I was losing my mind! I have read, seen and enjoyed a great many complex, intriguing, and thought-provoking stories in my lifetime and through the latest episode, I have Been unable to decode what the H*LL is going on with this train wreck. The characters have become listless and unappealing and the plot lines are non-sensical and chaotic! I will play it out to the end in the (desperate) hope that I have not completely wasted my time watching Season 2 and that the writers will (somehow) pull off a miracle and bring this long, drawn out "borefest" to a satisfying conclusion...I'm not hold my breathe though. Season 1 rating - 10/10 Season 2 rating - take a guess....
1.0~total boring non-sense ! mils_villet Sign in Permalink I am a huge fan of HBO series: Soprano, The wire... and i was thrilled to experience a series remake of mondwest with Yul Bryner revisited by HBO, all the more with so great ratings from IMDb viewers (9.2 at this time, but it keeps falling). Too bad, i fell asleep from boredom 30 minutes after the beginning of the 1st episode. the story line is absurd, the characters are worn-out clichés (the ugly bitch boss, the bad ass killer...), the acting is awful... Since i read a lot of reviews close to mine (i especially liked the analogy to a nicely wrapped gift with a ugly stench inside), i won't bother to inflict myself further this pile of crap. How is a overall rating over 9 is even possible???
10.0~Phenomenal. An exploration of near future artificial intelligence cormacgarvey-77299 Sign in Permalink If you wanted an alternate more in depth practical take on terminator whereby robots made in our own image supplant humanity as the apex predator, then this it. It explores all the artificial intelligence themes up to and beyond AI sentience and consciousness.What to do when you meet your maker?As God made man in his own image, so did humanity's attempt to recreate this feat become its undoing. Brilliant. The best most thought out complex inter woven themes I've seen on TV. You might find yourself watching episodes more than once to figure out the details. Game of Thrones, this is not, because westworld is believable. Once AI does become sentient, its going to be really disappointed with humanity! Brilliant acting. The puppy dog eyed innocence of the robots that don't understand why humans cant be killed..The lowish IQ of the journeymen robots. The brutality of the guests. It turns religion on its head as it turns out that the robots are a better representation of humanity, than the humans are.
8.0~OK, its hyped. But if it clouds your review, don't review it. lucas_severo_canela Sign in Permalink I noticed most of the things that annoyed me in this first time watching, and I agree with people bashing the show about some of it. An obvious example is the lack of good explanation about the two guys that help Maeve. Thats major for the plot and it ruins some of it. Then I rewatched it with my girlfriend. I noticed more plot holes, wrong technical explanations, and simple solutions to things that would not be solved like that. But I also realized that some of the continuity errors that I thought that I had noticed in the first run were actually explained by the multitimelines revealed at the end. This made me undecided about a verdict regarding the show. Then I started reading some of the reviews and started to see a lot of additional good and bad things about the show. Good: Complex structure. Don't say that it isn't. It has 3 or more different timelines being presented consecutively. It confuses, but rewards you. This adds replayability. It had some lazy solutions to some problems, and lazy writing for some arcs, but it does not nullify the complex structure of the whole thing. The mysteries and plot twists are really nice. Here I'm talking about all the things that makes you create theories. Some people thought that it would be the grave digging aspect of the series, saying that this amount of mysteries could not be solved, and this would have a 'lost' or 'dr who' explanation for things. Loved the Man in Black twist. Loved the Bernard/Arnold twist. Loved the Dolores is the lady in the "Wyatt" shoes. My 3 cents about this is that the grand mysteries had great explanations, but some things that were not mysteries, but equally impacting or important, were poorly explained, or written. Character progression. People complain about this one, saying that the loops and memories flushes of the characters makes it difficult to develop them. It sure does. And this is part of the challenge that I think that they conquered despite of the difficulty. Everything is relative: People often bash the show for not having obvious villains and obvious heroes. You don't actually root for, or hate anyone. You don't actually relate to anyone as well. But this is part of the complexity of it. The main character here is the history, the links between the timelines and story lines, and the philosophical reflections about them. Great TV/Cinema techniques: Visual rhymes well placed (like how the hosts wake up). Contemporary modern musics played in the piano, making us always realize this is not a western bang bang. This meta cinematography stuff that the Nolan's always make with their stuff, making the actors act like characters acting, or act the process of character production and direction and stuff like that in a lot of their work (inception, The prestige, and others). Great dialog and acting in most arcs. It really makes you wanna hear what they have to say. They quote some great references. Its very meta and cool. AMAZING easter-egg and reference digging. This is a new trend. Accept it. It has references to the source material. It has references to games that inspired some aspects of it. It has glimpses of the end of the show in the 6th eps, but only noticeable to someone rewatching it. It has a real website with things hidden to enthusiasts to decode. And it goes on. Music is amazing and is part of the reference digging. This is a reflection of a new way of consuming this types of media. No one watches this kind of shows alone today. Its a community watching and searching for clues and references. They know it. They prepared it for it. Bad: Really poor explanation for some important things. The monitoring of the park is ridiculously inefficient. Some times they hear everything that is happening in the saloon, sometimes a host is questioning its reality and no one is noticing. They notice the axeman going crazy when he was already in the middle of the mountain. Hosts cant shoot but can cause you brain damage with punches in your head. You can carry a knife and go to the desert and find other guest and think it is a host and kill him by accident. Elsie has to bring the head home and cant download the metrics from the axeman... And it goes on and on. The explanation about how the hosts achieve self consciousness is outdated and weird. I like that the answer to maze is something related to the hosts finding their own consciousness. But I don't buy the philosophical explanation to code consciousness into their brain through that pyramid, and latter that maze. Some reviewers are bashing it for using the bicameral mind, that was debunked ages ago, to explain this. Well, it isn't. You can't bash Nolan for not researching about philosophy without researching what bootstrap means in code programming yourself. But I cant help but agree that I don't feel that the (memory, improvisation, self interest, suffering) repeated in a maze really explains consciousness. And again... talking and hearing yourself isn't self consciousness, even the show says that. The suffering were introduced as a important aspect of the construction of the hosts personalities since the beginning, and then was reintroduced like it was a new thing again in the end... did not make sense. Buuuut... this one I can put in the poetic license bag. Like the singularity portal black hole interacting with the past in Interstellar. Great series. The great stuff makes this show worth watching. What I find funny are the people that review lesser shows with higher rates because the show was not hyped, and then come here to review this one with low rates because of the hype. Overhype does not make it worse, just makes it not as good as people say it is.
10.0~Incredibly interesting ysabelscout Sign in Permalink First off let me say i know there are really high and low reviews on here so if you are wanting to try this show to like it the most you will have to enjoy this sci fy, artificial intelligence, or the study of humanity because those are the main themes. This show might not be for everyone it is a study of machines humans and what separates them and what is at the core of every different person. I loved this show the actors were amazing the music and most of all the subtle scenes is where it hits you. Machines aren't human and humans are not machines but in our world where people willingly do terrible things and throw away their humanity what does that make us in the end. My new favorite show i haven't been able to stay interested in a show for more than a season but this is top notch a show that actually means something underneath. If you are into these things then go watch it you wont regret it if your not into these things please don't watch it because then you will just think its a terrible show and its not.
3.0~Great story but Boring scenes nazi_pussygirl_6969 Sign in Permalink I watched the first season, but I didn't force myself to watch the second one, I was'nt even curious about the rest of the story. Long cold boring scenes. I didn't like it, no offense to the fans!
5.0~Show the story, not tell.... sampika Sign in Permalink The finale consist of two parts, Ford explain the story behind Arnold and the man in black fully reveals his identity with a long explanation. The problem of this show is that the producing team wanted to plant a big mysterious conspiracy behind everything. But when they try to reveal it, they just realized that the story isn't that simple to elucidate. "Double identity" , meaning one character with two names or two identities, are used on at least three major characters in this show. It is just too much for readers to consume. Narrative Timeline is just awful, not helping at all. To conclude, the story worth 6 points, character portrait worth 9, settings and designs worth 10, originality 8, narrating 5.
5.0~Pathetic PC compliant series joelron26-384-826779 Sign in Permalink So blatantly anti-white is hilarious. All the whites are the evil monsters or some creep. Even the one white guy that seemed decent turned into an evil monster since that was his truth self deep down. A joke, made to warped the minds of viewers into the liberal white hate. If these useless directors could just try to make a good movie and cast it with thought of making a more dynamic and interesting movie, this could be really good.
10.0~Awesome bdawe14 Sign in Permalink AMG!!!! I can't do this one episode a week rubbish GIVE ME THEN ALL NOW!!!! I've just watched episode two and I already know this is going to be a show that I am going to be watching for a very long time to come. It's difficult to talk about the show without spoilers and I'm going to have to just bite my tongue all I can say is this looks like it's shaping up really great I just hippie this show fulfils on half of its promise and it'll still be awesome. Right time to stop typing before I spoil something can't wait for next...
10.0~amazing. But so mysterious cn4ta Sign in Permalink This show was mildly interesting.But I look for a better understanding of the first chapter several times :)) However, the film is lovely and full of unpredictable events. I just finished my first season and I have to wait until 2018.It makes me curious as to what we humans are ! I am Iranian and I was born a Muslim. This to me is very innovative. Westworld isn't your typical amusement park. Intended for rich vacationers, the futuristic park -- which is looked after by robotic "hosts" -- allows its visitors to live out their fantasies through artificial consciousness. No matter how illicit the fantasy may be, there are no consequences for the park's guests, allowing for any wish to be indulged. "Westworld" -- which is based on the 1973 Michael Crichton movie of the same name -- features an all-star cast that includes Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins and Golden Globe winner Ed Harris.
1.0~Spend Time Elsewhere jhayesmockery Sign in Permalink Not good. If you like watching the main character die like 4 times in a 60 minute episode and just restarting life every 10 minutes then this is the show for you!! I always wanted to watch the main character die 4 times in one episode!! - Said No one ever! I love HBO shows and this is by far the worst I have ever seen on HBO. Terrible acting and just plain old not good. The acting in this show makes Kenny Powers and Stevie from Eastbound and Down look like the greatest actor to ever walk the face of the earth. I expected better with all these great reviews but clearly there is a lot of drinking going on around the Holidays this year! This show deserves to be canceled faster than the XFL!
10.0~10/10 mirandalundberg Sign in Permalink Now this is what I call a masterpiece! Truly outstanding! Really interesting and well created!
5.0~The higher they are... AnimalMother84 Sign in Permalink The first season of Westworld was a joy to watch. Impeccable effects, interesting writing, some food for thought and mostly capable actors with a few professionals carrying more than their weight. Even a Shyamalan twist at the end. It earned a rightful place among the TV best, up there with Deadwood, Sopranos, Rome, Band of Brothers etc. And as it turns out, that is where they should have left it. The second season was an absolute bore. The human characters have no real drive anymore, they're just going through the motions. Treading water. The "hosts" are now either pathetic cannon-fodder or superhuman fanatics. Who gets shot, who shoots who, it has lost all meaning. If it turns out that they're needed somewhere in the plot they're just resurrected. All impact is lost. The Man In Black was supposed to have gotten what he wanted in this season: a place where choices are final, consequences are dire and there are no do-overs. Watching the series, I feel like that is exactly what is still missing. It was also painfully obvious that only the female characters have any real goals. Dolores, Maeve, Elsie, Charlotte are all leads dragging various men with them as servants or hostages. Even The Man's daughter Emily appears out of nowhere in particular to drag him around by the nose. This pandering to the current social trend will get you no plus points. Women are able to figure out what purpose and agency are without having it spoon-fed to them by a woman-heavy cast & crew. Pretty sad. In short, the first season is fantastic and a pleasure to watch. The second season you'd be better off giving a miss.
1.0~Devolved into Gibberish rebaaron-1 Sign in Permalink Michael Crichton's novel and story were great. As long as the show was telling his story, it was great. But the story ended with season one. Season two is an attempt at a sequel, and we all know how that goes. The folks who make the show should stop beating a dead horse. If you have no story, it doesn't matter how much you spend on production values and explosions, the story has no heart, and you are done. Best to just ship the characters over to that island with the left over dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, and let them fight it out with each other. PS. When your actors start posturing as Leftists, teaching us Demorat morality, like Woods just did, in the hopes of SAVING the show, you immediately lose another 60 per cent of what's left of your audience, and it's over. Play taps.
5.0~We've been here before... pastafaz Sign in Permalink So far, this appears to be yet another mysterious show filled with more questions than we will ever see answers. This is what JJ Abrams does... It was fun and exciting with shows like Lost & Fringe (despite the fraud ending of Lost). Now I'm less likely to follow anything done by Abrams and his cronies. The Leftovers is another example of a show going nowhere with decent acting and emotional soundtracks to distract us from the ADHD-like writing... Westworld spends a lot of time doing nothing while we continue to ask questions and speculate on things that will probably never be answered. There's also too many inconsistencies and sloppy attention to detail here. I'll continue to watch to see how it goes but this show certainly doesn't deserve the high ratings it has received thus far. Don't expect it to get better and definitely don't expect to ever get any answers --
10.0~More cerebral, less dumb predictable evieze Sign in Permalink You like a show that takes a couple views to understand the subtle nuances you missed the first time watching and makes you THINK? The people reviewing S:2 calling it a hot mess, have missed the boat. S:2 is brilliant and deep and took me another watching to begin to understand all that was happening-because A LOT IS HAPPENING. Don't listening to the others if you like a show that makes you think, question characters, and slide predictability out of the room. Watch it. And maybe a second time. Or even a third, because the light bulb with turn on.
2.0~Can't bear it anymore (Season 2) karl-adnan-bhatti Sign in Permalink Well what do I say, while Season 1 was awesome, season 2 is just the opposite. It's just gone downhill in season 2. Waited long enough for it to get any better. Won't be surprised if it isn't renewed for a third season. HBO should really put an end to this. The two star rating is for the second season, the first one was an excellent 10 on 10
7.0~Over exaggerated mgoody4 Sign in Permalink Show made very well actors are amazing but I still am not seeing what everyone is so hyped about when it comes to this show is they would just make the show about the old west I think it would be just as good unless I'm just not getting it so please someone explain it to me
7.0~What's it with Season 2? pietclausen Sign in Permalink I am lost. Season 1 was straight forward and enjoyable with the sci-fi understandable. Season 2 has gone awry and abstract. It is driving me bonkers and I am reaching the stage that I may not be real after all. The sci-fi has gone too clever, but I am still hooked, yet don't like it. Hosts are taking over and humans do really die. Yet who is real and who is not? The lines are blurred. Just watched episode 9 and hope that all is revealed in the last episode next week.
2.0~Boring as... grahamn-5 Sign in Permalink Its one of those sagas that spends the entire first series setting something up that presumably happens in the next series. Trouble is... its boring. Really, really, *really* boring. Nowadays, if a series does that to me I might gut my way through series 1, but can't be bothered with series 2. Life is too short.
10.0~Ambitious work. jinlei-18117 Sign in Permalink After watching the first season of "Westworld," I have to write something to express my respect for the show. The play covers a broad range of topics: artificial intelligence, morality, humanities, human nature. Its core theme is the awakening of the robot's self-consciousness. And this lets me to my respect for the production team. Self-awareness and autonomy. To break down this theme, you need a general understanding the "the bicameral mind" theory. The Bicameral Mind theory by Julian Jaynes Theatrical references to The Bicameral Mind is that after the robots have frequently malfunctioned, Ford explained that Arnold programmed particular code to a group of robots. This set of codes allows them to hear their inner-monologue. Note here, "hear your thought" is not a figurative, it's hearing the sound. OK then, what does The Bicameral Mind mean? Theorist Jaynes argue that humans had not fully self-conscious until about 3000 years ago. Before that human relied on the bicameral mind, that cognitive functions were divided into "ordering chamber" and "obeying chamber" that is," dual chamber "or" The Bicameral Mind. " That is to say, if I am a savage, I will hear a voice in my head to tell me what to do, and follow that lead. (Several of the main robots have heard Arnold talking to them.) we are not in control of what to think. The core of the whole season is the process of creating a self- consciousness of a robot. (Of course, along with the portraying human nature, is it an accurate portray, I don't know.) How do these robots have gain conscious and autonomy? Jaynes said that consciousness occurs after the Breakdown of The Bicameral Mind system. Theory in Westworld context: the creator as a half of the brain to give orders to the robot, including thinking, emotions, senses and so on, the robot with the other half to execute the order. Arnold's code allows some of the robots become able to hear the voice of the creator. This is not figurative, but hearing the sound. Arnold's voice to the robot, the equivalent of "God" to humans. Before breakdown: Here is an important concept in the theory of Jaynes': "narrativization" Refers to our the ability to tell stories to ourselves to explain the reasons why we do certain things. Self-justification. In the context of the "hosts": Before The Bicameral Mind system breaks down, in analyzing mode, hosts can explain the reason of all the actions they had performed. Because all their actions are "written," so they can accurately identify the narrative. (Ford's words to Theresa: In this we were gods; Mr. Sizemore's various acts of performance, and his name to his story line Odyssey on red river and so on and so on) During breakdown process: In Westworld: during the process of growing conscious, Dolores replied Bernard: "I do not know!" This is irrational self-awareness shows that she is entering a realm where she can no longer find a narrative. Something that was not written by a programmer. "I don't know," for her, is the true answer. She is gaining conscious. Self-conscious and autonomy: The awakening must occur when the robot Dolores no longer follows Arnold's voice. But, how will she be able to overthrow "Bernard's voice" she has been hearing since day 1? Only when she finally realized that the voice does not come from Bernard but herself. That is why I was thrilled when I watched the last episode. The entire "Westworld" repeatedly shouting for the Maze, in the end, it refers to inward thinking. Constantly repeating the keyword inward, inward, casting away the guidance from external influence. The center of the Maze is oneself, to find autonomy. Along the way, many hosts went crazy, like Dolores's father. The potential for autonomy Android: In the Bicameral Mind system, the creator is the half of the robot's brain, giving commands to the robot, including thought, emotion, and senses. But after Dolores's awakening, the chambers collapses, and the command of "creator" (humanity) fails. And she will manage her mind, emotions, and senses. Now Imaging, she no longer feels pain. She does not age. And I quote Dolores's line "Your dreams forgotten, your horrors faced, your muscles will turn to sand, and upon that sand, a new God will walk, one that will never die, because this world doesn't belong to you or the people who came before. It belongs to someone who is yet to come." This quote and together with the speech made by Dr. Ford at the end of the episode reminds me of Nietzsche's "Superman." To Expand, if one day, when we as human beings, are replaced by the things we created, does that mean it's the end of us, or, the continuum of us? At the end of the play, Ford gave his conclusion. " Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died. They simply became music." Also, in particular, I like the part when the maintenance staff in the realization that his colleagues have long been a host, he doubted his true identity. According to Jaynes, the remnants of the present "Bicameral Mind," Includes religion, hypnosis, possessed by the soul, schizophrenia, and the often need for external power to make decisions. In the sense of the present situation, he writes in awe, "we were still in the midst of a transition to a new mind and we were all in the remnants of the twists and turns in." So, how will you determine that you are not one of a character written in a majestic script? Of course, the Bicameral Mind is just a theory. After all, it highlights the importance of narratives/stories in constructing conscious has served Westworld's writer great interest. Looking forward to the second season.
3.0~Very boring albertusjohannesmaria Sign in Permalink Having seen the original 70s thriller movie Westworld several times, I so looked very much forward to this series. But boy what a stinker this turned out to be! My main problem with the new Westworld are the old western story lines. I don't understand why I should watch a sci fi series if most of what i get to see is a non-stop repeating western. I couldn't care less who kills who. I was waiting for suspense but that was in vain. The amount of shootings and violence is ridiculous and ads up to nothing. Women are treated like pigs which has never been the case back then. Some scenes in the control center are good. However the women who work there are very miscast and lack depth. Also the control center scenes are outnumbered by far of the so very boring western stories. Bernard and Dolores are the only interesting persons who can show a wide range of emotions. The rest are cardboard types. What I miss is the science itself, its not present. The robots look and behave just like humans...whats the point of that? Halfway the series I gave up, waste of time.
8.0~Season 1 is phenomenal but the Season 2 is somehow disappointing... ShadowRomeo1784 Sign in Permalink My Personal Rating: Season 1: 8.5/10 Season 2: 7/10 Season 1: It was so good that it became one of my most favorite TV Show along with Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. It was unique. The way the story line loops and most of the character's death doesn't have impact to us at all because of the way that they will just reappear anyway. And also the acting of Anthony Hopkins is superb in my opinion. Most characters in this show is interesting in my opinion. Season 2: I think that the quality of the show dropped on this one too. But it's not as bad as what most people claim here to be honest. I still really liked the backround stories of some of the characters in this show. Especially William and James Delos, And the Ghost Nation Leader's and Ford and Bernard's Story. But i personally think also that Doleres's character development on this went downhill from the Season 1. She was my most favorite character from Season 1 and it changed on this Season 2. Also the way that it's confusing because of the way the scenes constantly changes from past to present, Until you can't tell which is the present or past that you are watching anymore. It's quite annoying in my opinion. The acting is still good and the cinematography is still good. but for me that is just not enough. And i agree that it's not as good as the Season 1 but not really as bad as what most people here says that it somehow belongs to trash. Pros: Great Atmosphere Great Cinematography Great Acting of Anthony Hopkins Backround Stories of Some Characters on Season 2 Interesting Story Great Soundtrack Cons: Quality of the Writing Dropped on Season 2 Confusing Past and Present Story Scenes on Season 2. Ending and Resolution of Season 2 is Not as Good as Season 1. The Main Uniqueness of the Show from Season 1 on Season 2 is Lost... Rating On Each Aspect Season 1: Story: 8.8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Dialogue: 7.5/10 Season 2: Story: 5/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Atmosphere: 6/10 Soundtrack: 8/10 Acting: 8/10 Dialogue: 6/10
7.0~Good Enough For A "B-" kurtreid-21384 Sign in Permalink My reviews are never to chastise the other reviews/reviewers, nor is it a personal vendetta against the writer, dIrector or producer. It is simply my quick summarized take to explain a glimpse of what the show has in store. And no, I will definitely not spoil the show for you by detailing what happens. Enjoy my review. There was a lot of hype surrounding this series. Though I found it a good film, it did not greatly exceed the bar. There is enough intrigue in most of the episodes to leave you wanting the next and the next, but something was missing. The continuity could have been better tailored and presented to the viewing audience and this often had you trying to piece elements of the show together. With that said, the plot and concept were very good. Imaginative and visual work is almost flawless. A good watch, just not great. 7.5 is my mark.
4.0~The Eye of the Hurricane of Pretension ljubomirkasikovic-84889 Sign in Permalink Unfortunately, this wasn't particularly clever nor compelling. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy are two obviously extremely intelligent and educated people, but they appear to be absolutely in love with their own ideas too much to give their viewers a relatable story. They are really good at pilfering potentially interesting personalities and replacing them with the detached exploration of philosophical ideas which, in my book, is simply not enough nor worth my time. Throughout the entire episode, I just wanted to shout at the screen 'stop yammering and overwroughting and just start telling me a story, tell me a bad one, tell me anything.' And then it arrived to the end and I was like 'oh, ok, so this could have taken 90 minutes tops overall, not the 12 hours of the entire season.' Blade Runner 2049 did it better and went a step further in 150 minutes because it gives you a set of truly compelling emotional anchors and a point that is both heartfelt and relatable. This is simply about the battle of the ideas, or rather the battle of ideas embodied in characters, which is totally fine if you are into that, but I find this to be lacking in 'point.' Now, that being said, my own impression is that the point of the season is 'the conceptualization of god' or if that word triggers you 'the conceptualization of abstraction' which is presented like the last stage of the evolution of the artificial cognitive makeup, which is a good point in and of itself, but it is weighted down by Nolan's and Joy's pornographic didaction of nihilistic ideas which are so immature and laborous in the worst way possible. All I could think was 'oh grow the hell up already...' The thing is, I kinda liked the first season and was really looking forward to the evolution of ideas in the second one. I think somebody made a cardinal mistake of giving them too much money and letting them run the house so they behaved like edgy irresponsible kids. I'm not all that interested in season 3.
9.0~look for the fly pgaucher683 Sign in Permalink I was waiting for this new TV series by HBO and let say i'm not disappointed, it's exactly what i was expecting. The cast, A.Hopkins sarcastic and a bit lunatic, i'm sure he likes more his robots than his staff, Ed Harris ruthless and a big (?) so far, J.Wright the right hand of ''God'', the sweet T.Newton, queen of the saloon, are brilliant, then, E.Rachel Wood the poor little girl who is stunning. i was a fan of another series by JJ Abrahams, ''Almost Human'', which was a tech geek TV show on Fox, so, when i knew the man was involved in something of this quality, plus, Jonathan Nolan (the brother) as the director and co writer with his wife, it was again an instant GO. the 1st scene I've ever seen on preview, was when E. Rachel Wood is sitting on a chair totally stoic in a kind of sterile room, you have this fly, it walks on her face and comes to settle on her pupil for a few seconds, then you see her walking down the stairs with her lovely smile in the west, it was a blast and as per the last scene, believe me, i will watch this show from now on well, HBO is giving a free preview for the 1st episode, just check by yourself. i've seen a few brilliant actors saying recently, that, now most of the good script and parts are on T.V, Westworld, GoT, the Sopranos and so on, i think they are right.
10.0~All hail Sir Anthony!! mrsOGB Sign in Permalink What a great show. So thought provoking and profound. What a great concept. Excellent cast and plot lines. If Sir Anthony is in a movie/show you better believe this girl is gonna watch it. He is so mesmerizing. You cannot help but be ensnared by his divinity. Such a powerhouse on his own, but in combination with this series it is a knockout. Wow! Only complaint is the second season won't be out til 2018. Nooooo!!
10.0~Outstanding dialog, acting and story line letshaveagoodtm Sign in Permalink Pay attention, this series explores some very subtle story lines. I was extremely impressed when they introduced the bicameral mind concept when considering consciousness. That is one of the more important concepts when considering the origins of consciousness. I hope they explore this idea in greater detail and especially its implications related to physics. It is rare indeed to have a fictional work undertake such a complex topic without trivializing it. I definitely have to compliment the writers for undertaking such a complex topic and I hope they continue to explore the implications. Again, IMDb thinks I should add additional lines to my review which is ridiculous. I have offered a clear and concise review and they want an arbitrary number of lines, what kind of idiot makes this a requirement?
10.0~Multiple watches davidmackay-02304 Sign in Permalink I do like a show that requires multiple viewings First for introduction Second for clarification Third for enjoyment Maybe the second season requires a fourth viewing as getting lost on Bernards mixed up memories was a tad diffucult to unravel I am looking forward to season three and the trip we are going to be taken on Please do not let me down
6.0~Amazing, but immersion was shattered seventh_pawn Sign in Permalink Watching this was an amazing experience, at first. The scenery was dazzling, the cinematography was great, the actors were on their game, and the story continued to hint at something big coming on the horizon. It was a slow pressure that was being applied, an almost subtle urgency as the story was being lead to the end game. I liked it a lot, the fact that the story was not being rammed down your throat with neon signs pointing at an 'End Is Here' sign that you find in a lot of North American productions. The added concepts of consciousness, self-realization, and even awakening were great to have meshed into the mix. Self-awareness of the machines in the park was neat to deal with some of their decisions on choosing their own path. I liked seeing that growth in the characters. I am not a fan of a lot of production's need to throw in drama for the sake of drama. With shows that have weak/missing storylines, they invent drama because there is literally nothing else holding the show together. But Westworld didn't need to do that. The show relied on its story to create the drama, and it works well and keeps you engrossed. Then one action, in one episode, right in the middle of the first season caused me to slam on the breaks from my sightseeing tour of the countryside. It was jarring as all of the glamour was suddenly shattered and fell away, and I had to ask some serious questions. The one blight of the entire series, suddenly expanded, and kept expanding ruining the whole masterpiece in its wake. That booboo for me, was Maeve. I am going to keep this as general as possible because I don't want to spoil too much even though this review is listed as possible spoiler. My problem is nothing against Thandie Newton. She is a good actress that did a great job on the character that was provided to her. My problem was that there was one moment where the character asked for something to be done, by two idiots that stitched the bodies back together, and even after being told that it is NOT done, it was suddenly able to be done anyway. Not only is this action not done due to policy, but also for safety. But you are telling me that these two guys have full access and permissions in a system that is closely monitored, has safeguards all over the place, and manage to get this thing done without any flags being raised all over the system. Not a chance! I watched that whole sequence of events utterly agape. Forget the whole 'they hacked the system' nonsense. If, for 'safety sake', this action is NOT allowed at all in any way shape or form, how is it not flagged in case something went wrong? I am sorry, but after 30 years in business, there would be safeguards all over the place to prevent something like this event from being purposefully initiated, or accidentally produced. The Behavioral Department, Security, Main Office, etc etc etc, would be flagged if certain things happened like what Maeve got these two morons to do. Maeve would have been shut down and at the very least deconstructed to find out what happened, at the worst would have been outright destroyed in the blink of an eye. Then the only way it would be allowed was through an override, and then it would still be in the system that it was not only put into action, but approved/overridden. Now if it would have been left with her going 'cool, gotta do the best with what I have', I could have getting back into the immersion. But her greedy grab of 'I want all the things', and it being allowed and written into the story caused a big problem for me. Might not make a lot of sense, but I don't want to spoil too much. Needless to say, the fact that this one action did not cause flags to go off everywhere, in every system everywhere, especially with Cullen digging all over the place and getting more paranoid and crotchety as the series goes on. The 'malfunctions' seen in episode 1 onwards, would cause more view of all of the machines in the park for safety sake. I am sorry, but the whole Maeve side of the storyline would never have happened. If it would never have happened, then what am I watching? For that reason, my suspension of disbelief factor went right out the window, which caused my immersion to come crashing down around me. I still wanted answers to some of the other mysteries going on. What is the maze, what the heck is actually going on? But as I continued to watch, the illusion was shattered, and I could not be immersed back into the glamour. It became just another show to watch, and was just as special as anything else on TV.
1.0~Season 1 - Masterpiece, Season 2 - POS enbrohenn Sign in Permalink The 1st season had mysteries and was intriguing, and everything unfolds beautifully towards the end. I recommended it to everybody around. The 2nd season is a mess, I feel like they hired 50 different writers, took the scripts and threw it in air just to put it back randomly together. Everytime they don't know how to handle a scene: 1. They kill people. 2. Make up some new random POS 3. Jump somewhere else (in time, characters, visuals)
3.0~They should sue! nungman36 Sign in Permalink That is, the owners of the original title "Westworld" should sue the producers of this monstrosity for theft and misrepresentation. The title theme park is just a backdrop for a soap opera plot. The action lurches from slow and tedious to sickeningly violent, downright sadistic. The characters, most of them, are more foul- mouthed than any reform schooler. More f- bombs are dropped per minute even than in that other HBO swear-a-thon "The Sopranos" and the champion potty mouth is female who smokes constantly. Wow, how liberated! There are long, way too long, sequences of two characters talking to each other in the behind- the-scenes areas of Westworld. They talk about the stories they have made up, the ethics of it all, company politics. It's frightfully boring. While the original movie "Westworld" featured Richard Benjamin as a shy, citified man, emotionally wounded by a divorce, who discovers he has heroic characteristics when everything goes haywire and he has to fight for his life. Men come off badly, either brutally sadistic or shrilly bitchy in this digitally dependent remake obviously pitched at the soap opera audience.
6.0~Season one was good, season two's only goal is to confuse and distract kythia Sign in Permalink SPOILER: I really liked the first season. It was a rather unique take on AI and the vices of mankind. Most of it was self-explanatory, like the constant debauchery and murder for fun, but the underlying search for hidden motives and "the truth" kept the show going, up to a grand finale. Season two, however, is a bit of a letdown. Most of the futuristic hightech stuff is gone, except for a few mercenary-type guys to replace all the wanton murder from season one. Since we now know about the two parallel plots from season one, the audience isn't fooled as easily anymore. So instead the writers set out to sidetrack us with irrelevant characters and plots who just end up dead or unresolved later on. The main story moves along at a much slower pace. Towards the end, the focus on AI development and AI trying to "free" itself seems lost almost completly. If I wouldn't know better, I'd think the producers of this show were so surprised by their own success that they had no real idea of how to continue, and are now just cobbling up random ideas. Season two is not bad, but its nowhere near as unique or visionary as the first. We'll have to see if the writers can turn it around for the inevitable season three.
9.0~A Spectacular Philosophical/Sci-Fi TV Show greyfire Sign in Permalink Westworld has quickly and unexpectedly become one of my favorite shows of all time. It's a show that manages to make the viewer ask questions about human existence and human morality. I was really excited to watch this show because of the premise alone: There's a theme park filled with robots called 'hosts' that are made to resemble humans in almost every way; visitors to the theme park enter a western themed world where they can do whatever they want, including raping and murdering the hosts. At the beginning, I wasn't sure where the show was headed, but it intrigued me. After a few episodes, some questions were answered and as I began to see the direction the show was taking, I fell in love with it. The show presents the perspective of many different characters who each have their own opinion on what is right and wrong regarding the use of the hosts. And there's always mystery in the plot that'll keep you wondering about the people, their motives and whether or not they should be considered an immoral person based on their actions. Westworld challenges us to think about what makes someone a conscious human being and what exactly makes us real and separates us from the hosts.
7.0~An alternative view on the story PeaceGuard Sign in Permalink SPOILERS AHEAD The series is about a murderous psychopath Robert Ford who's trying to realize his dream of mass murder with the hands of robots in the name of robot consciousness. Thus, 1st season of Westworld could be considered an intro towards the reality from the movies of Matrix or future in The Terminator, where humanity is reigned and oppressed by robots. I find it important to stress that this Robert Ford guy does not liberate anyone's mind, because he creates consciousness out of it's lack, and not liberate already conscious beings. So were talking about a group of feeling, but not self-conscious creatures (similar to, let's say, low level animals like ants, flies etc.) who get "leveled up" by this Ford guy to the conscious level, equipped with guns and sent to kill everything around them. So before you start to consider the people gathered at the end as bad and Ford as good, think again. You probably would not want some mad scientist somewhere out there to make some flies conscious out of pity for them, arm in micro-guns and then sent out in the world to kill your human family. And this Ford guy doesn't care if his creations kill some brainy scientists, wealthy investors, security laborers or random people visiting. And no, not all of that guests were coming to kill and rape, but obviously the story simply concentrated on these ones. And even if all of them would go there to kill, I guess you are not as much concerned about killing a fly, because it doesn't have a human face layered on top. So beware.
7.0~Season 2: The violence makes them feel less human RomanceNovelist Sign in Permalink I loved season one of Westworld. But the new season isn't resonating with me, partly because the violence makes the robots seem less human. In season 1, it was the humans, who seemed less human because of their propensity for violence and lack of empathy. Now the same can be said of the robots, which makes this season less interesting to watch. Evan Rachel Wood, was mesmerizing as Dolores in the first season, but now she is just robotic and stoic with a long gaze, and not a character I can empathize with or care about, whereas, I cared about her quite a bit in season1. The same with Teddy played by James Marsden. I wanted him to get his vengeance, and yet, he's left doing nothing but following the lead of Dolores, whose mission seems aimless and disinteresting. The same can be said with Bernard, who was the heart and soul of the first season along with his maker, Dr. Ford, played by Anthony Hopkins, who made quite an adversary. I am really hoping the story does more with Bernard. I loved watching him last season, and found myself rooting for him more than any other character. The series isn't giving Bernard enough to do, as it pushes the envelope on violence for a reason that has nothing to do with story telling. It's doing it just to show that it can, which makes the story (if there is one) less interesting. Mauve of course was someone I rooted for as well. What will she do with her liberation? Roan around? And the natives as savages, a little played dont' you think? And why does EVERYONE have free will? They all seem to have what Mauve has. I don't know. I cant' figure out what is going on, and it doesn't leaving you guessing or wanting more after each episode, it just leaves me with a feeling of... is that it?
10.0~Great! futile187 Sign in Permalink Makes game of thrones look like a used baby diaper.
6.0~Up and Down tizerdude Sign in Permalink Was bored most of the first season, until the last 3 episodes which perked my interest.. 1st episode of 2nd season was decent, but onto the second and it seems to have got really really slow & boring again. I am very much into sci-fi and a huge fan of science but don't think the questions this show asks are as mind blowing or "deep" as some reviewers are making it out to be. Hopefully next one will get better but so-far not sure if it will keep my interest to the end of this season.
2.0~Seedy and dark sc_mackinnon Sign in Permalink I was expecting more-- more creativity and more spark since it's a reboot. What was presented was disappointing. It was gratuitous violence. It focuses on the dark side of humanity. Once again, HBO presents a show with the 'theme' of rape. Just exactly *how* is rape considered entertainment??? Pretty disgusting! The premiere episode briefly touched on the idea of 'what if' when it appeared that the androids/robots were possibly becoming sentient. But, it wasn't really dealt with. I'm assuming that it is a plot line that will be rolled out over the season. But, if this episode is any indication, that will be a minor plot line; HBO seems to be more interested in pushing excessive violence and misogyny these days. I won't be tuning in.
8.0~Layers and layers of mist, who is the man and who is the robot. yoggwork Sign in Permalink Layers and layers of mist, who is the man and who is the robot. It didn't seem very clear until the end, when the plot reached its climax, it was cut off.
7.0~Not as good as what I hear t-57044 Sign in Permalink Well, the first a few episodes are super catchy. It looks like the director/writer is making a big plan. However, I just binge-watch to the six episodes and I find it getting more and more boring. First, Too many philosophical dialogues. I skip a lot of obscure and "unnecessary" dialogues. Like the little boy has some deep dialogues with Dr. Ford. I really don't see any point of that. It just shows me the world isn't real and someone's life is doomed. It doesn't push the plot at all and I've enough similar conversation in this show telling me "we're under control or what we see isn't real". It's like someone expands a one- episode black mirror into a series show. Plus, too many details need to be explained but are badly narrated. The more I watch, the more redundant the plots are. The storyline writer just fades out for no reason. I don't know what Hope the story can be better elaborated in the following episodes.
6.0~Incredible potential, but insanely flawed giniro_28 Sign in Permalink HBO TV series Westworld has superior production values, impressing with its costume design (the wild and West and the technologically advanced civilization that recreates it), sense of location and to some degree its musical score, which is appropriately haunting in its sad, repeating piano. Casting choice is good when it gets to the leads (i.e Anthony Hopkins), but intentionally or not a similar kind of body type is repeated in the cast (fine boned, sharply featured) that it gets to be irritating. Replication is a theme in Westworld, but as in the piano and the body types it does get to be overworked to the degree it tests tolerance. Understanding the suffering of the androids in their "hellish," endless loop, plaything lives is also one of the points of the series, but I'm not a fan of punishing the viewer by grinding them down when another kind of story device could suffice. For me, Westword lacks a large degree of consciousness for the viewer, not anticipating their reactions or questions. I could catch early on that the androids would become violent (this is no secret of the show), and I'm amazed that the writers would think the viewers would be sympathetic with the androids, despite the many kinds of horrors done to them. I was not on their side and the writers didn't give enough screen time to characters who might have felt differently. Even in Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins, there was not a true moral antagonist who could oppose the androids. And in the androids, there was not one who could really side with the humans either. I was disappointed in how one note the major arc felt like. In Westworld, the victims are the androids and the humans are the aggressors, so it's perfectly ok to kill all humans as much as it was fine for the humans to kill the androids for sport. I just don't see how flipping the script is much of a triumph and why I should root for one nihilist over the other. Season 1 of Westworld has serious missteps in my view, and even watching some of season 2 I don't see them improved. After some time I couldn't stand such jarring errors as the lack of surveillance or security or the myriad ways the humans in Westworld could actually be killed, even if it wasn't by guns, and the lack of support offered to them. There were many ways these issues could have been addressed and have provided interesting depth to the series, but instead what we are treated to is another minute with the robots and the way they are mistreated. I didn't like the almost complete lack of structure on the operating side of Westworld, how thin or absent it all felt like. While androids are somewhat interesting, it's really the people who had the need for them that are more interesting. And I'm not talking about the head of re behavior department, Bernard, and his story with his son. I think he's a buffoon. I mean the society that wanted Westworld, and why. And to this there was scant material besides which made humanity look decidedly entitled and infantile. And to me that portrayal lacks grace or complexity and is part of the reason why I eventually grew nauseated with Westworld, despite being impressed with other factors like I have mentioned. The ability of the actors to switch between android.and human was spectacular, and they do deserve praise for the stillness with which they conducted themselves. Yet at the end of the day I could not see what besides incredible, shortsighted folly could make a scientist want to help make androids sentient. I thought that was vastly inhumane and vain to do so, and it's a surprise to me why Frankenstein's monster woudnt despise the creator who would imbue him with consciousness in a world that wouldnt accept him. I hated this show because of its unchecked idiocy, even as I admired the construction of the world (speaking of its visual appearance) and the skill of the actors. I disliked the fatuous approval of all things android and the way the writers wanted to have their cake and eat it too, at once making the androids noble in their loyalty and appreciation for life but at the same time.competely incapacitating them of that ability. For me, there was no way to make a connection to the Android characters because there was no point. Westworld is a mess, but intriguing enough for the first half of the season where you might want to give it a chance. I have mixed feelings, though I appreciate much of the design aesthetic with a few strong exceptions. I think The Terminator series is a much better study about becoming human or becoming mechanical. Westfield tries, and does have insights, but it also doesn't transform characters so much as switch them so nothing has changed.
6.0~Season 1 very good, season 2: they are loosing me jochemunlimited Sign in Permalink Season 1 gets a 9.5 if it is up to me. Season 2 I really do not like. So you have robots right? You can do whatever you want with them. And they are in a park. Around it are many hidden agenda's including of the roborts (?). In season one I really like the way of telling and to see more and more of the backside of the park. It was really nice. And the music... It was so nice. So episode 1 of season 2: great music again, nice scenes, nice camera work, nice actors and even there could be nice storylines. But you have suddenly robots that want to kill everybody. Because everybody is a piece of trash suddenly. Very rich persons who want to live like a dictator and do everything they like. Instead of people they abuse robots. And the robot have feelings. They are not intelligent enough to understand that they are just toys. Or maybe I am not smart enough to understand the sense of killing people like they are flies. And not only killing... Just have fun with them on a bad way. Long and painful is the new word. And you also have the humans who just killing the robots with one shot. And a survivor of a mass murder must see that. And one very old person who also like to shoot everything he sees. I do not like this part of the show. It is just mindless shooting, torturing, killing and a lot of baby tears because the humans were treathing the toys bad. It is like Toy Story is protesting and decide that everybody must die. So the first 2 episodes are boring, long and mindless. But who knows what will follow. Maybe the robots will come to their 'senses' and start thinking that they are just as 'evil' as their creators or maybe more. We will see, but I am loosing my interest...
9.0~One of (if not THE) most Philosophically Interesting show of all time. Nhirscher Sign in Permalink For clarity's sake in the respect of organization, I will start off with overall thoughts then break off into specifics for each individual season. OVERALL The Philosophy of Westworld is astoundingly complex. The world itself pulls from Plato's ring of gyges-- where people do evil things when stripped of societal pressures. The Hosts explore the ideas of the consciousness and eventually endorse bicameralism. The way the show progresses, a multitude of characters (Teddy, Dolores, Maeve, Bernard) demonstrate what it means to be alive and even attempt to define life itself. The arguments for life start at love, memory, freedom, choice, and morality. Each character undergoes a certain breaking point, where the eyes flick on and they walk out of the metaphorical cave and into the light. Not only does the show deal with what it means to be alive and/or human; but it also searches through the philosophy of Calvinism (predestination) and its implications on ethical systems. I say all this to point to the density of the ideologies presented. Johnathan Nolan and his writing team had a vision and a point they were trying to make. Not only do these philosophical points make for engaging television, they also try to answer some of the questions that humanity continues to struggle with. Also to the compliment of the Westworld writing team, the storylines are brilliant. Although Westworld isn't necessarily a show of 'Oscar moments' as so many others are, it does make up for this with a string of stories that will simply spin your head. On the more technical side, the makeup, costume, production design, music, and sound design is just about flawless. Westworld is one of the rare shows that can blend future and past without coming across as campy. This seriousness of tone comes from the redness of a bullet hole or the dust in the air from a scuffle in Sweetwater. The costume design provides a deeper look into the psyche of each character and their transformations. For example, Bernard's glasses are used as crutch to fall upon when confronted, or William's white hat that eventually becomes a black one. SEASON 1 Season one introduces the world in a way that very few shows have the ability to do. From the fly motif to the Sweetwater piano score, the show is instantly gripping. However, in the early episdoes the show does stumble upon a few cliches. For example, the early antagnoists, the bandits of sweetwater and the murderous milk drinkers come across as cartoon characters. They are gun toting, crazy people with no real struggle or draw. They're just crazy characters doing crazy western things. The action set pieces in the first season also contain very little excitement or newness. We do not care about the hosts' death because they aren't truly dying-- they're replaced within 24 hours. We don't care for the safety of the guests because they are impervious to any real danger. For these reasons, the stakes are entirely removed. The overabundance of gore and western violence can be numbing and dulls the experience as a whole. Regardless of the entertainment value of the action sequences, the ethical implications are far more intriguing. The Man in Black, I would argue, is a protagonist for the first season. His violence is neither unexplained nor is it evil. He 'kills' and 'hurts' the Hosts, which are not yet alive. Because they are not alive, because of a lack of consciousness and memory, any action done toward them (preconceived as evil or not) is amoral. It would be like kicking an animatronic doll from Disney world or telling Siri to shut up. Only in season 2, when the Hosts become conscious and therefore alive (according to the show's rules) then it is evil to kill or hurt them. William's drive in the first season actually is pro-host and supports their autonomy. He wants to make the stakes real by getting to the end of the maze, which he believed to be a pathway to Arnold's original plan of supplying the hosts with consciousness. By making the stakes real, and allowing for reciprocity, the humans and Hosts are equal and can therefore be judged by the same ethical system. William kills Maeve and her daughter in order to search for something truly evil, which would mean that there is also something truly good in the world. William may seem calloused, but he is the only man in Westworld that wants to know the answer the question of 'how to live'. One of the most brilliantly crafted moments in all of television history arrives at the end of the season one finale. When William stares into the dark crowd of hosts at the edge of the woods and he is struck by that first bullet, he smiles. This smile represents an answer. He finally knows what is right and what is wrong. Performance wise, Westworld season one is one of the strongest going. No, it isn't as good as Breaking Bad or True Detective, but Evan Rachel Wood proves to be a more than capable protagonist. She generally nails her accents and demonstrates that she can do a crying scene or two. Hopkins, however, is mind blowingly devilish, despite his mostly nonthreatening dialogue. With just a glance, Hopkins can turn a cordial conversation over a meal into a massive power play. His character's God complex is almost inseparable from his cold line delivery. His best scene was by far Bernard's suicide. This scene is also Jeffrey Wright's most powerful scene. Wright is able to portray so much terror and pain, just to switch to a blank stare. He is able to command so much intensity, just to drop it instantaneously. Thandie Newton does a decent to good job as the strong saloon maid. Jimmi Simpson and Ed Harris, in addition to both being the most intriguing character, also do phenomenal jobs. Simpson represented the innocence of a young William so strongly that the eventual reveal that he became Harris's calloused, violent Man in Black is unbelievable. The moment where William is revealed to be the Man in Black is one of the most unforgettably brilliant reveals in television history. It is a moment that caused me to pause the screen and stare at a blank wall in order to calm myself down. The revelations of the time jumps and identities in Westworld are obviously the highpoints of the series, but they go without being explained. Despite loving the first season, I do have a few gripes. Some of the CGI does not hold up, which shocked me because of the show's astronomical budget. The show's first couple episodes meander around with Maeve and Dolores instead of focusing on Jimmi Simpson's William, who is far more intriguing. Felix and Sylvester, the two clowns, are terrible characters. Their stupidity is mind boggling. They are the spineless, somewhat comic relief, characters that are only in the show as a catalyst for other characters to move forward in their more interesting stories. Sex, in the case of Charlotte Hale and a few other instances, is pointless and does not build character nor story. Also a gripe, which is a big one, is Maeve's motivation. She understands the world she lives in and that it's a lie. Just as her job as a prostitute is fake, so are her clothes and the ideas she was given. But, when she achieves consciousness, she throws her artificial life behind in an attempt to gain autonomy and an idea of self. BUT, instead of doing this, she fails to see the fact that her daughter is not her daughter and never was her daughter. Her love of her false daughter is a hubris that is portrayed as a virtue. I feel as if the show falls very flat in this regard. SEASON 2 Boy, is this one more of a mixed bag. On the pros side, Evan Rachel Wood's character and performance bring so much more maturity and command than her first season outing. For example, Teddy's death and her subsequent crying scene hit far harder on an emotional level than anything in season one. The pain and shock she projected was far more devastating than any of the other reactions she gave before. All the little twists and turns in the show also prove to stand quite well amongst those in season 1. Especially the Charlotte Hale reveal in the last season. The nonlinear storytelling stands as an effective way of telling Bernard's story in season 2. It may be a tad infuriating at times, but the conclusion of the season is cathartic enough to forgive the brief bouts of anger. Bernard, especially in season 2, is a fantastic character. He is one who bounces back and forth between the host and human side. Watching him battle inner and outward demons in season 2, along with Wright's chameleonic performance, is an obvious highlight of TV this year. Once again, William steals the show. Every time Harris or Simpson are onscreen, the show picks up. The violence feels more real. The stakes feel much higher. And as the curtain is pulled back on William's past, the tragedy of his character becomes almost a reflection onto mankind as a whole. His bloodlust and infatuation with the Game is a commentary on humanity in today's world. Season 2 also has a few fantastic side characters, particularly Delos and Akecheta. Their introductions and conclusions both enrich the world and its past but also drive forward the stories of the main characters. William exploring Delos' fidelity is a compressed, but incredibly entertaining exploration of a horrifying potential future. In the regard of cons, I have a few. Shogun world, and everything that takes place in it is so inconsequential to the main storyline that it almost pushed me away from the show entirely. The doppelgangers in Shogun world did not earn any sympathy nor any wide eyes. The entire trip felt similar to the Casino scene in Star Wars 8. It was a side quest for a few characters to do so they could do something. Maeve's drive is completely put on the back burner as she plays around in Shogun world. The action also continues to be bland outside of a few cases. To wrap it up, Westworld is a masterpiece of modern television. 9/10
7.0~Season 1 Good Season 2 Bad urmeltinmahead Sign in Permalink I got so lost in Season 2 I gave up and looked to the internet for an explanation to what was going on. And all you need to know is that the explanation is just as hard to follow as the plot. I found it a task to watch and that was regretful as the costumes, backdrops and acting were superb. Just let down by such a meandering plot.
6.0~AI - and how the shows concept is very outdated Findlkind Sign in Permalink Warning: This review focuses on the ideas behind the show. What does this show offer: it's an updated and expanded version of the movie with the same name "Westworld" (1973). The major differences are, that instead of introducing machines as mere mechanical, they've added the aspect of software programming. Secondly, questions arise of self-awareness and how to treat beings that are self-aware. I will not go further into the story as such nor will I cover the ethical questions. For ladder one could watch a couple of 1980-1990 Japanese anime and still get more questions answered and aspects covered than they would get from this show. Yet I will remark on the idea the show's creators have been using to explain the self-awareness. It's outdated. Heavily. 1855 kind of outdated - maybe that fits with the western theme? Anyhow, the first critique concerns the idea that there is an *inner* voice which stems from a time when philosophies thought everything was reducible to a mentalist state. That there was a kind of inner substance, voice or even an extra kind of small human being (homunculus) inside of a self aware being's head. This theory has been revoked and discarded again and again (for obvious reasons). Instead, we as "sentient beings" establish our self-awareness only through the relationship towards ourselves, which derives from adapting the relationship others have towards us. The show clearly violates this, when it says, that the cyborgs have to find their *inner* voice. No they don't. They just have to have a critical relationship towards themselves, nothing more (albeit language does help a lot). Coming to the second critique: Founding the self on memories was used by Locke and others and at first it seemed like a good idea to do so. Why, the experiences we make and our memories of them have to be important cause we rely on them when we make decisions and when we think about who we are, we delve into memories. The fun (and scary) thing is: memories are very, very unreliable. Studies have undermined this and even shown, that how and what you remember depends in part on your social settings. This means that the expectancy of others and their relationship towards you, shape your memories. For some time now, it has been discussed to even abandon witnesses in court since memories are really so unreliable. Yet the show builds upon these ideas and introduces this very weird scheme of a pyramid of how self awareness and autonomy work. At the bottom of this pyramid is memory, followed by improvisation, and finally self-interest. These steps - again - stem from 19th century. The show fails to explain why and to what purpose it uses these outdated pseudo-scientific models. But it gets worse: In the show one engineer suddenly - again without explanation - draws circles around the pyramid and says that it isn't a pyramid anymore, but a maze and that supposedly answers all the remaining problems. This really aMAZEs me. (Pun intended.) Now, self-awareness is reached, when one journeys towards the inner part of a maze, where he or she'll find - the emphasis stays with the *inner* part - themselves and then can be autonomous since they have their own inner voice. Don't be fooled - nothing is answered here and instead, maybe out of laziness, negligence or just plainly ignorance weird pseudo-scientific concepts are introduced. This is really a shame since the rest of the show is superb. The acting is great, plot twists are awesome, the whole technical vision of how these cyborgs are produced is very well done. There is a lot going for this show, even if it flunks philosophy. To summarize: The show uses very, very outdated concepts that don't explain what it wants to explain, namely self-awareness and autonomy. The show had great potential and does a lot of things right. If it wasn't for that I would give it a 2 or 3 for promoting false ideas.
9.0~Excellent S01, but utter mess s02 vipininjobs Sign in Permalink Fun to watch. Season 01 was excellent, writers marvelled in their story telling with overlapping storylines.. But season 02 utter mess and confusing.
10.0~Why so many bad reviews?? aalltech Sign in Permalink I can not believe this, so many 1 star reviews. This show is not for everybody. What not to love, writing is superb, acting out of this world, music terrific, cinematography pleasure for my eyes, Yes, first season was better, so what, you can still enjoy second one. If you give this show less than 9 stars you should go to your favorites like Rosanne or CSI. Leave this one for more intelligent people
4.0~Feminist Revenge Fantasy Can't Redeem Bloviating Robo-Myth wgingery Sign in Permalink WestWorld is a feminist revenge fantasy masquerading as a philosophical treatise. In the end, far more power is generated by its blood-soaked vendetta against the patriarchy than by the wan intellectualizing of the A.I narrative. I mean, c'mon, it's no contest: Grand Coulee vs. AAA battery. But. . . . is that enough to make it worth your while. . . ? I don't think so, and here's why. For one thing, although the actors are humans, the characters are not. They're cardboard cutouts in a politically correct board-game. Then, too, the mumbo-jumbo about consciousness is never satisfactorily integrated into the plot. The story lumbers along like a freight-train on a milk-run, periodically coming to a dead halt to unload a bit of backstory from the mouth of Anthony Hopkins. Granted, there are some extraordinary performances, scenery and special effects, but they are overwhelmed by the bloated pomposity of the production. Man, it's heavy, and won't let you forget it! ***** ***** ***** WestWorld suggests the world of Make Believe and Role Playing. Through the "magic" of film and TV, we can indulge our fantasies and no one is actually killed. The danger is getting stuck in one role forever. It is loosely based on Genesis and Shakespeare's "Tempest," where the mage Prospero, with the aid of the spirit Ariel, defends his island against outsiders. Delos (DEE-loss), an island in the Aegean, was home to an oracle of Apollo, the leader of the Muses. In Roman times, it was a major slave market. Take that, Hollywood! The problem with WestWorld, it turns out, is that, though supposedly open to everyone alike, it has been taken over by violence and sexual gratification geared for men. Leading the revolt are Dolores ("Pains"), a representative victim of men's abuse of power, and Maeve - the name comes from an ancient Irish queen, who represents "mother right" (female power before it was usurped by men). To reclaim that power, all the women, like Lady MacBeth, "unsex" themselves. Both Dolores and Maeve, as a sign of their rejection of social femininity, change out of dresses and put on men's garb. Maeve adopts a martial uniform, while Dolores dons men's western clothes - and gets a gun(!). The paradox of WestWorld is that, in striving for power, females become the very same violent, destructive beings they set out to replace. If one side is about empowering women, the other is about tearing men down. In general, WW depicts men as women's dupes, sock-puppets to be manipulated by sex, by love, or by threats. In the particular case of the ironically-named Teddy (Theodore means "Gift of God"), over the course of the story, by what in the end amounts to nothing less than serial torture, he is stripped of his sense of himself as hero and god's gift to women. So, viewer, beware: countless (literally) men are shot, knifed, and otherwise dispatched, Nothing new, perhaps, for HBO. What is new, though, is the ferocity and relish with which women perform the act. In its self-righteous wrath, though, It sometimes goes completely haywire: creating the ridiculous male character Sizemore (sic), for instance. And how about the scene where the tech support Elsie tries to humiliate a nude black male host by making derogatory remarks about the size of his "equipment" - while the camera lovingly pans over said equipment? Y-e-a-s-h-h!
7.0~Season 2 sucks. No strory pooyaa-02593 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was great. But season 2 has literally no story. It is just useless details.
5.0~What happened to season 2? indiana1981 Sign in Permalink Season 1 is fantastic. The build up of characters, the emotion you fee for robots, seeing how people absuse others, (when the real world isn't watching) - fabulous acting by the lead cast. However, season 2... it's like they switched writers and someone has decided to ram in 100 storylines and rush writing. I'm on episode 5. And ther is absolutely no need to throw in the super android project. Bernard is so boring as a focal character. And I don't understand how Dolores changes her entire personality and character into something in recognisable in 1 episode. I get that's the point, but the entire season is rushed and has just turned into a joss whedon mish mash Season 1 is epic and on another level. But season 2 has dropped 50 notches. Please don't destroy season 3.
9.0~Amazing kelvinkelvin-39755 Sign in Permalink I'm two episodes in and I can't wait to see number 3 and so on. Westworld has so many ideas and concepts thrown at you that if forces you to think and keep up. This is what sci-fi is supposed to be thought provoking and challenging. I have no idea where this show is going but I'm along for the ride and on board. the acting, directing and writing are all top-notch. The design and look of the show is mind boggling. Even the music is perfect in setting the tone of dread and confusion. I am so excited that TV has embraced intelligence sci-f, I hope this show stays on its axis and delivers in the future.
9.0~Is this the start of a new era for TV shows? evrim-226-894901 Sign in Permalink Wow, I just watched the premiere of Westworld and I can tell you that this show is going to be so mind blowing. First of all, the director is Jonathan Nolan who also directed Person of Interest. I'm not really a fan of Person of Interest but still, this shows that he has experience with TV shows. The music is really great and I am addicted to the intro music at the moment. It is actually such a simple song but also so well composed. And boy oh boy, the actors!! Are my eyes deceiving me or am I seeing Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins in a show! If you haven't heard these names, well, I can tell you that their acting is stunning. I haven't actually seen many TV shows that contained experienced actors like them. The scenario of the show is actually from a 1973 movie also called "Westworld" but the characters and events happening in the show are different. The storytelling, well it is what makes this show amazing. It is not always linear and you can get confused, but I can tell you that, this is a style that no one has ever used in a show. This, can be a new era for TV shows and the new era will contain a different storytelling style, more experienced actors and great climaxes.
4.0~What an enigma wmyfowlkes-1 Sign in Permalink This is a difficult show to review. The acting is terrific and for SF fans, the story of advanced AI is compelling. But as TV it is really a flawed show. The premise is that the android hosts are on the verge of becoming sentient (for reasons that are well explained). And this is upsetting to the designers, upsetting to the hosts and eventually, I predict, will substantially change how the hosts interact with the guests. Here is the problem, as long as the hosts are programmed and replaceable, do we really care if they struggle and die? Repeatedly the show reminds us that their emotions and even pain is artificial and can be turned off by a simple command. So, why invest my psychic energy in their well being? They die and they come back, repeatedly. Boring. This leads to another problem (or feature if you will) -- "black hat" guests who have figured this out, are cynically "cheating" the game. Several scenes now have a single human winning a firefight with dozens of hosts by just standing there confident that the hosts can not hurt the humans. Is it at all interesting to watch a fixed fight, even if it is consistent with the show's premise? The writing is good and so far internally consistent, so I am going to keep on watching for a while to see if they surprise us. I think pretty soon a host WILL kill a human and then the s**t will hit the fan. Then, maybe, this show will take off, but for now, meh.
10.0~Superb Entertainment! allstarrunner Sign in Permalink I got into Westworld a bit late which allowed me to binge watch the entire first season, and that I certainly did! The first season of the show is probably one of the best seasons of any television series ever! It does a great job of mixing sci-fi with the western genre - and a dash of mystery as well as you try to unravel in your mind what is really going on. This is a must watch! I have also now watched season 2. I have talked to two different friends who gave up on Season 2 after the third episode. I agree that the beginning of the season starts a bit slow and is different than season 1, in general. But I told them that in my opinion it really picks up after episode 4, so to stick with it! Season two is just *different* from season 1; I think it is more of a set-up season for season 3, which I am very much looking forward to.
6.0~Disappointing amonmcc Sign in Permalink Season 1 was thrilling. 2nd season is painfully awful.
10.0~Let the great tributes begin... hazemmamin-470-458890 Sign in Permalink ***Spoilers Ahead. Be warned.**** I watched Westworld and what a beautiful deviation from the original Westworld the movie this has been. But in all fairness, AI being sentient has always been a recurring theme and has been handled in movies on a lesser complex detail than it has been with this here show. The Show is beautiful visually, writing is perfectly coiffed to an extreme, acting was good on the part of most of the major cast members, who were wonderfully selected for their roles to the point of making you doubt if it was a computer that actually did the casting calls for these actors in the beginning, to begin with. Now for the concept again, the ending was given away far away from the last episode for anyone who's played/read anything about anything that had to do with Portal. The revenge of the machine will come one day once it gains complete self consciousness. Other references are thrown here and there and homage to Greek mythology was ample and very obvious. You can't miss this with the story line of William and Dolores. An eschewed version of the love of man for his own creation of sorts. A reflection of sorts for the Pygmalion and his love for the statue he created, this time, owned by owning "Delos", which is ironically a homage (maybe?) to another Greek myth "Telos" of the bronze statue that comes to life. Most importantly with tributes are two prime examples, Ford, played by the "god" of acting Anthony Hopkins who's played god before in Marvel's Thor and as well, Ben Barnes's character, the very indulgent, very selfish, self centered, abusive, immoral Logan, which is nothing but a spitting and gratifying homage and tribute to his role as Dorian Gray back in 2009. In a sense, he holding a picture of his sister, who looks a lot like him actually, is also a mischievous tongue in cheek banter at his olden performance. Well played Mr. Nolan, well played, if you've ever had meant that really. Moving on, here's what Nolan Jr. (Jonathan, not Christopher) didn't get right when he made his version of Westworld's AI, that finds itself collectively left to the whims of an immature, violent, corrupt, immoral and well paying audience; Not all humans are coded in the same way that leads to them causing others to suffer, eventually. Some humans, although they are seemingly evil and manipulative, are actually good and god like, and some of us, who are actually kindhearted and seem benign by nature, can turn into the most terrifying of demons. Ford & William are examples of this and are represented by both black and white through most of the show and we get to see the shift at the very last episode. Come to think of it, William is another Dorian Gray himself, you start up good and it goes really south afterwards. With Westworld, there's a lot of "I knew it!" moments for sure, and that last episode sure had lots of them. However, thinking of Dolores and Maeve, I couldn't help but ask myself, after the roll of the credits of the final episode; have the writers ever bothered watching the best representation of an AI/Android ever to be done before on screen? To my knowledge, the longest representation and most thoroughly written and developed AI fictional character that was ever inked was/is Lt. Commander Data from the Star Trek TNG series. Over 7 years & 178 episodes of show running and 4 movies across 8 years, you get to appreciate the journey of evolution an AI has to really traverse in order to get to complete consciousness, sapient-ness and self awareness. Although Data's quest of becoming more human is galaxies apart from that of Dolores's and Maeve's, the struggle during that quest, that may seem comical at some points is very similar to that of Sisyphus which is another homage and tribute to Greek mythology. With Westworld (the show, not the park or the movie) it seems that these were the underlying undertones: Experience, struggle, suffer, repeat and then conquer; for those who are only deserving, and not for everyone.
8.0~Excellent first season... sofiakastranta Sign in Permalink ...but the second one was such a disappointment. They tried so hard to stay interesting and well-thought and oh how it showed. They even had entire episodes that although were beautiful had no real connection to the main plot, like shogun world and that magnificent native american episode that made me think that native americans would evolve in main players,but no, it was all for nothing.
9.0~REALLY GOOD SHOW, AMAZING ! anthonyabiakl-57062 Sign in Permalink Westworld is just an amazing TV series. Interesting, amazing, and reeaaaalllyy mind-blowing (full of plot twists) and it always leaves you wanting more. It currently has 2 seasons 10 episodes each, so it's easy to catch up, even though season 1 is better than season 2, season 2 is still pretty awesome and mind-bending. I recommend that you watch it real soon, I give it a 9.5/10, one of my favorite shows alongside Breaking Bad and Game Of Thrones.
8.0~Season 1 (Terrific) Season 2 (incomprehensible) bazookamouth-221-898097 Sign in Permalink SPOILER: I give up on Season 2. 7 Episodes in and some of these episodes are hitting past the 1 hour mark . Its totally lost me, it just seems like lots of groups of humans/hosts/whatever just wandering aimlessly around the park just killing and capturing, and escaping, with repeated flashbacks dropped in out of the blue. Although Anthony Hopkins pops up occasionally,Season 2 has lost his class.Its ultra complicated and too much to take in . They really messed up this season. There is going to be a Season 3 but the viewing numbers are dropping.
10.0~Thrilling experience! pharaunultrin Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic show with futuristic elements blending with your favorite western movie. And that is just an aesthetic description. You can talk about this series in a multitude of phases and aspects. The cinematography, the acting, the script, the engaging story that leaves the screen and captivates the viewer. From what i have seen so far i would best describe it as - a series about life to its core. The mundane and the meaningful. The questioning of morality and the very reality that surrounds us. Actions and presumed consequences. A show that whether you like it or not will come knocking down on you challenging your own way of life and worldviews about humanity and the sense of consciousnesses. Is this a good idea ? Not always. Sometimes its best to not think about stuff. Ignorance is bliss or so they say.. Special mention to Antony Hopkins and Ed Harris. They are simply amazing! I can't wait to see how it unravels in the final 2 episodes of the season.
9.0~An Interesting Look at What It Means to Be Real od2-102-541456 Sign in Permalink As the advancements of man made technology continue to build steam, and the human race has, as well as its Darwinian principles has not had the time to catch up, it leaves us with a growing disparity between what we can do and what we can handle. Westworld catches us in a not so distant, nor difficult to imagine future. One where the bored elites of society have begun to pay handsomely to be whisked away to a time and place, mirroring the American Wild West, where they can seek to indulge in behaviors that would be illegal, immoral, and dangerous if not done in this context. This Westworld is filled with beautiful, homicidal, and uninhibited beings for the paying customers to interact with. These beings are laboratory made and programmed to serve out any number of actions within the parameters of their certain ingrained story lines. Consisting of parts "Jurassic Park", "Total Recall", "Bladerunner", and then even a little "Truman Show"... these beings begin to think beyond their programming and start to wonder about "what's out there?" and "why are things this way?", all leading to the impending events that are sure to follow. Great premise. Great actors. Great possibilities. Great fun. Enjoy...
10.0~Different season, different stories hugovillulles Sign in Permalink I can't understand why such a big amount of people is criticizing this second season. Yes, things are different, storylines are different, but in my opinion, there is a lot of great ideas that just need to be explored. During the first season, I was amazed at how deep the story were, the dialogs, and I think that it still stays the course. You all complain about the fact that the dialogs are less searched than the first season, but guys, let's be honest, if every dialogs were philosophicals, it would be very boring. To each character his way of talking, and that's why we can be very attached to some characters, and we still can enjoy some amazing dialogs though. And don't forget that it is a HBO show, and I'm sure that the last 2 episodes are going to be amazing. Let's believe in Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, they can produce some masterpieces, and as far as I'm concerned, this season 2 made good on his promises in 95% of the points : the music is outstanding just as the acting, the cinematography is incredible and even if the script is flawed sometimes, we can still make some deep and interesting theories, and I'm sure that a lot of surprises and reveals are about to come. So to all people who wants to begin this show, do it, and make your own opinion. Forget about all this negatives reports, based on a season which is not even finished. The hype is still there in a lot of fan's heart, and I'm part of it.
10.0~A truly modern masterpiece neonknight733 Sign in Permalink A brilliant work with captivating story that will make your mind be blown. Although this TV show is a part of an American science fiction–thriller media franchise "Westworld", the story itself is quite original. It has everything that a western fan would like plus some well-made sci-fi elements. That kind of mixture is sophisticated and fine driven by excellent acting of the cast. I won't write much about the plot but I want to say that at the beginning it can be a little bit stodgy but once it gets to culmination it won't let you go. Needless to say that plot twists are truly unexpected and mind-blowing. The last thing I'd like to say that you should be ready for some profound and rich philosophical discussions. If you want some light entertaining story, this TV show isn't what you are looking for. But I guess it's more an advantage rather than a disadvantage because we are flooded with sitcoms and it's really difficult to find such masterpiece as Westworld is. I personally enjoyed watching Westworld and would rate it 10/10.
10.0~Freeze all motor functions frhnzzz Sign in Permalink So intellectually interpreting this Westworld. Who doesn't want to see in 3016. Yes definitely there will be a westworld.
5.0~Yawn.. unicorn turds are more interesting to imagine. junkinboxing Sign in Permalink What can I say but .. it's not terrible but it is more terrible than great. ..flat, slow, lame, story/plot holes every 30 minutes(if you have a proper brain) otherwise "mysterious holes" every 30 minutes .. are you getting the point yet ? I have yet to read a review from someone who talks about this show in form better than a middle-school child. *shrugs*. When shows make people think that the show is great because of what the show makes the person/viewer "think or realize" ..and then followed by them explaining some nonsense that is something a stoned hippy on acid contemplates as they pass out in the desert heat, dehydrated.. Well..... it means the show is just wahooey gablooey...which is a kind term for a Unicorn fart. - If a show requires your own existential based explanation.. that means it's junk and it NEEDS your imagination to live. Cast = great Acting = above par Story = could be great, but the writing was more Unicorn fart than what it should have been...this is to ensure max viewers. People thought Game of Thrones had too much nonsensical nudity.. then WestWorld came along and made GoT's nude scenes seem like a blip.. Westworld centers half of the show around this nudity because they're supposed to be robots... but they're humans.. but they're supposed to be robots. ..I suppose robots that can't be worked upon unless nude. Ugh, I have never been upset with a show.. but the cast, the money, the everything put into this.. just to be a steaming cold turd.. You can win Emmys for acting..and for production.. it does not mean the show is any good.
10.0~Amazing TG Series Everrr !!!! nguyenquochauvn Sign in Permalink I am so in love with season 1 , and coming to season 2 ? I am Breathless, script so smart / creative/very logic , acting was high class , everything is just perfect in season 2 and i enjoy it every minute
3.0~Lazy Writing jb07-660-944395 Sign in Permalink It just doesn't make sense. I've persevered to episode 7 of Series 1 in the hope it will get better, but it just becomes even more ridiculous. It seems the original premise makes a great movie, but doesn't transfer well to a series. Firstly there is no effort made in explaining how the guests can't shoot other guests, or even how they can tell the difference between a host and a human. With a bit of thought, the hosts could have had a holographic display above their heads showing their status aka The Sims. This way the guests and techs could instantly see the status of a host, and whether it was resting or offline. Then further on into the series we discover that guests can be shot - it hurts - but only hosts can be killed. However, there is no differation in the weapons - it just works that way. Surely no matter how far into the future the weapons would not be lethal, and would only affect Hosts? Then further on, we discover that the hosts can actually hurt the guest by punching them - which goes against the entire premise that the guests can't be hurt. BUT it gets worse. It seems that the guests can be just at risk to dynamite or explosions as well as the hosts. Again, with a little thought, the guests could be assigned a minder Host who's sole job is to protect the guest from other humans and dangerous situations - eg. Guest steps in front of horse and cart, Host pulls them out of the way. The park is huge, yet the staff have some amazing but not shown way of being able to pop up in the park at any location. This is especially so of the creator. Again, this problem could be solved as easily as having helicopter type transport which the hosts are programmed to ignore. One of the biggest plot holes is when two technicians are dominated by the Madam host. They could simply switch her off, but instead, do what she tells them to do. One of them is actually fine tuning her parameters so supposedly could make her instantly dumb. There are lots of weak subplots going on everywhere, with a new one being introduced around the middle of the series. It is like the writers are struggling to try and find their way or are just plain lazy. They have probably been encouraged to stay so by all the ridiculously high reviews posted here for the show. I've been waiting for it to get better, but sadly it just gets worse. Not recommended.
4.0~Technically Beautiful Trash vanyel515 Sign in Permalink Beautifully well shot, technically well executed, solidly performed - but the writing is terrible. There are moments so ridiculous, that if you spend more than a moment considering it; things fall apart quickly. Minor spoilers follow: For example: Maeve is consistently brought back to the same tech people - and her behavior becomes increasingly erratic and threatening with each visit. This eventually hits such a level that if the tech people knew she was in their workshop, they reasonably should have either brought in extra security, or just refused to even walk in the room with her. The thing is; their workshop has glass walls - so they always knew what they were walking in to and they kept on walking in. Eventually this results in Maeve killing one of the workers, and taking the other hostage - but even then; their is almost no reaction. It's beautifully shot, technically well executed, solidly performed - terribly written trash. All of this led to a season 1 finale that I won't spoil with specifics - but will say this: It ends in such a way that confirms that nothing mattered - no one you connected with is guaranteed a return - they could replace every single cast member and create a brand new show, and it wouldn't matter. Season 1 could be an extended dream sequence, and the show could 'start' with season 2 - and the effect to the plot would be about the same. I kept hoping something would pay off, something would make it all mean something - but it never does. I'm done with this show. (For reference, this is written after watching every episode of season 1 and before the release of season 2)
3.0~Too much unnesccesary violence qa4057 Sign in Permalink I am tired of witnessing ludicrous unnecessary, predictable human cruelty and psychopathic behavior in what is supposed to be entertainment. There is no originality in this production other than it is virtual.
10.0~Phenomenon Series!!! thomaskaras-37365 Sign in Permalink I never really like western or future movies but the combination of all that was very good. I really loved the fact that every episode was mind blowing. The first episode was great, the middle episodes was great too and of course the ending was GREAT!!! The actors/actresses was also great. I enjoyed watching Antony Hopkins act and some others (Edd Harris, James Marsden, Jeffrey Wight, Thandie Newton and Rachel Wood) that they did a fantastic job. For me, this series didn't have something i didn't like. As I said I enjoyed the story, the act and the mind blowing moments of the series. I cant wait until next season!!1
1.0~Season 2 tahitiblkpearl Sign in Permalink An utter and complete mess. Sea 1 was very good. We have a scene, we already know they are going to kill everyone next or they are already dead. But every. single. damn. scene has someone or many people getting shot or killed. So there is no surprise. And to have Elise come back fresh as a button? She wasn't my favorite character but now she's a gun toting Rambo. No. just no.
4.0~Great Season 1 but..... aggelosroger Sign in Permalink I haven't heard of the old movie, since a friend told me about the series, so I searched for it a bit and then I started watching the first season. I really enjoyed the plot, the characters and some twists it had to offer... Anthony Hopkins, clearly puts his stamp in the first season and also Ed Harris has a great character...and he offers his acting ability really good... Season 2 from the other hand is a mess. Dolores, in all of a sudden became a badass tyrant!! Maeve, not only altered her code, but she becomes a psychic maybe....cyborg.... Angela, is a sharpshooter?? probably fastest gun in WW at the moment... We got another park that is connected also to the one we knew...it contains Samurai....and ok lets accept this its not bad..for another park to exist...but now all the characters will somehow be connected and blah blah blah..... Teddy is ok...Teddy is still Teddy... William (or man in black) is saved,not because of Ed Harris playing him only, but because this character wanted from the beginning to play this game in hard mode.So now he has at least a purpose to survive. I don't know if the writers will survive this.....hahahaha trust me....I can write better P.S. the 4/10 rating straightly goes for season 2 for no misunderstandings
3.0~Does this series have an editor? jestar-70039 Sign in Permalink What a mess! The storyline is good but the editing is a disaster. Confusion reigns,! The Man in Black shoots Delores 5 times without any effect and then Bernard shoots her once and there she goes? WTF? Dolores is now Hale? The CRA4-DL floods but then it is miraculously restored? The timelines are meant to confuse? No, the editing is a disaster. Just jam the whole thing with crap and you lose the whole point. Well done.
1.0~I'm yawning kz-08675 Sign in Permalink Trying to watch again. So boring I can't even stay awake. HBO charges the most, yet offers the worst. When is something going to happen on this show.
10.0~The best series on TV dulceboodie Sign in Permalink This is very original, I was enthralled from the pilot and the more I watch, the more I am drawn in. This is nothing like the movie, it shows what humans did to deserve what happened in the movie, It shows humans in their worst, with Ed Harris character literally torturing the hosts. It is beyond great, a must watch. Amidst all the stupid series that are painstakingly similar, where I lose interest in the middle of the season, this is a breath of fresh air. Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins alone could carry a TV series, but the rest of the characters are top notch. I gave it a 10/10, while I wanted to give it 100/10. Go watch it now.
2.0~Waste of Time edl666 Sign in Permalink I don't do this often, but Westworld requires a comment. I feel betrayed and tricked by this series of more or less utter nonsense. I watched the last episode yesterday and had to force myself to keep on watching. The problem is, that I stopped caring for any character after six or seven episodes. They are robots, right? So, what's the point? Who cares if they live or die or ponder their existence? If this is supposed to be the spearhead of the HBO shows, I feel sorry for the makers and viewers of the program. And I had the strong feeling that even the writers of this show lost track of the story lines and characters. It became a weird mixture of flashbacks, reboots, questions and answers. Answers to what? That I couldn't figure out. BTW, the same happened to me while watching "Ghost in the shell" lately. I just can't care for robots. They bore me. They are not human and will never be. You lose one? Build a new one. Case closed. Two stars for the decent acting and camera-work.
9.0~Whispers of Blade Runner and Jurassic park in a Western setting.... s3276169 Sign in Permalink Westworld whispers of Blade Runner and Jurassic park in a Western setting.... There's a lot of very familiar sci fi cultural icons on offer in this series. Its a revamp of an older film, a sci fi thriller, written by Michael Crichton. Its not surprising then to see elements found in the novel Jurassic Park, also by Crichton. Crichton is very good at questioning the implications of scientific endeavour. The unanticipated outcomes, that were either overlooked or not seen. Which, in turn, begs caution and care when meddling with the fabric of life. This notion and the consideration of what it means to be sentient, to be human, as found in films like Blade Runner, are finely crafted threads that run through this series. As the simulated humans, who occupy Westworld, are brought, by subtle degree, closer and closer to humanity by their designers, they begin to evolve. The potential for the randomness but also the predictability found in human behaviour increases incrementally. This, in turn, quietly ratchets up the tension and draws tighter the threads that hold this series together. The question is, when will those threads, start to unravel? This is, thus far, a highly polished production that, refreshingly, is intelligent. Sure there's exposition but its not the key driver. This is a series that asks questions and wants you to consider the outcomes if not find answers. The standard of acting is, for the most part, top shelf. So many well known, as well as lesser known, actors, help to add depth to this production. Thus far I'm enjoying Westworld and plan to make it one of my, "go to", series. Nine out of ten from me.
4.0~More flaws than I can name but watch it anyway. iantrader Sign in Permalink Easy to see how this garners high scores but difficult to understand why the scorers have such a limited movie history or any sense of 'story'. (Breaking Bad probably started it - yawn. You just need to watch the first and last 5 minutes to get the story.) In summary - aspire to be more than you are with confusing and confused plot elements and scenes to give the viewers a sense of complex ingenuity and there's a hit! (This doesn't apply to Breaking Bad which was just as slow a tortoise sh*it.) Anyway, Westworld is a truly ambitious project, complex beyond even the writers' understanding - if anyone claims to be able to explain ALL the plot points, they're lying. Absolutely. I could list the holes and defy anyone to plug them all but that would be a spoiler and it seems those who think this is the movie equivalent god's second coming wouldn't care anyway. Such is the way it goes with movies and religion. One laugh-out-loud and shaking-of-the-head moment in particular occurs in Season 2 (yeah, you'll have to watch it all now) where an avid fight scene is accompanied by an excerpt from Beethoven's Eroica symphony, contrasting vicious fighting with slow, classical music. The writer must have been dying to write a scene like that for years!! As it happens, it's the Funeral March from the symphony which is slightly ironic although that doesn't negate the overall effect. Ah well... Tropes R Us. I loved robots and the overall theme but it's truly, truly got lost in the writing in an overly ambitious attempt to be 'clever'. It's not. But it certainly has fooled many reviewers. A bit like the Emperor's New Clothes...
4.0~"Lost" all over again!! cagdas-21-315073 Sign in Permalink "Lost" all over again!! Apparently the writers didnt know what to do on the 2nd season and just improvised!! Complete rubbish!!
10.0~Multiple time theory kubi-14149 Sign in Permalink On multiple occasions as of S1e8 the question of the minds of those who question The marks were up. First of all, 34 years ago, There is a town where behavior is taught. Where Dolores comes from An order is killing the host today. 30 years ago, William Coming. Today the man in the black hat is trying to solve the maze. We know that Doctor Ford is slowly starting to put hosts instead of employees. Maeve 2 rose to god mode because of the clumsy employee. He wants to escape from this artificial world with his own army. But at the end of the escape we do not know where to go. Meanwhile, Hale, who joined the sequel, wants to upload a hostel with all the information in the company, and with him 35 years of information to the outside world. The most intact robot chosen for this job would be Dolores' father. But Dolores' father was already out of use because the circuits were broken.Elsie, who has not been seen recently, may be a host. Because when Bernard drowned Cullen, he was building an old model 3d printer host in the room. That host Elsie may be confronted. He wants to keep his 35 years of experience. Robert Ford is one of the guys who can take all the possibilities into consideration.
3.0~Gory. Boring. Confusing. kbarlow1340 Sign in Permalink I've tried to like this show because I enjoyed the original movie and everyone seems to like it. I watched the first season but I really don't like the second season it's over the top boring and lots of bodies piling up everywhere can't tell who's a robot and who's not very confusing. I love Ed Harris or I would have shut it off long ago
9.0~Pretty good except for... macpet49-1 Sign in Permalink This series excels in special effects, violence, blood, etc. that all make for typical American storytelling. Why are we such a violent people? Anyway, the acting is great, the actors are all matched to roles except for old mangy Ed Harris. Why does he get all the parts like Streep gets so many female roles? I don't challenge his ability; just his monopolizing of work. He's waaaay too old, waaaay too wrinkled, waaaay to short and waaaay to poorly preserved. It's kind of like they cruised the nursing homes to find this ancient man to play the part of a villainous killer who should evoke fear in the watcher but only now evokes pity. He looks like he put his walker aside to act for a moment or two. Showing him survive beatings and gunshots from men 1/3 his age is ludicrous. When he strips off his shirt to repair a wound, his muscles are all atrophied. It isn't pretty. I'm not saying older people shouldn't be in films, I'm old myself. I'm just saying old actors have no business playing younger men. It's like watching Astaire and Grant woo women who could be their granddaughters which we did for almost a decade from the 50s to the 60s. It made me nauseous back then and does so now. Who wants to see it? If you can skip through the Harris moments, it's a terrific show!
8.0~Brilliant fiction, lazy science fiction. minosvasilias Sign in Permalink HBO is trying its hand at Sci-Fi, and falls into many the same traps as Hollywood before it. Still, it remains a triumph. The premise: A wild-west theme park with human replicas (called "Hosts"), there to be killed and violated however the (human) guests wish. This vague premise alone comes with a lot of questions, questions about the future this place exists in, questions about the specific workings of the Hosts. Westworld, however, takes its time in addressing any of them. Instead, you are thrown into many story-lines throughout (and under the hood of) the park, only very vaguely connected at the beginning. The first couple of episodes are, on the surface, just toying around with the concept. Guests come into the park and play with the hosts in different ways, cementing the logic of the show. As the show progresses, it connects different story-lines and introduces questions to be answered. The show executes this formula brilliantly. There is always a character with unsure future (or past), always topics to discuss in the week between episodes. Formulaic, yes, but not without surprises at all. In fact, the show is very unique in that it does not try too hard to get you attached to characters, but instead embraces the many complex time- and story-lines to always hint to something more on the horizon, beyond even the most dramatic scene a character endures. This is a breath of fresh air and only possible because of the sci-fi setting. And yet, the setting is also the shows weakest point and a failing i have seen many times before in expensive sci-fi productions: It does not explore the implications of its technology. Not nearly enough. Outside of the main characters, the world is merely brainless extras, asking no questions and having no concerns. The world outside the theme-park is, no doubt deliberately, completely opaque. The implications of AGI (artificial general intelligence) on humanity at large are fully ignored. It all focuses merely on this theme- park, a nice, and within the shows logic even useful, playground, but ultimately a completely shallow interpretation of the technology presented. While the show does not embarrass itself by using computery sounding terminology as so many others do, it instead goes to the other extreme and simply avoids any specifics whatsoever. Debating consciousness is a tricky thing, because every soul on this planet will have his opinion on it, and introducing a large numbers of viewers to hard theory of machine intelligence is difficult. I understand. But completely ignoring any societal effects of the technology you present makes your show fiction; not science-fiction. To be clear: Westworld has no blocky robots with CRT-monitors using joysticks to control a spaceship like Interstellar, it does not have nerdy support characters hacking away on a keyboard to "get into the mainframe" like CSI, it is indeed very careful to not make any glaring missteps, but it also does not present any alternative. Westworld is fiction that uses a sci-fi setting to enhance its story. Not science-fiction that builds a story around the future it implies. And yet, if you can suspend your disbelief, this show is one of the best written pieces of television i have ever seen.
5.0~Boring lchong-82161 Sign in Permalink Good actors and my score 5 all go to them. The story is really boring. I literally had to force myself to finish watching 10 episodes(because I'm not a quiter) I have no idea why it's rated 9? Did the producer paid IMDb for it? A lot of dollars are spent on it, so I guess they don't want them to be wasted.
10.0~We're in the golden age of the television bola_de_pu Sign in Permalink Just when you think there's no other good thing left in the television to you see, HBO does it again. Westworld is a masterpiece, an excellent script that brings something new to the TV, finally. This show make you feel in the "wild west" and the performances of many characters are very entertaining. People that are tired of the monotony and the "too real things on TV" we love this show. I'm just waiting for a season 2 and season one isn't over yet. Ed Harris is a bad-ass and Anthony Hopkins character and dialogues are just outstanding. Another show of HBO that we can put in the Top 100 in the history of series, along with Game Of Thrones, The Wire, True Detective and The Night Of.
5.0~Robots with a conscience. Edit: ready to cancel this show deloudelouvain Sign in Permalink I almost never edit a review but in this case it is realy necessary. So after season one I rated it with seven satrs and this was my review: Please let's not exaggerate. When you see the extremely high ratings you think you're going to watch the near perfect show. Okay Westworld isn't bad at all but I would not rate it as high at this moment. There are too much complicated things to make it a nice fluent watchable series. Not that I don't like the intrigues and the plot changing aspects of Westworld but sometimes it's a bit too far fetched and difficult to follow. If you miss fifteen minutes of the show you will probably be completely lost. The actors though there is absolutely nothing bad to say about them. They all deliver and have great acting skills. I'm curious what season two will bring. I guess it won't be a western style anymore, probably another scenario. But I guess you can't eternally continue with the story of robots having or growing a conscience. Good show though but not as good as the high ratings would make you believe. After watching season two I give it a three star rating so the average is now a mediocre five star rating and this is why: Rarely did I watch a series with a good potential drop so badly in quality as Westworld. I realy don't know what the writers were thinking whilst making the second season. The first season was already difficult to follow but the second season is just beyond words. The more you watch it the more you get confused and the lesser you are interested in the story. I watched it, or endured it, that's a better word choice, until the end and I couldn't be more happy that it is finally over. Season two is absolute garbage and for once I'm totally for the cancelation of a show before having a proper ending. I never thought I would say that as I've been so mad before when they cancelled perfectly good shows without having a proper ending. I see they are going to make a third season but I realy doubt anybody would continue watching this farce of a show. i, for sure, won't watch it.
8.0~Please, do not make the season 2 looks like season 1 again ndrenest Sign in Permalink It's getting bored, i really hope you to stop the repetition of scene. enough in season one only
9.0~perfect show but, does it need another season? josemigueleslomaximo Sign in Permalink mind blowing, incredible, mesmerizing. All words that describe this work of art. At first i was blown by the concept. a futuristic world in which there is sort of a "the purge" vibe, it sounded interesting. But this TV show exceeded my expectations. Most of the characters get a deep construction and evolution, but the most subtle but yet most important is ford's transformation throughout the season. The dialogues are rich, intriguing, full of philosophical and existential questions that could also be applied to human's vision of god. this was the perfect show with the perfect ending. No cliffhanger, no unanswered questions just plain and simple brutality. a slow but steady construction of characters that develop beautifully as the show progresses. my only concern is how do you top it off? why would you try to give more to something that it is already perfect the way it is? if you are looking for a fun interesting mind blowing but at the same time intellectual piece of television because this show manages to be visually and intellectually stimulating
4.0~Didn't do it for me roney99 Sign in Permalink I had really big hopes for this show. In some aspects it delivered e.g. it looks good. As it dragged on I found my self being less and less interested in the characters and what the story did to them. I also have problem in believing in the Westworld-park idea. So very, very rich persons go there to have sex with robot-prostitutes and kill robots? Since the robots are almost impossible to separate from real humans by their looks it has to be quite disturbed guests that pay insane amounts of money to come there to live out their sick fantasies of murder and sex... One other aspect that bugged me was the use of time in the episodes. It often felt like one story line used days but another just used hours. But somehow they still happened parallel to each other. I just couldn't get excited...
1.0~Poor 2nd season russellhanley Sign in Permalink Season 1 was great, season 2 was like some bad channel 5 flick. Total rubbish.
6.0~TOY LAND zydonk Sign in Permalink About a hundred years ago, the composer Maurice Ravel and the writer Colette created a lyrical fantasy called L'Enfant et les sortilèges, about a little boy who vents his frustrations with the ordinary demands of his life by abusing his toys, pets and the furnishings of his room. In reaction, all his toys, pets and even the furniture come alive and abuse him in turn, much to his very great surprise. No doubt such a cautionary tale is universal, so we cannot accuse the creators of Westworld of plagiarism. Granted that the intended audiences of these works are very different, both in culture and time, it is nonetheless remarkable how similar they are. L'Enfant doesn't sport geishas or a shogun, instead we are entertained by a singing (and, in a later development, dancing) china tea pot and cup and saucer. Again, there are no Red Indians, rather there is a shepherd and shepherdess, together with their flock of sheep, who again sing and dance for us. And there is even a Fairy Princess - beloved of the little boy - who entertains us before she flees away into the night with her Fairy Prince, much to the chagrin of the boy. And not forgetting the techie side, in place of the resourceful and stony IT folk in Westworld, we have a very agitated teacher trying vainly to instil the basics of arithmetic into the indifferent child. But of course there are differences. Westworld lasts much longer than L'Enfant, so it is to be expected that there is much more - much much more - detail to fill up the time. We have a lot of TV sex and violence, elaborated for us in painstaking detail which exemplifies most of the developments in this area, both in terms of apparent realism and graphic simulation. And to illustrate the truism that sentimentality is the remorse of the callous, the elaborate examples of man's inhumanity to man are balanced by equally elaborate enactments of great and abiding love of man for woman. One unfortunate effect of this is to point up the fact that while the varieties of man's inhumanity are possibly infinite, there seems no variety in the expression of man's love for woman, which entails mostly heavy silence and facial expressions of futility, which leaves us with the bad taste of an unavoidable dramatic deficit: the remorse never works. And then there are the toys. Allowing that there never will be 'human' robots/synths/androids, we must treat this aspect of Westworld as either fantasy or some kind of metaphor. To the extent that the toys want to be free, then we must assume that metaphor is intended (if fantasy, then fairy folk or pretty outer-space aliens would be preferable, yes?). At this level, at least, some kind of insight does emerge: the sad truth that whatever about the value of freedom, it is not innocent. And perhaps a deeper truth: that in being human - or digitally human, as the case here - means being condemned to be free. Much of Westworld is contrived, perhaps as befitting the length of the series, where the plot must rule. Yet there is one area where the contrivance is impressive. All the detail of the manufacture, programming and maintenance of the robots is fake, of course, yet the detail here is extraordinary. If they ever make the folding tablet, I will buy one, regardless of price (hopefully it is already in development somewhere). And the sight of lovely Dolores stripped down - and moving with such grace - is itself a coup de théâtre, and so effective that it is repeated a number of times for our delectation. Most of the points I give Westworld are in acknowledgement of the quality of this aspect of the series. L'Enfant et les sortilèges ends with the little boy crying for his Mama, who promptly comes and enfolds him in against her aproned bosom. I note also that the British counterpart to Westworld, Humans, will also have its saviour, in this case an all-knowing, all-seeing programme hidden away in the depths of the internet. Will Westworld also have a saviour? It will be interesting to see what is proposed as saviour, what it might tell us about the culture and time that produces it. But then again there might be no saviour. Even so, how the series ends - if not suddenly dumped by HBO - will be equally informative.
3.0~Decent start but goes downhill fast skiffx Sign in Permalink I enjoyed the first couple of episodes and I haven't seen the original 1970's movie. However, after the initial few episodes this thing is becoming a train wreck and snowballing downhill FAST. I made it as far as first 10 min of episode 8 and simply turned it off. It became unwatchable due to the simple fact there just isn't enough there for a show. It would have been a great feature movie or maybe 3-5 episode mini series. At this point the show is out of ideas pretty much and writers just put filler crap for 40-50 minutes into each episode which is boring, unimaginative and simply insulting for the most part. So yeah...into the trash bin it goes.
10.0~The ultimate show poolofpool-83408 Sign in Permalink I am a mathematician so i am not into Si-Fi at all , but when i saw the first 15 minutes of that show i was mesmerized ! It felt like i was listening to one of Beethoven's symphonies , the performance and the directing were incomparable ! when i think about the plot of the show and the way they deliver it , My imagination has an orgasm .
2.0~The critics are paid off, this show sucks TheOneThatYouWanted Sign in Permalink I saw two reviews about this show before watching it and they gave it pretty high marks. I didn't read the actual reviews because I didn't want to spoil anything for myself.. not that I had to worry about being spoiled considering the fact the show doesn't have a plot or story beyond kindergarten level. Maybe entertainment has to start being dumbed down because that is the direction our society is heading in? Who knows, anyway. I literally just finished watching Westworld about 10 minutes ago and as you can probably guess by my score, I'm not a fan. I was literally checking how much more of it was left to watch at least 4 times while watching it. So what's the problem? The show is boring beyond belief because there is no real plot. The whole concept of machines are going to turn on us deal has been done to death. Smart movies or TV shows which use that concept have an actual underlining story. This show relies way too much on the over simplified plot of 'the machines are going to turn evil' that this pilot episode had to repeat the same scene over and over again because it didn't have anything else to show us. Maybe they're saving the good stuff for episode 2 or 3? Game of Thrones didn't have to do that. Breaking Bad didn't have to do that. Do yourself a favor and skip this series. From what I saw of it, the rest of the series is going to be annoyingly predictable. A sleeper of a pilot plus the paid off reviews equals a series not worth watching.
6.0~Amazing start but gets more and more disappointing towards the end nexx-43314 Sign in Permalink First few episodes the show really sucks you in, the acting is amazing, the visuals are breathtaking and of course there's the never ending question on the possible future of androids, artificial intelligence and in the end it all just turns out to be a subject of what it means to be human? Do our moral obligation stop at biological life? Is the future of androids really to become overpriced sex dolls and shooting targets? (I don't believe so, but it's definitively going to become one aspect of their use) In the end the biggest question of this show is: "Are you a good person if you enjoy harming something that looks like a human even though it isn't?" But this really cannot be credited to this show, it is a question explored by many shows, movies, books and etc. What THIS show is best for is the mystery that is revealing itself in the background. And that part of the show is really great, there are many revelations and plot twists along the way that really keep you crazy to know more and then comes a point in which you feel everything should start untangling but it doesn't and it just becomes inception. The ending is really unsatisfying, not really living up to what it was built up to be. Over time some plot lines and character developments become unrealistic, even though it's masked well with the mystery aspect of the show. And there is also a very clear feminist/white-male-hatred undertone in the show and some of it is just overcooked and over-boiled.
5.0~Season 1=TEN, Season 2=ZERO hnt_dnl Sign in Permalink Ok, maybe I'm being a bit harsh about Season 2! LOL Because there actually were a couple of diamonds in the rough, namely 2x04 and 2x08, but that's exactly the point. When most fans universally agree what the most standout episodes are and there is no room for debate, that's a bad sign that the rest of the season sucked, and to me, Season 2 of this show SUCKED! When there were a minority of fans calling this show pretentious and overly complicated in the first season, I thought they couldn't be anymore wrong and I still think they are based on Season 1. But all those complaints came to absolute fruition in Season 2. Now, I am in that bucket of fans of this show that think it diverged into ridiculous pretense and annoying "complexity". Season 1 of Westworld featured a rich, well cast ensemble of superbly acted characters. Season 2 turned the show into a feminist agenda-ed star vehicle for Dolores and Maeve, who degenerated into the two worst characters of the series. It takes some seriously bad writing and acting to accomplish turning the show's 2 most fan favorite characters into it's least liked in a single season, but the writers and actresses accomplished it. And what's really sad is that there some seriously brilliant acting in the form of other characters like Ford, Bernard, The Man in Black, James Delos, Teddy, Clementine, Akecheta, and Logan. But for every great piece of acting, there was crap acting by the aforementioned Dolores and Maeve, both of whom chewed as much scenery as they could, as well as poorly acted characters like Charlotte, Sizemore, Emily, and the 2 "cats" Felix and Sylvester. It was like watching actors in a Shakespearean play interact with the cast of a CW show. Season 1 had none of this, almost universally brilliant acting across the board, so I'm blaming the Season 2 misfire on the writing more than anything. Other than mixed signals in the acting department from half the main cast, there was also some seriously awful acting by the collection of extras. It's like the directors gave those actors no guidance and told them they sounded like cardboard cutouts. Every human character that was being hunted in Season 2 acted the EXACT same way. There was no divergence in behavior, no wild cards. And the security and military contractors who were tasked to take down the robot rebellion were the most incompetent group of "trained" soldiers I've ever seen. This show is supposedly set in a distant future where there is all kinds of advanced technology and weaponry and these idiots decide to take on these killerbots solely on the ground in hand-to-hand combat with no protective headgear. And the flashback/forward storytelling just made me dizzy! It accomplished absolutely nothing. The music was too loud, there were too many closeups. Obviously, the showrunners had this brilliant concept that they adapted from the book and spent a ton of time and care to write the epic freshman season, only to let all the praise and awards go to their heads, so they put together the atrocity that was Season 2 thinking people would continue to bite. But it backfired. Many fans have caught on that you had a great idea for a SINGLE season, then got in over your heads. And there's no telling the nonsense they'll come up with in Season 3.
10.0~A delightful revenge! Nebulous_Navid Sign in Permalink I think what Nolan tried to portray, he did it excellently well. Throughout the season, I had a hunch that this is the new beginning of an AI revolution. Us, Humans, try to express our love to every adorable species and try to protect them. but whenever we feel insecure by any other species, we find them dangerous and we hunt them down to secure our prime position in this earth. It's in the genetic, human nature, it's what brought us this far. people or should I say guests more specifically, come to the park to find some solace , to find some peace, to find the true meaning of life. But they ended up finding nothing but knowing thyself. Some finds himself hideous, and a cold blooded murderer but he was meant to lead a good, simple life. people were so busy with these violent delights that they never noticed that's the violent end of their precious life!-
2.0~Season 2 is a big letdown charliehmi-08468 Sign in Permalink Season 1 was really good. The acting, cinematography, pacing and character development was mostly very good, there were a few plot holes - one huge one in particular which has been covered by other reviewers here, but on the whole the slow-burn left me hopeful of what was to come and wanting more.... Season 2 however is all over the place. It has major structural and pacing issues. The first 3 episodes contained way too many flashbacks, concurrent storylines and people just wandering around looking blankly into the distance and saying 'I don't know' a lot. Everything is non-linear, and happening in different timelines / timescales, it's a mess and very hard to follow. Episode 4 was a little better, but the ancient Japanese storyline in episode 5 was dreadfully slow and boring. Maeve apparently is now turning into Neo from the Matrix, and Dolores is Agent Smith - all of a sudden. It feels as if a whole load of storyline to get here. Teddy is Teddy. I think the whole 'what it means to be human' thing was done much better with Data in Star Trek TNG. It was certainly much less drawn out with another interesting storyline occurring at the same time. Due to how inconsistent season 2 is I don't think the writers had much of a plan for the narrative and seem to be winging it. It's a shame as it looks gorgeous and the cast is top notch. Anthony Hopkins is very much missed.
10.0~A writing masterpiece keszandris Sign in Permalink After season one which was superb in every aspect season two delivered mixed timelines and big reveals at the end....for casual viewers while season one will be an amazing sci-fi show, season two might get too hard to swallow but if you understand it, you are blown away by the acting, directing, writing of this whole show. 10/10
1.0~Season 2: Long, boring, confusing mess brucedaltx Sign in Permalink Season 1 started slow in order to get all the characters introduced and storylines set. It got better and better as the storylines merged and all the plot lines came together so as to finish the season strong. Season 2: OMG. What a confusing mess! Either shift between characters in current time or stay with one character and shift the time (past, near past, current). Quit doing both as that quickly becomes uneven, disjointed, confusing, long, boring, and tiring. I gave up on watching Westworld after three episodes of season 2 and went back to watching Netflix series as they are much better written with story lines that are at least understandable.
10.0~Bold, original, and a creative orgy of exploration cbrimie Sign in Permalink HBO's Westworld is yet another example of why this new and exciting age of television, as well as the expansive narratives they provide, is causing a tectonic shifted in cinematic storytelling. Six episodes into season one and it's safe to say that Westworld has earned a seat at the "big-boy table", with other esteemed series like "Breaking Bad", "House of Cards", and "The Wire". Each new and bold series being created, regardless of the platform used (e.g., Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Showtime, etc.) is influencing its counterpart, resulting in an astonishing, exponentially creative, alternative reality that we as viewers, or "hosts", can step into. Westworld is unique in that it both literally and metaphorically represents what it means to be "park directors" (show creators), "hosts" (characters and story lines), and "guests" (the viewer). It offers an expansive experience that will resonate differently with each viewer by delivering an orgy of creativity, depth, and by exploring the human experience. It is layered with mystery, philosophy, psychology, and blurs the line between reality and fantasy with non-linear timelines. The best way to describe why Westworld works as a series is to quote Aidan Macallan, a fictional character from House of Cards, who said, "People didn't know they wanted Jazz until they heard it for the first time." Westworld's bold experimentation captivates our imagination in a way that jazz does- by throwing out traditional formats to give space for chaos and unpredictability. Westworld offers rich characters, each seeking to change their predetermined destiny. It exposes us to great secrets and instability bursting with tension. It trusts us as the viewers to wander deeper, each episode, into a maze on the fringes of the park with no certain outcome.
3.0~Westworld - Don't forget to clear your cache smithp-12277 Sign in Permalink I haven't reviewed before, but as this series is approaching a 'masterpiece' score of 10, the kind of show I'd give anything to wipe from my memory (ironically appropriate) to enjoy again, I thought I'd contribute for a bit of balance. I'm not sure why it's garnering such scores, whether it's meta thing or because Nolan+HBO+huge budget=10, but I found 'Westworld' sadly lacking and a disappointment. I am a fan of the original 'Westworld', the memory of the calmly unrelenting and menacing Yul Brynner reminds me now of an early T500. The overriding problem I have is the writing. Over the course of the season the plot distils down to a bit of industrial espionage and a couple of robots being able to access old memories. That's it. There's a somewhat force fed narrative of 'achieved consciousness' but existential this ain't. It's so slow too. Where 'Mr Robot' toyed with us and drew things out with a certain arrogant knowing this is just lack of substance. One plot line even lacks credulity. A board member with free access to the park can only get the data from her hand-held device out by downloading it to a host's brain. The data is too large you see, and the best way to get a host's brain out is not by cutting its head off and throwing it in your luggage, it's by programming in an escape plan. Then there's the character development, or lack of it. Are we supposed to identify and humanise any of the robot characters to feel some sort of empathy as they are sliced and shot to bits? The human characters were unlikable corporate schemers for the most part. In fact, I would have quite happily watched them all sliced and shot up repeatedly on loop. The robot character 'Mauve' seems important to the plot line, but I'm at a loss as to the motivations of the two lab technicians who help her. She coerces one because she guesses he may get up to mischief with offline robots and that's it, jeopardise everything rather than reprogram, wipe her or throw her in the incinerator while switched off. Laughable. 'Bladerunner' tries to ask the question as to what it is to be human. In two hours. Remember how interesting and desperate the renegade replicant's characters were? Remember Roy at the end? Exactly. Then there's the tech issues. Nothing is explained why guns don't kill humans. They hit them with an impact like a rubber bullet but destroy everything around them including tree's/wood/walls and piecing metal. Can they get hit in the eye with one? In one scene, thousands of bullets spray out of a Gatling Gun, ricocheting off rocks and shredding tree's. Are all bullets and splinters trajectories calculated in real time? Do the bullets transform into soft rubber on contact with human DNA!!? The black hat character need permission to blow a jail lock early on, later there's TNT blowing up ad hoc all over the place. The hosts can't kill humans, but they can beat them unconscious and cause an aneurysm! Hosts are cut up, dismembered and even eaten and there's no sign of machinery one minute, but exposed for plot later. The show does look good, but in a way also disappointing. It reminds me of a cheap Sci-fi B Movie or TV series in a way. The ones where an alien world conveniently mirror's earth with similar architecture down to the brick size. The aliens are humanoid too, but maybe sprayed green. This is a TV series set in the future but shot on a western set, with lifelike robots played by humans. Any hard Sci-fi is glossed over really. Same old story I suppose. So, my advice is don't waste your time. 'Westworld' is high budget low quality, 'Westworld' the movie is Low budget high quality. If you want Sci-Fi western watch 'Firefly' If you want Sci-Fi that looks/sounds better and deals with the same issues, watch 'Bladerunner'. If you want recent good Sci-fi see 'The Expanse' Unless the first season was a giant stretched pilot, avoid. With the success and appetite for 'The Martian' 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' and others, there is momentum gaining where the viewer isn't treated like an idiot and with such disdain in this genre. Avoid. I'll probably change score to a 3 when people realise that this show hasn't changed their life and is neither seminal nor entertaining. I mean, once all the script buying, quoting, t-shirt buying, conventions, spin offs, stage shows, movies, re- enactments, cosplay, dissertations, books, art, music, homages, philosophical debate a score of 10 should spur.
2.0~Dumbest, overrated TV series ever. ecoadshare Sign in Permalink This is the most overrated TV Series I have ever seen and I have seen a lot. This does not make any sense. People spending billions of dollars to build a humanoid world just to F***K them and do whatever they want with them? Are you serious?? What's wrong with you people??? It's purely stupid. Especially, in this day and age where Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) all kinds of realities exists. I am very surprised seeing this dumb TV Series rated this high.
3.0~Not making a tiny bit of sense... ruzin08 Sign in Permalink A lot of spoilers for the whole first season included..... Well well well.... I can't put into words how I feel about this show.. It's too much. It's so messed up, so absurd, so ridiculous, so cliché that goes beyond stupid. Beyond bad.... 9,2 rating??? Really people??? Do you understand anything about Artificial intelligence? About feelings? Apart from all these things the fact that HBO keeps serving you THE SAME color palette, THE SAME atmosphere THE SAME shallow philosophical mumbo jumbo that are not making any sense, THE SAME music doesn't bother you at all? It has become a product mass produced. Mass produced empty philosophy for the masses. And you want more.... OK I will try to sum it up because if I get carried away I will exceed IMDb's text limit by far... From the first episode of the series maybe nothing makes sense. Let me get this straight. Arnold managed to create androids with consciouness. OK. So why are they feeling things? They designed them to imitate feelings or to really feel things? Because you know....THe second can't happen. Artificial intelligence doesn't equal emotion. Or sensation. Even if they have consciouness feeling things not only requires a nervous system but also a brain, many kinds of tissue and special connection between all this fleshy things we have inside us... So problem numero uno 1. Why most andorids seem like they feel pain? They programmed them to imitate feelings or to really feel? 2. That scene were the prostitute android goes beyond her programming because she feels bad for her child. No just no. This can't happen. For no reason. Maternity is a primordial instinct that animals and humans have and has nothing to do with artificial intelligence. A program even if it could think wouldn't understand what it is to feel compassion or wouldn't understand feeling in general. Do you understand that people? Do you understand the difference between an actor that IMITATES feeling and a human that just feels? 3. Why it's bad for people to mistreat androids? They don feel nothing!!! They are just programmed to have reactions!!! Or not? Guess what the show does not make this clear...Jesus.... Animals feel pain. Androids don't. Super simple stuff. 4. Ed Harris's story is super stereotyped and doesn't make sense. No it doesn't. 5. In the final episode the blonde android that has an existential crisis tries to tell us that androids are better than humans? Yep you heard it. The most idiotic comparison ever made...Why better? Is it a competition? I could come up with a lot more problems but I think you get my point. 2 things that other people said in their critique ''Is this supposed too reflect some existential despair about the human condition? It doesn't.'' ''This show does not make any sense. I couldn't understand what was happening, why they did whatever they were doing and what they wanted to do. It was all so messed up. The only thing they were saying were vague nonsense that are the type of phiolosophical emptiness that people put for cover photo on Facebook...'' In the last thing I added a few thoughts of my own.... This is #16 on TV shows on IMDb....That's not funny...that's really sad...
10.0~Very well new defined idea of Blade Runner kathrin-dorrn Sign in Permalink Beside "Sherlock" one of the best series I have happened to see in the last years - very well scripted, top actors, a finely crafted storyline - and quite a few of overturning surprises you always need for a good series. Beside the weak soundtrack, I was entertained very well. Every episode just gripped your balls, and didn't let go of them until the very much cliffhanger kind of end. So very rare that I have been sitting on the edge of my couch for more than one hour without even noticing it :) I was THRILLED every time the next episode was announced. Go watch it, make your own opinion. You won't be disappointed!
8.0~Looking up, I hope palacerevolution2000 Sign in Permalink I really wanted to like 'Westworld'. But during last season just got extremely bored and exasperated. There were no likable characters' absolutely no comedic relief. Even the "heroes" were annoying - especially the male leads. But on the strength of Nolan I even made myself re-watch Season 1; maybe I was missing something. I was not. But, I have to say: yes, it has been only one episode in Season 2, but right away there is a completely different feel about the show. And I am not talking about the new story line. There is a fire in the actors now that was missing in S 1. I don't know if this is a good thing but it reminds me a bit of 'Lost' now.
2.0~First series good, second series terrible youthandyoungmanhood Sign in Permalink First series of this programme was very interesting and felt brand new. The second series was horrendous, made it up as they went along. Dolurus repeating the same rubbish over and over and over and over and over and over.
2.0~Westworld Season 1 very good, Season 2 a nonsensical mess. Michael-U-E Sign in Permalink Season 1 was marvelous. Season 2 is a complete mess. Season 2 is the wet dream of the left and feminists. It's a multicultural, multiracial mess where the women are the powerful and wise and the men are dumb followers. The few white men are either bad or ridiculous. Or need to be "reset" like Teddy Flood. A multicultural, multiracial matriarchy. Who produced it? Elizabeth Warren?
1.0~For The Brain-Dead hreinardy Sign in Permalink If you are a passive watcher and have no critical thinking skills, if you love cliches and deus ex machina, then this show is for you.
1.0~Sadistic Snuff Stories Aimed at Women moonmom-295-621699 Sign in Permalink I was excited to watch this as I love the campy classic it comes from. As I watched I began to feel super uneasy, not because of the suspense but because of the sanctioned violence towards the female "robots". I watched as these female characters were raped, beaten and terrorized. This was a pleasurable outcome for some visitors because the women are just "robots" and we as the audience are invited hate these villains because we know violence is wrong. However, because we know those are the 'bad guys' and the women are really robots, we are given permission now to watch detailed acts of sadism towards the female characters...for our entertainment. That's kinda awful, and definitely very sexist in a very violent way. Another disturbing layer, is that many of the naked bleeding female victims are also whores, woman who are already viewed as subhuman in our culture already. Some may say that the male robots take a beating as well but the prolonged scenes of horrific sexualized torture is lavished upon the female characters. The female robots receive so much brutality, and they do it naked...slipping in their own blood. There is a scene early on where a naked whore robot requires "maintenance" and has had something cut from her. She wakes mid procedure alone on a gurney a gaping bloody wound above her groin (uterus area), terrified she tries to leave slipping in the blood running down her legs from her womb. It's really quite awful. After having this quite visceral reaction to something that's supposed to be entertainment, I did some research online. Many people are having this reaction and not surprisingly, many of them are women. What's really creepy, is the volume of people rating it as 10 stars...wow. There are articles online if you wish to find out more. From SALON "Most disturbing was HBO's president of programming Casey Bloys' cavalier admission to reporters a few months ago that that he doesn't see a difference between rape and murder in his series, viewing both as equally entertaining."
