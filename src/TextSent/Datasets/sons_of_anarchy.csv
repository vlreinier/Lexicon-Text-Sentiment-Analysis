9.0~Being a big TV junkie, I have to admit that I didn't hear about Sons of Anarchy (SOA) until the middle of Season 2 and even then, I didn't really pay much attention to it. I guess the main reason is because we don't carry the FX channel here in Canada, even though it finally became available last month. About 2 years ago, I received the SOA Season 1 Blu-Ray as a gift for Christmas from my cousin's boyfriend. I remember unwrapping it and then giving him a raised eyebrow look, What's This? Some random TV show about biker gangs starring Peggy Bundy and Hellboy? "Uhhhhh Thanks." He insisted he heard great things about it and that I should give it a try, I was very appreciative of course but the Blu-Ray sat on my shelf unopened for over a year. I honestly just kind of forgot about it because the idea of watching a bunch of old biker dudes causing ruckus just didn't seem so appealing, like how deep could the story be? I was just picturing a typical gang show but instead of the mafia sporting baller suits, you have old hairy fat white men shooting up each other while riding around in their Harley's. I was cleaning my house last summer, and stumbled upon my SOA Blu-Ray, filled with a layer of dust, still in its wrapping sitting on the shelf. I decided to give it a shot and let's just say my perception of the show was COMPLETELY WRONG. I was hooked after 3 episodes and I proceeded to marathon through the 3 seasons. Simply put, Sons of Anarchy is dope. Sons of Anarchy is about a outlaw motorcycle club called, well—Sons of Anarchy, also referred to as SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original). The story takes place in a town called Charming in California. The club basically owns the town, they have the police chief working for them, a Charming politician in their pockets and all the citizens respect them and fear them at the same time. The crew's clubhouse is located beside Teller-Morrow garage which basically acts as a business front for all their illegal activities, primarily, importing and selling firearms. The story centers around the vice president of SAMCRO, Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam, The Ledge) who is next in line to become the president when Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman, Hellboy) steps down. On the surface, Jax is probably one of the smartest and most useful club members, a natural leader who gets the job done but from the very get-go of the series, we see that he starts to question the club and himself. I don't want to get too much into the shows storyline because I went into the show not knowing what to expect and found myself totally divulged into the story. There are so many deep character interactions and story lines that make SOA far from just a simple show about biker gangs selling guns. Politics, family, love, friendship, brotherhood, secrets and betrayal all come into play. Continue reading the full review at: http://www.thetvsamurai.com/search/label/Sons%20of%20Anarchy
1.0~I get it: Real MC are not like SOA. I accept that in order to run a show, the creator has to dramatize it. But to the very least, the story has to be plausible. So many things in this show are so beyond belief that it's impossible to take it serious. Even worse, the characters in this melodrama are utterly disgusting. They are, for lack of a better description, a bunch of white trash criminals. The innocent get killed. The weak get bullied. And there is this girl with an MD - medical doctor - willing to join the motor gang to do all the disgusting things with them. Give me a break.
6.0~Based on an overall 8.6 IMDb rating from 188,387 series fans I was expecting a lot more from SoA since the series ran for seven (7) seasons. I must admit that the last episode of season 3 was well written, but I found there were more low (and slow) rated episodes than a stellar 8.6 rating which it has received. After watching all seven (7) seasons with Ms. Shullivan we both agreed that Gemma Teller Morrow's character (played by a then 54 year old Katey Sagal when the series commenced) just wasn't the right character for her to portray. For this lead role I would have considered a younger biker mom to play Gemma maybe someone like Edie Falco, Gail O'Grady or Joanna Going. Gemma's character portrayal as the manipulative mother and "old lady" of the original (dead) President J.T., then old lady to biker President (dead) Clyde Morrow (played by Ron Perlman) and then old lady a third time (third time is a charm) to Nero Padillo (played by Jimmy Smits). Knowing that Katey Sagal's real life husband Kurt Sutter is the SoA series creator I guess you could say that she really is the original manipulative old lady. I just was not impressed with her portrayal of the manipulative control freak biker mom/grandma who continued to state family was everything to her, would be responsible for killing everything and anything that was close to her biker son Jackson Teller (played by Charlie Hunnam). The crimes these SoA bikers were engaged in required competitors such as Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Irish, Arian race and of course the local town of Charming police department, the FBI and Department of Justice. In my summary I mentioned that the SoA series reminded me of a daytime soap opera, and/or a 1950's cowboy/western film. The reason I compared the SoA to a daytime soap opera was because of all the heavy conversations between Jacks Teller, his momma Gemma, his stepdad Clyde Morrow and the core group of SoA bikers and their ladies who after discussing the murder and mayhem they have caused would embrace each other, then kiss each other on the cheek and state "I love you bro', we're family". The series probably replayed that same scene in 50 percent of the episodes. As for the comparison to a 1950 cowboy/western film, I viewed the SoA biker club as the cowboys who always invariably got the better of their rivals whether their rivals were the FBI, Chinese, Blacks, Irish, Mexicans or another biker chapter. Everyone else died and the only SoA bikers that ever died were when they were written out of the storyline. I did like Opie's character (played by Ryan Hurst) and he was an unfortunate casualty of Kurt Sutter's script writing. And no, Opie did not ride a white bike (white horse hero comparison). So the SoA were involved in guns, drugs, female escorts and producers of porn films, but the violence always seemed to be short lived and retaliation was only initiated by the SoA. It seemed the other clubs and gangs would throw a single temper tantrum and once they talked to Jackson Teller, the SoA president, everything was hunky dory and the other gangs retaliation for crimes and many murders the SoA were responsible for would just conveniently vanish. If I compared SoA to other crime series I would give SoA a 6.5 rating and series such as Justified an 8.0, Dexter 8.0 and The Wire a perfect 10.0. If you liked SoA and you have not seen "The Wire" this would be the TV crime series to measure any good quality crime series against. In summary SoA is okay but I found the series had far too many mommy issues, "love you bro"... and "we're family man" ... moments that extended the series to seven (7) seasons and it could have been a higher quality crime series if it had been shrinked down to maybe four (4) or five (5) seasons. Overall I rank this series a 6.5 since the supporting cast was above par.
3.0~I can only suppose the high rating for this rather odd soap opera is due to folks not having the real-life experience to know how laughable it is. The first few episodes give a peek as to why bike clubs exist - because folks like to ride bikes. However, we're soon off into the melodrama where the bikes and riding are just forms of transportation. The club may as well be taking Ubers as riding from about the end of S1 to the final rushed and rather nasty conclusion. Some items got so bad that the show sunk into laughable. Let me give you one example. A major figure in the club falls in love with, wait for it, a surgical transsexual. The club's reaction: support him in his rather unconventional love. In real life, he'd be stomped, stripped of his colors and tossed into a ditch. I want to hold one exception to my rather dismal view of this show and that's Katey Sagal who is a bright light every second of her screen time. I only wish the writers could have worked in an excuse for her to sing in every episode. Owell. Folks: this is NOT an accurate picture of a club. The bikes match, are new and the get-ups seem like tailored for Holloween costumes. The supposed leader is some sort of metrosexual who doesn't even have the testosterone to grow a beard. Instead, he has some 30% beard which looks like lichen on his face. There are a few good character actors supporting Sagal. I'm happy that we have a bike show, but unhappy that it's not really a bike show.
10.0~sons of anarchy is the best series out now in my opinion. it has a unique way of making us empathize with those bikers even though they are criminals. we see the best of those characters even at they're worst situations. the story is still, after 5 seasons, on an uphill, with every episode being better than the other. season 1 is amazing but it does not prepare us for what is about to follow on the other seasons. it changes for the better but i some times miss the good old day samcro that had less to worry about. season 5 is the best in my opinion because we see a whole other aspect of jax on the way he deals with problems. i hope the best for season 6 and i am sure that it will be a good season.
10.0~Sons of Anarchy is a top notch show about a biker gang in a small town. It is one of the best written shows on TV right now, the characters are well thought out, the acting is amazing and the directing is great. From personal problems, to dealing with gangs, to dealing with the law, this show stretches the limit, and does it brilliantly. Now in it's second season, the show is at a very high point in it's young life, here's to hoping the 7 seasons planned, come to light. The best characters are Jax and Clay, they play well off of each other and Katy Sagal is great as Gemma. I will be watching this series hopefully for a long time, and I hope it continues to do well because you'd be crazy not to like this show.
10.0~10/10 mukemmel dizi akli olan izler Chibs adamdir jackieeeeeeeeeeeeeee
1.0~While the actors show there talent, the characters are mind-numbing, first off the show itself is not worth watching on commercial television and at times the commercials have better content and are more interesting then the SOA show itself, but still the commercials drive me away from the show, SOA is not worth waiting through the commercials. I happened upon a set of SOA DVDs for loan so I could sit down without the insidious commercials pestering me while I watch the show and not kill my interest with unrelenting harassment to spend my money. What I found was, most of the members of SOA are a bunch of cut throat snitches, I lost my interest but I kept watching anyway and found 5 hours into the show was a bunch of predictable plots one right after the other. I was thinking I have done nothing but wasted time that I could have spent watching something with plots on the evolutionary scale higher then Wile e Coyote. I'm pleased the DVDs were just a loan; to spend money on the repetitive plots would be the same as tossing cash in the garbage can. Time wasted I will never get back.
10.0~I love this show... been a faithful follower from day one... reminds me of some very good friends of mine where i'm from!!The twists and turns in the plot make M. Night Shamalyan (sp) look like an amateur, and the depth of the characters give the viewer a familial feel! It's as if you know each one of them personally! Each episode is filled with mystery. Sad to see Hale get murdered and just amazing to see Stephen King of all people as a guest star. It's as if the show has received his stamp of approval! Looking forward with anticipation to the remainder of the season! Gemma Teller is my personal favorite character, filled with passion and determination! Kudos to Kurt Sutter, his lovely wife Katey Segal, and the rest of the crew!! And since no one rated the show, I gave it the first 10 stars, so there!!!:-) much love SOA View Crew solitary :-)
10.0~This is without a doubt the best TV show I've seen in ages. There is nothing about this show that one can't like.Every character is well defined and has it's own boundaries. The story line has enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seats through out the episode. And it may come across as strange, but you don't wait for the next episode because you wanna know what happens next (as in Prison break etc) you wait because you absolutely love the show. I envy the respect the S.O.A have for their members and what they are willing to do for one another. All in all, this is how you make a freaking entertaining show. Kudos to FX!!!
1.0~First couple of seasons were OK, nothing spectacular but OK. Unbelievable story lines, outrageous bad acting (especially the pompous, egotistically pouty whispering pussy Jax). Started getting ridiculous so I quit watching. Saw it on the lineup this season so I thought I'd catch an episode to see if it was any better. I couldn't get through the first minute of the tranny and ass rape scene that unfolded... REALLY? It was already bad enough but they felt they had to up their game and turn it into a fagfest. Truly the worst "show" ever. Really beginning to wonder if I need to drop FX from my favorites if this is the garbage they pump out.
10.0~I think this is the best TV series ever, they show us lot of trust,love and anger. Hope we could see more of Charlie Hunnman in the future. Also miss the other good actors. Would love a new sons of anarchy season but it sad that s7 was the last one. Everyone that love Dexter, Breaking bad and The walking dead would love this show! The show have a lot of drama and action. It is hard to only watch one episode on a day, i watched 3pr day and sometimes 4 until it was finish. We need more series like this, it not often you could find a solid TV series like this! Good actors, funny persons and every man in the club have a nice personality. The series cover everything like shooting, family life, club related things, deals, criminality and it is very exciting!
7.0~My wife and I were excited to watch SOA at first and the writing was good with interesting stories and insights into a lifestyle most people do not know. This in itself is a good reason to watch. The show held our interest until it started to become predictable and stopped breaking new ground. What should be a final season has been watered down to stretch into two final seasons and it really shows. There is lots of filler in every episode that would not be there if Kurt Sutter, the creator, had let it finalize in one season. Greed rears it's ugly head once again. The sign of a great story is to watch as a character grows and changes as events occur to him/her and how said character deals with these changes different from what they would have when we first met them. These characters never change. Or at least, the majority don't. Sad really, as Sutter had something here but he watered it down and lost the edge.
8.0~I guess I now understand what a guilty pleasure is. Never have I seen the word "love" tossed around so much! Killing someone's kin is a minor infraction sometimes and a big deal at other times. People who are thought to be smart aren't. People who are smart are in the gang but if they really were that well-read and contemplative, they'd not be in it. There's a lot of sexism and, although there is a lot of male-male kissing, they seem to be a rather homophobic group. I could go on and on about some of the negatives I saw but the series engaged me as well as enraged me. I wanted to see liars and sneaks be outed. I am a sucker for desert island and prison scenarios where society is run differently from our vanilla one (all puns intended). This series, in a strange way, falls into that category.
3.0~The first season is okay, after that it goes downhill. The storyline is exactly the same for at least 5 seasons (I stopped at season 5, something I have never done with a series). It seems to me the writers only wrote 1 season and it just keeps repeating itself. They have tried to raise the gore level/shock effect to compensate for the weak story. It's a commercial storyline at its worst. To bad for the actors who do a pretty good job in acting (I'd give 7 stars for the actors but then -4 stars for the storyline). There just isn't any honor in acting a story-less series.
10.0~we love sons of anarchy,and watch it wivout fail every week.always rush back if we are out so not to miss it.actors are brilliant,story line is believable and keeps you on the edge of your seat!they've made it so realistic,you'd think it was a real club.we are huge fans of s.o.a.brought loads of stuff like keyrings etc. brought s.o.a hoodies and me and a friend went to a general bike meet place.as soon as we arrived,there was another bike club there and two of the members said:"should be burnt".don't know whether he was referring to us or the hoodies!! anyway,don't people know its only a fictistious t.v programme?!
10.0~If I could give this TV series more than a 10 star rating, I would have. This is the most brilliantly written show that I have ever watched. The characters are intriguing, and always leaving you with the ache of wanting more. It is very violent and graphic, but also shows the love of those they call family. So much drama goes on throughout the seasons that you have to know what comes next. The storyline revolves around Jaxon Teller, (who by the way, is the sexiest man on earth), and his need to learn about the history of the motorcycle club and to help with guiding it's future. There are so many times that you will either want to cry or throw something at the TV screen, which goes to show how brilliant Kurt Sutter is with his writing. I highly recommend this show!!
1.0~Personally, I stopped after Season 4:Episode 10. If Jax Teller grew up in that life, and read his fathers novel on his opinion on where the club should go wouldn't he be able to tell who is putting hits out on his fiance and the mother of his children even if they are in his own crew? Especially because JT even realized Clay and Gemma were getting close? Actually I am not surprised because no one except the former sheriff and Gemma knew that Pilley was killed by Clay(why no one said anything I have NO CLUE), Opie Winston should of went to the cabin regardless of what Clay said because that is your father, WTF?! Then Gemma knew Clay took the money out of their safe at home THE SAME DAY A VAN OF 3-4 MEN TRIED TO ABDUCT TARA ON HER WAY TO OREGON, and she did not say anything to anyone even though deep down she had a hunch that Clay had JT and knew CLAY KILLED PINNEY?! It is not fun to watch when a viewer watches the step dad of a step son put a hit out on the step sons wife with two children, then when Abel went missing you claimed you were going to do everything to get your grandson back? What kind of Grandfather is Clay if he is emptying his safe at his house to abduct and eventually kill Tara(the mother of his grandchildren LOL?)
2.0~Wow, season 3 has been totally disappointing. I thought one and two were fairly good although there were many plot holes in the road the SAMCRO were on but season 3 is just horribly written. I predict this is the end of this show. It sadly doesn't have the creativity that shows like the Sopranos and the Wire have given us. Too bad, thought it had some potential. The writers seem to be grasping and straws and have over complicated the issues that face the MC. Not to mention giving them far to easy a way out of every situation, "oh I know, let's just have them suddenly have access to a jumbo jet that doesn't go through any border inspection". Pretty sad writing. They have also had a 101 chances to kill the Mayans, their arch rivals but for some reason they never have the balls to pull the trigger when the chance is there. They also seem to have terrible aim when their target is an actual person. Weird. Ahhhh well, was fun well it lasted.
6.0~It's 50/50. Some episodes really keep me interested in watching but there are also episodes that are really slow and boring that I end up falling asleep and end up missing something big happening. The writing for a lot of episodes is too much like a soap opera making the show unrealistic. It lacks action in most episodes because of too much soap opera going on. The acting in the show and choice of casting is great but is given little to work with because of the writing. Overall OK show to watch but not something that is binge watch worthy.
9.0~Living in France, the show wasn't on air as earlier as it was in USA. So, i had to wait, and i somehow managed to look all the episodes that already aired. In my life, there was never any movie or any series that was entertaining enough to give me an adrenaline rush... This show is. Overall cast is pretty good, even if i'm not a big fan of Hunnam, which, i think, always play his roles the same way. Kurt Sutter managed to improve his writing skills from The Shield to deliver us a show with great things happening, from good to worse (i don't want to say too much details), and the best part of it is that everything happening makes sens. I fell in love with the show and i can't wait to watch next episodes. Good show when you are "in need" of violence, or just when you want to relax and spend nice time in front of your screen. 10/10.
7.0~I applaud Kurt Sutter for creating something wholly new and exciting, and he clearly has a love for the motorcycle culture that shows thru in every episode. Charlie Hunnam, Katie Sagal and Ron Perlman are outstanding in their roles and pretty much carry the show. It's no coincidence that when Perlman's character dies, the show was never quite the same. Now having said that, there are some flaws. As the seasons wore on the characters seemed to reached Chuck Norris levels of hand to hand combat skill, and I cringed every time Jax started a statement with "Look, man...". But all in all some pretty minor complaints for an otherwise great show. No, my biggest criticisms are in the presentation of what it means to ride a bike every day. As a member of a club who puts over 12k miles per year on my bike I can tell you some of the misses were glaringly obvious. 1. I know it's California, but it never rained once in 7 years? Not once? Thug life takes on a whole new meaning when you have to spend 5 minutes gearing up before you can get on the bike. 2. All the bikes are the same. Not only do they all ride Dynas, but none of them are all that customized. Not a single Heritage Softail or FatBoy in the bunch (other than Bobby's smoke belching backup bike used as comic effect). This is a California biker gang with their own garage and they all ride matte black Dynas? Sorry, not only is it unlikely from a motorcycle culture perspective, but they missed a golden opportunity to create bikes that are their own characters.Match the bike to the rider. The Mayans and the Grim Bastards did a better job of this, largely because many of them were played by actual biker gang members who brought their own bikes. The Sons' bikes smack of a production decision to use bikes that are easy to ride and to fix. Bleh, 3. Nobody was ever a victim of a stupid cager. Even in a 1% gang, the biggest danger they face on a daily basis is from soccer moms in minivans who don't look before making a move. Seems this could have been the basis of an entire 3 show arc. One of the gang is senselessly killed by a douche in a Mercedes SUV and the club has to figure out whether retribution is warranted, or smart. Maybe the douche is connected politically, or something. Anywho, a really good show that I recommend. Just not great.
5.0~Sons of anarchy has its good moments but it can also be painful to watch. There are entire seasons where in every single episode something goes spectacularly wrong, these guys are like the worst criminals ever. They have been in this business for years and they all seem to be as poor as me (I am basically homeless) and whenever they make a bit of money and you get the slight hint that things are on the way up, THEY LOSE IT! To me it seems like the creators of this show just had the image of these guys on bikes riding across a beautiful landscape in a big group and then just making the story up as they went along! The joy of biking doesn't even seem to come across in this show it appears more like a pain in the arse. There is no character development throughout the show, nobody has evolved at all, they just seem to get into a bad situation, get angry and then make things worse. The show feels more like a soap opera for bikers then a serious crime drama.
10.0~I've read that some people may be thinking that this shows characters treatment of women is so bad that its unrealistic. If you still believe that, then get on Netflix or however you can watch shows, look for Gangland and watch every episode about Biker Gangs. The men in Biker Gangs treat women like second class citizens. They don't respect them. If you're a woman and you want to be in a Biker Gang, you are open season to any member of the gang. You will be involved in prostitution. There's no respect. Until you become an old lady, you are nothing. So how these characters treat these women is realistic. The creator of the show spent time with the Hells Angels for research and one of the actors on the show is a real Hells Angel, if he's still around and involved, then the show is realistic. I'll admit that while I liked the first season, it was weak in some points. But don't give up. Keep watching. It picks up in season 2 and in season 3, the storytelling is exceptional. When you get to the end of season 3, you will be shocked. Season 4 leaves you in such suspense that you want to raid FX Studios and force them to start season 5 right then and there. Just keep watching. I guarantee that it gets so much better.
9.0~I don't know why some of you hate the show but in my opinion it couldn't be written better. So stop acting like series master and actually watch it till the end . Acting is great although Jax could be played by someone else but it's still great actor and his accent is great in the show. Soundtracks of the show are going really nice with the show and mood of certaing scenes and cuts. So before typing something with voting 1 of 10 actually get all points of view of the show. Yea show isn't masterpiece but it really puts you in to watch till the end. If you don't like the show its because you don't like that type of the series, go watch Game of Thrones or something that you are interested more than this. I really love the show can't wait for season 6 and I hope for exciting end. Actors are very well chosen for the show except Jax could be played by someone more like John Teller. Cheers
10.0~I can't even start to explain how much i'm hooked on this show,i absolutely LOVE it! Great storyline,great flow of the story,a lot of twists,fantastic actors and actresses and great production. Love the whole idea.If you like:drama,criminal conspiracies,love stories,family feuds and comedic moments,this is the perfect show for you. You'll find yourself crying at one point,laughing at another.I can't exclude how AMAZING the music is,every song is perfect for an according moment,either sad,blow-up things in the air moments,happy moments,moments of regret,you name it.Overall,i love,love absolutely LOVEE this series and i place SOA in my top 5,being my #1! My personal favorite characters are Jax,Gemma,Juice and Tig. Watch it,you won't regret it!
5.0~I've heard of the show but at face value did not look like something I would enjoy. After watching every episode, it was okay, good. The first season was rough. I really thought the show was overrated, but I forced myself to watch season 2 and it got better. The show is not binge worthy. It is better to watch on occasion. There are a lot of sex scenes most are unnecessary to the story. Give it try, watch at least two or three seasons before you give it up. By the end of the series you will have an emotional investment.
4.0~OK, If you have not watched this show, you are not missing anything. I still don't get why this series have a high score(8.xx my ass). I think people who write reviews above 6 are not putting any attention to whats going on in the screen. To be short in my review I must say that this series is like watching a Chuck Norris films but without him, the acting is bad, really, every episode you see a situation in which you expect everybody die , but no, the SOA are like Chuck Norris, they don't have a rival whatsoever. They go dress in black from here to there and no one knows who they hell they are, the police is a joke. Every time they arrest some member of this clan suddenly they go free somehow. I laugh my ass out when they go killing everyone without any retaliation from anyone. If you expect something realistic with this one you are going to be disappointed. This series is a weak effort to show something nasty to people, but unlike Breaking Bad, you don't see any real character or something, there is no starring role in this one, which is really lame, everyone is a protagonist and suddenly everyone is a f...ing philosopher and knows how to deal with almost every problem. Are we talking of a bikers gang? I don't see any white trash or redneck in this series, instead a group of vigilantes watching over everyone.
10.0~I started watching this show a few years ago and have finally finished the series. Amazing writing, action packed, edge of your seat in every episode kind of show. One of the absolute best ever created in my opinion. SO many twists and turns and characters you can identify with and get interested in to the point you just cant stop watching. Really enjoyed every episode and I will be watching again. Can't praise this high enough. A must see! Reviewed by: Marcus Drew, 5656 Clara Street, Bell Gardens, CA
10.0~Where to begin? I started watching this, after getting together with my partner, as he had previously been into it. And since that moment from watching the first season, we've seen the whole series, several times online. The writing behind the show, is so good. It's around a pretty cool subject, of Harley Davidsons! And has paired it with great actors. And Tommy Flanagan's Scottish accent is to die for as Chibs. It does have a lot of violence in!, but that coupled with character development, is a to die for combination. @RebeccaKLxo
9.0~Before I start I am gonna warn you there are spoilers ahead please don't read if you haven't watched all the episodes already. Television show Sons of Anarchy follows the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle club. Clay, the president wants to keep things dangerous and lucrative while VP and stepson Jax influenced by his dead farther's journal wants to make things more legitimate. SoA is an extremely good show and I throughly enjoyed my 2 week Netflix binge. I find it hard to write how good this show is due to the fact it has so many layers and things going on that effect your emotions. The acting is second to none from all of the main cast, truly phenomenal performances by Katey Sagal, (Gemma Teller Morrow) Ron Perlman (Clarence 'Clay' Morrow) both of which give chillingly good performances I saw the start of pitch perfect 2 the other day and I can't look past Katey Sagal being the manipulative, cunning and down right psycho she ends up becoming in SoA. (A credit to her acting, also props for her singing in some of the songs through the series she really dose an amazing job, pleasantly surprised.) Ron gives a performance with just as good attributes, minus the singing, the way he deals with getting stripped of his patch and by the end he some how made me feel a little sorry for him, how he gets me to feel such strong hate and sorrow for him is a show of his fantastic acting. Charlie Hunnam as the main man, Jackson 'Jax' Teller people have criticised his performance but I thought he really got the conflicted emotions across to the viewer superbly well. I can not stress enough how good other supporting actors are tho, the rather weird and complex Alex 'Tig' Trager played by Kim Coates is hugely underrated for me never gets mentioned. One of my favourites was Tommy Flanagan as Filip 'Chibs' Telford a true bad ass and really comes in his own in season 3 I think it is. I felt the writing to be shy of the quality of acting at times especially in the more intense scenes I found it to be disappointingly predictable. I found it hard to really care about Theo Rossi's character Juan Carlos 'Juice' Ortiz that was mostly down to the poor script, for him especially, than his acting chops. The cinematography, the long panning landscape shots of the crew riding together with whatever scenery they find themselves in seemingly made beautiful be it suburban, country grassland or just highway roads. The music is extraordinary they manage to find (to me) completely unknown artists that do unique, clever, covers of some really famous songs some of my favourites are The White Buffalo - The House of The Rising Sun, Jamey Johnson, Twiggy Ramirez & Shooter Jennings - You Are My Sunshine, Alison Mosshart & The Forest Rangers - What a Wonderful World and Audra Mae & The Forest Rangers - Forever Young. All amazing, not only this but they have a range of ordinal pieces that hold their own too. I have a lot of the songs from all seasons 1-7. I can not express how remarkable the music for this show is, gets the tone and the mood of each scene and episode perfectly right. The plot in the show is a massive highlight too for large portions of seasons I didn't have a clue how things were gonna turn out the unpredictability of Jax's temperament really made for a range of different outcomes all equally possible. Overall I think Sons of Anarchy is worth your time, with sensational acting, music and story it is a strong 9/10.
10.0~The depth of each character of the MC unfolds with each episode, even now in the sixth season. You feel the struggle each one faces, and you either empathize with them, criticize them or ostracize them. The grittiness, raw emotion and overall amplified rush will have your lust and complete devotion. You will continue to be rooting for the antagonists in this show! At times, it jaw-dropping, heart-wrenching and undeath defying. If you have loved older shows such as the Wire, and The Shield then you shouldn't miss Sons of Anarchy. It is already said to live to at least 8 seasons. Don't miss out!
8.0~This is not a perfect show or even a great one but it is one I would highly recommend to anyone who likes a good story and this is a good story about love, hate and the ties that bind and choke you to death. The acting is wonderful by everyone; most notably Katey Sagal who gives the performance of a lifetime as the Matriarch of an outlaw biker club. This is not a show for everyone and it sometimes gets lost in its own drama but I disagree that season 7 was a letdown. I think it was a necessary outcome of everything that came before; a man with nothing to lose and nothing to live for. SOA is not the greatest show of all time but it sure was one of hell of a fun ride.
3.0~Okay so after hearing from many sources that Sons of Anarchy is a great TV show i decided to give it a shot. I found the pilot episode rather boring and so decided to give the show a fair chance and watched another 8 episodes. The problem with this show is that they are trying to mix a soap and a gangster drama like sopranos. Now even i critiqued that sopranos could have done with more action but sons of anarchy takes it to a whole new level. The show so far has lacked a proper long term story-line. Its almost like watching a CSI Miami episode where there is a new story every episode with a very minimal attention to the overall story. Like in one of the episodes Jax, one of the main characters is in a vehicle transporting a dead body with some of his gangster buddies. A cop who has his sights set on their gang decides to pull them over and so to deal with the issue Jax pulls over and just as the police officer exits his car, another vehicle filled with Jax's friends rear ends the cop. As the cop turns around to look at the situation Jax exits his car and slashes the cops tires with a knife. Now the cop shoots at their tires as they drive off and thats where this entire dilemma ends.... cops don't even show up to arrest the crew... the show makes it really clear the cop knows each and every gang member. Why don't the cops do anything... Well two episodes later Jax goes into the police station to tell the same police officer that there is an FBI agent in the city harassing his girl, instead of the cop remembering their confrontation he is all like "omg no way,i knew something was up!" and swears to deal with the situation. Now i was like what the.., it gets even better Jax later calls the same police officer on his phone number( why does he have his cellphone number?! i thought they were supposed to hate each other) and says the FBI agent hasn't left. The cop tells Jax that he is going to go talk to the FBI agent and that he is at the barber shop, Jax goes to the barber shop and beats agent really badly. Now Jax's alibi is that he was getting a haircut and the agent attacked him, now I'm thinking well how did you beat the cop to the scene, how did you have the time to have the entire fight and then claim you were getting a haircut?.. the cop told you the location!! There are so many plot holes that this show can be painful to watch. Like the club president gets called in for questioning and he is smoking a Cuban cigar with the police chief(who is allied with the gang),okay fine you have the police chief in your pocket but like how are you discussing illegal activities with the police chief, in his office while his door is open?! like in one of the scenes the cop who is set out to arrest the club walks by and gives the president the "I'm on to you" look as he sees him smoking the Cuban with the chief. Now to make things even worse the president convinces the police chief to arrest the opposing gang leaders so he can discuss business and beef with them in the police holding cell.This show is a soap and that's all it is.. Even the battles are dumb, like in one of the biggest battles the Latino gang is completely surrounded and is being shot at by automatic weapons and shotguns, you see a few people get shot but then in the end they all drive off and not a single person on either side dies... How do people love this show? and to think i heard from a few sources that this show is better than Breaking Bad and Sopranos. Oh yeah and the FBI agent, Jax kills him in the girls house with a shot to the head and then has sex with the girl next to his dead body...
8.0~from what i saw of this show,i liked it.it's probably a bit rough for some people though,what with the language and the gritty realism.it doesn't hold too much back in that regard.i can say this because i lived with members of a bike club at one time,and they pretty much act the same way as they are portrayed in the series.it doesn't air in Canada,as far as i know,so the only option is to catch it on DVD so far.it definitely isn't for everyone.one of the biggest reasons i was interested in seeing the show was Katey Sagal,whom i had only previously known from Married with Children and 8 Simple Rules.i must say,she is really impressive in "Sons".not once was i reminded of her other characters.obviously she is a very gifted actress.the rest of the cast is also superb.if you don't mind strong language and violence,give this show a shot.you might enjoy it.for me,"Sons of Anarchy" is an 8/10
10.0~Not A lot of people know this but Kurt Sutter the writer and the creator of Sons Of Anarchy Was actually going ahead against another show that HBO was doing about an outlaw motorcycle club and basic cable was able to beat a premium channel. The is very creative in so many ways there a lot of shows out there about crime and a lot of them don't really hit on the stress that it brings on the criminal's and how they have to deal with it. The character development is incredibly good because The main Character Jax Teller who is played by Charlie Hunman Starts to realized where he at in his life and decides which direction he wants to go with out the help of his family because they think he weak when he wants to the club in legitimate business instead of running guns up the west coast for the IRA. His Step father Clay Morrow is played by Ron Perlman and I felt he stays evil through the entire series because he old, he has arthritis in his hands, and he used up basically. But since he knows he done soon so he trying to go out with a play and just try and make as much money as he can get his hands no matter what the coast is. The show will anybody mind
9.0~There always comes a moment in someone's life when a motorcyclist cuts him/her off. Most people react in anger, if not they are probably texting or high off their ass. After watching the show, Sons of Anarchy, I felt connected to the motorcyclists for some time, it was as if I could finally see the camaraderie that comes with being part of a club. Of course that only lasted a short time, which ended once a motorcyclist flipped me off for braking at a yellow light when I could've continued. SOA is a fantastic show, one that grips you from beginning to the end, it is my second favorite show so far, only behind the perfection that is Breaking Bad. The show starts off with the fantastic song by The Black Keys 'Hard Row', and even though I felt nothing for the main character at that point, I knew that he made driving a motorcycle look Bad-Ass. The pilot feels a bit jumbled, I probably only remembered three character's names by the end of it, but I quickly became engrossed by the aspect of a gang of that was based around the almost poetic freedom of riding a Harley. After the pilot, I knew that I had to continue watching, but I never expected to really car for the characters as much as I do now. The writing beautifully unravels the story, which many point out is quite similar to Hamlet. There isn't really fantastic camera work in relation to characters, but I have to say that the scenic shots of the Sons riding down the highway made it feel almost as if you were there, witnessing a roaring and unstoppable beast rip through the wastelands of California. SOA is an amazing show, one that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end, and for my fellow binge-watchers an experience almost on par to that of Breaking Bad.
1.0~There must be so many more delusional pervos out there than I suspected. Onanistic Male Fantasy Scenarios, meet Bad Writing, and it's friend Worse Acting. If you like this, you're the kind of person who mistakenly thinks motorcycles and leather jackets are cool. Have fun at your oppressive day job. Since I need ten lines of text to post this, my husband and I actually counted the turdy male fantasies in this show...the number is high. This is what I call a lowest common denominator show, if you like it, congrats you are the lowest common denominator. I bet you just looove Jackass. Maybe you only have sons. Maybe your girlfriend has a tramp stamp and you think it's sexy. Oh yeah, way to fail at an American accent.
10.0~Great show, you can really connect to the carachters! Jebu majku svi
5.0~I watched the first season out of curiosity. I found the characters rather interesting and the actors excellent, so is the direction. However, the scripts are a bit basic and I did not manage to get much more into it. I guess it is entertaining but I am expecting a series to make me want to follow the story, which unfortunately wasn´t the case.
10.0~SOA is the best show on t.v. period. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat! The show is pretty realistic too. My husband and I are into motorcycle gangs and love watch documentaries about them and this show stays true to club roots. You can never predict what is going to happen next because the show always takes does a 180 and people you don't expect to die, leave or turn do and thats what makes the show so good. The actors are perfect, not one person on the show seems fake or has bad acting. The scenes are intense and believable. I LOVE this show and I try and turn as many people as I can to it. I'm going to buy all the seasons on DVD so when my son gets older he can watch them because I guarantee this show will go down in history. It's just a awesome show and I haven't yet to meet a person who doesn't like it.
10.0~I really don't get the people rating this 1 star etc. This easily for me one of the best TV series i have ever had the pleasure of watching up there with The wire,24 and the sopranos. Every episode has plenty of action and sure its a bit over the top sometimes but who cares honestly. I particularly love the character Kim Coates plays Tig who just gets better all the time. I have watched SOA up till the most recent episode on my own and i am currently near the end of season 3 with my wife so keep up the brilliant work Love it! Also what more do you need when Robocop himself Mr Peter Weller is involved lol. Great actors all playing their part and i just cant wait to see more.
10.0~I am a relatively new fan of the sons, but I have to admit I am completely addicted. The deep ongoing plot lines that keep you guessing right up until the season finale combined with the random twists complications that arise make Sons of Anarchy. The acting is stellar by anyone's definition, and the characters all have well defined personalities that are never compromised. So yeah, I absolutely love this show. But the reasons I just listed are not the only ones. Currently I am taking a college course on modernism, and as I watched Season 2 of SOA, I could not help but notice the symbolism that permeates this show. For those who aren't familiar with the subject, modernism is basically a social movement that was sort of a knee-jerk reaction to the failures of institutions like the government and the church prior to approximately the seventeen hundreds. This knee-jerk reaction resulted in a complete change in the way our societies operate and the things they value. I saw this starting to take place toward the end of season one, when Clay and Tig bought Stahl's lies and tried to rub out Opie, with the assassination attempt landing Opie's wife, Donna. Jax and Piney later find out about this huge mistake and are livid about it. They both realize a change needs to be made, and they both turn their backs on the power and authority that has ran SAMCRO for decades, looking to the teaching's of Jax's birth father, John Tellar for guidance. The ensuing conflict between Jax's vision for the club and Clay's desire for the club nearly tear SAMCRO apart, just as the world sometimes has over conflicting views on how to run things. Another more personal thing I notice is the struggle within Jax. You can tell as the viewer that a part of him sincerely wants to be a good father to his son, Abel and a loyal and loving companion to his girlfriend, Tara. However, he was raised in the MC world, and he cannot turn his back on the life of crime he leads with the club. He is comfortable with that life and it is the only life he has ever known. He cannot make the two lives coincide with one another, so eventually he is going to have to choose. As a Christian who did some really stupid things and enjoyed living a life filled with all kinds of evil prior to my conversion, I understand this struggle. There are still days where I sometimes think about going back to the life I had before, because sometimes it just seems easier and more comfortable than the life I am leading now. But as a Christian, I found something that keeps me from going back, and that is my relationship with Jesus. For Jax, I don't know what it will be, but I do hope he finds what he is looking for, just as I do for the rest of you.
1.0~Well someone somewhere thought 'hey what if we put the Sopranos on bikes and gave them loads of tattoos' and the other Idiot in the room said 'great Idea, have some money!' I have to confess I have only watched the first episode but on the 'strength' of what I have seen I will not be watching any more. The Sopranos drew you in and after a few series I realised that they were all evil people with no redeeming features but I did watch all of them. Ten minutes in to this and you realise they are ALL vile, corrupt, hypocritical murderous psychopaths and that's just the women! I think you are supposed to empathise with the son but he brutally beats some guy to a pulp over something I have no doubt he would condone if the guy had been wearing his colours.The 'bad' guys seem to be distinguished only by the fact that they are even uglier than the SOA! Its just a series about a bunch of lowlife scum, why we need to see or 'explore'this incredibly seedy,sleazy and worthless aspect of modern life is beyond me.This series cheapens us all.I knew how this episode would end about half way through and it was so clichéd I burst out laughing.Pathetic.
10.0~Online reviews are promising at first, but quickly show their crap colors. As many have said, they are nothing but trolls with absolutely asinine things to say. In this fantasy land, any fat nerd up at 2am in between porn masturbation sessions, has something insightful to say; at least in the capacity that their hot pocket and red bull-driven insecure rants will allow. And in this fantasy, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE could care less about what your ridiculous opinion is. Each review starts with some dumb troll saying something dumb, while other dumb trolls agree with what the original dumb troll said, because dumb trolls all like to be publicly negative together instead of just focus on what they DO like rather than what they DON'T like. Like these people have nothing better to do with their lives than to sit there and talk crap on a show beloved by millions of people because their lives are so miserable? Sons of Anarchy is amazing, get into it.
3.0~With a weekly death toll usually reaching 3 figures and at least a couple of gratuitous head mushing incidents an episode this relies heavily on a shock factor to try and raise this above the level of what it actually is, a soap opera. As far as soap goes it's pretty awful, lacking plot and character depth. From the middle aged transvestites, the compulsive masturbating to the racist Nazii's this thing images no effort to disguise the fact that it is a freak show. I watch in the hope of seeing long serving characters die a horrible death as there is not one likable character in the whole show. The small town of Charming is a joke, Walton Goggins in a dress with huge fun bags just about sums this show up.
10.0~Superb musical montages which tell as much of the story as the rest. Good and detailed plot, tightly scripted and well acted. Directed and edited to perfection. Manages to capture what feels like a very real sense of brotherhood and what it means to be a man in a hostile world, yet remembers to include the women and their role too. Avoid if you don't specifically want to see gore, a bit of female flesh and drug use. If you can accept that as part of the plot and appreciate quality TV, you gotta watch it and give it your full attention. Great story told well. Can only think of a few TV drama series that are on a par with this.
10.0~Great show in which you get attached to the characters. It's dark and gritty in places and funny in other places. Makes you want to go out and get a Harley and a cut! The first series takes some time to get going but once you're in you cant stop watching. Some characters hang around a little too long. The final series is barbaric and a little unbelievable for the first few episodes but once you understand where Jax is taking the club it becomes really watchable. There are some cheesy scenes and the car/bike chase bits could be a little more original but otherwise its a great watch. Hopefully there will be a prequel.
10.0~I did not know who Charlie was until the first episode of "Sons of Anarchy " so I went in blind. What a fantastic surprise to find an actor of Charlie Hunnam's calibre in what I thought would be your basic " biker" show !! He is an awesome talent and deserves and will one day win an Academy Award. I have since discovered he is an awesome human being period as is Charlie's long time beautiful lady Morgana McNeils, a jewellery designer in LA. Both are down to earth people who shun the glitz of Hollywood preferring to do their own thing. Charlie is very very aware of how much his fans love and follow him and does his best to give his fans time for autographs and photo ops no matter how busy he is or what physical condition he may be due to the rigorous time schedule he follows. Charlie is definitely destined to be THE BEST STAR OF HIS GENERATION bar NONE!! We love you Charlie and respect your privacy! Please keep up the excellent work which you do for all the world to see! May you and your lovely lady Morgana have a long happy life together Charlie!
10.0~This is by far one of my Favorite series, Ever! I think they did an amazing job at casting these characters. I wondered if we were to rotate some of the characters around, how it would have turned out, but I must say... Don't change a thing! I absolutely love it!! I am looking forward to the spin off series of the Mayans... However, I wish it was the story of the First 9.... And if it really is about the First 9, I'm even More excited! Kurt, I am an actor myself, and would Love to be part of this cast! Not to mention, I get told I look like Jax all the time! Lol! But Great job Everyone! All the Actors did an Amazing Job! I loved the iconic actors involved as well! Mixing the cast, to not an All Popular cast, was smart. I love when you get the mix of popular stars and not so popular stars, because when you're a follower of certain actors (like Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal), you then find more actors (like Charlie Hunnam, Kim Coates, & Theo Rossi, to name a few) you love and now want to see All the stuff they've been in. I will say, I loved Every actor on there! And am now a fan of a Lot of these actors! Thank you for that! ...patiently waiting for the next series...
5.0~I read a review of this moronic show that compared it to Hamlet. Well, friends, Charming, CA ain't Denmark but there's something' rotten in it: This series. What amazing talent, though. Ron Perlman, who has done European art films. Charlie Hunnam, who has done Dickens for BBC. Kate Sagal, who was the iconic wise-ass mama of "Married With Children". Kim Coates who has played countless psychos to perfection. On and on. What the hell are all these great people doing in this turkey? The pay scale must have been tremendous. My major objection is an ethical one: This series portrays violence and crime as admirable pursuits with dignity. This is not only false to the core, but it is at the root of its poor writing and poor acting by some great actors. I watched several streamed episodes of the first season on Netflix out of pure boredom. I can't even begin to imagine who sponsored this trash when it had commercials. Harley Davidson? Male jock-itch cream? Dominos Pizza? My rating of 5 is too generous, but it is a pity vote for the good actors who felt needy enough to submit to this bad writing.
10.0~Sons of Anarchy is simply a marvelous depiction of life in the criminal underworld of biker clubs. The quality of acting in this series puts many television series to shame. Every actor did an incredible performance, particularly the main cast which is seen throughout. The character development, the twists and turns and all the things this MC goes through, drives one to binge-watching. One falls in love with the characters, as bad and evil as they become, and of course, with some, all you can think about is exacting the worst possible pain on them for their acts. I could never return to watching a superficial CSI series, with bland acting and Hollywood models, after watching Sons of Anarchy - because these actors were the real thing. I never cried at the end of a single TV series in my entire life - but as the final episode neared the end, I couldn't help it. I was living every second of the story until the last second. I'm told that it didn't get more awards because of the "violence" depicted, and on that count I say this - HYPOCRITES. Are you kidding me. These bubble-gum CSI and murder series which abound on television are just as violent, whereas with Sons of Anarchy, it depicts the reality of an entire sub-culture which exists not only in America, but around the world. It has no equal. Watch it folks. You will lose sleep.
7.0~The first seasons I really enjoyed this show. It was refreshing, easy to watch, and the plot was interesting enough to keep you entertained. Normally I hope that good shows go on forever but with this one I was actually glad it came to an end. I mean how long can you go on being at war with every possible other gang? There was just a little bit too much betrayal for me. There is betrayal in gangs like that but not of those proportions like in the show. The characters were all OK, some were very detestable at the point you really wished they died but that's a good thing because it meant that the actor did a good job making his role believable. Some other actors were not very believable to me as bad ass bikers. To me the plot started good, then it went downwards with too much back and forth problems between the different gangs, but then the last season was back on track with a good ending. Nice show to watch once.
9.0~One of my all-time favourite TV shows. A must watch
10.0~The best motorcycle gang tv series in a long while! Storyline: NAILED IT, Plot: NAILED IT, Actors: NAILED IT, Every Single episode: BLOWN AWAY!!!
10.0~Sons of Anarchy is a phenomenal TV show. It is very underrated and should go down as one of the top 10 of all time.The show is non stop action but also has a very good storyline. The writing by Kurt Sutter is also outstanding. The characters he created aren't just regular TV show characters, they are incredibly unique. For instance, Chibs. He is not the typical kind of guy you would see in a California MC, but it was the creativity of Kurt Sutter that incorporated him. I have watched Breaking Bad, Prison Break, Person of Interest, and SOA and SOA is without a doubt the second best one. If you have Netflix, watching it is very easy to do. I absolutely recommend SOA!
9.0~Just finished this show and I miss it already . Kurt Sutter really created something perfect with the right amount of love/hate in every character and makes you feel in love with the show for the first minute of running until the very last second . I think I never liked a character so much like I did with Jax Teller (with the great performance of Charlie Hunnam being a bad-ass biker with a philosophical mind that really make you think that every bad decision he makes is the right one) . I am not a very social person but seeing the brotherhood and love that this bikers have for each other really makes me want to be in that kind of weird relationship.
10.0~When I started this series, I was expecting a cheesy biker show. Boy, was I ever wrong. 1) The acting is phenomenal. These high-caliber actors are so believable as grungy bikers, I had to double check their backgrounds myself. The cast is comprised of very well-trained actors who take their craft seriously, and their dedication truly reflects on screen. 2) The writing is extremely compelling. Every season not only has depth & complexity to the story lines, but all have jaw-dropping season finales that leave you wanting more. The mafia-like lifestyle portrayed is intriguing, as you have violent criminals who will go to any lengths to protect their families & club. There is love and spite, tenderness and toughness, humor and horror, loyalty and betrayal, and endless twists, turns and surprises--creating a very well-rounded series. Great job SOA crew, look forward to more entertainment to come!
10.0~This series is as good as The Shield and Sopranos was, which for me means it is as good as it gets. It is fun and mature action packed Drama and the storyline is just perfect! I do not understand why it is not even more popular than what it seem to be. If you like Dexter, Prison break, Carnival, Oz and other such great series you will also love this one. The whole thing is a kind of harsh and epic story about an Outlaw brotherhood unfolding and the depth of the characters, even the ones which are unsympathetic, are what really keeps the series going. I hope we get at least 4 seasons of this future classic! 10/10
5.0~I only recently started watching this show. In the last 3 weeks I've watched season 1 to season 6. So unlike other reviewers I have not spent 5 years watching this show. Firstly this show is Hamlet re-imagined if you've seen Hamlet (or any Shakespeare movie) you will identify similarities and draw comparisons between the two. The problem is where Shakespeare is masterful...Sons of Anarchy is frustrating, full of plot holes, full of unbelievable "factuals", stupid and the show treats its audience as dumb as the "White Trash" characters in it. While I'm not going to ruin this show with spoilers I will say this - Laws and legal matters that are handled in this show are terrible and not even in the realm of believable. Affidavits submitted by felons or people related to felons, warrants issued based of these affidavits (btw warrants usually take more than a day to process unlike this show which seems to process them in about 20min in real time), retired federal agents or agents related to people involved in the crime or victims (conflict of interest). Also under the Fourth Amendment, 95% of the legal matters within this show (which make up a great deal of the show) are bulls**t. It throws the show even further when everyone has such a convoluted agenda...99.9999% of people in reality aren't generally as complicated as every character is on this show. When can we have a show were the drama feels real? the characters are believable? the show makes sense?
9.0~Very hooked on this show. I like the fact that one qualifies as a "good guy." Virtually everyone has an illegal demon in their closet. Pretty typical in a Shakespeare tragedy. It's easy to find a character who is interesting, but difficult to find one to root for. I hope they take advantage of the Agent Stahl character. She's a hoot. Definitely a woman operating in a man's world there.The sound track is excellent. It has a very blues/alternative country feel. I especially liked the instrumental "Fortunate Son" and the season ending "John the Revalator" A big fan of Ron Perlman, but would have liked to see what Scott Glenn would have done in the role. It's good to see Katey Segal in action. She's the glue behind the scene holding the gang/family together. It will be interesting to see how they deal with the prospect getting his colors or not.
5.0~This show has gotten tiresome and very predictable,the dialog is negative & without substance or any real texture. Any human with a remotely functioning brain would have difficulties maintaining interest or a straight face through this now soap operaish dribble.. The plot similarities and story developments gives the viewer the feeling the real culprits in this fast decline are the writers and producers of this once promising dramatic series. I've noticed even the actors appear to look tired of the same boring lines. Unfortunately this program has now fallen into the Soap pit of creative writing. I can only hope the end comes soon and by the look on the faces of some of the regulars on the show,it not be soon enough.
1.0~I might just watch it all again to find out a)The total number of deaths; b)How many times people call each other "bro", "momma" or "homes" c) How many times the phrase "We need to get the Intell" is used. The show is extremely clichéd and predictable. At best it is a cross between the A-Team and The Cannonball Run. Except for Jimmy Smits the acting was poor. Direction and continuity, well let us just say below par. The story-line was a little bit on the naive side. all credit to the actors and the crew for sticking with the synopsis for so many seasons. I watch all shows and movies from start to finish. There can be no comment if you do not complete the task.
10.0~I hadn't seen Sons of Anarchy and so many of my friends had. I sort of felt like I'd been left out of the loop so last month I started at the beginning and I must caution you that if you don't want to be addicted, don't watch this series. I've made it through the 4th season right now and it's like I have a person connection with all the characters. The writing is excellent and the depth of each individual is marvelous. I had spent time in youth with a friend of motorcycle club and had a great time. I think this is a good represntation of the type of lifestyle that happens. It is a very good show! I would recommend this series to anyone. Anyone that is who doesn't mind becoming addicted. I can't wait to see the next season, but I'm not sure if it is out yet.
6.0~I have not watched an entire series and only seen a few episodes so haven't become attached to the characters. The episodes I have seen are so idiotic and ridiculously insulting to the viewers I couldn't bare watching the following episode! The only distinguishing feature the "bikers" have is facial hair, but well groomed facial hair! Have the producers ever been around a gang? The few episode I have seen have the gangs murdering people and getting away with it due to stupidity so basically the gang is immune to prosecution! Everything that happens on the show is so predictable to the point of being boring! For example, one gang member was in a jail hospital and someone walks in and wants a written statement about another gang members involvement in crime. The gang members hand is set free to write the statement and surprise, surprise, he attacks the man! Honestly, if anyone enjoys this show, especially when the production is aimed at realism, they obviously don't have high standards or require thought provoking story lines! I have just watched a few more episode just to make sure my initial impression and opinion was correct and again, the show is beyond ridiculous! I have never come across "Bikie Gangs" that drink green tea and are as well groomed and clean as these bikies seem to be! Plus, there is no gang that wears it's colors all of the time like they do here! I really don't know what people are watching but it's definitely not the same show as I am watching! Maybe the people involved with the show have a lot of relatives! This show did have the potential to be great if the viewers were smart enough to complain about the ridiculous story lines from series 1! It occurs to me that this show is aimed at the simple viewers who don't mind idiotic representations of gangs!
5.0~This series used to have killing as needed. Jax is a sadistic psychopathic killer. He kills without remorse and then promises his wife that they will have a great life together. I do not understand how the club and all the others get away with all the killing, not to mention the other crimes. There are shoot outs in the middle ofOakland and not one police car responds. I used to live in Oakland andif there was a gunshot and there were always gunshots you would havesquad cars by the droves and complete with air support. I know that Charming is a fictional town but lets be a little realistic. What jail lets the guards pick out convicts who then beat an inmate to death while the guards watch. Then they let some guy in who we have yet to identify and he beats Otto to a pulp, again under the watchful eyes of the guards. anywhere. I think the violence has gotten out of hand. When Pope burned Trig's daughter alive was one of the most vicious and sickening sites on television. I served 24 years in the military and watching a person burn to death is no easy feat. I know that there has to be killing but I believe that it has to slow down or be less visual. As I pointed out before I have yet to see a cop (besides Charming's cops)question any of the members of SOA or any of their associates about any crime.
10.0~i've loved Sons since the first episode and it continues to get better, now we are close to the end of season 2. the primary story line is the conflict between the original MC club co founder, Clay and the son of the other co-founder Jacks. the conflict is played out perfectly as it grows from episode to episode culminating in , well i don't want to spoil it, but really great writing. the acting is 100% top notch, Charlie Hunnam is perfect in this roll, Ron Perlman who is not my fav actor from other movies is brilliant, Katey Sagal is awesome and the list just goes on, not a bad roll in the whole show. the only small grip i have is Tommy Flanagan (great acting BTW) who is very obviously Scottish and sounds it, plays an Irish man, which is odd because every thing else in the story line makes sense, why make such an obvious error? Kurt Sutter is a freaking' genius writer to come up with such compelling stories every episode and keep the pace ever building, just like in the Shield which he has now relegated to the second best TV show ever. i just hope season 3 stays this strong, i'm sure it will and maybe Kurt Sutter need to write a movie, movies seem to suck compared to TV these days.
2.0~Sons of Anarchy, an unfailingly coarse yet brashly effective series that burrows into the workings of the titular outlaw motorcycle club, it seems to be bloody, disturbing and maniacally addictive. Gritty and occasionally violent, Sons was created by Kurt Sutter, an executive producer on "The Shield." As "The Shield" prepares to bow out, Sons should capably fill the smart, testosterone-fueled void. I do think it has real potential to become a solid dramatic addition to the FX slate, as The Shield enters its final season. This show will make you THINK and I know some of you may not want to think or take on deep cultural or moral issues but every once and awhile your brain needs some stimulus and so does your soul most importantly. This show sneaks in Philosophy and makes you like it. Sons of Anarchy will force you to laugh, to cry, to love and to be free.
2.0~I feel compelled to write these comments as the stratospheric high reviews are misleading. The format and premise are promising- a modern day biker gang struggle with relationships, illegal gunrunning, competing gangs and how to walk around in a leather jacket without looking like a total idiot most of the time. Sadly, this is just a poorly written soap opera - the acting is variable and occasionally comical, the main characters are wholly unconvincing as tough MC club members (I have some knowledge of such things) and the male relationships are as homoerotic as those in Top Gun - which, lets be honest, set the benchmark in such matters. The worst aspects of this overblown nonsense is the predictability of the plots, and the by-numbers skirmishes where the whole MC crew appear to be bullet- proof and legendary combat specialists, rather than overweight drunken louts with mummy issues. Look, it has a degree of watch-ability and may pass some time on a Sunday afternoon if there's nothing else on, but the ridiculous scores of 8 plus puts this drivel in Breaking Bad territory, and I'm not having that.
3.0~Full of clichés, bravado and posturing. Almost totally predictable. We know the bad guys will lose, in almost every confrontation, every fight, and of course, in the end. In every gun fight bullets almost always seem to miss our heroes, and the "bad" guys almost always exist for the sole purpose of being beaten to a pulp by the main characters. Even when the bad guys are two to one, and holding guns against our heroes, we know they are seconds from being overpowered and beaten. Season 3 was a let down too, as we continue to watch the bad guys committing monumental errors of judgement. An FBI agent that has staked her whole career and life into capturing a famous terrorist, to the point of murdering her colleague and cutting deals with gang members. Yet, after 12 whole episodes and once finally in possession of the terrorist, she decides to stay alone, without protection inside known gangland territory, and get ambushed and killed. In anything vaguely resembling reality, a known terrorist arrest would involve a detachment of an army unit for everyone's protection. The main characters are similarly badly scripted, with sociopathic and schizophrenic behaviour, including a loyal gang member whose wife and mother of two young kids is murdered by the gang leaders, yet he remains loyal in the gang. I can't write more the whole thing is so terrible and now I am watching how the bad guys will get beaten too, it's just a matter of seconds... Hmm by the time I wrote this, the bad guys, the Russians, in full control of the situation, just sit there and become punch bags for our heroes to shine once again. Why even bother showing it since we know how it's going to end...
8.0~To be quite frank when I had first seen the coming attractions for FX's new bad-ass biker T.V show the only thought that popped into my head was "Great, another *BANG BANG* exploding gang violence drama". And from what I could gather, that was a pretty popular consensus. But i decided to give "Sons Of Anarchy" the benefit of the doubt and watch the pilot. And let me tell you, Kurt Sutter slapped my previous opinion right in the face. Each member of the club has his/her own unique, individual personality. Like for example, Clay Morrow president of the club, first nine and revered as the foremost authority on all club and domestic matters. Or Alex "Tig" trigger the Sgt. At Arms; Clay's right hand man and a violent and horny sadistic animal with a passion for bedding whores and biting off chunks of peoples ears. And then there is the main protagonist, Jackson Teller the young Vice President whose deeply conflicted on the matter of where this club is and where its going. So while the action can be somewhat repetitive and the show can often become predictable. I find myself coming back week after week to see these characters that i have an inexplicable connection to.
10.0~I am writing this review to let people know that Sons of Anarchy is a well written, well acted, drama. When I first heard people talking about this show "as the best series since the Sopranos". I rolled my eyes...a lot!(I loved the Sopranos and am sick of the comparisons). However from the first episode to the last of season 1, I have become a huge fan. The characters are great and all are portrayed in such a way that you want to learn more about them. Even Tig with his fetishes, and Gemma with her over-the-top, protective, psycho Mom, shtick. You will find yourself wanting to watch more, wrapped up in a "what's going to happen next?" frenzy!!
10.0~I love this show, and cant believe I didn't watch it before. But at some level I'm happy about that, because now I can enjoy five whole seasons without a break and then the sixth season will be up in the fall. Its so exiting, and it really leaves you breathless at some points. You end up sitting on the tip of the couch leaning against the TV (or pc) and wonder whats gonna happen next. I think the cast is amazing, they are growing on me for every episode too. If you think you have to love bikes and tattoos to watch this show, you're wrong. Its a good show for everybody, not kids though obviously, but you get what I mean. Go Jax!
1.0~If you are simple minded, coarse and gullible, and also like racial slurs and constant juvenile level filthy language, then Sons of Anarchy is for you. Lot's of P words and constant Jesus Christ cuss words. It was like listening to middle schoolers trying to impress each other. It was beyond over the top. The story line is so weak, only a simple minded individual would find it good. I can't think of another way to describe it other than very cheesy.
1.0~Have you ever seen a real motorcycle gang? Well this group of pretty boy actors are about the complete opposite of the real deal. It's ironic that some of the plot revolves around them laundering money through a porno, when the acting is as bad as an porno with to much script .everything feels so set up and staged it feels like I'm watching a theater play
9.0~I originally began watching the show to see how realistic it would be. Living in that culture for many years, I know most people have no idea of the 'lifestyle'. I was pretty surprised as I have only found a few issues that were, in my opinion, not realistic. I would give it a 85-90% for accuracy. Much like other specific shows/plots, I really didn't expect this show to be very good, but I was pleasantly surprised and want to thank FX for doing some homework. The cast is extremely well picked and fits their personalities. I also highly suggest this series. Is it for everyone, of course not; but for those who want to see the 'other side' of life, it is not only fairly accurate but also very entertaining.......
9.0~Much like Breaking Bad, Sons Of Anarchy overall is a story of a tragic hero's descent and the overall arc of a Shakespearean tragedy. I thought Season 1 and 2 were great and a unique and stylistic and fun show (although season 2 was brutal), Season 3 is the one season where you'e just gonna have to sit through, it's oddly paced and the worst season. But Season 4,5,6 and 7 are some of the most intense, engrossing and riveting television I may have sit down and seen and Thank God it ends on a high note and end completely satisfied and emotional. The acting is also phenomenal. If you haven't seen it check it out. Overall: Season 1- 8.6/10 Season 2- 8.6/10 Season 3- 5.8/10 Season 4- 9.8/10 Season 5- 9.5/10 Season 6- 9.7/10 Season 7- 10/10
10.0~This is the best show ever !! This is just pure gold.... 10/10
6.0~I really don't understand which great mind decided to ruin this show in its last season. So many ridiculous scenes that the mind boggles. Season 7 is a mix of the 80s Chuck Norris movies and the 2000s B action movies. The plot is ridiculous, embarrassing and an insult to viewers intelligence and the show's history. The only good thing is that the final episode of the season finally arrived and it took the cast out of its misery. PS: the show has very good first few seasons, so if you haven't watch it, you should do it, just keep in mind that you will find a disaster in the final season.
2.0~I have seen so many rave reviews, my friends seem to think its awesome putting it in the same conversation as Breaking Bad. I tried one other time to watch a single show and recently watched season 1 to episode 6 and it just sucks to me. So many things just seem so far fetched. It plays out like a bad movie of the week back in the 80s. The gang reminds me of a grown up losers club from "it" I mean a biker gang that rides around .. everyone's wearing a helmet "safety first" all the bikes must have been purchased at the same time and they got a deal .. how else can they all be identical. The cuts they wear look like grranimals with their titles and names so perfect. Its just so cheesy I'm not even getting into characters or story lines(except Katy Segal I did like her and she made her part likable and somewhat believable). Nothing shocking no surprises and from the reviews I have read that agree it only gets worse. If you haven't seen or know nothing of a real biker gang .. this ain't it. I personally am moving on from this as it just isn't worth one more second of my time. Want a seriously awesome show out of the gate .. Ozark. Great acting, story telling and characters.(my opinion)
10.0~Charming in a small fictional town in Northern California in the United States, inhabits the club bikers Sons of Anarchy. The group deals with illicit activities such as drug trafficking and porn films and is led by Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) and Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam). Besides the effort to reconcile their employment with family and children, you have to live with their different opinions: while Morrow opts for violent tradition, Teller is inspired by the revolutionary rhetoric of the daily of his late father. One of the best series of all time, early action to an end, simply indescribable! Nothing I try to write about this series will measure how is a fantastic series, the first episodes you did not feel so much enthusiasm, but after about 10 episodes, you felt as if made part of it, really deserves to be in first place in the ranking of best series of all time!
9.0~This was a TV show on Netflix that i always saw but never watched a minute of. I took a chance on it when the show had just finished its final season and i must say it was one of the best decisions (tv wise) ive ever made. Sons of Anarchy has it all. Take a chance you won't regret it
10.0~I DVR'd SOA and I forgot I had it saved. I finally watched the 1st episode last week and I was hooked 5 minutes in. The show is a mix of The Sopranos and The Shield. The acting is top notch and as others have said, you find yourself rooting for the "bad guys" just like The Shield and The Sopranos. How cool is it seeing "Peggy Bundy" in a hardcore role? I also like the way there are several story lines developing, which allows you to attach yourself to several characters. I am anxiously awaiting season 2. My only fear is they may have gone to deep too quick, with lines in the club apparently being drawn with Jax & Piney vs. Clay, Tig and the hardcore members. But we'll see.Bring on season 2.
10.0~Every episode is packed full of brutal action that does not hold back at all. The casting done on this show is phenomenal, the main character Jax is spectacular and when watching the show its impossible not to root for him in every episode, he is a perfect symmetry of hardcore bad ass and caring friend. The show is one of my favorite shows on television if not my favorite by far. If you like brutal action or your into outlaw motorcycle clubs you will be in heaven watching this show, but i would recommend this show to anyone honestly. Its an easy 10/10 for me and I am curious why more people haven't rated this show. If you haven't seen this show at least give it a try, i guarantee after one episode you will be hooked.
6.0~I started this show thinking that I would absolutely love it and for a while, I did. It follows the journey of Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam), who is navigating his way as the VP of a motorcycle club led by his step-father Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman). The moral dilemma faced by Jax pertains to the practices of the club, his step- father's modus opearndi and life in general. In terms of sheer acting brilliance, Ron Perlman and Kim Coates stand head and shoulders above all other regular cast members. Both are superb and portray their characters with sheer conviction. Charlie Hunnam is also good in most places but stumbles in others due to his contrived accent, which can get rather annoying. Other annoyances, major ones at that revolve around the character of Titus Welliver and his horrific Irish accent. It becomes unbearable in many places. Jimmy Smits is also incredible, as he was in Dexter as Miguel Prado and so is Billy Brown, also seen in Dexter. Theo Rossi also does full justice to his part and shines with what is given My major gripes with the show are as follows: (1) A plot that jumps from one point to another with illogical transitions. Characters defy their normal behaviours randomly to do complete U-Turns (2) Some horrific accents, especially the Irish ones and overuse of the word "Darlin" by Katey Sagal and Charlie Hunnam. Absolute cringe worthy. (3) Most of the characters are rather unlikable except Ron Perlman's, Smit's and Billy Brown's plus Theo Rossi's. They are almost one dimensional, with little charisma, straight forward arcs (for the most part) and rather lackluster acting. (4) The script is severely deficient. I cannot remember a show that has fewer dialogues that can be remembered. Every conversation is so mundane, attempting to fit into the Southern Cali biker subculture that there's literally nothing to remember.
10.0~This series is very, very good! I see that some people think otherwise. For instance one guy who writes in the review that they got their bikes with them to Ireland....hmmm....well.....in the episode I watched the head of the Irish bikers said that they were gonna fix them some rides when they got there....or maybe I'm wrong....don't think so, though.The same guy wrote in his review that they didn't have their passports....strange....if you LOOK you clearly see them show their passports when they are stopped on the road in Ireland! I wish people have all the facts before just writing. Good actors, well written. At the end of each episode you just want to continue watching more. Well, of course everybody don't like to watch the same type of TV-series, but some people writing here have watched two or three seasons and think it's not for them.....but....why watch all those episodes if you don't like it? ..... I've started watching series and maybe after the first or second episode I realized that I didn't want to continue watching, so I stopped. I think this is great! Quite funny also, sometimes.
10.0~Due to my involvement as an Op in an irc chat channel where the other Ops are American I have been introduced to a number of US TV series. Having recently 'binge watched' Justified one of my US friends suggested I tried Sons Of Anarchy. Not being a fan of bikes and bikers I wasn't sure if I'd be able to stay with a series with this as the main premise but Boy was I wrong!!! I was hooked within a few episodes and proceeded to watch all 7 seasons in about 8 days. By the time my 'mega watch' ended I really cared about the central characters even though they were basically violent, amoral and psychotic. They perform criminal acts and many episodes are violent, very violent, to the extent that Game of Thrones is almost a kids tea party in comparison. But it works!! As I said the central characters are amoral but so are most of the people they are in contact with and they do actually have a pretty strict code of conduct but it's based on the kind of world they inhabit, not the normal, cosy world many viewers will be familiar with. The primary motivations behind many of their actions is to be totally loyal and to protect their 'family' and this is not just their own relatives but also the Sons Of Anarchy club itself. This overwhelming commitment to 'protect their own' is a strong thread throughout the show and I got drawn in. I found myself accepting much of what they did as I understood the reasons behind it. They make mistakes, get the 'wrong end of the stick' on occasions which leads to appalling acts of retaliation that the viewer knows are unjustified as we know more than the gang do - but I still maintained my affection for this bunch of misfits. One reason, I think, is that over the seasons the main characters are so well fleshed out, with their own unique personalities and foibles, that you really care that they get out of whatever the current situation is but at the same time you often have a sense of foreboding as to what their actions will lead to. I read some of the user reviews which were less than flattering and in every case the writer had only watched one or two seasons at the time of writing. So many of the comments are incorrect such as 'they always get away unscathed' etc. They don't! There are many sequences that stay in the mind long after viewing and many of those are because of the use of some incredible songs used as a backdrop to the visuals. As I don't like spoilers I don't plan to elaborate but I will say 'The Lost Boy' and 'Come Join The Murder' are two songs that remain in the memory long after the episode they were used in has ended because of the way they are used with the visuals. By the time I'd completed the final season I was genuinely sad that was it! I wanted to know how they got on in the future but by making me feel like this the writers have done their job. If you're are squeamish or have unflinching moral values this might not be for you but for anyone else I really would recommend giving it a try. I am so glad I did!!!
10.0~When this show was recommended to me I thought 'Bikers?.. Well, I don't know, doesn't sound that interesting.' I was WRONG! Just several minutes into the show I had realized this was something special. And that time I was right. This show is simply amazing. All the characters are played by great actors (looks like that they were written specially for them) and the story itself is very deep. If you have any doubts about it - don't. It is a must see. To make it short, just sit back, relax and enjoy this full-of-action series. Heck, I think I'll just go and start watching all the episodes all over again.
10.0~This show is one of the best I've seen(if not the best) and trust me, I've seen a lot. This show has everything you need:action,comedy,romance,crime,mystery,shootouts.. It's a show that you won't be able to forget and you're gonna love the characters ! This show is about a motorcycle club, a "gang" of outlaws, that runs the streets of Charming. They value very much loyalty and friendship and maybe that's the reason why I love it so much. The main character's name is Jackson "Jax" Teller and he's the Vice-President of SAMCRO(Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original) Charter. SAMCRO is the original charter of SoA and it originally contained 9 members, whom were called the "First 9". Among them were John Teller,the dead father of Jax, Clarence "Clay" Morrow,the actual President of the club and Jax's step-father. Clay married to Jax's mother, Gemma , not long after John Teller's death. The original charter was formed in Redwood County,Minnesota, therefor stands the name "Redwood Original".
1.0~I recommend the first 2 seasons. After that, it all went down hill after that. This show has a few satisfying moments, but in all it's not consistent. The first 2 seasons had lots of realism, but Kurt Sutter and his writers threw that out of the window a long time ago. Now its just car chases and seeing how much they can shove Gemma in your face. It used to be about bad ass bikers, and would successfully even out the FAMILY issues and BIKER GANG issues. But now, it's just about the family issues and Gemma. In all, it's not worth your time, I watch it every week only because I've been with it for so long. The show is nothing compared to shows like Breaking Bad or Justified. It is its own series, but that's not always a good thing... Season 1-8/10 Season 2-8.5/10 Season 3-5/10 Season 4-8/10 Season 5-6/10 Season 6-5/10
8.0~Im currently binge watching this show on Netfix and I cannot stop watching. It's so addictive and so very good. I haven't come across a show like this for a long time. My sister introduced it to me and I've been hooked since. I'm a bit of a Harley fan myself so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all the Harley's. And then I saw Jax and I think my girly romantic heart skipped a beat. In terms of the writing, producing, directing, etc. All excellent. The one thing, and trust me, it's the only thing, that is bugging me is the overuse of the phrase "Jesus Christ". This isn't a problem for me in terms of blasphemy but I hear it at least 5 times in each episode and it is kind of getting on my nerves now. For an English watcher, Im not sure on the regulations on swearing in the US. But they could try and broaden their cursing or outbursts. Other than that, this show is perfect. Surprises at every corner and moments you go "No way!" and "Dont do it!". I'd seen this show advertised before but never really looked further into it, regretting that now! It's excellent. Side note: be prepared for a lot of Charlie Hunman's butt. It's a true piece of art of which could be compared to Michaelangelo.
10.0~We were hooked on Sons of Anarchy after watching the first episode, the acting is first class and it actually has believable story lines. It makes a real change from all these hyped up US shows like Flashforward and the like which are rubbish. Was not sure they would be able to carry it to a second series as well, but so far it has been every bit as good (if not better)as the first series. The standout performance has to be Katey Sagal, she can be hard nosed and menacing one minute and generous and soft the next - a brilliant actress who deserves every award going for her portrayal of Gemma. The soundtrack is also awesome, some great music bringing something to emphasize the storyline brilliantly. All in all 10 out of 10, if you don't like this genre of programme think again, everyone should watch this.
10.0~I just recently finished my 4th re-watched and realized I haven't reviewed it yet! This show starts with such a high octane speed and it hardly ever quits. While it's not exactly the most poetic show, it does manage to let you ponder the meaning of life and which path you really want your life to take. Jax Teller the main protagonist turns from a man wanting to change the direction of his club to a stone cold murderer by the series end. All of the interaction with the police is a joke and is pretty much everything you'd see out of a Hollywood speed movie. These guys get away with crimes all of the time but each one pays the price from time to time, whether it be through themselves or someone personal to them. Everyone has a weakness on the show, but that doesn't stop it from being highly entertaining with surprises thrown at every turn! One could argue that the show peaked after the Fourth season, but I loved S5 and every season after that. It only gets darker and darker and it hurls towards a unbelievable ending, with our main character having to make the choice of a lifetime and choose which "father" he wants to listen to. If violence, sexuality, all out slaughter fests and a club full of dead hookers, you might want to avoid this at all costs.
8.0~I started watching Season 7. Got hooked and then had t watch the previous 6 seasons as if it was a prequel to Season 7. In doing this, I actually enjoyed watching the seasons one after the other, in order to understand how Jax came to be. There were some emotional episodes, but the one standing out is the episode where Opie made the decision to save Jax and take one for the team. My favorite character of the entire series was Opie and my favorite quote was "I Got This". Some episodes were a little boring, but only until the end of the episode where you could not wait to start watching the next one. My advice in watching a series is to watch them one after the other to really enjoy it. I really do hope that Kurt Sutter will create some sort of prequel to the SOA. I LOVED IT!!!
10.0~Excellent show that transcends even further to teach about love, respect and friendship! Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman are both very gifted actors, who can clearly be seen pushing their talents to their limits, episode after episode. I am glad to see the multi-facet Katy Sagal also pushing the envelope, standing in between his son's affairs and his husband's. The MCClub is a tough life, with enemies around every corner, guns to sell, people to pay (and to kill)... and SOA goes beyond this, by showing that the characters can love, laugh, care, worry and cry. Can't wait for season 4!
8.0~SOA shows the ups and downs of a outlaw mc - haven't seen Mayans MC yet but is on the list based on the quality of SOA
3.0~Probably one of the most disappointing Shakespearean opportunities to evince itself on the small screen. Such promise and hope from the original scenes of character building moment of episode one. Unfortunately the production turns into samo-samo, American dull cinema. Needs serious examination amongst the brains of the producers. The best actor is Katey Sagal as the Gertrude character from Hamlet. She's a strong leader, but unfortunately, that's it. Charlie Hunnam, the Geordie, somehow finds a physical demeanour of a 12 year old walking tough on the streets. A little too overacted, and the American accent is too tried. Ron Perlman is the unfortunate leader who withstands the business of dealing with the immature acting and storytelling.
8.0~Loyalty and friendship within the law breaking club of SAMCRO and the Sons of Anarchy is done so well, that you forget that these guys are bad, like really bad. Between killing, stealing and dealing there is this lovable part of each of the main characters that makes you look at what it means to be placed in a situation that makes it almost impossible to change the course of your life. Sons focuses on Jax, played by Brit Charlie Hunnamm, and his inherited VP station within the SAMCRO. Jax, from the beginning struggles with the ideas of SAMCRO and those he has subsequently grown up with after the death of his father when he was young. His mother, played by the amazing Katey Sagal puts new meaning into the words 'Proud Mama'. If anything Gemma (Sagal) is two parts crazy bitch and one part mama. I love her in this role because she is so tough and has to be because she is surrounded by ruthless men who wish to bring her family down. Gemma is now married the Clay Marrow (Ron Perlman), leader of the Sons and they play well together and in the tender moments of husband and wife, there is a real sense that they too struggle with the life choices that they have made and they question how to continue this game of death and dealing. Such as Clay says- 'no health care, no savings' Clay is aging fast and with age comes the realization that perhaps the road he has traveled has in fact taken him the wrong direction. The show, which just began its 4th season is packed with action, love, lust, guns and drugs- all the things that makes a great show. As the audience, the strong lead characters pull you in and make you understand that not all things in life are black and white- that sometimes loyalty and family forces you to do things that you would not normally do. The outcomes of those difficult choices do not just alter the lives of those involved, but even those who you do not know. There is a lot of sex, violence and language in this show that adds to the destructive patterns that the characters continually fall into. Either way though, I root for the boys of SAMCRO- because that is what loyalty is about and after three masterful season they have earned it.
10.0~I decided to watch "Sons of Anarchy" initially because I am a fan of Charlie Hunnam (a seriously under used and under rated actor,) Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal. What I didn't expect was the best ensemble I've seen in a TV show in years. Every cast member is spot on and the three I mentioned are positively brilliant. In the first five minutes, I completely forgot that Charlie Hunnam is British because his American accent is excellent. This show is heavy on violence and rough language, but it all fits in with the story...as do the occasional sex scenes. Everything about it is excellent: the acting, scripts, sets, cinematography and direction. I'm thrilled that this excellent show will have a second season. If you haven't seen it, all episodes except the finale (to come) are available on line. I hope many more people will watch this terrific show.
10.0~I just started watching SOA last year but caught up with the first 5 seasons before season 6 started...I love this show and most of the characters. Opie,Piney,Tara & Donna's deaths devastated me because I have grown attached to each character over time. For the longest time I went back and forth with Tig but seasons 6-7 he has spent time redeeming himself. Chibs and Bobby will probably always be my favorites based on the way they try to be Jax's conscience when he needs even if he tends to go his own way. I love Jax but really hate the darkness inside of him that he's starting to let loose since losing Opie and Tara. If Gemma were a real person I'd hit her in the face with a skateboard like she did to Cherry lol. I hated Wendy to start but now I'm kind of hoping she gets Nero and the boys. As this is the final season I'm truly hoping Gemma gets what's coming to her in the form of an enraged son. I had a love/hate relationship with Clay. Out of all the guys of SAMCRO I have to say that Happy would be my #1 favorite just because he's a bad-ass on and off screen...he's a real life Hell's Angel!! I'll be sad when it's gone but I have the first 6 seasons on DVD and I'll satisfy need for season 7 until I can get it on DVD.
9.0~Initially I gave 9 points, but after seeing all 7 seasons I feel that 6 is better. Too many seasons, repetitive, too unrealistic (e.g. police could not solve simple murders, did they try?). Monster Gemma's role was disturbingly too big. Jax (Hunnam) was splendid, one could see he really tried to balance between the club and the family. Juice was a tragic figure also well acted. Acting throughout was good. Jax's background history was always present. It was important, strong, and well written.
10.0~Kurt Sutter proved himself by the screenplay on the 6th season finale. That was savagely and genius. He correlated the happenings extraordinarily and really shocked me! About inside... Gemma is the most irritating character of the series. Katey Sagal is acting her part perfectly but nearly all of the spectators hope to see her dead. And Wayne.. He is cancer from the beginning of the series but he never died. Man, Nero you're on the wrong way. So, Tara's death means Jax doesn't need to go to jail anymore. He turned upside down. Think he'll spew his anger all around, destroy everything on his way and there's a 7th season within entirely club-fights and a tragedy final.
9.0~S.O.A is a well written well acted show.While it is not realistic,and often times hilariously unbelievable,it is very entertaining.It is obvious a lot of thought was put in to the writing.I do wish however,it was on a premium network such as HBO.That being said it is well worth the time invested to watch it.I recently watched the entire Breaking Bad series,and to me this is a better show.There are more moving parts and more time invested in character set up.Although the members are criminals,you find yourself rooting for them more times than not.If the show is appreciated for what it is (fiction) it is a can't miss.IMO Kurt Sutter has created a gem and I for one can't wait to see any of his future work.
8.0~SOA is a brilliantly cast and well-acted, entertaining tale that might be all the more so because of the tragic ends most of them come to. Is SOA "true to life"? Hardly. A motorcycle club that operated like the characters on the show wouldn't last a week before they were all gunned down or busted. If you don't mind suspending reality a little, you'll probably enjoy this show. If not, don't watch it. While there's plenty of action and gore in this series, it's wheelhouse is the tension and antagonism that exists between its characters, the rapid twists and shocking betrayals, and the swiftness with which love and tenderness turn to anger and rage. There are episodes where your jaw actually drops. From the death of a primary character in the next-to-last season, to the end of the series, the drama plays itself out to tragic ends, making it heart-breaking to watch. For a television series this gritty and graphic to reach such levels of emotional involvement with its characters has to be a first.
9.0~The show obviously is linked with a motorcycle gang that really exists (maybe mixed with other stuff), even Ron Pearlman accidentally says Hells Angels during Season 1 (it's in the Gag Reel which can be seen as a special feature on the discs). You also have people who were with the Angels attached to the show with different roles to it. David L. is one of them, though his acting skills do lack a bit, he's as authentic as it gets. Kurt Sutter who created this, is also known to be involved in the Shield series. And throughout the 7 seasons of SoA you can see a lot of cast members returning to play one role or another, sometimes for just one episode sometimes recurring (watch out for Walton Goggins, who has one of the craziest guest roles in this). Even without being a bike fanatic and even though the show does have either convenient ways to ease up on things or make them really complicated, the show is really well made. Not only from a technical stand point, but also from the point of character development. You could argue, that some of the characters are not given enough screen time and that some plots could have been explored more, but as it is, the show is (or rather was since it's through now) as thrilling as it needs to be. And while this is based in reality, that doesn't mean that some things happening, have to be "real". There's a lot of death, though no frontal nudity (I think that has something to do with the policies of FX channel), but still sex thrown in there from time to time. The relationships seem to shift suddenly at times, but all is somehow connected and the show tries to keep it as logical as possible (that also can be attributed to character decisions, no matter how stupid they may seem to the viewer). While it not quite reaches the heights of Sopranos or Breaking Bad, this is another good example how to spin something bad, to make it look somewhat good in comparison to others in that created world ...
8.0~I love the internet... We all do!! You can find anything you want, anything you DON'T want, and it's that last point that makes me write this 'review'.... See, the thing i don't like about the 'net, is that everybody becomes a critic. An expert. Someone who decides to completely put down another man's work, desecrate it, and think they are cool. Make stupid comments, say things like 'I never knew what SAMCROW meant, as it was not explained'... Well, if you didn't know what it meant, you really shouldn't be writing a review about it!! It was OBVIOUS what it meant! Like another 'reviewer' who said (after hating season 1, 2 yet still watches up to 3 and beyond!) 'when they get to Northern Ireland it's laughable! I mean, no passports, and they arrive in another country'!! Well, expert, in the same episode when they are stopped by the police in Ireland and they are asked to produce their passports, and they do.......!! See what i'm getting at? My favorite though, is a 'reviewer' who commented on the lead actors 'awful American accent!' Well, if it was so awful, how did you know it was American?? Did you not notice the bad (not awful) Irish accents? Someone else said, 'for a program about a motorcycle club, they don't ride their bikes much'?!!? WHAT???? How two rival clubs became friends? Some people REALLY didn't get that!! 4 words. WATCH.THE.SHOW.AGAIN. It will then become clear... And this is before getting to people who write about 'characters lack of depth', like they would know!! For goodness sake. If you don't like it, say you don't like it, but don't try and be something you are not. Like, clever. So, this could be applied to any film,TV series... For example, i tried Breaking Bad, and i couldn't get into it. But at no point did i feel compelled to slag off another mans/woman's art, as I have left, and will not leave anything to the world of Entertainment, as will most of you. Nobody that writes these reviews came up with an idea, was given $/ £millions to make a program...So, before being stupid, writing drivel (like this maybe?!), please, just think about what you will write first? For example, read 'U.N. Owen from NYC' review below...See? Drivel... And 'he works in front of and behind the camera...' Of course you do.... Anyway, I liked this show,as did many other people, hence the 6 soon to be 7 series... If shows are bad, ratings tell all, and no more shows are made? Right? Right. That's all you need to know!!
10.0~I was very intrigued by the title of this series. Sons of ANarchy is a very stylish name. Add badass harleys to the mix and you have got a great way to lure the viewers. But to sustain the viewership the show needs to be irresistible. Sons of Anarchy has all that and more going for it. The acting is top notch. You can actually feel his emotions on his face. The series reminds me of the wild west where revenge and killing ruled over the law. The series has politics, team work, manipulations, deaths, gore and most of all the wonderful recurring sounds and sights of bunch of harleys. Addictive and awesome. After Dexter and Game of Thrones, this is my newest addiction. Double thumbs up
9.0~This series has oscillated in my esteem but now as it nears its cusp I must affer my commendation for this this series. The world is a complex place and this series does not assure us it is not. Therefore I love it all. There is no doubt for the aficionado's of reality this is a treat, we leRN THAT REALITY is but a web of lies, conveniences and subterfuge of the those mighty lords who rule us by deception and our own unquestioning loyalty to things we do not even read let alone understand. As a required addendum I must state that that I understand nothing, I know not much, I don't pray to god but I worship the leaf, the crawling ant the slithering lizard, the calculator of profit is not in my ken.
10.0~Great series with a great plot. I loved it up to season 7 which is crap. Jax turns from a "real-life" character to a complete psychopath, killing tons of people, including ..., getting away with it, and immediately getting back to routine club issues like nothing happened. Minimal acting guidelines should have been to look more human and less like a robot while doing that... Chibs and the rest of the club follow him like pappies, not questioning Jax's actions even a little. Also seems unreal. In general season 7 plot is weak and quixotic, to a point it even becomes ridiculous. Sorry but series should have ended at S06...
10.0~I just recently started watching this show, and really liked it. Yeah, it's got some unrealistic parts... but when was the last time we watched a TV show that was realistic? It's more realistic than most, and it's got an interesting plot, with some really kick-ass actors. The name that drew me into watch this was Katey Sagal. I was a huge fan of Married... with Children, and from the different things I'd heard, I felt I had to watch her in this. And I was right. Her character is amazing. Maybe it's just the bitchy attitude coming out, but she makes me laugh. But, I was surprised at the acting of a few people I had never heard of before. Kim Coates (who I guess is a big actor in Canada), Tommy Flanagan, and Mark Boone Junior, for instance, were amazing. Part of it was that they were good actors; the other part was that these characters -unlike so many today -are human. They all have flaws. They all make mistakes, do some screwed up things (Tig's little speech about necrophilia for instance...), and are more than a little screwed in the head sometimes, but they're still over-all good people. Not perfect people, but realistic people. People with flaws. Now, that being said, the glowing part of the review done... Charlie Hunnam bothers me. Not sure if it's his acting, or a poorly written character, but since everyone else seems to pull it off, I'll assume he's just a crappy actor. His swagger in the first season made me cringe, and all I could think of was the 'gangsters' who walk like they gotta take a crap. His lines are delivered either in anger, or sarcasm. There never seems to be any other emotion. Even when he tries, it comes across angry or sarcastic. Still, definitely worth watching. No, it's not the most realistic thing in the world, but it's still a good watch. Oh... a little PS... For all the people saying that 'real bikers' wouldn't act this way or that... Are you a real biker? No, I'm not saying necessarily that they would act like they do on the show... But I love people who complain about a certain group not acting a certain way, while they're not part of that group. Like up-town Manhattan liberals complaining about how hard it is to be black in the south. Just a little side note.
10.0~Always on my toes when watching. Fanastic cast and storyline. Biker version of Game of Thrones lol.
6.0~Old Gema says: "... mothers should kill their baby girls". Questions: first of all, she herself was once a baby girl, no? All mothers were once baby girls, no? How could this world be without women to be life companions and mothers? I quote: "... mothers should kill their baby girls". Am I the only one that thinks this is kinda too much? Because, as a father of two wonderful girls myself, whom I adore and I'm proud of, I find the above line a bit too noisy. I guess it obviously aims at creating an impression and some very strong feelings towards the show, still... I don't know, it really sounds bad. if you gave a moment to think about it wouldn't you agree with me?
7.0~Ok so the plots can be a bit ludicrous. The acting and writing has some corny moments. The protagonist fails in my mind to redeem himself despite seeming to have redeeming qualities. But gee, it was a fun ride that was worth every moment.
10.0~When you build a character to be completely against being what they hate, only to have them turn into the thing they hated the most. It doesn't make any sense and is just downright lazy and stupid.
4.0~OK, to me this is entertainment only. Yes, show contains some sprinkling of what documentaries and those who have live it, tell us what biker lifestyle is like. But in the end, really? Do gun-runners load and unload barrels of guns and examine them in plain sight? Do they wear their colours on hi-jacks, break- ins, and bombings? Do club presidents, vps, and secretaries do their own dirty work (including special-forces style attack on a house) while a prospect (only one) merely tags along? I'm thinking either not at all or at best, not very often. I only made it half way through the first season and am leaving it at that. Glad others enjoy it but not my cup-o.
3.0~This is the most ridiculous and unrealistic series I have ever seen. I don't understand how I got through almost 2.5 season. The instructor is living up to his name. In Danish Sutter means sucking/sucks. Kim sure does suck ...
8.0~Pros: ~ Excellent acting, from performers ~ Strong screen writing, and plot development ~ All-Star, celebrity cast ~ Expert Cinematography ~ Good chase scenes ~ Does not glorify the outlaw MC lifestyle ~ Hells Angels Sonny Barger, Chuck Zito and David Labrava appear Cons: ~ Insane body count, with minimal, logical repercussions ~ Some violence is contrived "Sons of Anarchy" captivates you with a poignant story of one man's struggle with parenthood, while leading the deadly agendas of a small town, outlaw motorcycle club. The results are staggeringly eye- opening. Everything is for the most part believable, especially the main characters - who are well-developed. The screen writing is top- notch. Just like "Breaking Bad," this series is addictive like the drug Walter White makes.
9.0~Sons of Anarchy reaches in to the lives of the outlaw biker attitude and gives it a whole new light. Grasping your attention and affection through strong acting and wonderful writing. The story is a tragic heart-breaker especially toward the end, but I'm not going to spoil what happens. The show kills off some of its best characters but in doing so it keeps everything constantly fresh, there are times when it drags, but not enough to complain too much about. A solid 9/10 and if you haven't seen this series yet, get on Netflix and get to watching it. It's a good one, one of my favorites of all time. Everything from the acting, story, cinematography, and scenery add to the lure of the outlaw biker group known as SAMCRO.
10.0~A friend recommanded me this show and when he told me about it I wasn't really impressed but after some time I finally decided to give it a try. After the 3rd episode I was obsessed, it's a great story and it really made me change my point of view in a few areas. I just love how to show is directed and that by the end of one episode you can't wait to see the next one, that why I finished the entire show in just 4 weeks. I was a little disappointed on the ending, but I guess that's how it was supposed to happen. I totally recommend this show for everyone who wants to see a very interesting story, with excellent actors and unexpected twist.
3.0~This show has officially jumped the shark...The club members are near bullet/bomb/fist proof and even when held at gunpoint, manage to get the jump on their attacker with skill that would make James Bond look like Forrest Gump. This includes their women, who have escaped being held at gunpoint early every other episode. (Honestly, when a gun is trained on a Son or an old lady of a Son, count on them pulling a Jason Bourne and snatching the gun). They engage in bare knuckle brawling, are shot, and survive bomb blasts with nary a scratch. Without vulnerability, the characters have no risk, and without risk they go from humans to superheroes. The emerging theme of escaping "the life" of violence becomes a parody. For anyone who has seen the real effects of violence and crime, this show presents a surreal and cartoonish farce. There is no motivation for their actions when every tight spot or fix can be resolved by using violence and military style black ops which most Navy SEAL teams couldn't accomplish, let alone a biker club. For example, the club is able to run amok in a local hospital and kill and interrogate a patient multiple times using a "decoy" tactic to lure away the bumbling sheriff guarding the room. The same tactic is used to infiltrate a rival club's drug operation. At no time are their plodding enemies every able to successfully resist or touch the Sons. A drive-bye hits only bystanders, an IRA bomb blast leads to a few day hospital stay, and even a rifle round to the shoulder is but a paper-cut. Meanwhile, the Sons are granted bail after storming a church meeting with weapons drawn, overpower North Irish border guards who have carbines trained on the prone Club members, and escape a team of IRA hit men armed with sub-machine guns. In the real world, such ham fisted operations would have brought a world of heat on the club and they would be in bright orange jumpsuits not, their black leather cuts. Oh, but then again, they'd just bust out of prison...
10.0~sons of anarchy, its the best biker TV series on TV, it really give you a look into the life of a mc club and member, it juggles between Jax Teller's life with the mc and being a father. With a load of explosive scenes firstly starting with the birth of his son with the child's mother being a junkie and going to rehab and Jax left to raise the child with the help of his mother and new gf, then showing them fighting with other mc clubs and then neo natzi's etc. Then when Abel's kid-napped by a IRA member and Jax is doing everything he can to find his son, going to Ireland then finding out he has a half sister thats Irish. Then finally finding Abel, Jax heads back to charming with ATF and all crawling on there doorstep exposing Jax as a rat and then the sons getting sent down and illumination all there treats and showing it was a club decision Jax being a rat just to play the ATF into getting the club less time in prison and getting Gemma of the hook for murder. With season 4 on the way i myself can't wait to see what happens with the sons getting out of jail and the 21st century finally hitting charming and a new chapter in the Harrison. And i hope there's a lot more episodes in season 4 because the only problems with seasons 1-3 is that they didn't go on longer and i would say most sons of anarchy fans would agree.
4.0~I do not understand what all the hype is/was about. Poor acting. Weak stories. Very poor technical aspects (gun handling, law enforcement/ medical procedure / MO, terminology, etc.) Would not have been that expensive to throw some retired cop and/or nurse/EMT on payroll as consultants. Show had so much potential. Thought Breaking Bad and other top shows set the bar higher. Feel a 4 is being generous.
10.0~Just as each season approaches to an end you wonder how much more can be added and twisted and just like that the writers sway you onto the next chapter and make you experience all emotions all at once with all these brilliant actors taking you on this beautiful journey! This show is definitely a masterpiece, hands down!
2.0~Weak plot, weak on realism. Waste of time. Awful acting that is highlighted by the seering contrast of Sagal and Pearlman who are just utter powerhouses.
10.0~I started watching SoA a few years back when I found it on Netflix and binged it till season 4. I thought it to be good entertainment but after a while got a bit fed up with everything going wrong. So I stoped and it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started watching it again. And then I started to realize what a beautiful story SoA actually tells and how brilliantly it does so. It's not a story about some ruff bikers dealing guns, playing cool and killing dozens of people along the way. It's about family, the one you choose and the one you can't choose. About a guy that tries his best to live up to the person he wants to be but being confronted with his actions and reality time after time. It's about manipulation, power play, love, honor, fate, morality, loyalty and finding your identity and path in life. Everything that happens, happens for a reason. Every foreshadowing has its purpose and the characters are so beautifully written, so honest and real, you feel like they are a part of you. I would not have given SoA 10/10 as sometimes the storylines do seem a bit dragged out. Yet I feel like I wouldn't do it justice by giving anything under a 10/10 rating...why? Because SoA touched me deep within my core. It's hard to point my finger at what it is exactly, that makes it so special. I guess it comes down to a main character as real, dynamic and complex as it gets, a story that, as a whole, is complete and makes sense, great acting (especially in the last few seasons) and a very unique setting. I'm very glad to have given it a second chance and hope many more people get to enjoy this masterpiece!
10.0~Nearly through the third season and have been binge watching for the past couple nights. Really liking what I've seen so far and actually relate strongly to Jax's character due to being in very similar situations at times(need not disclose details. .) but again overall great show
1.0~If you like to see some kind of justice in a show you watch, don't watch this one. When someone bothers the club, the club kills them. When the police start bothering the club, the club kill the police. If they are threatened to go to jail, they rat and get out of jail. If a rival gang bothers them, they kill the rival gang. They can do all that because they have a magical spell that makes enemy bullets avoid them and their bikes. In 6 seasons the SOA (more like SOB by now) have killed about 100 people. They have lost one guy too. I watch every episode hoping at least one of them gets shot and dies, but I'm always left disappointed.
9.0~This show is one of the best on television and would likely be even more popular if it wasn't so restricted from its limited target audience. This show gives you an inside look at a rarely talked about subgroup of people.. Biker Outlaws.. This show has some very interesting characters and story lines. Although it is easy to criticize and dislike many of the characters on this show they are all so fascinating it becomes hard to look away. As different as these people may be from everyday citizens, we can all relate to them in one way or another. This show gives a unique perspective on things from the eyes of the people we often neglect the most. Sons of Anarchy is well put together and interesting series that will undoubtedly keep you coming back for more.
10.0~Good show kills the good people rip ope the story line is great pretty hardcore realistic stuff in the show 10/10 should watch this
5.0~Starting on a positive note. SOA, I feel, has an amazing cast , especially the roles played by Katy Sagel , Maggie Siff, Charlie Hunam, and Tommy Flannagen. Not including Hunam, theses actors have not played big roles before this series. The emotional investment and dedication towards their roles makes the audience believe them, hate them, and love them at the same time, until seasons 5. Then the plot takes an ugly turn, not bra cause of the endless torture scenes, the massacres, and the countless head shots committed by the club, but because of the motive. Up until season 5, despite the brutal murders consistently committed by Jax Teller (Hunam), you began n to root for him because of his drive to bring the SOA out of gun running and drug dealing. (Spoiler) this results in him eventually killing his own dad in order to put his club and family in a better direction. Nevertheless, (spoiler #2) when Gema (Sagel) brutally murders Tara, Jax's wife, and covers up her act, jax goes off the handle of sanity, as he literally sabatages every single thing that he has taught so long to build. He severes ties with every affiliation, and loses many close to him as a result, (spoiler) ultimately discovering that his vengeance for blood is misdirected and assumed because of the truth being his mother who killed Tara. You actually begin to resent the main character that you loved prior. He uses little motive to ruin everything. I feel that if it weren't for a ridiculous, unrealistic, and depressing (in all the wrong ways) ending to the 7 season series, I would have rated this a fat 10/10. I walk away glad that I watched it because the side elements and cast being the best I have ever seen in a TV series but I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth for how everything ends.
10.0~Rate this show. It easily and most certainly deserves a 10 star rating. It's one of the best action and drama series ever made. It's both action packed and full of emotion at times. It pumps adrenaline and pushes you to the core of action head-on, then smacks you with great moments of drama in the face. It is that powerful. The show's cast is tremendous. All actors and actresses are great including main and supporting roles. The music tracks used in the show whether it is an action scene or a scene that shows our outlaw-biker friends slowly moving into the sunset, are marvelous. The hard rock tunes accompany the soul of this show perfectly. This show will make you addicted once you click play and leave you craving for more. The first season was awesome and the second season was more awesome if that is possible. The only thing I can complain about is the length of the seasons. 13 episodes is far away from being enough. It won't sustain your desire to hear the rumbling and roaring of the Harley bikes. Second season is over and sadly we have to wait over nine months to greet season 3 but heyy!!, The SONS answer to no one...CHEERS!!
5.0~I've been watching SOA since day one, have them liked on my Facebook. I personally love motorcycles, But I'm here to give my honest opinion about this T.V. show. Besides the cool name "Sons of Anarchy" Other great aspects of the show are the amazing actors that star in and appear in episodes. They seem to all have a well developed understanding of their character in the show. My only criticism is of the writer's doing the scripts. I'm a fan, but please stop boring me. I'm tired of this annoying relationship drama, it's turning into a soap opera. I'm truly sick of watching Gemma VS. Clay, Jacks Vs Terra & Wendy. after watching episodes like this It's like a dose of having a annoying girlfriend. characters are worried so much that the show is tired up around children. The build up throughout season after season is very soft, Minor things happen; Where the season finale is literally the best part. That climax where something major happens should be going down every episode or every other, so I won't have think about what pointless stuff took place. Although I was very surprised about the loss of a main character in laying pipe. I hope this type of stuff continues so it keeps me on the edge, I'd like to be more entertained with the plot and story line. please less family and relationship drama, more action.
10.0~I know, hug delay, but I had to share this Amazing, brilliant art show with all of you. Not sure how I missed it when it was on the air, how I haven't heard people taking about it because it's a MUST! !!!Sons of Anarchy!!! Without giving any spoilers... I'm really picky and usually starts a TV show or a movie but if I don't connect I won't force myself to watch. The first 3 seasons were good, I wasn't blown away but in the fourth season and on I just couldn't stop! Wow wow wow If you haven't seen and you are looking for an amazing: actors, an intelligent script, emotional moments up to tears and well invested into all the small details this is the show. Get ready for 7 seasons of mind blowing bing that will make you skip your sleeping hours. Sons of Anarchy - A Masterpiece!!!
8.0~Amazing show and well written. Only problem is the pacing sometimes, one episode will be blowing your socks off and another will bore you to tears. It's also an amazingly sad story of love and betrayal in the worst ways possible. One of my top 5 shows of all time.
8.0~I really, really love this show. I only recently discovered it and have been binge watching on Netflix. The story lines are original, the acting is excellent and the music is awesome. There's just one thing I don't understand. Why could they not have used actual Irish actors for the scenes which were supposed to feature Irish people. Nowhere was this more cringe worthy than the scenes that were set in Belfast. As an Irish born person, I was appalled at the fake accents. Not the fault of the actors, of course, it's not easy speaking in an accent that is foreign to you. There are plenty of US based, talented Irish actors out there. They really should have used some of them, particularly as the Irish element was so extensive in Season 3. I wonder what Americans think of the quality of Jax's US accent?
4.0~I hate it when a series starts out fresh and interesting and then bends into the boring predictable "formula" drama series. We used to have guys we loved and guys we hate, now I don't see the difference; who's the good guys and who's the bad guys? You really need characters you root for, and others you can't wait to see them beaten out of their victory. I can't tell the difference from or the other this season, there isn't one character I care about anymore. SAMCROW used to care about the town and many residents knew that and were happy they were there, not anymore, old alliances seem to have vanished due to the open violence, killings, and beatings. Sorry Kurt, you had it going good; then all the flip flops, hate her-love her, love him now he's doing what the last bad guy did, or worse-he's dead. Your good guys are bad guys or don't stand a chance. Your good guys are hard to tell from the bad guys. Everyone I used to like is dead or is easily stepping into the bad guy's shoes very well, so they are not good guys anymore. I loved that you originally based your story line on King Lear but that whole story is long gone. You have successfully killed off great characters and a great story line that was original and kept you in front of the TV on Tuesday nights. I'm sorry, when I miss it now I don't even record it, I'm not rooting for anyone now. It was so good and I loved it. Now it is just convoluted. Sad good-bye.
8.0~Do you know those series that start out so confident and they really catch you up so hard that you HAVE to watch it ? But at 1 point you get disappointed, cause they start throwing scenes/episode so they just keep the series on air ? Well i have some news for you, this is not that type of series. This is the type that just gets better and better with each episode/season. Whats the key of this movie ? IT'S UNPREDICTABLE. You just cant figure the plot out, or if you do at 1 point it just turns. I m a big fan of quality movies/series. This is one that you should check on you re watch list. The 8.7 rating is so irrelevant, its at least a 9, id give it at 9.4, lacks some actions here and there. OVERALL : GREAT SERIES, its the kind of thing done when you put you re heart to it and it just cant turn out bad. PS Ron Pearlman's acting makes you feel sometimes like you re a part of SAMCRO.
9.0~An awesome series...with mind blowing story line.....once u start watching this show there is no looking back....well i regret that i started watching this series so late...but as the saying goes..its better to be late than sorry....i have no words to describe..the moment you start watching this series u will fall in love in jax teller...and yeah " THE HARLEY"......The moment i start writing reviews about this show i had already completed 2 season, and yeah i m deeply in love with this show and this club.....may b i would have been a part of some clubhouse i wish.LASTLY.....I WISH I HAD A CUT OF SONS OF ANARCHY...ENJOY AND DO INCREASE THIS SHOW RATING...THANKYOU
6.0~this show is so overrated. once you see season 1, the rest of the seasons are boring and transparent. the "SONS" become very annoying very quickly. clay makes this a very dry series. jax, sorry bro but he tries way too hard too pull off his role and becomes super annoying. you can even see it in clays face most of the time. jax really needed a haircut. the lame porn adventures the on the show were not even needed. I did not want to see fat, old disgusting bikers with beards getting busy. opie goes to his porn girlfriends gig and actually flares up when he see her doing her job, ummm, guess what opie your in love with a stripper you moron. the show loses its charm, get it "charming" and luster after season 1 and becomes unwatchable after season 2. very overrated show. the redundant biker rides get stale.
8.0~FX has done it again. Another excellent show that we sit on the edge of our seats during, and wait impatiently for all week. If the common opinion that shows improve the longer they run rings true for this one, then I predict a perfect rating by season 3 and it will be in the running for all time great. The timing couldn't be more perfect with the great "The Shield" coming to a timely close. Sons of Anarchy takes on a classic Hamlet premise with a dead dad under potentially shady circumstances, a wavering prince, (or in this case vice president of the biker club), wondering what the right path for him is. Should he take the more philosophical path of his deceased predecessor or the hard core gangster approach of his mothers current husband and president of the S. O. A. biker club. The first season is only half over and my wife and I are already dreading the wait for season two. A special kudos for Katey Sagal, I didn't expect her to be able to shed the memory of Peggy Bundy of "Married With Children" but she has been able to create a strong Queen of the club character that is easy to love and hate all at once. Find the time for this one, It's like a white trash Sopranos with a story line that actually goes places.
3.0~'Sons of Anarchy' is a TV show about a motorcycle gang conducting both legal and illegal activity in a town called 'Charming'. This show has a following and is regarded as one of the best series of the decade. However, it's pretty much a big miss from the first to final season. 1. To start, every single character (of the main cast) is so God damn shallow. They constantly go back and forth between wanting to follow good morals, but then immediately fall back into doing stupid sh#t. Jax (Charlie Hunnam) and Tara (Maggie Sif) take the cake on this since they both are such complete idiots more than anyone else. You'd assume Tara has a brain for being a doctor, but no, she's just the typical low- level chick that chases after bad-boys, constant d*ck and the 'motorcycle thug-life'. 2. Charlie Hunnam is such a bad actor that he constantly struggles to grasp a North American accent in every episode. He's the worst of the group considering he's the star of the series. There is nothing redeemable about Jax, who it seems can't stop himself from humping anything that moves. The law of physics dictates that every action has a reaction. Hence every bad thing which happens to these characters, is a product of their own ridiculous and juvenile actions. 3. I could care less about Katy Sagal (Gemma) who's as arrogant as can be. Ron Perlman (Clay) is the only actor that has some decent weight and dimensions to him. The story is the only hook of the series that keeps you interested, but that's about it. I keep using the word 'shallow', cause I can't find any other word that's non-vulgar to describe these characters. Their the bad-guy, plain and simple, and I personally can't root for the antagonists for six years, sorry. Kurt Sutter (I'm sure) had some good intentions and ideas when creating this show, but unfortunately it never fully realized itself. The writing is amateur at best, with so may crindging moments just by the garbage-bin of dialogue coming out of the mouths of these stupid characters. Like my summary for the review, the 'Sons of Anarchy' can ride off a f#cking cliff.
7.0~The story is one of a Shakespearean tragedy. Where the two styles differ is that SOA does not give you a lot of sympathy for what are brutish thugs with few redeeming qualities. The acting can be over the top. Still- a show that will have you coming back for more
6.0~This has been on my list of shows to watch for the last few years having heard comparisons with my favourites - The Wire, Sopranos and Breaking Bad. To cut a long story short, it doesn't come close to any of those shows. I have only watched one season so far however reading other reviews it sounds as though the general premise remains the same throughout. My main gripe is the central character Jax. The guy who plays him does a good enough job however I don't buy into the whole hard man/heart-throb image and I don't believe for one minute anyone like that would last 2 seconds in the criminal world, not that I have any experience in that area! Also being the central character for 7 seasons I assume he is supposed to carry the whole show? I'm sorry but his acting skills are not in the same league as James Gandolfini (Sopranos) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) who were both pivotal to their respective roles. My second gripe is the filler scenes. The plotlines are so thin that each episode could easily be 30 minutes long however it seems as though the writers have been tasked with including endless scenes with cool background music in an effort to stretch out the show to 40-45 minutes per episode. Watch the last 10 minutes of the season 1 finale for example - presumably this is supposed to be a montage. Literally nothing happens. We have to endure Jax waking up (in a cemetery?), turning up late for a funeral, just to collect his jacket from Tara before laying his flower on the coffin and then proceeding to strut off into the sunset with the rest of the characters watching him as he goes. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. I was too puzzled to feel any embarrassment towards it. If you want to see perfect examples of season-end montages check out The Wire. Literally everything is wrapped up already and those 5 minutes are just a reflection of the brilliance you have just experienced for the last 13 episodes - sadly the same cannot be said for SOA. That said, the episodes are fun enough to watch. The storylines are extremely basic yet the writers still feel the need to spoon feed the audience. You really don't need to pay any attention to know what is going on. I'm quite confident I could miss a couple of episodes and quite easily pick it up again later on....Sorry, I started off giving praise then yet that quickly turned into criticism. The other characters are interesting enough Gemma (Katey Sagal) and Tig (Kim Coates) are the obvious stand out performers whilst the rest hold their own. Hopefully there will be some character development in seasons to come. If you are able to separate yourself from any form of reality whilst ignoring the cringeworthy clichés then it's just about interesting enough to stick with. A generous 6/10 for me.
7.0~I've loved SOA from the first few shows savoring every episode as this group of characters captivated me in showing a side of life far from what I've lived. While frustrated at times at the constant barriers, it is those barriers that have made the show so intense and captivating. After the season 6 ending I am very concerned for where the story has to go now. I didn't see it coming, and while likely necessary to facilitate new paths for the story I'm not sure they will be able to pull it off. The end of season 6 leaves a future that requires radical change to some of the core characters in ways I will be amazed if it doesn't result in the show entering its demise. I pray I'm wrong as I am addicted to this show, but there are just some things that are to core to the story to eliminate without tearing apart the fabric of its success. I fear that is exactly where this is heading. I hope I am wrong. - Added 1/31/2015 - I wasn't wrong, season 7 was unbridled violence and pointless brutality. With no reason to be anything other than thug that is exactly what Jax became. When he "drove off into his sunset" riding that old Harley into the oncoming truck it was sweet release for every former fan who just couldn't stop watching. Never have I seen such a good show go so bad so fast. To sit and watch Kurt say how season 7 was a relief to create as all the complexities of prior seasons had been eliminated. Yeah, it was easier Kurt because it wasn't anywhere near as good. I would have been happier for the franchise if Season 7 wasn't created and we were left with the knowledge that everything would go to hell with Tara gone as Jax no longer had a reason to fight to be free to raise his family free from what he had been subjected to.
4.0~Nobody is getting smarter... character development next to 0 Everybody gets away with what they do... Team members hardly die. You feel that the intelligence of the characters is limited by the creators of the series. However + It is fun to watch but sometimes you just think... wtf + Some character are very likeable + Good cliffhanger But in total it is not enough... It is more like watching a car accident... not pleasent but you can not stop watching.
10.0~To me this show was perfect from the beginning until the end. Not everyone will agree with me. But I guess I saw what the creator of the show wanted to give us. I was interested for the first 3 seasons, i the 4th one I became completely hooked. And while the beginning of the 7th seemed a bit less good than the rest, the finale of it made it all make sense. It is one of the few shows where the ending is perfect even if not everything ended the way I wish it would, but it made perfect sense. Every season has a main story through which the club goes. And it is usually very entertaining. We get a lot of twists and surprises. And even things that we can predict manage to make one gasp. It is absolutely beautiful. Don't get me wrong, it has a lot of violence and some parts can be so gruesome that one has to look away. But when it comes to character developments the show is definitely on the high level. The actors are all very well casted and do a perfect work. At first I didn't like Charlie Hunnam very much. Mainly because off his ridiculous way to walk, I thought it was him overacting. But luckily he turned it down a bit and as I found it out it was his natural way of walking, go figure!. Katey Sagal is perfect in her role as Gemma. This is an amazing female character for such a show. A ruthless matriarch who doesn't just sit behind her man but does a lot of twisted things herself. I really don't want to list all of them. My review would go forever then, but every single of the characters was very well thought through and brilliantly performed by a very talented cast. I will be happy to see them in other shows as well as other creations by Kurt Sutter.
10.0~I've started watching SOA a couple weeks ago and 2 days ago I've finished it. It kept me glued to my laptop for weeks in a row. The way the story is told by Kurt is simply amazing. It's true there are some uncomfortable scenes within this show but those only make it more viable and real. The actors are all perfectly chosen for the job. They are all so natural in doing what their characters are supposed to do that is almost scary :)) Nobody can be that good of a player. Jax is by far my favorite character not only for his looks (Charlie Hunnam is indeed gorgeous) but for the life of his character. Born in this life he cannot escape from. I truly am amazed of what he does in the end..of what becomes of his family and club. Another great aspect of this show is the music. I love it! The white buffalo fits perfectly and it gives the show a certain feel i will truly miss. Sons of Anarchy..it was such a great ride and i will miss watching it.
10.0~Awesome show. Really a must see. Criminal motorclub with members that still thinks they do the right thing. Meantime the club is drifting into darker times then before
7.0~I love gangster bikie type shows. I was intrigued by the idea of following a Shakespearean narrative. In saying that the series can frustrate you as it oscillates between Shakespearean and blow-you-away moments and completely lame and silly plotlines. Overall I did enjoy it however, but I can imagine this won't be for everyone.
10.0~SOA was in my watch-list more than one year and I was afraid of to start a new TV series which is needed to spend time for it. Eventually ,I said to myself; Screw it! i am starting and I am overly glad that I started . SOA is unique program in its own way. I wanna point out a few things which cause me to attached to SOA. 1- Incredibly excellent acting.Every main characters have a specific personality. And you can describe all of the crew's behavior , personalities. 2- Phenomenal ,Magnificient Soundtracks. I gotta tell you they have the best soundtracks ever If think the whole soundtracks. You can listen every one of them again and again. Keep watching it. YEAY...
9.0~This show, along with Breaking Bad, is definitely in the top 5 crime dramas on TV right now. It has great pacing and quality acting. Being a big movie buff I recognized many of the actors; Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Tommy Flanagan (Gladiator), Mark Boone Junior (Dark Knight), Charlie Hunnam (Green Street Hooligans), Katey Sagal (Married With Children), Jay Karnes (The Shield), and the list goes on. The cast does an outstanding job. Ron Perlman is outstanding as the club leader 'Clay Morrow'. Charlie Hunnam also shows does a great job playing 'Jax', the main character of the show, who has doubts about his biker ways because of his newborn child. First thing I'll say is this show is not for the squeamish. Although most scenes aren't too bad in terms of imagery, there is some pretty haunting stuff in this show. Lets just say I've seen a fair bit both in cinema and in real life, however, this show still portrays some horrifying moments all too realistically. Like I said though, it's not excessive. I'm referring to mainly only 2 or 3 scenes. The acting in this show is superb, something I cannot repeat enough times! Great job by all the cast including supporting, cameos, and even extras who only have 5 minutes of dialogue. Jay Karnes gives a great performance as agent Kohn, and is in no way similar to any of his other roles. Katey Sagal must be mentioned, as she is nothing short of stellar. Half of her dialogue is in her expressions, and she does a great job at it. Amazing job playing the strong, and often seductive wife of Clay. Kim Coates is chilling as Alex 'the Tig' Trager. He plays his role so convincingly I sometimes wonder if he really is a little crazy! Ryan Hurst is great. His character goes through so much you can't help but feel for him. Hurst plays him so well you can see the emotion behind his eyes in almost every scene. Definitely a character you want to see develop. That's what makes or breaks any show; the characters. This show has character development along the lines of The Wire, Breaking Bad, Oz, and the Sopranos. In all seriousness, a great, great show. How IMDb has not put the ratings up, is a mystery to me. I recommend people who have seen this show to vote so others can see just how good this show is. And as somebody who watches, and enjoys, an array of TV series (Lost, Heroes, Prison Break season 1+2, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Dexter, Oz, The Shield, Band Of Brothers, etc) I can definitely say, this is up there with the best. I'd put it in my top 5 of all time actually. If I had to compare it to any show, it would have to be Breaking Bad. Although it's an entirely different show, I'd say it's the most similar in terms of pacing. There is action every episode, often times there is more than a few big action scenes in a single episode. So, did I say it enough times yet? OK I'll say it again. THIS IS A GREAT SHOW! If you enjoy any of the shows I mentioned (how can you not!?) then this show will fit right in. *NOTE* - Hilarious cameo in season 2!
1.0~I had high hopes for this serie, but it is just too silly with SOA going around winning all fights, threatening everyone, getting out of jail despite clear evidences etc. The list is too long of all silly stuff. I stopped watching because I got angry.
1.0~I put up with a few of these SOA shows to see what people were bragging about since I'm a long time, high miles Harley rider. I was getting to know the characters and they were tolerable, but I realized the shows were constantly filled with strife, violence, lies, hatred, ughhhhh, Gimme a break, how can anyone continually watch this crap??? Not to mention that there are no clubs I know that are this bad-boy stupid. And then came the show with the transvestite... worst show I can ever remember seeing on TV. Who is writing this garbage??? No more for me, I can't believe Harley advertises with this manure. The low budget 90's Renegade TV series show with Lorenzo Lamas was a better biker fantasy show than this. Seems I gotta write some more (10 lines). Well folks, good luck with your lame, aggravating fantasy viewing, this should fill your void. Yeah, and every show starts out with the same warning in the exaggerated horror voice, "Viewer Discretion Advised", but they forget to tell the real reason... Mind numbing stupidity, unless your a mental zombie. Sorry for the harsh words, but that transvestite episode was out of line in association with bikers, even fantasy bikers.
8.0~Overall, this show was very entertaining and gritty. The Good-- It offers the thrills, sex, violence, and intrigue that keep most adults or teens ready to see the next episode, and there are still some human and realistic moments. Great, yet overlooked actors, and it forces us to take a look at all sides of criminal rings like SAMCRO, and the emotional toll, as well as our own desire to see this violence and crime on screen. We crave horror, violence, sex, and depravity, but we want to be safe to get up and walk away from it when the show is over. The writing, acting, and action deliver in a dark panorama of visceral brilliance. The Bad-- Many real gangs and bikers complain that it doesn't even focus on realities of their daily activities. It never really focuses on motorcycles at all, even though the show is about a MC and their garage as well! Some of the writing is good, about how dirty cops and politicians work with criminals for a trade-off or to keep certain areas clean, but some of it is just sensational nonsense, filled with lesbian ATF agents and murders of govt. workers and street battles that would quickly result in swift action unless your club works directly for the CIA, illuminati, and CFR perhaps! Some of the seasons get a bit boring in places(though this is admittedly seldom), and some of the writing about Jax's love interests are goofy or contrived, and he seems to never see his kids, that he loves so much. The Ugly-- OK, some of the show in later seasons just got totally absurd, in my opinion. Like, really??? Trig suddenly falls in love with a transgender bozo that doesn't really fit into the gang or story at all. It seemed painfully obvious that this was a contrived PC preachy moment for LGBT or cross-dresser awareness month or something. I don't even mind such things, if they play into the script or the story well, but this just seemed ridiculous and drawn out on too many levels. For instance, the guys run into some other gang or white supremacists who make fun of Trig for having sex with this person, and are using jokes and slurs. I believe the guy making jokes got shot in the crotch, and beat up, etc. It was like watching Inglorious Basterds or Django or Hateful 8, with modern revisionism that seems so fake and goofy, where they had to make a huge social warning announcement about bullies or people joking on sex changes by brutally castrating or humiliating the guy who disagrees with them. Scenes like this didn't make sense, because most of SAMCRO and the stars are portrayed as blue-collar and racially or sexually- insensitive neanderthals, yet they champion and nurture Trig's relationship with that weird dude, and suddenly he is one of the family or something? WTF? LOL. No continuity in some of these plot lines. Overall-- still highly recommended and way more exciting and intriguing than many other shows. Worth a watch. I will definitely re-watch the series later.
8.0~I love this show it's not my top favorite of course,but it's a fantastic show..I wish they wouldn't of made the main character Jackson so dang hateful at this point, but I do love what they have done with this show I always look forward to the next episode to see what stupid things Jackson will do next...or who will die next!! A lot of people say you have to turn off your brain to watch this show.. Haha!! which I don't completely understand unless all they ever watch is animal planet Bc let's face it its a TV show..we watch them for the thrills and the stupidity and excitement of what's going to happen to what character..I would of gave this show a 10 except I don't like how they're ending it so soon and I feel like there are a lot of stories left out on Gemma I would really like to know in more detail what all Gemma has done and what she's been through to make her who she is...I also of course hate that they had to kill off Opie so fast..he was one of my Favies!!
10.0~Love EVERYTHING about this show! I was so lucky to be on this show! Cast and Crew were awesome the entire time throughout all Seasons. The cast was perfectly picked. Not one character I did not like because they were all so appealing in their own way. Suspense, Thrill, Drama, Funny and the SEX!!!! Wow it was hot! #TeamCharlie #TeamKatey
10.0~This show has everything you would want from good TV; great writing, interesting and complex characters and enough complex plot twists to satisfy even the most attentive viewer. This show is incredibly complex and complicated, but doesn't leave to many plot threads to tie up. Each season is it's own tale, with the same characters and a large inter- twining story tying them all together. For example, Season 3 is about Abel's kidnapping and Season 4 is about the new agent trying to shut down the sons. The show is very violent and is not for the squeamish. It freely shows graphic shootings, stabbings and torture. If you're okay with all of these things it's a great, morally ambiguous tale of bikes and blood.
2.0~OK, after watching Breaking Bad this one's not going to make it for me. I was hoping to find something exciting and intelligent about the series. Perhaps there's some type of historical reality about the biker life that so many of you love. However, watching a group of psychopathic machismo white men pretend that there "aint" no consequences to completely stupid and and out of control behaviors makes no sense to me. Narcissistic and other personality disordered females with a drug baby with no ethical narrative? Holy f***. These guys operating in a little BFE town would never survive even with some some police corruption. Dozens of dead bikers in a small California town after a gang war would bring the entire nation down on them. It's completely unrealistic. I'm disappointed and was hoping to enjoy watching the entire series on Netflix and FX. Any reframe that would help me to find some value in the series is welcome. And... why is not Ron Perlman at the top of the cast list? And... I love Katy Sagal's work. She's true to her character in spite of the lack of direction of this production.
7.0~Sons of Anarchy is a really good rural crime show. If you've never seen a single episode, it's basically the Sopranos with motorcycles and fewer suits - lots of backstabbing, secrets, double- and triple- crossing, and deals with the devil. It's a great show, well-acted, and I really enjoyed it all the way - until the last episode. I won't spoil it for you but it just rushes you to an extremely unsatisfying, poorly put-together ending. On the surface it feels like they wanted to "close a circle" as it were, but it feels ham-handed and I felt like it really cheapened everything that I had seen prior to it. Aside from that enormous gaffe this is a good series and is worth your time.
7.0~'spoilers' are vague so it shouldn't ruin any surprises but there are some details revealed. I gave a 7 of 10 for its realistic, gritty portrayals and convincing acting. This show is well written and well acted. Only a little "Hollywood" phony stuff here. I originally rented it to learn what Hollywood was saying about bikers. Being a motorcycle rider myself I just had to see what was being portrayed. I like it for showing the mindset of those in outlaw biker clubs. We get an accurate look at what goes on in the club and in the heads of members. Emphasis is on "outlaw" here. There are many law abiding motorcycle clubs out there that are good for the community helping with fund raisers and other events. Maybe this series will open the eyes of those contemplating joining an outlaw M/C club. Murder, deceit, illegal activities that can bring prison time or a bullet to the head are all aspects of outlaw clubs. All the emphasis on camaraderie, 'family', and brotherhood make it seem like a good thing. Having a group of friends you can count on is good, but if they are outlaws you most likely will end up in trouble with the law sooner or later. Pay attention to how they use money to corrupt the local law. Most of them live with the motto, "Start no s**t, there will be no s**t. But that only applies if you don't annoy them first. Then there is the illegal activity that may one day spill over into your life. Selling guns illegally to other outlaws does not put them on my Christmas card list. But again the positive side of this series is that it shows quite accurately what goes on in clubs like this. FIRST EDIT: After thinking more on this series I am finding myself more intrigued wondering what the writers will do with the characters. I intend to view all of the episodes so I can better comment on series later. A guy I knew from work tells me this stuff is pretty darn accurate as to what goes on in outlaw clubs and between them. They talk very casually about wasting someone who is a danger to the club. Take note and give clubs a wide berth. To their credit outlaw clubs have a code that they stick together and woe be unto anyone who breaks that code. At least they have honor amongst themselves. One thing I like about this is that no one with any brains would be rude to these people in the SOA. They know the consequences. There are now many rude people in our society because we decent folks allow them to get away with it. We sometimes hesitate to tell off the rude ones because we fear a situation or even a law suit if things get out of hand. Every time we allow that we "enable" the rude ones to continue their behavior. This show has convinced me it is time to cease allowing rudeness.
10.0~This show is like the best TV-Series so far! The Story, The Characters! The psychology! The CLiffhangers! everything is so good! when you start watching a episode, you can't stop, when the credits starts rolling you gets frustrated and just want more and more! the series is a little slow at the beginning, but well.. every TV show is like that! you have to get to know the characters and there life, Kurt Sutter is fantastic! don't need to say more! And the actors is spot on! the soundtrack of the series is masterpiece's! every song will be stuck on your freaking head! if you watching some other series right now, stop... start watching this kick-ass Mystery Action Filled Story! 10/10! if i could give it 100/10 i would!
8.0~A friend of mine got me into SOA as it isn't anything likely to hit our screens here in Oz. Ironically enough the theme of the show is not that far removed from a lot of the bike gangs we have here and hear about but i digress. It took me a few episodes to get hooked on SOA as i can honestly say it is unlike any American show i have watched. Its grainy and raw and even the actors are people who you'd see in your everyday life and not the glam and glitter that Hollywood or the like fobs off. For that i ended up loving SOA. A lot. I like also that there are a lot of "known" but not blown up actors. You know their faces but you don't have them seared into your mind from over exposure so you can suspend judgment and believe these characters exist. And the characters drive this series. It isn't the most polished TV series but its edgy and if you are looking for something you can sink your teeth into and not get sick from the saccharine then bite into this show. You will invest and you will care about these people even if they are the "kind" of people we normally fear and shun. And that is not to say the writers glamorize or sympathise, they just offer a different view point. Something we don't normally see. That is the hook and the viewing pleasure of Sons of Anarchy.
10.0~I was not interested in watching a drama about bikers. The whole affair smelled of a testosterone soaked soap opera for men. Something for a bunch of weak wannabes to chew on and get off on. I only have it a chance because I read a review of Animal Kingdom that mentioned that that show filled the void that this one left. At that time, that was my vote for the best show of this type. I grew up with outlaw bikers in my family and felt that Hollywood couldn't possibly get it right. The writer of this show must have had some inside knowledge because...with the exception of some of the melodrama like baby Abel being kidnapped and a few other things...the show is very accurate. I know they had to keep coming up with situations to keep the show interesting but much of this really happens. The code...the old ladies...the gunrunning and drug dealing...the murders...you name it. I will add that the crooked cops tend to be as violent as the bikers. That is something that the show goofs on. However, I was hooked and binge watched the entire catalog in a couple of days depriving myself of much sleep and social interaction. I couldn't find many places to break. I conclude in saying that I felt like I was watching real life events unfold almost like a documentary. Hunnam, Perlman and Hurst are excellent. It was a hard swallow to realize that Opie was Gerry from Remember The Titans. Wow! Excellent. 20 stars or more!
9.0~With no star power, no big budget, and no playing on pop culture, Kurt Sutter creates a masterpiece about one simple yet dynamic issue we all can relate to, and that is family. I am not of fan of Harleys, bikers, leather, etc. I have always been a sci-fi/ fantasy junkie. When my friend told me I had to watch this show, I obliged only out of boredom. Thank the good lord for boredom. SOA is a tale of a family of bikers in Cali. The dynamics and struggles they face can seem alien to those of us who abide by the law, sit in cubicles and drive minivans. I do none of the following, but still, I am like you, one who lives on the grid. SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Redwood Original) does not. Yet still, inside of the dark shell of lawlessness and well-paced, not overly used violence in the show, you see a family struggling to find their places beside one another. You see a strict and very dramatic set of rules governing the club. With flaws abound in each character, there are no true stereotypes. Sutter did a fantastic job with his homework, and after viewing two or three episodes, I never once thought of our cast as one dimensional or clichéd. The cast is near perfect. No true stars, but superbly talented veterans. Kim Coates is a highly underrated actor and nowhere near a household name, but he is "that guy". You know, the guy you've seen dozens of times but has never headlined a major film. Boone, Perlman and Flanagan all fall into this category, and all are equally tremendous. I will reveal no other information about the show, as I want you to view it as I did. I want you to sit down with no reservations and practical expectations. If you do, you will find SOA to be one of the most addicting and well-written shows ever. Yes, I said ever. Now go, go and be sure to have plenty of snacks within arms reach, cause there is no way in hell you will want to leave the couch.
7.0~The first four seasons of sons of anarchy are very compelling viewing, the characters are drawn by the actors with such skill and love for the material you will find yourself thinking they are real bikie gang members. Unfortunately seasons six and seven let the series down, it became too convoluted, too bloodthirsty, the characters became very unsympathetic in the viewers eyes. and the same plot device was used repeatedly to the point that I could no longer suspend my disbelief. I became frustratedly bored with season seven and in my opinion the show should have ended in the fifth season.
10.0~This show is awesome be prepared for a emotional roller coaster
9.0~A past effort to help one ally lead to trouble with another.

10.0~A gripping and dark tale of an outlaw's journey in order to balance the love for his club and family. Sons of Anarchy is one of the best crime/drama shows of its time. From the intense storytelling to critically acclaimed performances, SOA justifies its genre. The show, which is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, depicts the life and culture of biker clubs in the fictional town, Charming. The series was created by Kurt Sutter (who also played an important character on the show) and has been hailed as one of the biggest shows of FX. The show's main element is brotherhood and compadre. SOA narrates the journey of Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the protagonist, and his beloved club. The club members, who work as a motorcycles mechanic in the day, are involved in all sorts of illegitimate businesses. And after the birth of his firstborn. Jax's real quest of self-discovery and to make his club legitimate begins. The show is an ode to anti-heroism and vigilantism as most of the characters possess shades of grey with their own sense of delivering justice to the town. I highly recommend this show to the people who love dark, crime and thriller genres as Sons of Anarchy is a gem of a show with amazing performances and outstanding narrative which you can't miss to watch.
2.0~I hate you, me and everyone remotely connected with this series. I'm ashamed of myself for watching, but it gets two stars for the soap opera like addictive qualities. Not unlike Charlies Angels filming scenes around a single walk, there are entire scenes filmed around a motorcycle ride or worse, a meaningful look from the ever brooding Jacks (Charlie Hunnam) and Tara (Maggie Siff). Add in screaming infants, country music and as close to pornography as they could get and there you have it. Creator Kurt Sutter has said that the series is loosely based on Hamlet; while it's easy to see the characters and plot aspects lifted from Hamlet it digresses into the most base series of torture scenes and cheap sex that you can imagine. If you have a mute button and only need something for background entertainment, go ahead and watch.
10.0~Such a good series. Love the bikes & love the actors & actresses. Binged watched this!
6.0~Very entertaining series. But unfortunately is just too stupid to be able to take seriously. A dozen of drunken white bikers basically outsmart and outmuscle every single gang, judge, auhority, mafia, international terrorist, local cop, and federal agent that comes in their way. These are the chozen dozen. The king of kings. It actually should be named the Fantastic Dozen. The amount of daylight homicides that go unsolved by police must be a record on any given series. Actually, there is no more incompetent police force than the Charming PD and every other agency that sets foot in the city of the Dozen bikers. It really shows the state of TV and Cinema when this series has a rating of 8.6 With that said, it sure is very entertaining. And every episode will keep you in the edge of your seat.
9.0~Here i am watching the third episode of the first season of Sons Of Anarchy and i remembered why i loved it this show from the first episode : the brightness of the script, how the writers succeeded in maintaining the plot all over the seasons is absolutely remarkable. The casting is tight, a pleasant discovery for me for Channing Hunnam who was excellent in playing his character's emotions. Ron Pearlman's performance is like his any other works : perfectly well done. he list is too long, but every character played was 100% AUTHENTIC. Each season has his own theme like The Wire (which is one of the best TV series ever created ^^) and every next season is getting more better than the other and that what makes Sons of Anarchy unique and 100 times more better than The Sopranos. I watched The Sopranos and i mean i really force myself to watch it, and the series couldn't approach the gangster games, plot, revenge, love, betrayal like Sons of Anarchy did. I assure you, you will be hooked after the first or second episode.
10.0~OK, I saw Sons Of Anarchy by mistake a few weeks back (I recorded the wrong program) I Had heard of it but never really fancied it! Bikers and all that, not my thing! I had major doubts about Charlie Hunnam, I have only ever seen him in one thing before and that was a movie called Green Street (Hooligans) where he played an East End Londoner (West Ham) football fan-cum-hooligan! He is from Newcastle and his accent in Green Street was terrible but he must have had some voice coaching because in SOA he accent (usa) is spot on, all but the odd word! I watched the first episode and thought it was awesome! But then again, how many first episodes are awesome, only to be followed by a totally average rest-of-season? But I am so happy to say that I was wrong! I am up to episode 10 and each one is better than the last! It's not your average knuckle head biker show! It follows the trials and tribulations of each and every cast member! I really can't recommend Sons Of Anarchy enough! 10/10
6.0~I just finished watching SoA and I've come to the conclusion that most of these serial shows on TV should not be serial shows ... or if they are they should end much sooner than they're meant to. I got into SoA from the beginning. Having already watched The Shield, I had high hopes for this show. I would watch it every week, and, for the most part, found it to be a pretty awesome show on par with The Shield if not a little unrealistic (but then so was The Shield). But the story seemed to drag in the third season and I stopped watching it on a week to week basis. It wasn't until the recently that I decided to plow through it on netflix to see how the story ended. Nowadays, I usually don't binge watch TV unless I'm home sick and have a large block of time with nothing better to do. Well, I've been sick lately, so I figured "why not finish watching SoA?". Well there are plenty of reasons why not to, but I don't entirely regret it. I did seasons 3-5 last year, and seasons 6-7 this month. Overall, I think the show had its moments, but man the show went way off the rails with how ridiculous it got. It was downright stupid in certain parts. SoA isn't the only serial show guilty of going off the rails because they overstayed their welcome. I guess not every show can be Breaking Bad. Some shows hold it together really well until their final seasons. Lost, Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica come to mind. But Babylon 5 at least pulled everything together for the second half of their final season. Some go off the rails much sooner than that. Heroes fell apart after the first season. Bates Motel seemed to outstay its premise after only a few episodes. And even The Shield felt like it was getting a little too crazy with what Vic Mackey could get away with towards the end. But SoA was particularly bad in this regard. I feel like the whole Jax story would have been better served if it ended much sooner than it did. It was a great premise, but it was, at best, a four season storyline. Stretching it to seven seasons really killed it. The first two seasons were good because the story was still fresh and the writers didn't feel the need to fill it with ridiculous shock value that add little to the story. When you watch these serial shows, especially one right after the other (like many people do nowadays with netflix and on demand) each season is like a long movie. But if there's not enough meat to the story the writers tend to pad it out with convoluted BS and it often requires the characters to make really stupid decisions just to create drama and a means to carry out the episode's quota for sex, action and violence. It just gets exhausting after awhile, especially while binge watching. So perhaps, binge watching is the wrong way to go about watching this show ... but like I said earlier, I found the story to move along way too slowly for me to care enough to commit to watching on a week to week basis. SoA doesn't seem to work in either case. That being said, it was entertaining enough for me to binge watch it to the end, but I do wish it didn't require as much of my time as it did to get there.
10.0~Love the show. Seen the whole show 9 times, all 7 seasons.
9.0~At first glance, it does seem rather basic and familiar with the motorcycle gang trying to earn their way, building and breaking alliances along the way that lead to bloodshed. However, the main storyline at play here is all about Jax and the other-worldly consciousness that overcomes him. Over the seasons his attempts to break away and legitimize the MC consume the majority of the conflict that provides our viewing entertainment. A closer look sees a struggling man, husband, father, friend, and son, and no matter how hard he tries, every step forward he takes creates a fallout of two steps back. He can never get ahead, he can never reach his goal. Thus, we see the evolution of Jax turning into the very thing he hoped never to be. While I greatly enjoy the various subplots, I applaud Kurt Sutter for never losing focus of the main story. The character development gives us a connection so deep to these characters, it is hard not to be moved by Jax's struggles and their consequences. While I have my suspicions and hopes for season 7, I cannot imagine Sutter disappointing us in the end. Ultimately, what I have come to understand about this show is that you may not like what happens, but you understand why things had to happen.
10.0~My reviews are never to chastise the other reviews/reviewers, nor is it a personal vendetta against the writer, dIrector or producer. It is simply my quick summarized take to explain a glimpse of what the show has in store. And no, I will definitely not spoil the show for you by detailing what happens. Enjoy my review. If you have not seen SOA before, you should. It is a great series to binge watch and an even better series to have you going 'Did that just really happen?"! Great storytelling in the way the series unfolds show by show and keeps you guessing with every corner the writers take you. Suspenseful, high drama and action ride that leaves you wanting more each time. 10 out of 10.
5.0~I been watching this show for going on 4 years now. Since the pilot i haven't missed a episode. Even while in jail i was able to watch the show. The sons has good acting. Up until this season i wasn't sure about the writing. Up until this season none of the main characters had been killed off. I found it unrealistic. Let face fact, When people are involved in a criminal organization, People die. That's why i was thrilled when Opie was murdered in county two weeks ago. Now the shows getting more believable. But there are still flaws. Like When Chibs killed Jimmy O? Then he spit on the body? That was unrealistic. You know at one point chibs was picked up by the feds and they cotton swabbed his cheek. No one spits on bodies anymore. That really disappointed me. Last season they put Danny Trejo on the show. Trejo's character is suppose to work for the Mexican cartel. Later we learn he works for the CIA??? Sorry but way too unbelievable. The CIA doesn't care about biker gangs and the IRA selling guns. The CIA cares about nut bag dictators of third world countries getting their hands on nuclear warheads. Just like right now. The CIA's in Iran assisting Israel in killing Iranian scientist. They're not investigating Hells Angels in Oakland and SF.. Its unbelievable scenarios like this that really hurt my point of view of the show. Kurt Sutter should have just made it so the FBI criminal division, DEA, Or ATF were investigating the sons. The CIA would never get involved with that. I think Clay should have been killed last season. Keeping him around is a drag on the show. I'll continue watching the show. But Kurt needs to keep it real. Just keep it real Kurt. No need to embellish...
10.0~Sons of Anarchy not only has one of the best casts I have ever seen, it also has fantastic storytelling and very real and believable dialogue. Kurt Sutter does a perfect job of making the town of Charming come to life, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Every actor knocks it out of the park, there isn't a single uninteresting character in the show. Doesn't matter if I came to love or hate someone, they all contributed to the show in a good way, had their own personality and quirks all while being completely genuine. I can't say enough good about this show, it is collectively the best series I have ever had the privilege of watching.
7.0~This show falls into a category I often like. We get blue-collar folks, or criminals, or otherwise non-exalted characters in a story about palace intrigue. There are struggles for power and leadership. Strategies for building the kingdom, and protecting its members from attack are a main thread. The Wire was a good example of this, too. Although The Wire also included distinctions between the cops and the drug dealers. The drug dealers led these big, Shakepearean lives of power and glory, while the cops were much smaller -- ordinary, sometimes petty men. While SOA is not nearly as complex or nuanced as The Wire, it is carefully put together show. I sometimes worry that a show like this might never find as much audience as it could. I know I was pretty sure I wouldn't have any interest in a show about a motorcycle gang.
1.0~First off, I can't believe how this show could ever get a positive review. Kurt Sutter you must really love your wife, because you wrote this show for her, she get's away with everything in this very unrealistic show. Second no real MC (not the lawyer and doctors MC) would do stupid mistakes and decisions like these no way in hell, maybe you should have done more research on real MC's like H.A. how they operate and run their club's. In the it was a complete waste of time watching this show, Kurt Sutter please give me my time back. After watching Breaking Bad this one's not going to make it for me. I was hoping to find something real and intelligent about the series, total disappointed and I can't enjoy watching the entire series, unbelievable story lines, outrageous bad acting. Started getting so ridiculous I quit watching. Saw it on the lineup this season so I thought I'd catch an episode to see if it was any better. I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes of the tranny and ass rape scene that unfolded... REALLY? very low.
10.0~Where do I start with Sons of Anarchy? I was a little late to this party as I started watching when it finished. It has since become one of my favourite shows. Sons of Anarchy follows a gang of bikers in fictional Charming, California. Shows the inner workings of the Motorcycle Club - The Sons Of Anarchy, and ran for 7 seasons. The show is full of sympathetic characters. We learn from the get go, that these characters are lawless and reckless. Yet somehow I found an affinity with many of them. The music in sons of Anarchy is amazing. A band called the Forest Rangers do covers of many great songs especially for sons, it really helps drive the story and emotions home. The acting is great, Charlie Hunnam is likable for an anti-hero and both Ron Perlman and Katey Segal are perfect for their characters. You will love some of them and hate some of them in equal measures. All in all, this is an amazing show and comes highly recommended. Well worthy of a binge. 10/10. :)
10.0~I have to say, when I heard about Sons of Anarchy..... I thought..... Hhow can a bike series be good blah blah. Out of boredom I decided to take a peak..... Well guess what... I couldn't stop watching;-) Season 6 finally.....what a sad tear shedding moment I had...... So disappointed in Juice....I kind of hate him right now...... Wish Gemma could be ran over..... Got absolutely NO love for that woman!!!! So proud of Jax and his crew! I grew so close to the Sons of Anarchy.... Its one awesome series and very sad that it is coming close to an end! Will sure miss you all a lot!!! I will just have to watch it over....... ;-) Keep up the good work guys.... My Gemma and Juice get what they deserve in Season 7! Can't wait to see what the S.0.A is up to
3.0~Seriously bad acting and corny scripting! I really wanted to like this show, but the fight scenes and shoot outs are laughable. The dialogue is corny, and the constant brooding, sauntering, and threatening is threatening. Ugh! Kaley Sagal is the only actor delivering any believability. Hunnam is cute, but a one trick pony. And Perlman just comes off as an old fart trying to be cool.
10.0~Some shows just don't sound that interesting, and I admit when I heard about this new show, featuring an outlaw motorcycle club, I wasn't interested. Similar to shows like Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy gained it's reputation by word of mouth. Once word got out about just how well written this show was and how deep the character development was, it gained a following, and by the end, it was one of the highest rated shows on cable. For over 20 years, SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Originals) and Sheriff Wayne Uncer (Dayton Callie) have kept the small town of Charming California safe, a suburban paradise in an otherwise corrupt world. A series of events start to change all that, and SAMCRO is forced under the microscope. A shift in attitude, an ambitious young sheriff, and the ATF all threaten to destroy Charming and SAMCRO. Left with few options, the club must form new alliances and carry on business as usual if they hope to survive. I'll be the first to admit that I was wrong about this show, I just couldn't wrap my head around it. How could a show about a motorcycle club be any good? It turns out that it was more than good, due to a combination of complex characters and tremendous writing. No one would have ever imagined just how in depth and shocking this show would become, and it's a real tribute to Creator, Kurt Sutter, who always had another trick up his sleeve. Just when it seems like there is nowhere else to go, the show changes direction, characters change, and the story evolves. Sons of Anarchy seemingly gets better with every season, but it's not just due to the writing, it's the actors themselves. Sons of Anarchy has some of the best writing I've seen in a television show and the characters (while on the surface are nothing more than outlaw bikers) are so complex and interesting that I was hooked after just a few episodes. This show is as addicting as it gets, because everything seems to fall into place and it just work. From the casting, to the comedic moments, there isn't anything about this show that I could possibly complain about, as it earned it's reputation for being one of the best shows on cable. Sons of Anarchy, if nothing else re-enforces the old theory that you most certainly can't judge a book by it's cover.
10.0~Simpy the best show ever. This show is not about a bunch of bikers, drugs and alcohol. This show is about something special. A son trying to live up to his dad. A man trying to change things in this Club. Sons have a lot of darkness in it. There is a lot of violence and even some humor in it. The show is tragic in so many ways. But the show is also beautiful in so many ways. The acting from everyone is superb. Top class. The storyline is followed trough every season. The show really begins after the 3 season. I have no words. I have never been so connected to a TV- show ever before. You can really feel the pain in the characters. You can relate to the brotherhood because its all about brotherhood and family. Its hard to explain what the show does to you. Just watch it. Best show ever.
10.0~I wish it never ended!!! I know the Mayans is not a sequel but a similar show, I don't think it will compare! But going to gv it a shot! Farewel soa
10.0~SPOILER ALERT!!!! Season 1 up until Season 7 was a breathtaking experience for me. The CGI was perhaps cheap but that doesn't matter. The pilot episode in SoA already hyped me up, that doesn't happen a lot in the first episodes in TV shows. Jax finds his father's journal and then wants to head in the same direction his father went. This is the case in Season 1 up to Season 3. Jax is the Vice President of the club from Season 1 till Season 4, from Season 5 till Season 7 he's the President of the club until his death in the finale of Season 7. His mother Gemma has manipulated the club at many moments. She got what she deserved late in Season 7. There is a lot of action and violence, and here and there humour.
5.0~What a disaster this show has become. What started as a pretty decent show centered around bikers has turned into a cluster f#$k of bad writing, terrible acting and down right ridiculous story lines. It seems like the writers are going for politically correct garbage rather than concentrate on the reality of Organized criminals. These guys are drug dealers, scum bags and garbage yet they avoid racism, homophobia and even adopt a dog here and there. Totally unrealistic and Hollywood gutter garbage. Season 1-3 are OK but after that? It's become a bad joke. It's also slowly becoming the Gemma show. Each episode features 50%+ of her story line which are usually borderline insanity and ridiculous. Gemma is either God's new fallen angel or her husband (the creator) likes seeing her face on the screen all the time. The only series I have seen decline in this manner was Heroes but at least they killed that one. It's time to send SOA to the glue factory. This series has had it. As one reviewer put it- if you want an unrealistic crime series written by a chick, for a chick and to place politically correct nonsense in the show then SOA is for you. I can't take another Gemma plot. In fact you'll see 5 Gemma plots in one episode.
9.0~OK. I admit that I avoided this like it was poison when I first heard about it. I thought it was another pathetic attempt to exploit the outlaw lifestyle along the lines of a bad reality show (which we ended up with four years later, but that's another story). Anyway, I was bored one night and there was nothing on the 3685 channels I get from Communistcast, so I decided to stream the first episode on Netflix. Boy, was I wrong! The basic premise is based on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Charlie Hunnam is Jax Teller, Vice President of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Originals (SAMCRO for short), and is analogous to Prince Hamlet. Ron Pearlman is the Club President and analogous to Claudius and Katey Segal is Gemma, Clay's wife, and is analogous to Gertrude. We find out that Clay succeeded Jax's father as President after he was killed in a motorcycle crash, and subsequently marries the widow Gemma, which is the whole Hamlet angle. When we pick up the story, Jax is in his early 30s and contemplating the direction of the club, especially after reading an unpublished book his father had written about the club. It turns out that his father, John Teller, was horrified by the 1980s as the direction of the club had taken a bad turn. It devolved from just a group of guys who wanted to ride free to a full blown 1% outlaw biker gang that specializes in trafficking illegal firearms. As we follow the story, Jax begins to doubt SAMCRO's directions and activities, and begins to want to change the club, much to the chagrin of Clay and Gemma. Kurt Sutter has created a really tight story with great characters and all the actors are first rate. The gun running angle is a little far fetched: when is the last time you heard about AK-47s being used in a drug deal? Moreover, SAMCRO traffics enough firearms to outfit a small country. But Sutter wanted to avoid portraying the main bread and butter of outlaw clubs, which is drugs. Anyway, if you can get past that, you'll like the show and the writing, as well as Charlie Hunnam, Katie Sagal, and especially Magie Siff's portrayal as Jax's love, who is torn between her feelings for Jax and the life she built as a surgeon. Enjoy!
5.0~A few years back I had already seen a few episodes of this show. That was enough for me to decide to ignore this show. Now after all the good reviews, and on the advice of friends and the fact that I am real series-junkie, I decided to give SoA a second chance. And yet, this show can not convince me as a quality drama show that it should be. Too bad, because this show certainly had potential. I have often heard the comparison with The Sopranos. And to be honest it did remind me of The Sopranos. But that is not a plus. Rather a big disadvantage. Where the script with the sopranos is genius and has a very realistic feel, this series is filled with too many coincidences in the important moments. These events feel like they are forced. After a while watching this show you know actually how most developments will go on. Plus I find most characters flat and one-dimensional, making it caricatures rather than real people, so I do not feel connected to them. Also the acting is not that great. (casting could have been much better, one of the few good cast is Katey Sagal, great acting performance). What I really miss is the (black) humor. You would think that there would be a lot of laughter and bullshitting with each other in such a biker gang? That would also displays a deeper bond of comradeship. A missed opportunity in my opinion. The creators are trying to be funny which is done very poorly, because it often don't feel genuine, so again it feels like it has been forced. (Eg the man with his compulsive need to satisfy himself with his hands... that is too easy thought up IMHO). Ultimately all these shortcomings ensure that the many events which follow each other up in very high pace make little impact on me. The momentum continues in it, with lots of action, which makes this series so popular in my opinion, because it must be said that this is well cared for in this show. The many action scenes does look good and the music is often well chosen, which is also immediately the few plus points of this show. So no, this series did not convince me. I can understand that many people like to see this show, because of the many action, but to say that this is one of the better series of recent years no... I don't think so, therefore, this series has too little depth and too many coincidences.
10.0~I was bored in holidays and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Little did I know... I've watched all 95 episodes in almost exactly one week. This made me get so much into the life of SAMCRO, I fell like a patched member. I have surprised myself with how emotional I was during the viewing, and usually I'm quite a stone faced guy. I laughed, I teared up, I got furious simultaneously with the club. When the last season delivered the last unexpected scene, I couldn't help myself and broke down. I want to applaud to Kurt Sutter for giving the show a special touch, along with some small clues(?), such as the homeless woman and crows. I hope the rumored prequel will make it's way on the screens soon!
10.0~My uncle rode with the Hell's Angels, and I remember some of the stuff he used to tell me. This show is very accurate from that perspective. I really enjoyed from start to finish. It was nice to see how the characters changed and became their own during the series. I was totally bummed out though when one of the main characters was killed in jail. He was my favorite!! I am ready for the spin offs from Kurt Sutter. He really knows how to make TV. I found many Hamlet references, and that plays out in the end. I think they could have done a few more seasons. The show was just too exciting to end.
10.0~I actually love sons of anarchy literally it's been five days and I'm onto season 7 it's so addictive!! All the episodes are so believable and interesting it doesn't leave anything to the imagination when it comes to violence and everything is so well thought out it's so entertaining to watch and see the different sides of the characters. I absolutely love Chibs & Tigs and obviously Jax the big hunk, the cast are so believable and all play there roles so well. This is definitely one of my favourite programmes I really thought I wouldn't like it but I am hooked it really is pure entertainment and leaves you hanging onto the end of your seat after every episode! I LOVE IT. Everyone should watch sons of anarchy you will not regret it.
2.0~I can't believe how this show could ever get a positive review... I haven't watched gay porn, but I'm sure that there's more male hugging going on in this show than in gay porn (not saying that's a bad thing, if you're in to it of course, not trying to offend anyone). The story is predictable, characters are the same. You can see everything coming from a mile away. I've not just watched a few episodes, I managed to keep going for the first 2 seasons..since I wanted to give the show a honest chance... And I'm sorry, but this show is just awful. So called ballin bikers.. Terrible! I can't understand how this garbage has so many seasons while other good shows have been canceled after just one.
4.0~...isn't easy. But this one is certainly written by well payed pro's and... you simply have to be incredibly stupid to buy it. The protagonist -who I guess is supposed to be the show's hero- is totally played by his mom, his wife and his stepfather (and more). To "protect him" (probably uttered a 100 times by Gemma) from certain hurtful truths. It makes him look half brain dead. He shouldn't notice that everyone is lying to him? And the lies also causes dozens of deaths, but that doesn't seem to bother the liars. All to "protect" this and that. Bottomless plot holes are covered with "let's keep it a secret to protect" whatever. And then there's the ongoing slaughter of... I don't know how many people. Preferrably by the use of heavy artillery and nuclear warheads. In broad daylight. And they never really get caught. Also it almost hurts to see twenty+ gangsters firing away at each other with assault rifles and hitting nothing but air. From 15 feet away. Last, but not least, is the inconsequences. The characters, and especially Gemma, tends to change views from episode to episode. Maybe it's supposed to look like she has a very clever hidden agenda, but I doubt it. It bums me out anyhow. No, the script isn't good. But the show's still watchable. It looks good, and some of the scenes are really well made and well written. Pardon my terrible English, I'm from Sweden. EDIT: I'm sorry but I really have to add a couple of things: 1 The acting is really good 2 The characters are truly lovable 3 The directing is top notch 4 The music i well chosen. Especially "Los Tiempos van Cambiando" (cover of Dylan's "Times are a changing"). I mean: I actually did enjoy the show. The bad script just made me overly negative to the whole thing. But my rating (4/10) still stands. A great TV-series should be well written as well. Not just well produced.

8.0~*********************ONLY MINUTE SPOILERS******************* I absolutely love Sons of Anarchy. It's a FX, television version of shows like, The Wire, The Sopranos and Deadwood. SOA seems like it should be on a network like HBO and though it may lose something small in the cable translation, it's also a success where many HBO shows that were similar were canceled prematurely. The third season of SOA lags to be honest. While I was perfectly happy as a fan of watching the everyday toils of the Sons of Anarchy in Charming, the show felt the need to turn SOA into Belfast Bikers which is what I feel I'm watching most of this season. Unfortunately like many shows before it, SOA felt the need escalate the show as the seasons progressed. I feel other fans like me would much prefer them keeping the show on the level we've learned to love. When I say all of this I think of Dexter and how it started so strong and tried to build the show into something bigger when I the fan would've been happy with more of the same. Dexter eventually pulled themselves out of the lag and the series as a whole is still great. I'm still working on finishing season 3. Hopefully they'll pull themselves out of the Belfast lag. Hopefully even by seasons end. Still a great show with my full recommendation. If you like any of the other shows I've mentioned in this review I have no doubt you'll love Sons. 9 of 10 - Television doesn't get much better.
6.0~I gave SOA a rating of 7 because its really addictive and exciting, but with errors. First, there are so many plot holes you lose track. For example: clay being alive a day after season one. This was my biggest pet peeve of the entire show. Every other situation in the show when Jax gets mad, he turns to violence and sometimes murder. He just found out his father in law, the man hes most looked up to basically his whole life tried to kill Jaxs best friend, a member of their club. According to every other situation in the whole show, Jax would kill Clay, right? No, instead he lets Clay live for about 5 more years, even after he later finds out Clay killed his actual father and tried killing his wife. I mean, I really don't know how I managed to watch through season 2. It was horrible, every second that Jax or Clay was on the screen. And when the clubhouse was blown up, why did everything burn except their table, gavel, and JT's bike? In real life when there's a fire, everything burns! Including the most important things! Not in SOA. And why didn't they ever rebuild the clubhouse? The club is so invincible it gets really annoying and unrealistic. It becomes a little more realistic in the last season, because they start paying for their actions for once. Another thing I thought was kind of annoying was the extremely repetitive dialogue. Whenever bad news was heard the only thing anyone said was "Jesus Christ" or "Sh**" . And I can see if all the club members talked similar because their together 24/7, but EVERYBODY said it, Jesus Christ was said probably multiple times an episode. Other words that got old were "sweetheart" and "give me a minute". And there would once in a while be a phrase never used before like 3 times an episode, from different characters in different situations. The 3rd season was just weird. It just felt awkward and I really didn't like it at all. I didn't really care for the ending much either, it was pretty unclear. The entire show was about Jax making the club legit. Well, why was there still question about whether the club was legit at the end? And I know Jax said there was peace everywhere, but he said that all the time in season 7 so why is it believable the last time? There were so many questions left unanswered. But even though my review was about all the bad things, there were a lot of good things too. The acting was good, especially Katey Sagal, and the characters are pretty likable. The story lines are for the most part interesting. You really start to care about Jax's family. And I cared so much about Gemma that after she killed Tara I hated her but I actually still loved her. I never really cared about the cub members that much (Tig, Chibbs, Bobby, etc.) but they were funny at times. I would recommend this show if you like a lot of action and excitement. But if you are a realist, like myself, I wouldn't watch it. It gets painful to watch at times and if you get hooked you cant stop, even with the errors.
9.0~Nice plot and absolutely the best music in a serie!! It focuses on all the members of the club, not only to Jax Teller! I recommend that and surely you will feel such as you live in Charming town!
10.0~This show has so much going for it--and I'm glad F/X has chosen to continue this ride. (Sorry, I just couldn't resist that little pun.) The writing is incredible and the characters are are so well developed that viewers can relate to them--perhaps even respect them, in spite of their obvious flaws, weaknesses, and challenges that draw us to them. The cast is incredibly talented--each actor is strong enough to be a lead and carry their own story-line but, as an ensemble, they're even stronger and they definitely bring their best performance to each and every episode. I was very skeptical about Katy Sagal ever selling me on a character other than "Peg Bundy", and I admit, I was dead wrong! She IS Gemma! (RIP Peggy....) There are so many reasons this show has viewers hooked--If I tried to list them, I'd run out of space! It only took one episode for me to be a major fan. The only thing wrong with the show is that the season is way too short!! This is a strong show with equally strong subject matter and delivery, and F/X schedules it accordingly-so if you're easily offended (or if you have children/teen viewers), perhaps you should opt for another channel (and DVR/TIVO it for later viewing).
6.0~Having finished recently I thought id give my opinion on this show and how great i think it is. I could talk about this show for hours but ill keep it brief. This show is pretty great. The performances were fantastic throughout with the likes of Charlie hunnam Ron Perlman and Katey Seagel being the stand outs. There is also a lot of action throughout the show that is directed for the most part really well. There are also lots of twists and turns throughout the show that will shock you and at times make you feel sick. Which is one of the things that makes this show unique. These people are just bad people there is no way around that. Which is why at times these characters that you are rooting for are going to do things that makes you wonder why you are even rooting for this gang of bikers which is great. The show is not perfect however. There is a lot of downtime where the main story isn't really progressing and this really shows in the final season where nothing really happens but then in the final 3 episodes it all kicks off. Also at times the writing could get a little sloppy but definitely not bad in anyway. Overall i really enjoyed this show and its sad to see it go. You should definitely at least give sons of anarchy a chance as it takes you on one hell of a ride.
9.0~Addictive, emotionally charged, brilliantly acted.
7.0~Let me preface this by saying that Sons of Anarchy is a very solid show and the acting is often impeccable. Maggie Siff, (Tara), and Katie Segal (Gemma) bring their "A" game almost every episode. However, this show relies heavily on violence and typical TV tropes. Violence is used to get a response so often that that while it is going for "shock value" its hard to be shocked when violence is the norm. Episodes regularly follow the same patterns (particularly in season premiers and finales. Music montage depicting normal activity, reintroduce us to characters, insert conflict, action and resolution, music montage. That is a pretty typical set up. While this show is solid and enjoyable, it is by no means of the quality showrunner Kurt Sutter believes it to be. He regularly goes after critics and award committees, but if one watches the dramas that show up come awards season it will come of no surprise to sees SoA left out. While nowhere near the best drama out there, Sons of Anarchy is a highly entertaining, soap opera of show that will keep you coming back episode after episode.
3.0~High IMDb ratings had led me to watch masterpieces such as The Wire, Dexter, The Shield, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Treme, and Game of Thrones. With an 8.7 rating, I was confident that Sons of Anarchy would be another IMDb slam-dunk. Boy was I wrong. Sons of Anarchy isn't so much a drama as it is a soap opera with a generous dose of violence. The typical show begins with a montage of characters going through their morning routines, as oldies music plays in the background. Soon enough, someone gets a phone call, emits a distressed "Jesus Christ!", and our favorite band of criminals hops on their bikes to go solve the problem. This is shortly followed by a series of unbelievable explosions and senseless violence. By the end of the episode, teary promises have been made, and the episode concludes with more oldies music. Rinse, lather, and repeat. The story lines are bland and construed; the characters are weak and cheesy. Character development? Forget about it. Characters play the same roles, over and over again. They never learn, and they never evolve. More than anything, they are just boring. They fail to grip the viewer, and instead becoming something of an annoyance. Not only are the episodes repetitive, but they are also riddled with plot holes. In the small town of Charming, California, the Sons of Anarchy somehow manage to explode bombs in broad daylight and murder hundreds of people, all without hardly a member going to jail. That's right, the small Charming police force only seems to be around when a plot hole needs to be filled, and when federal agents are finally involved, they bungle their work in the most unbelievable of ways. Let's put it this way, in the real world any gang remotely as brutal and careless as Sons of Anarchy was operating in small town in California, the FBI would be on them within the week. At some point it no longer is entertaining to watch the Sons of Anarchy engage in risky business because you quickly learn that with only a handful of exceptions, they are indestructible. They can blow up what they want, kill who they want, all while drunk and/or high, and not only that; they'll do it regularly and escape under the most incredulous conditions. Somehow this band of paroled alcoholics make the Navy SEALS look like a bunch of inexperienced rookies. On the bright side, the production is good, and some of the music can be catchy. But these positives are heavily outweighed by the negatives. All in all, Sons of Anarchy is a sub par show. If you want a quality show along similar lines, go pick up a season of The Shield.
10.0~One of the best TV-Series I've watched , I just finished it yesterday. If u start watching it you will love all about SOA , the characters, the story line , the club and more.Eventually you're beginning to realize how toxic can it be that kind of life.As Jackson at the first episodes and a few seasons maybe , wasn't that cruel , revengeful , so soulless.Struggling to be a member of a club like that and a good husband / father.He had so much to lose , that's what didn't allowed him to be clear-headed at all.As he said on his last words talking to J.T's spot , ~The war with your own mind is more difficult that anything else"~. Even that he knew the story , the purposes , the end of his father he didn't managed to avoid it.History repeated itself. At least Jackson sacrificed himself and managed to cut ties and deals with gun,drug business from the club as his father wanted. He secured a good life for his kids.That's what a true leader does.And Jacks did it. Now somethings that I didn't like for example Gemma should suicide , I mean how could she even lived after all?How could she let Jackson take a huge burden like that from killing her.Because she knew that Jacks will have to kill her eventually.I think that kill swallowed Jackson.She should wrote a suicide note to admit everything and kill herself.But instead she acted selfishly for one more time. However, I loved every second of it.Lets hope for a spin-off with the first nine or maybe from his son Abel. RIP SAMCRO!
8.0~The best ending of a series i've ever seen until now and also the best musical moments you can find. The action and story line is well defined and the actors are very complex. The final scene was better then I expected as you see a element on the ground and realize something you've seen a lot in some episodes and will give you some chills.The morality of the show is the struggle of choosing between what you love to do and what you should do for the loved ones, the demons you need to fight in order to thank everyone without betray anyone at the same time. I highly recommend to watch the show as long as you love rock music, choppers and the meaning of the word "brotherhood".
8.0~I love this show but I find myself in hate with the main characters Jax Teller and his girlfriend Tara Knowles. I don't think that Charlie Hunnam was ever the right person to play Jax Teller (he should have stuck with gay-dude roles like the one he played on Queer as Folk). I think he is an awful actor and doesn't pull off the biker-dude role AT ALL. His on-set girlfriend, Maggie Siff, is nothing to write home about either (she was horrible on Nip/Tuck too). Other than those two the rest of the cast is awesome, if it weren't for Ron Pearlman and Katey Sagal the show would have tanked in my humble opinion.
9.0~A friend of mine recommended me this show a few years ago,so I decided to give it a chance,and i wasn't mistaken.At the beginning and at the first two seasons things were going smoothly and calmly,just to explain the past of the samcro,but then everything changed,a whole other story.Each member of the club has his own history,and they all follow their president at whatever his say until the end.The story was very very good with lots of surprises and with many twists,really this story can taught you a lot.The choice of songs were terrific especially at the last scene of the series,these seven last minutes with that song will be in mind for ever.
6.0~Sons Of Anarchy had a fantastic first season but after that it really jumped the shark in my opinion. Season 2 was basically filler, season 3 had a nice pilot and an amazing finale but the problem with this season is it was so unrealistic its ridiculous. In season 3 against all odds everyone somehow manages to survive and they have a happy ending, which really takes the realism out of the show (not to mention the obnoxious Irish remix of the intro song). Season 4 is a very well made season except for the fact that barely anyone dies, or anyone that we really cared about. Season 5-7 is where the series has really jumped the shark, once again barely any characters that you actually had any emotional connection to die in the 5th season (Opie was a very boring character and to me his death was freedom from his shitty life). Also Kurt Sutter completely forgot about the whole getting out of guns thing so he decided to make Jax a more evil character. Season 6 was the season Jax finally decided to get the club out of guns, so to do that he kills more gangsters and innocent people. The 6th season wasn't terrible though, they finally remembered Clay was still alive and killed him off, then Tara finally dies (Not saying I wanted her to die but lets be honest she impossibly survived so many situations that she had to die at some point). Season 7 is not very good, the first half is extremely boring and really not convincing me that Jax is even anywhere close to being an anti-hero at this point, the premise to this season was very good though except for the fact that the first half of the season is basically season 6 without Tara. I haven't even finished the season yet because I was so tired of it (on the final episode) and also why do they wait until the last episode to push the plot of Jax fulfilling his father's wishes, this should've happened like 3 seasons ago. All in all season 1-4 are pretty good but after that the show gets extremely repetitive and ridiculous at times, if they just cut the show down to 4 or 5 seasons maybe there wouldn't be so much filler and other bullcrap but since this was really the only reason people watched FX they had to drag it on for 7 seasons, this is no where near a bad show but it is definitely no where near the quality of shows like The Wire or Breaking Bad.
1.0~I would love to know. I want to see that show. The one I watched, and I watched 2 whole seasons, is appallingly bad. I can't even understand how or why I made it through 2 seasons. Each episode only got more ridiculous. It's a daytime soap disguised as a hard-hitting drama. A federal agent shoots her witness then frames Katey Sagal even though Sagal just shot someone else with a completely different gun? Who's buying this? The leader of the Mayans has to be the DUMBEST dude in the history of mankind! Every time he shows up on screen he's getting burned by SAMCRO. The writing is purely guttural and shows no thought process whatsoever. The acting is laughable. It...it just defies explanation how this show is so popular. What I witnessed is a complete disaster. Someone PLEASE tell me where the good one is!!!
5.0~Was it totally on necessary to use the name of the Lord in vain over and over and over took a lot of way from the movie
10.0~One of The best series I've ever seen , i really can't describe you how good it is , I'm addicted to it , and it gets better and better, season 7 was the best season , #samcro for life brother#
8.0~Harley's, cool dude's, gorgeous chicks, guns, random and reckless violence and gratuitous sex - what's not to like?! The only surprise here is Michael Chicklis not appearing as a rival gang-leader - he's big and ugly enough (He did make a cameo in a prison cell TV screening of The Shield...)! I've watched all 69 episodes these past 3 weeks and it's been a roller coaster of a ride. For no reason that I can explain I cried during Opie's funeral episode. It's strange how you can miss somebody so much in death yet they never had a huge impact while alive?? This series has the same grit and realism of The Shield but more character and plot depth. As mentioned in earlier reviews, too many of the twists and turns are implausible if not downright ridiculous but we still soak it all up and love it nonetheless. Opie's death sentence by the gang was the low-point for me credibility-wise. For the gang to condemn poor old hapless Opie for installing federal wiretaps in his pick-up without confronting him and to kill his wife by mistake smacks of bad script writing, as such a thing would just not happen in SAMCRO reality?? Oh, and like other viewers I think I was well into series 2 before I 'discovered' that Sam Crowe wasn't actually a person! Poor writing again guys... Where did we want Series 6 to go? All 5 series' have been leading towards Jax up tailing it with his wife and kids and heading East and S5 finishes off with him more ensconced as Gang President than ever - doing even crazier stuff than Clay might have done.
5.0~The biggest problem this show had is that it's too damn long. Subplots are dragged on for way too long, some only to give the current season 13 episodes. I understand building tension to an eventual climax, but the build-up is 6, 7, sometimes even 8 episodes. Asking the viewer to put up with setback after setback, and plot twist after plot twist is a tall order. Now this wouldn't be a big problem, if the conflicts made sense, but the length of a lot of these are just ridiculous. Let me give you a few examples. Season 2 has the club dealing with a group of neo-Nazis, the leader is pure evil, and does some absolutely terrible things. After Season 2, the Nazi group isn't mentioned again, and the leader isn't even killed. So what was the point of dragging out the conflict for 13 episodes? Give me a legit answer, please. Another example is Clay being kept alive way longer than he should've been. He gets found out in Season 4, and isn't killed until halfway through Season 6. Why? Because they had to beat a dead horse for a little while longer. The same for Juice and Gemma and Tara, The last season is so drawn out it hurts. They could've wrapped the show up great with the final season being 6 episodes, but a lie is drawn out for 10 episodes, a lie the audience knows the truth to for the whole time. It's ridiculous. I eventually just watched the final season solely because I had watched all the other episodes. Of course it also doesn't help that the final 5 episodes are over an hour long, each, for again no reason. This show can have some great moments, but it's slow moments are torturous. I normally do a "Best and Worst Episodes" list, but I don't think I can for this show, there's too much freakin' fluff, and not enough impact. I'll figure something out though, I always do. If you can put up with all 11 million subplots, and twists, and the drawn out build-up, then good for you, but it killed the show for me.
10.0~This show is the embodiment of what being in a real biker gang(despite the legal ramifications) is all about. It's got drama that really might happened to a biker gang, guns, drugs, and deals with local gangs. All these elements seem to give a sense of authenticity and zeal. Now onto the actual plot, Jax the "VP" of the club has discovered his dead fathers journals in his old things, now up to this point he had been led to believe that his father went along with all the gunrunning and shady dealings that the club has been doing, although his journal seems to suggest something entirely different. In the meantime we have Gemma(jax's mother) trying desperately to cover this truth up to what end we don't know yet. Clay (the clubs "Prez") has assumed the role of jax's father-figure and seems to have his own ideas about the way the club should be going. There's also a few more characters to take note of like Tara (jax's love interest) and Opie (jax's best friend), but all and all a very well written out story and plot hats off to Kurt Sutter for creating yet another brilliant series. Keep'em coming we love it!
10.0~This series is so great, for me at least. I mean I like these kinda shows. I mean (again) these anti-hero based shows are just awesome. The acting is so damn good and plot is so great. There are many different characters and the main one is just "bad-ass". There is a good message in this show and you know, you can just watch it for entertainment, only. I you like a "bad-ass-anti-hero" based show, then this show is legendary.
10.0~The best show the whole show I mean the finaly it wast f^&:^* amazing
2.0~This TV show wasn't that great to begin with. Although, as a comedy it was entertaining. The idea that some broad can run an MC, from the shadows, is ludicrous. This just doesn't happen. This is making itself evident, by the way she (or the writers) is screwing things up with her BS. So, she gets 'turned out'.....like that never happens in the outlaw world. This has gone from a comedy, to a chick flick soap opera. I'd like to see more on the porn company the 'club' got into. Come on.....how about some babes! How about some action! Currently it is quite pathetic. There are tons of chick shows on TV. this could be better than that. Maybe men (real ones) should write for this show. Get rid of that girlie boy 'Jax' too. If this don't improve....I'm out of here.
5.0~MAJOR SPOILERS. My GF and I disliked the violent, totally dishonest and rather stupid characters (i.e., psychopaths) but "had to" watch the series anyway because we wanted to see them get what they deserved. Save yourself some time: they get away with everything. The acting and such was decent enough, the plots and dialog were pretty weak. Their gang uniforms, apparently designed by little kids, always made me think of gas station attendants. The interactions with police of any and all types were pretty comical and spoiled the series quite a bit, amounting to "Don't arrest them, they might not like it." Having the police watch them run out of an occupied church carrying shotguns and automatic rifles, and then disarm them, was no problem at all because the surveillance video wasn't very good... The political correctness was pretty typical of Hollywood and detracted from the show: we kept expecting the tobacco-free, racially sensitive outlaws to attend some DNC wine tastings and have quiche at luncheon. They briefly had a black baby-sitter, but she disappeared as soon as their racial sensitivity was established. The main bad guy in the show - the extra-bad bad guy - is - get ready - a real estate developer; they emit some sophomoric economic ideas as justification. At the end of the series they're basically working for the CIA and pretending to be outlaws. They find out their main guy has killed some other members of their gang, but won't get revenge on him because they need him for the CIA work, and they don't want to get in trouble. Nobody important gets killed or permanently injured.
8.0~So good I'm thinking about watching it a second time. Love the soundtrack!
9.0~If somebody were to ask you if you could ever feel yourself to be part of a gang which ruthlessly murders & tortures people and feeds guns to organized crime, you answer would probably be an outraged 'No'. However, when you are watching this series, not only do you feel yourself to be there among these outlaws, witnessing their every good or bad action, laughing with them, riding with them, drinking with them and crying with them, you also start understanding them. You understand the outlaw code, why they do what they do, why it is so important for them to make it right with those who wrong them, why a club is at least as important to them as their families. I believe that any show or movie is successful only if, at any point in the show, you feel exactly what the director wants you to feel. While watching this series, there were times when I was filled with revulsion for Gemma Teller and there were other moments when I sympathized with that very same character and at some level I even understood why she did what she did. That's the power of characterization in a show and it manifests itself when the viewers start understanding the characters at such level that they don't need any rationalizations for the actions of the characters. The character of the protagonist Jax Teller has been portrayed beautifully and successfully shows a man tormented by his internal conflicts in doing justice to both his family and his outlaw organization. He understands everything and tries to set things right but in the end has to embrace his destiny. Throughout the series, and especially in the last season, the plot was wonderfully set such that everything comes together and fits nicely and snugly. On the acting front both Charlie Hunnam and Katy Segal have done an excellent job of bringing to life a highly conflicted and a highly resolute characters respectively. Overall, loved this show.
2.0~This show was promising in the first season, but it quickly showed it's crap colors. As others have said, it's nothing but a soap opera peppered with absolutely asinine scenarios. In this fantasy land, cops don't exist, at least not in the capacity in which they do in the real world. And in this fantasy land, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is a hyper-dramatic drama queen. Each scene starts with a silent moment where some dumb biker sits there with a contemplative look on their face. The dumb biker is usually surrounded by other dumb people mulling over the dumb biker's latest dramatic dilemma. Like these people have nothing better to do with their lives than sit there and feed the dumb biker's sappy ego. The show is complete crap. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because a few episodes of the first season showed promise. That quickly faded.
10.0~I went into this show thinking it would be another decent action show that would fail after 2 seasons, after a few episodes though, my mind was very pleasantly changed. This show is as entertaining and deep as the shield or the sopranos, it bears many resemblances to Hamlet and is obviously based on the Hells Angels. It has deep interesting plots that really pull you into the story, the acting and character development is so deep and incredible that you can relate to the characters, fear for them, hope for them and worry about them. the writing is great as well, great dialogue, interesting stories, and surprisingly realistic. it is also smart, something rare in todays reality TV and soap operas, with intricate stories that aren't just senseless violence, not that there is no violence. it has been called the sopranos on motorcycles, but i think the sopranos should be called SoA with more Italians. With the new episodes coming out i'm really excited for the season finale, Donna is dead, Abel came home, jax slept with his ex and all in one episode. Cant wait for the season finale, then i wont be able to wait for season 2. This is an incredible show that really stands out, and it would be a serious injustice to be canceled. If you have yet to witness SAMCROW i highly advise you check it out, all the episodes are on hulu.com, if you've seen it and loved it like me, support it by watching all the new episodes and buying the DVDs when they come out(cant wait) and if you don't like, well you can go back to your mindless reality TV and soap operas.
10.0~You will hear lots of good and lots of bad about this show, just as you do with any show. However I personally love this show and think it is by far one of the best shows I have watched. I loved Dexter, Breaking Bad, The Shield, NCIS, Law & Order Special Victims Unit and many others, but this show is more nail-biting and extreme than anything else I have watched. Love it or hate it a lot of people still talk about it which makes it one of the best shows on T.V. today. I hope my review helps you consider watching and season 7, which is the last season, will be EPIC! If you have not yet seen the show please take the time to at least watch a few episodes as some people might think it starts out a little slow where others will think it starts out with a bang.
6.0~Sons of anarchy tries to be a Soprano-like series and fails miserably. Characters are all over the place, having a puppet-like behaviour which is not believable. For gun dealers / killers these guys are unprofessional , hot headed, non practical, something that woudlnt work in the real criminal world. Main character Jax's favourite sentence is : "i promise you" , which after all those seasons he havent fulfilled any promise whatsoever but he keeps saying it with such conviction , like he forgets what hapenned in the previous episode. The series is watchable and some times entertaining if you are able not to take it too seriously and switch of some areas of your brain.
10.0~Love this show , all actors are good and the script & story is well presented, gripping show , I finished the 8 seasons in one week during Xmas period !
10.0~excellent show. i've crossed paths before with show then one day i decided to give it as hot. on the second episode i was hooked on and never stopped watching the show. the end of season 7 is a extremely sad. i recommend seeing this show and paying attention. 10/10 excellent. this show tends to be sad a few times makes you feel inpatient. all of the issues tend to make you feel that way. the amazing cast makes it feel right and including a few funny scenes with David labrava. including his real experience as a member of a real California motorcycle club. its extremely sad towards the end of the 6th season and towards the end of the 7th season. i really recommend this show for adults only.
5.0~Been reading how people here think the show is almost like a mirror image of the real biker life. I find that pretty hard to believe myself. Watched the first 4 episodes and I finally got enough of how easy everything seems to be for these "realism bikers" which culminated with that horrible firefight at the sons new nevada branch in episode 4. Here we have 20+ bikers going at it face to face with mere feet between them, hurling bullets at each other without even one being just somewhat seriously injured it would seem. And then they just walk away as if the scene was from a John Wayne western-movie fistfight . But that's just the firefights. Everything on the show seems to be so staged that it immediately blows away any scraps of authenticity for these bikers.
6.0~Sons of Anarchy gets off to a rough start. Although it's style is very similar to The Shield (which I adored) the characters don't gel as nicely and a couple of actors seem out of place. The sporadic bouts of narration as Charlie Hunnam's character reads his fathers journal are also out of tune with the rest of the show and Katey Sagal's character seems a tad OTT partially due to her performance, but mainly because her lines seem like they were designed for Joan Collins. Things get substantially better after a few episodes with awkward introductions behind us and some fine tuning by actors as they find their rhythm. The writing also seems much tighter and I'm starting to feel like I'm watching a good movie. I'm not sure how much mileage this story has got left without cast changes, however I'm most definitely investing in the second season and happy to see that gray area so often visited by The Shield given prominence in a show which explores similar themes while doing it's own thing.
8.0~I have watch all seven seasons of the show a few times now. I was hooked from season one episode one and was always left wondering what would happen next. Between the second and third time watching it I watched Blue Bloods and then watched SOA again after that. Then I started thinking about it all to critically I suppose but it is what it is. I was half way way through season one for the third time when I realized this. Danny from blue-bloods would have already shut it down before the end of season one with his first partner. Most of it you know is unrealistic but I humor myself by comparing the two shows. After I watched Danny and his family doing their thing I realized that Danny would have taken off running after them and make sure its done and over with. I am sure that their are gangs that do some of the stuff they do but its highly unlikely. Maybe I am thinking to much into it since it is just a TV show. It just seems like the last six season were just filler to keep it going on to make sure that there was a cushion behind it after it finished up. I still gave it a decent rating because I still like the show just not in the same capacity as before. Thank you for reading my review.
1.0~I guess folks that love network TV and can't or haven't ever watched an HBO or AMC series rank this show pretty high because maybe it's all they have for comparison. That being said, this show is rotten. The acting may be the worst of any show I've ever seen that is rated above an 8.5 on IMDb with this number of ratings. The plot is pretty silly all around. Maybe it picks up in the third season, but I couldn't make it that far. Who would... If you want real drama series that is amazing, watch the Wire, Sopranos, Breaking Bad or hell, even Prison Break. This show is a hot mess.
7.0~At the end of season 6, I find an increasing lack of satisfaction with the show. Many, if not all of the characters are unlikeable at best, including those of Katey Sagal, Charlie Hunnam, and Maggie Siff. In addition, the body count per season is rising significantly. So much so I start to wonder if the town of Charming can perhaps be looking somewhat deserted. Initially, the central and ancillary characters all had their merits, but as the seasons progressed, they changed, perhaps to the ultimate detriment of the show. Earlier, there were occasional bursts of black humor and the plot twists were few but served to propel the storyline and increase both tension and interest. Sadly, no more. It is becoming a relief to reach the closing credits for each episode because the morbid songs that often serve as a soundtrack to the ending scenes are just too depressing. Sutter's writing remains powerful though and the actors - lead and otherwise - give sterling performances. All seem to judge their roles perfectly and give terrific performances, though Jimmy Smits is a standout. At times and in other shows I'm acutely aware that I'm watching actors at work, but not so in SoA. They all seem authentic and for this I can mark the show higher than I otherwise would, though if I was writing this after season 3, I'd mark it much higher still. And as has become almost the norm, the season ends with an apparently impending prison term for an otherwise innocent character. So I await season 7, but with less enthusiasm than previously. I no longer have the strength of interest in the character's fortunes, and may well move on to something else come September. That said, I'm hopeful Sutter will rediscover originality and inspiration and is able to elevate SoA to the heights it once reached.
10.0~Wow just when I thought FX couldn't do better than the shield I got the Sons of Anarchy. This show is just about perfect. Ron Pearlman and Katy Segal make two of the most interesting villains I have seen in a long time, (the trick is I am not sure if they can be called villains or not, they do bad things but for semi good reasons) even the supporting cast shines in this show. The story with Opie and his family made for one of the most heart rending moments all season. I just hope season 2 keeps the same high values as season 1. This is one of those shows that I find myself waiting to come on from week to week I haven't been this excited about a show since the Shield and Rescue Me. Long Live SAMCRO
10.0~Sons of anarchy is easily the best tv show I have watched. I recommend going through it slowly because the story and characters progress slowly but in loads of detail. You grow to love and hate different characters and any of them can be ripped away from you at any moment. I took a break from the series at season 4 but after coming back to it I forgot how much I loved it. I recommend this show to everybody. Very violent at times but fits with the theme of the show. Very good story.
10.0~The writing and the acting in this show set it apart from 99% of other television shows and movies. While no show is perfectly written or filmed, this one is far and away better than nearly everything else. Why? Several reasons, but here are a couple. 1- More than any other drama I can think of, SOA avoids resorting to highly contrived scenes and plots. How many crime or action shows have LEO characters attempt to clear rooms with their guns held at arms length as they walk through doors and around corners without first clearing blind spots? This kind of forced stupidity absolutely strains credulity and like other viewers I hate it. Only lazy, stupid jerks write scenes like that. They assume viewers are idiots and won't notice how forced and phony the writing is. Apparently this is an old favorite method for building suspense, for giving viewers that "uh oh, something bad is about to happen" feeling. But such writing is transparent and insults the audience. SOA writers didn't do that. Their writing was almost always realistic in those areas. Sure, the characters in the show are unusual, but their behavior is believable. In the same way, the writers did not resort to making most characters emotionally labile as the majority of other drama writers do. There is plenty of emotion in the show, but it is developed realistically, and most of the characters have a normal amount of emotional maturity, so the viewer is able to relate to and go along with it. There is a lot more to be said for this show of course. But I was and am extremely pleased with the realism of the writing, and also of the acting. One more thing which makes the show so believable and good: it was not another vehicle for "political correctness". The writers avoided all that phony thinking and speaking. In one episode a SOA member remarked that he had taken his son out of T ball because every member of every team was given a winner's trophy. As normal people in real life do, he recognized that the school's attempt to eliminate winners and losers is harmful to children. Far too many TV shows appear to be vehicles for promoting "PC" nonsense like that. SOA was not one of them.
6.0~Last summer I had a nasty arm fracture and was bed ridden for about 3 weeks.. In that time I started watching two TV series; "Breaking Bad," and "Sons of Anarchy," (SoA). At first SoA was the more interesting show featuring a larger cast, more action, and a promising story line. Spoiler alert, Breaking Bad ended up being the far superior show when everything shook itself out. I won't compare SoA to Breaking Bad for the rest of the review, but I thought it might help to establish my point of reference. The first season of SoA is awesome. It introduces us to the highly flawed (and I mean highly) anti-hero Jax Teller. He is dealing with the loss of his real father and the growing discontent he shares towards his step father and president of the bike gang, Clay(Ron Perlman). Season 1 also deals primarily with the bike "club's" negative relationship with the Sheriff of the local town of Charming, CA. Long story short, the season is exciting. It gives us an inside look into the culture and dealings of a biker gang...Something that is generally "kept a secret," so to say. After the third season though, it gets a bit stale. The characters don't offer anything new, and the story lines all become the same. Don't get me wrong, there are still exciting moments, but they are few and far between. Acting is pretty first rate for the most part. Ron Perlman is easily the best actor in the show and the most fun to watch; His character really is menacing and conniving. Other actors I enjoyed watching are the guy who plays "Tig" as well as "Chibbs." Charlie Hunnam is a good actor, but his character is frighteningly one dimensional...Now, I'm not sure if that's how it was written, but it's painful to watch at times. The rest of the actors are tolerable, but nothing to rave over. I found myself becoming less and less engaged with the show once the whole Irish plot came up. It started getting really boring. I would check my phone a lot and do other things while "watching the show." It's a classic example of a show that had a short run as "the most popular show on TV," but took it waaaaaay too far. The latter seasons aren't BAD, but they really aren't all that good either. There are far better shows out there.
10.0~Kurt Sutter kept you on your toes throughout this entire series. Throwing in curve balls and heart wrenching moments. Definitely a show I would own, re-watch and recommend to friends. The acting was phenomenal throughout the entire show. The connections made with the characters within the show and just how the actors interacted behind the scenes really set off the chemistry for the show. The writing and dialogue set up for the show was very professional and non-repetitive. Again the show character and emotions were excellent and the casting was spot on in filling all the roles. So sad to see the series end but it made a full circle and closed beautifully.
1.0~This does contain a serious spoiler because this show should be spoilt. So I finally watched an episode. Never had any interest before but since this seems to be the final season ?? I thought that the opening episode will give me an insight. It did, and what is more disturbing it gave me an insight as to how low the viewing public that seems to support this garbage must be. What in the name of human decency are these people doing? Well nothing obviously because decent behaviour is not on this shows agenda. One could make all sorts of statements about the boring plot line but who cares. What one does need to mention is that this stuff should never have been allowed to go to air. It is a disgrace and like violent videos does nothing but gratify cruel and demeaning behaviour. Are the US public really this apathetic to what is shown on their TV's or is the freedom of speech gone ballistically mad? To cut to the end scene where we have the protagonist (in this case a totally pathetic thug) doing a torture on a guy in a most disturbingly ugly way. Now I am not a squeamish person but I can see how this would be just not on for any juvenile but I know thousands of juveniles watch this and in some way find it appealing and that is just what the producers of this show are wishing for. The entire time his enterage of thugs are watching as if they were at a screening of a bake and cake show and this is where I must say that the actors who are doing this seem to be very professional because I can imagine that they were none to pleased with this script. If they were not then there we also have a serious problem.This sort of violence is just not wanted by cultured people but then what can you say is cultured about a vast percentage of the US civilians. Sad society reaping the reward for unfettered violence and a gun culture gone mad. Back in the real world for a second, I have to add that as a tax paying citizen I am disgusted that I have some of my money going towards incarcerating these type of gang thugs. Exterminate them!
10.0~My friend suggests me to watch this, at first I don't know what kind of show this is, but when I started watching, this show is totally an epic one. What an acting, what a thinking of the Hero. Liked every bit of it. This show is also very helpful for me in my life, not that I am in this kind of business, but I have a rough life and I wanted to do the things right. Jackson Teller is my inspiration, I learned many things from him. In the end, I would highly recommend this show if you have done such things in your life that you don't have to do and you wanted it to be right, then I guess this show is for you, showing you the life.
1.0~I find this show to be hyper-edited; that is, how quickly each shot is cut, so that a conversation is characterized by rapid cuts, each actor saying but a single line before the camera switches to the next actor. Other scenes with fewer such edits have a mildly shaking camera, particularly during tense situations. The show is highly produced, and the writing immaculate; it is indeed a finely crafted show. Action comes quick, and characters have powerful things to say. The viewer is assaulted by powerful words, aggressively delivered, and intense evolving drama each scene. To this the editing suits the fast-paced delivery, the frenetic camera-work matching the dizzying story lines and blistering action. It is meticulously crafted, muscular drama.
5.0~When I first started watching Sons of Anarchy, I admit, I found it quite entertaining. However, as the seasons went on, it became a far fetched (and I mean seriously far fetched - like science fiction) slaughter fest. There is a total absence of brotherhood that the MC supposedly has. Everyone is out for themselves in this show, and I mean everyone.... at least everyone that counts. The ones that are not, are insignificant or killed off. Nothing ever goes as you hope it would. You bond with characters, only to see them wronged in some freaky scenario that only a Hollywood writer can come up with. My favorite line, and its repeated often is Jax "I'll never let that happen." He is talking to his wife, saying she will never get hurt, etc, yada yada ya. However, him being in the line of business he is in, it impossible to make promises like that. The biggest problem with this show is how every little thing falls perfectly into place to make the plot work.... the impossibility of how things transpire is painfully obvious. I cant bear to watch any more of it after the 6th season ended.....and yes, that is partly because the only character that made sense in the show was killed off.
9.0~A son discovers that his mother and her lover have killed his father and have taken over the motor cycle club that should have belonged to his father. He embarks on his revenge, and his Harley. Unlike Hamlet this young prince marries his love and has children. Over time, seasons of the series, his wife changes into a lady Macbeth type character but who could blame her? The answer most of the club, an ex-sheriff, and some of the best character actors in American television. If some actor has distinguished him or herself in television watch the series long enough and you will see them here. At the time I am writing recent episodes have had Donal Logue, CCH Pounder and Peter Weller. The series pushes the limit of what networks have traditionally allowed on television but Sons' heart, if not groin, is in the right place.
7.0~Sons Of Anarchy has one, huge problem: Charlie Hunnam's character, Jackson 'Jax' Teller. He's a whiny little sh*t. The rest of the cast are all strong, and more-or-less believable. We've got Chibbs (Tommy Flanagan, with his real Glasgow Smile), Bobby (I've met so many big ole bikers who are like him) and Juice (Theo Rossi is an underrated actor IMHO). We've got Happy, played by David Labrava who is a Hells Angel in real life as well as a bike-magazine writer. NONE of these guys would do anything, except laugh, at some piece of fairy floss like Jax trying to be 'tough'. No matter how many things they get him to do, no matter how they ratchet up the tension, I just CANNOT take him seriously. I'm not even sure it's Charlie's fault - I think it's maybe just the character. I quite liked him in Pacific Rim. But then they chose to put a fine-featured little blonde boy in the role of an MC bad-boy: it's the producers' bed and now they must lay in it. The series keeps re-using the same plot devices over and over again, but... like we care? As has been said many times, including by the cast, it leans very heavily on Shakespeare. Round and round we go, seeing how many different types of trouble we can get ourselves into, and what profound realisations we can make in the depths of despair, the heights of victory, and in the hysterically absurd. It must be noted that, as far as I can tell, no real bikies watch this show. I attended an appearance by 3 members of the cast, and, apart from the poor guys copping some of the dumbest questions anyone could ever be asked, the audience contained no low-percenters. No, it was wall to wall nerds. Who cares. It's got its faults, its gone silly and come back again a couple of times. It rocks. I'm good with that.
6.0~After dragging myself through a show that became gradually worse for every episode since Ron Perlman, they were serving up a pretty damn decent finale. Until Jax comes to let his club kill him. This moment that the entire series has been building up to, they just decide to mess it all up and pull the good old 'shoot a friend and tell them he got away' out of nowhere. A scene that would have put some resemblance of depth and meaning behind the show, they messed it up. Only to kill Jax right after, BY HIM CRASHING IN A POLICE-CHASE. I can't believe anyone can mess up a setting with this much opportunity for story-telling, emotional conflicts and action, but they did. It's like they just didn't care at all past the 4th season, which stands in sharp contrast to the first 3 seasons which were actually really good. The terrible aim of everyone shooting at the sons in this series annoyed me. The incompetence of certain antagonists annoyed me. The constantly changing cast of club-members that had increasingly little to no introduction, personality or relevance at all annoyed me. But the botched ending made me angry. I may be leading you on to believe that this series is utterly terrible, which it's really not it has a lot of well-written conflict, interactions and a lot of interesting characters. Unfortunately they fail to deliver any of that for almost half the show, where it really seemed like the show should have ended, but they extended it for 3 more seasons where they thought "screw it, this show can survive solely on Charlie Hunman playing a likable character" Which is just not enough for anything that wants to take itself more seriously than a soap-opera. What annoys me is not the mediocrity of the show, it's that it should have been and could have been so much better.
1.0~I loved the series until season 4 but than it all went rapidly downhill i mean who thought we want to see even more of this old stupid ugly b....? Yes im talking about gemma or what ever her stupid name is pronunced. I could tolerate that a BIKER SERIES has women included but it just makes no sense at all that this ultra annoying thing got more and more showtime?????!!!!! It ruined the show completely!!!
10.0~Contrary to what seems like 90% of the public I did not enjoy Breaking Bad & thought it unworthy of the hype. Everyone would tell me 'stick with it' 'it gets better after a certain series ' but my reply was always that if a series doesn't entice you from the get go then it wasn't worth watching the whole way through. I had a similar fears when I sat down to watch Sons of Anarchy after a recommendation from a friend. But after two weeks I've finished all seven series & I'm at a loss as to what to do with my free time. Sons isn't for everyone but it is a fantastically written series whose characters become your family. You connect with every character as an individual which I haven't found with many other series I've watched. You will have at least five or six favourite characters throughout the series (but don't get too attached Sutter's writing is ruthless- no one is safe) Both Kurt Sutter's writing & the incredibly well chosen cast shine through and I never wanted it to end.
8.0~To me not Worthy of watching multiple seasons in a day or even multiple episodes but worth having around as a when your bored kind of moment. Very realistic and we'll written. Just has a lot of boring moments for me to stay deeply involved. Acting is amazing honestly everything about the show to me is good but it just seems when it gets on a boring part it just drags and drags.
9.0~I just purchased SOA seasons 1-2 on DVD the other day and have to say it was definitely the best show since The Sopranos. The acting is just great Charlie Hunnam, Katey Sagal, Ron Pearlman and Mark Boone Junior all do fantastic jobs. the story line is just flawless, a bunch of guys who ride bikes, run the town and kick the crap out of other gangs what's more awesome than that? It is a good mix of drama, crime and a few black comedy moments. You get to know the characters very well and to know and understand their lives and learn to love or hate the way the Sons Of Anarchy live. it's one of those shows that is totally original and will probably go down in history as one of the best shows of all time. All in all this is an amazing show and one of the most original. It takes you into the lives of motorcycle brotherhood thugs who live life the way a lot of people in my opinion can only dream of living. 10/10 Just awesome, one of the greatest shows on TV!
8.0~I almost didn't give this show a chance because Hollywood rarely offers up fully developed biker characters, much less decent or realistic plots about outlaw biker clubs. If there's a Harley and black leathers in the shot -- bad guys killing and doing bad things -- their work is done. Not so with Sons Of Anarchy. While you will find all of the above elements, they're woven into a much richer fabric that brings each and every character to life in 16 million colors and full resolution, rising above the stereo-typical black-and-white portrayals of VGA-rendered knuckle-dragging villains. And the casting! Katy Segal is phenomenal as Gemma, the widow of club founder and wife of present club runner, Clay Morrow, played by Ron Pearlman. Gemma's son, Jax, played by Charlie Hunnam, butts heads with his step-father's vision for the club. But what really sets this biker drama apart is the context. The bikers are all natives of Charming, childhood friends in a small town. They've kept the town free of corporate tentacles and development, partly so they can run their legal and illegal businesses free of interference (gun-running and porn), and partly because the town itself might as well be a club member. The characters have deep roots to the townspeople who fear but also trust them to a degree, at least in the sense that it's sometimes better to deal with the devil you know and sometimes it's even handy to know the devil. The Sons have 'profitable arrangements' with certain local law enforcement officials, including the Chief of Police played magnificently by Dayton Callie, better known as Deadwood's Charlie Utter. Conflict arises from neighboring clubs, gangs and criminal organizations trying to horn in on the action, and to an Aryan businessman and politician, played by Alan Arkin, who wants to set up shop in Charming and take out the Sons of Anarchy so he can take their place at the top of the criminal heap. As if this wasn't fodder enough, Ally Walker joined the cast in season two as ball-breaking FBI agent June Stahl, going after the Sons and IRA gun runners who are selling to the Sons. Her quest, made painfully personal, by a meeting-gone-wrong with an imprisoned club member. The action is gritty, the anti-heroes are plentiful, the characters are full-bodied and the writing is Class-A. Let Sons of Anarchy become your newest guilt-free pleasure and you'll find yourself heading into it full throttle.
4.0~I find Sons of Anarchy is watchable, but the story line is just ridiculous and the characters are stereotypes. There is happening too much too fast and everything is worked out too easily. Storyline is jumping around as often as in daily soaps. Sons of Anarchy's storyline is far, far away from reality to give it a good rating. I mean when 20 people are involved in a shooting with machine guns, shotguns and pistols within 50 feet range you expect some dead or at least wounded people, but not that everyone is fine. You notice quickly that SoA is all about stupid violence. I think it has potential, but right now it is just boring and I feel kinda stupid to have watched all 3 series so far.. For me it's not more than a 4/10
9.0~The constant violence grew old and much was gratuitous, but it created the story. Jax was COOL with many JC shades. Maggie was smokin hot as Tara, Gemma turned out fast to be a conniving bitch, Lady Macbeth type and Clay was Lear/Trump. The series really touches the race problems post Rodney King in CA. SAMCROW is basically indifferent to race, and Jax more and more ties to unite them, but early on I do hear a few ethnic jabs. The final scene of Jax riding into the semi was brilliant, taking out everything of his father's legacy. In the episode from season one, "fun House," could one of the gonads from the clown have been used by Half-sack?
9.0~This Tv Show is great. But you can't watch it with kids. Many Sex Scene. But Story is Good.
8.0~Great show that feels brutally real and down to earth honest. Gladly without over exaggerated Hollywoodmanners in acting and fx. The only obstacle to get a full 10 star is the feeling of some episodes being pure fillers and some unrealistic events and actions by characters just to bring the story of the episode home. But overall this is one of my favorite TV-shows for being somewhat alone in its genre, at least here in Sweden and the channels I access, and for the good casting of actors. An exception is the casting of prospects who are characterless and look far to bleak and geeky like if the only tough guys in the county are the ones around the table and in other gangs. The difference gets a little to much.
8.0~Sons of Anarchy is a good to great show. It's hard to believe it was on FX and not HBO. I will miss it and it deserves credit for bringing a certain grit and realism for a cable series. I've been with the show since Day 1 and the argument was always too much Gemma. Gemma, Gemma...MF Gemma. Anyone new to the show will go through the same thing, so to all of you I have to say try to get over it. I and many other fans had to get over it but it should be easier to live with if you know before hand that the show is more about Gemma than anything. Watching it from day 1 to the end proved more difficult with handling that. It was the shows only true flaw. ******SPOILERS BELOW****** The first two seasons are great. They set you up for the struggle of the entire series. Jax, Clay, Gemma, JT...the club and family struggle. You think that the show is about Jax and his struggle but it is not. It's about Gemma and her struggle. She is/was in many of our minds at the beginning supposed to be a gatekeeper of secrets. A go-between character that is involved in everything because of what she knows and her relationships with Clay, Jax and JT but she's actually the centerpiece of the show. The show is about HER struggle. She's the Shakespearean tragic figure of the show and not Jax. What happens to her at the end is appropriate and it is filled with emotion. What happens to Jax is empty and unnecessary. The series is great because of all the ensemble moments with SAMCRO and definitely worth watching.
3.0~Honestly I expected more from this show. Started watching it late, not finished all seasons yet, but it's not as great as more people use to say. It's more a big family drama than anything else. First season was worst, second I liked, next are just boring. Never ending lies and secrets of Gemma, brutal murders of Clay and Jax who is always wondering and always have a doubt about everything. Every episode shows how they plot against each other, kissing and embracing each other and a little shooting between bands. There is always a chick with broken nose and too much drama. Not enough good sex scenes, not enough about the other members of the club relationships and life, not enough rock music or good shots of any of them, their bikes or whatever. It's so banal and the same. They work in auto service, it supposed to show some cars and bikes, talk about it, not even a word about that. It's always the same - lies, shooting, kisses. It begins to pall after a few episodes watched. And about Jack, I really liked this man more with long hair despite he rarely washed it. Can't even comment his dressing style, he have a nice body and wearing hobo clothes all the time. Just this show is a big disappointment for me as a fan of rough playing, rock music and fast driving, bikes and classic cars at all. They could do much more. I can't believe how this movie can downplay all the good human sences and emotions, and turn them to something so banal and lower. I really hate I lost my time watching this movie, really. I never actually enjoyed it, none of it.
9.0~Watched it all in 2018-2019. I was quite surprised how fast I got sucked in in this show. The realism and the values of the characters make them quite believable and you can empathize with all of them at some point. This elevates the show on another level. Yes, sometimes the writing and the rest are not god tier and you might find yourself doubting some deus ex machina but it is overall an amazing experience and I totally recommend this show.
7.0~It's a very entertaining show for what it is. I mean- who would get tired of seeing badass bikers kill and shoot at each other? The plots are bit over the top and each episode seems to try to one-up on the previous. The senseless violence can become a bit much, but I still enjoyed it.
10.0~I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. It had been recommended by a couple of people so I decided to give it a go. FX have an absolute diamond of a show on their hands. It is superb The writing is fantastic and the casting is spot on. The plots are intricate and well thought out and the characters are developed to perfection. I was sceptical of Hunnam's ability to pull off an American accent (his cockney one in Green Street Hooligan's was painful) but he nailed it. Katey Sagal absolutely owns the role of powerful matriarch. Kurt Sutter is a genius!
10.0~GgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggGgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggGgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggGggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
10.0~Hold on to your seat boys and girls cause this series will take you on a wild ride. Jax and his boys do everything for the club even if that means taking down a few people along the way, even the ones who rat or try to throw in an "accidental" murder. Now i will say by season 5 all the people that you thought the MC hated come to an alliance and work together against a much bigger threat. You wont be able to stop watching! Warning: WILL BECOME ADDICTIVE!
10.0~I just want to say Sutter is brilliant ...this last episode was out of this world good. I know good and I know bad this was great Yes there were a few continuity issues. But I doubt most people with out the eye saw it. ! Sutter I can't wait to see what project you come up with next . We will all Be anxiously awaiting . Charlie Hunnam I hope he gets several more awards For his role on this show. I cant even imagine the toll on his personal life to get in and Stay in character for this role. A m a z i n g !!! Sutter U are brilliant... Katey amazing the whole cast did a great job and we Are all going to hate to see this great show end. I wonder how many knock offs will appear
6.0~I really don't know what to think about Sons of Anarchy. I have mixed feelings about it and impressions of it. This show has always had the potential to be a great series and so many times it made me think of it as a great TV show, thanks to the story line, the characters, the excitement, the twists ..etc. But so many other times I felt stupid watching this show and would find myself saying in my head (and some times out loud)"Oh, come on! What's this?" or "Be realistic, for god's sake!"I find myself wondering, why all this complication? Keep it simple! A problem is never solved until another bigger one says hello to the club... What brings me back on track are the twists and surprises that seem like bonuses from the writers, (in the season finales, mainly) to reward me for being patient and for fighting those moments of disappointment. This show is definitely made for consumption and entertainment without too much thinking behind it, and like so many other TV shows, it is a victim of Breaking Bad, The Wire, and Game of thrones..all those masterpieces that are almost flawless. I say "victim" because anyone who watched those masterpieces I mentioned is going to find it hard not to criticize Sons of Anarchy
10.0~I enjoyed every moment watching Sons of Anarchy. It sends a message. I really recommend it . What I personally did not like was the end , by that I mean how it happened.
10.0~Love sons of anarchy with a passion! It's a must watch! Sad it's finished
10.0~This series is one of the most brilliant of all time. It has a different angle that one does not find in other series. The story and the way it has developed through these first 5 seasons is incredibly intriguing and it is clear that Kurt Sutter has put some real thought into this. The acting is terrific. Everybody does a fantastic job and they work extremely good together. I will stop here due to the fact that I have nothing bad to say about this show. If you're reading this - WATCH THIS SHOW! I promise that you will not regret it. Those who rated this less than 7 has absolutely no understanding of what a series should be like. Or perhaps it is the same ones that rated the shows, which spoon-feeds people without making the viewers think for themselves.
10.0~Sons of Anarchy is an absolutely amazing series. Everyone who had negative things to say about this, definitely had not seen past season 1, because I must admit Charlie Hunam clearly had not mastered the true American accent and the story line wasn't the best at times. But even so season one being only a decent first series, the rest of this show surely got me hooked... It's appropriately violent, dark in places, funny with a few light hearted moments and overall brilliantly diverse. Another thing that really surprised me about this was, it wasn't just about white trash bikers (as someone may assume) it's a quality drama with complex female characters. In my opinion there was no-one better suited for Gemma and Tara then Katey Sagal and Maggie Siff who pottery they're roles beautifully as well as the rest of the cast. Overall this is a great series. I have been hooked on and seen a lot of other great series like breaking bad and the walking dead; but they're just not as good as SOA. 10/10
10.0~this is the best TV show i have ever seen all the characters are very brilliantly written and beautifully performed with the story and twists and action and love politics........there is not another better than this i have ever seen and i have seen lots it satisfies all your needs in an entertainment.... the only cons is you cant skip any episode better than vampire diaries, breaking bad, etc its not about a single person ,it's a story of club and all the peoples related to them. this show teaches you about brotherhood, trust, importance of family. it's just simply excellent and brilliant. and definitely recommend it for season lovers.
9.0~I was a huge skeptic over Sons of Anarchy. I actually wasted; Yes Wasted! two full seasons ignoring this gem of a show. I am caught up now. The reason for my title? This is truly the best show that services the best of what men and women both want in a show. It truly has it all! Sexy, dangerous, brutal, edgy. romantic, dramatic, and very well written. The actors are as diverse as the show itself. Each with a flare and personality rich with character. It is truly impossible not to find something great about each and every one. Be it hate, love, like or lust this cast. Each and every emotion has been brought on by superb acting, writing, wrapped up with the general environment created. I only have one minor complaint over season 3. It should be called "Chasing Able" As it seems the entire season is about finding Jackson's child. I feel it has gone on a bit to long. Regardless of that though? I still get giddy on Tuesday nights to watch this edgy and creative show. Regards Michele
5.0~This show started very good for me, I enjoyed it! the story was amazing it was with no doubt a thriller. Each character did the best for his part and I was waiting for any moment I would be free to watch it. It was fun to watch a show that talks about motorcycle clubs with the rivalry of other clubs and they showed it in a way that would make you watch the next episode as soon as the previous one ends. However, they should've stopped at 5 season or even 6 at max. The last season for me was a waste of my time, but somehow I survived it until the last two episodes. The story line was stretched to the limit of making me hate it, all that's exciting had gone. For me, the show stopped in the episode before the last one. I still didn't finish the Finale and for two years I was trying but I think everything I wanted to watch happened before that. It really ruined the show for me, good times had been forgotten.
5.0~This is a highly over-rated, over-acted show. It is very similar to a daytime soap opera in how plots move painfully slow, have too many angles and never seem to be resolved. The lead actors all have one expression for everything that occurs in their life....it has become sort of a running joke...the same stares and cadences and screen shots over and over and over and over.... The plots are repetitive and boring; predictable. I have viewed the first six seasons, in hopes it would get better...it does not. The characters never develop nor change in anyway. The idiotic plots continue. The characters turn against anyone for any reason. They forgive the most insane and unreasonable acts of their "family" and enemies, yet begrudge and retaliate for insignificant slights. They are horrible criminals, too boot, which makes it difficult to care about the outcome. It is hard to root or care about such idiots. The writing is sophomoric, juvenile. It is as if the writers wrote it in high school right after learning about basic story writing mechanisms. The saving grace of the show is the Katy Sagal. She deserves better than SoA but glad she is working at least. Done with the show. None of the episodes are worth a second viewing and I definitely will not waste any more time watching the remaining seasons. Too bored to care what happens to any of them...
10.0~I started Sons of Anarchy not really knowing what to expect, except for what my dad -- who's in a Christian MC -- and several friends told me. They thought I would love the show, but I was skeptical. I watched the first episode, but fell asleep -- so I gave it a shot again a few days later. This time, I was hooked. I watched the first season in a week, then breezed through the second in just a few days during a snowstorm. Everyone who told me I'd love the show was right. This show had me. I couldn't get enough of it. I got to Season 7 -- the final one -- and decided to take my time with it, to really try and savor every minute of the show. I finished it just a few nights ago, and the finale blew me away. The scene with Jax, Abel, Thomas and Wendy were incredibly powerful, and the imagery throughout the episode -- the bread and wine and the angel of death Jax encounters at the courthouse -- made it even better. What an ending, too, with Jax's final ride. I highly recommend this show to anyone and everyone.
10.0~This is one of the best written, with the best suited actors, best storyline along with the best suited music show that I have watched. I only wish that Jax was not killed off so he could be in future shows. I wish that it could just go on and on. Kurt Sutter is a genius and deserves all the awards possible for such a unique drama. I have just re watched it in 2018 so for a series to hold its own and have people still wanting to watch it 10 years after originally written, that is saying something. I am chomping at the bit awaiting The Mayans, bring it on. For the few morons on here that didn't like it, they should stick to David Attenborough and stick their reviews where the sun don't shine. Everything about this show was excellent, the actors were so suited to the characters, the music was fantastic, bought the soundtrack, and the storyline was realistic. I am sure that all the stars got a lot of notoriety from such an epic series, which they deserve. Love, Love, Loved this show.
1.0~Sons of Anarchy was really great at the beginning, some of the scenes were corny and cliché, but all-around it was a great action series with a bit of character drama. Why did I rate this show a 1? Simple, season 5 ruined the show! Spoiler alert! They turned Tara into an ultra-strong manipulative b***h that is constantly going from helping the club to ruining it and turned Jax into a p***y whipped b***h that believes everything Tara says. To make things even worse in season 6 they added political correctness to the now disastrous show by adding transvestites, turning one of the bikers gay, annihilating a start up white supremacist gang for a minor infraction while doing hardly anything to other groups who killed some of their members and giving them all even cornier sappy feelings about what they do. I have not yet finished season 6, a few episodes to go, but i'm hoping someone has the brains to try salvaging this series by brutally killing off Tara and even the whipped Jax.
5.0~I can imagine if I were a dirty rotten 13 years old and were living with my abusive drugged out parents in a trailer park, I would certainly LOVE THIS SHOW! But then again, how would I be able to watch this? Oh yeah, an illegal satellite connection! But here I am, 43 years old. So who is this show for? Certainly not for me! I've watched almost 3 seasons so far and the 3rd season is by far the MOST RIDICULOUS one yet! (but I read in season 6 someone becomes a tranny!!! omg!) Is this show meant to be a comedy? Are the guys one day gonna start dancing and singing their dialogue? OK, I digress... The episode where Tara and her co-worker (boss) are kept by a couple which demand $250,000, gets stolen by 2 kids on bikes (pedals), and the ATF agents and SOA members can't catch them?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? COME ON!!!! The VP's (Jacks) infant child is in Belfast, they get a dozen chances to catch "the bad guy" yet he ALWAYS gets away!?!?!? COME ON!!!! This is by far the most CARTOONISH TV SHOW I have ever watched. I am not gonna repeat all the other PATHETIC things that other reviewers have noticed about this show, cause I would be writing all day. I would much rather watch The Sopranos. At least, I cared for ALL OF THEIR Characters. Not to mention THE EMOTIONLESS MONOTONE SPEAKING VOICE of "JACKS" btw...Who the heck is Sam Crow?!?! Or is it SAMCRO!?!?!? These guys are hardened killer bikers! Yeah right! lmao.
8.0~This is a great show & we are excited to now offer an official shirt on our all women's motorcycle site, Asphalt Sisters. The characters are compelling and well-developed and the story line keep me coming back for more. I am disappointed I read that the 7th season will be the last. I suppose it's better to wrap it up while the show is still interesting, though. Particularly, the growth of Jax is interesting, as his world view is shifted. With the gun-running and bike gang theme, the shows can be rough at times. It does not seem gratuitous, though. The violence/cursing, etc. fits into the story in an authentic way. The characters are many times those that you develop a love-hate relationship with. While they are good at times, they can be awful and you find yourself rooting for them anyway.
7.0~This show has has fluctuated between predictable and good but, the end of season 6 was all predictable. I'm assuming the plot twists were meant to be unforeseen but, they were not. Weather this series ends next season or not, it will be the last season I watch. Shows like Breaking Bad and Dexter ended with self respect just as they were loosing appeal. That's how all shows should end. I hope this doesn't become a show like Nikita, that keep going due to a small fan base, who love the show out of loyalty and can't accept the show has run it's course. SOA will either take that course or become a full on soap opera if it continues. I hope season will be the last so the show ends strong.
6.0~You know it's a bad sign when a show keeps the same intro through the first four seasons and through its peak seasons. Sons of Anarchy developed the story and characters very well and never broke them away from their typical nature. I applaud the writers on maintaining that aspect. The show focuses on the life of Jax Teller and his business and personal relationships. I noticed the show becomes very predictable after a while. They go based on the what goes around comes around karma. Each season focuses on bad deals, betrayals, suspected deals with the police, attempted hits, kidnappings, accidental killings, prospects getting killed constantly, etc. After a point if you don't see a murder then it didn't happen, because the show avoids cliffhangers. For the most part I think the show fell apart with the murder of Tara Knowles and hanging on way too long to Gemma Teller. Gemma and Unser should have been killed a long time ago around season 3 or 4. I just about nearly quit watching the show, because I got fed up with how despicable and untouchable Gemma was and the complete lack of knowledge the writers had about the Justice system and police investigations. Klay Morrow really made the show worth watching along with Tara, Opie, and Piney. When you kill off characters you put your story at risk of falling apart and this is exactly what happened. Likewise a story can also fall apart by holding onto a bad character way too long.
10.0~Well, it's quite difficult to say without spoiling anything WHY you have to see it. It has everything - love, hate, violence and everything in between. When you start, it is almost impossible to finish it before the early hours of morning. You breathe every moment in and don't want to let none of it go. I assure you - it was one hell of a ride. I cried, laughed, amazed and..longed for another episode for a whole year. I hope you will have the same experience. Jax and every other cast member will have a stationary place in your heart after that. You will think with them, you will argue with them, but in the end..you ill never see what's coming next.
8.0~Sons is a show that should be up in the ranks with The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, that being said given I hail this show as a true classic I can focus on the aspects of it that are disappointing as well, like all great shows, nothing is ever perfect. Season 1 of SOA was a good show, it established what the series will bring forth, season 2 was downright PERFECT! An excellent season with multiple story lines that could have produced more stories to comebut did not. Season 3 was downright dragging and poorly written filled with characters you will never see again in a plot in Ireland that wasted the entire season. However, towards the end the season somewhat redeems itself. By season 4 the show goes back to being great, establishing the main rivalries, cementing its main villain and giving the characters the drive to move to its ultimate finale. Season 5 shows a violent leader in charge heading the SAMCRO gang, it has a slower pace than the rest of the previous seasons, but still good. The focus is on the main relationships and its effects of betrayal. Somehow, this season makes it hard to understand why the show is not getting closer to its end, it felt a bit dragged and somewhat unnecessary. However, it's the quintessential season that establishes the main character as the true VILLAIN! And the addition of new characters was excellently casted. Season 6 is definitely more brutal. It felt dragged and long with episodes over extended, but it it's the season that stages the beginning of the end. Season 6 seems like it could have been mixed with season 5... to create a more superior whole and complete season. One interesting element of the season is that WOMEN are the true power players of the season, GEMA VS TARA VS WENDY. The main thorn in SAMCROS thumb is a female DA, and yes there's also a trans character. Margaret should have been given a stronger role, but it was still good. Season 7 Probably my least favorite season after season 3. It was dragged and extended and had too many new characters, that we are not really invested in. Too much violence on these un-invested characters that make the action scenes lacking in payoff. By now you want Jax to die, and there's no one left to root for, with the exception of maybe Gema/Juice. The final episodes were powerful, tying up the main characters journeys (the ones who made it to the end) in dramatic and emotional fashion. There is something very deep and memorable about how thing tie up in the end for everyone. Its closing shot is poetic, metaphoric and downright beautiful. It ends as all strong shows with a strong lead do (Sopranos, Breaking Bad) with a tragic ending worthy of discussion. Ultimately what the story is, is about a man being controlled by the two main women in his life, by his need to bring the club back to the "good old days" as it being led down a destructive path of violence, law enforcement corruption, drugs, prostitution, revenge and lies. Its about a mans identity and his self fulfilling prophecy to play out his fathers vision as stated in the manifesto that drives the story. Its about loyalty, power, control and fate. If you were paying attention, you won't be surprised for it was expected.
10.0~I just started watching "Sons of Anarchy" and already it's become one of my favorite shows. The writing is excellent, and way too complex to really be able to properly sum up here. I have to say, I've been really impressed with how TV shows have become much better forms of entertainment than the movies being put out from Hollywood. Thanks to shows like "Sons of Anarchy", I haven't completely lost faith in Hollywood just yet. Hopefully the show will continue to be as good as it has been. It's really addicting once you start watching it. You watch one episode and you find yourself wanting to immediately watch the next one. That's partly due to the way they always seem to end episodes with a crazy cliffhanger. I would definitely recommend watching this show, but keep in mind it does contain pretty adult material, so if you're kind of uptight, you might not like it, but I don't think that should be any reason to keep you from watching it. Give it a shot! I really think you'll enjoy it.
1.0~I started watching a year ago. I really gave this show a chance, after really annoying, bad written episodes in season 1, but season 2 made it even worse. This is by far on of the worst shows in the last 5 years and I still don't get it how anyone can rate it above a 5 or 6. There are so many logical mistakes, bad acting, "a-team like" shootings from professional killers and bad casting choices. When you reach season 3 and get to Ireland, you won't stop laughing. Sure, some shots made in Ireland are not that cheap but Ireland looks like California - with a blue coloring and every house needs a shamrock painted on a wall. stop wasting lifetime with sons of anarchy.
10.0~In my decades of TV and movie watching I've come to use a particular phrase far too often: "Well it's not Shakespeare but at least it was entertaining." It's kind of my go-to summary of routine stuff that is fun to watch but isn't really ground breaking. Of course there's better and worse but that one phrase is (for me) adequate enough to describe the bulk of OK shows that come and go. I'm happy to say I can't use that phrase here. Instead I get to say: Sons of Anarchy is Shakespeare. This is a show I started watching with no expectations. What I ended up with was a thrill ride of drama, action and dark comedy. Whether you like the idea of a story about bikers or not, set aside any hesitation and at least give it a chance. This does not glorify the outlaw lifestyle or encourage people to break the law. It just lays out an epic tale of family, friendship, betrayal and brotherhood in all of its glorious and more frequently tragic circumstance. There is a connection here to the core of human relationships that is rarely portrayed in any format of entertainment; and while you may not always agree with the choices someone makes, you can't help but feel their pain while considering what it would be like in their shoes to be forced into making those choices. Shakespeare has far and long been considered a master of storytelling. All I can say is the writers have learned from him and infused that same level of craftsmanship into a masterwork of drama that pulls at the very heart of man. Beyond the story, every aspect of this show is also well done. The acting quality from some of the leads is among the best ever put on film. Even the secondary talent brings a level of realism and believability that suits what is needed for their character. The casting was simply spot on and leaves no room for improvement. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all also suitable for what needs to be portrayed. This isn't a big budget sci-fi with a bunch of expensive special effects, its the nit and grit of the real world we all live in and it's shown in all of its dirt and glory. In 40+ years of watching TV and movies; I'm honestly at a loss to name a single thing I've ever watched that was better written or acted than Sons of Anarchy. There are a few things that come close, and to be honest there are things I'd rather watch more often on repeats simply because they are more fun or more in line with my daily tastes. But, as a total experience Sons of Anarchy is a must watch, at least once in your lifetime. It's just that good.
9.0~It's said that most series have their peak somewhere inn season 4, and that quality tends to drop inn both storyline and cinematic sequences. This is something that SOA with it's both " realistic" and serious manners manage to avoid. The way history is written, and things turns, the show only get better and better by episode. Carracters gets to evolve with itself within the show, while manuscript manage to make this one of the best series on international TV ever. It's fear to mention that every season have half of episodes usually used to be filmed, but this is maybe also what makes it a great show. Quality before quantity! Anyone doubting this. See it for yourself!
9.0~Well let me start by saying that in this case "bad guys losing" is totally depressing! I surprised myself by falling in love with the anti-hero. First, Kurt Sutter, to create a show about outlaws took real guts. The research, the casting , the story lines, the gritty sadistic genius vision, I was hooked the very moment I started. The story lines were so raw and compelling; it covered every wrong doing from buying and selling of guns, drugs, human trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, racism and gender bias. I loved that midst the chaos, the adrenaline shot sequences you'd find poetic undertones, moments of vulnerability, loss & comedic relief. Besides that I love,love, love the musical score! I listen to the tracks on loop. The tracks they add to the show's appeal & fit its descriptive. Actually,I almost didn't give this show a chance. I'd read all about it, seen the promos but never really thought myself to be the kind of person who'd end up watching a show about bad ass bikers! Which brings me to Hunnam; thanks to Charlie I gave this show a go. I've been an admirer of his work for the longest time (Nickleby, Crimson Peak, Green Street Hooligans, Undeclared, Pacific Rim) and felt silly to have not watched the show that propelled him into the limelight & gave him the bad boy persona...The moment I sat to watch the show, it took me approximately 15 days to binge watch all 7 seasons of the show. His rendition of the anti - hero had me in knots. Though obviously I got hints of some accent slips here and there, he was a convincingly imperfect, sadistic, sociopath with compassionate & lovable undertones. In some ways the "handsome devil"! I felt at times that he was the character he played. And I get that happens after spending almost a decade on the same show, the reel & real character tend to intertwine. And I absolutely loved that! After Jax's character I think Kim Coates' portrayal of 'Tig' with complex layers of emotions character was amazing to watch. As much as he was hated in season 1 for killing Opie's wife Donna you can't help but weep for this reluctant father as he was forced to watch his daughter being burnt alive right before his eyes. His helpless demeanor to his love hate relationship with Jax followed by his fierce loyalty to him in seasons that follow and then to his much controversial yet supremely endearing relationship with a transvestite "Venus" (another amazingly well added character played by Walton Goggins)in all adds up to brilliant character actor that is Kim Coates. Ryan Hurst as "Opie"; this massive yet adorable guy just took my heart away. After 'Remember the Titans' this was the first time I watched him on screen again. I love how this tall strong frame can convey just deep emotions & show so much vulnerability. He was conflicted for the longest time in his entire show appearance. Loss after loss we felt his sorrow, his fight with himself. His undying loyalty to Jax was so admirable even in his last moments, and the manner in which he was ended on the show was maybe by far the saddest I've seen on television. Besides these, shout out to Ron Perlman,Katey Sagal, Tommy Flanagan, Mark Boone Junior & David Labrava. I think the whole ensemble were perfectly cast and brilliantly succeeded adding their own flavor to the characters. This wasn't only a show about "Bad ass bikers" but a show that gave the stereotype a different face. It feels so ironic to say that I absolutely loved the show by hating every character at some point. You'd wish redemption for them yet you realize that they are beyond redemption. The series ended on a poetic note! The anti - hero who found redemption & gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of brotherhood yet not quite as you would imagine it! I love a show that steers up all the emotions in me and this show did nothing less. I felt all anger, anguish, anxiety,love, hopelessness & of course the strength & meaning of brotherhood. Raw, Smart, Unpredictable!!!
7.0~I've followed this show for all its seasons and I have to admit, it's impressive. What initially appeared as a style and stereotype exercise has really turned into a good, dark show. What I appreciate is that there is really no shining angel in the show, all the characters are dark and have, over the seasons, gone down dark roads and every one of them is hard to really like. That is something different and worthwhile to me. All that said, this last season has proved the toughest to watch for one reason, Abel. He is now portrayed by what is absolutely the worst childhood actor in the history of television, and that's saying something considering i grew up in the 80's. Awful.
10.0~One of the best i'ever saw! Great story great actors great action.
1.0~I am SO disappointed over the final chase scene that it left a sour taste in my mouth over the whole series. It's not hard to tell they gave a bunch of high school dropouts $157.00 and told them to go wild. All this so they could get an early start on a drunken after party. It's so bad it's hard to know where to begin. How about this? Since when is Interstate 580 a two lane back country road with a double yellow line? And can somebody explain to me how "Interstate 580" goes from two lanes to four and back to two in what seems to be a totally random, although somewhat alternating, pattern? Why was the chase scene filmed at about 20 MPH? Who were they chasing? OJ? If it was supposed to be slow motion why did they go to the trouble of speeding up the flashing lights? What happened to Jax? Did the semi stop in time? With all the blood and gore and violence for SEVEN years why wimp out on the final shot? I expected the grand finale to be a GRAND FINALE! Not some green screen cop out to save a few bucks. I wanted an aerial shot of the bug hitting the windshield! There was a lot more stupid stuff in that final minute or so but this is what sticks in my mind and I'm too damn disgusted to watch it again.
10.0~After seeing the commercials on TV my first though was 'just another biker series' as there are so may already. Sons was running for some time when at some evening while trying to find something decent to look I took the time to was an episode, Immediately I was hooked... Me and my wife started over again at episode one, although it starts slow, but you get the urge to keep watching. Now, after 4 seasons we know that the first few episodes are needed to create the plot for the rest of the season, but still you are not bored at all. It became clear to us that this isn't at all just another biker series! Sons of anarchy is great combination between drama, thriller, action and die hard mobster. We watched all episodes and can't wait for the new season to come. This is one of the best series we watched in years.
3.0~If I had to consolidate into one word all of the unpleasant emotions I've undergone in my painfully slow journey through five seasons of this cartoonish series, the term "frustration" would fit the bill perfectly. If you plan on diving into this show expecting the universe in which this story takes place to even remotely resemble our own, you too will feel this frustration. I am actually thoroughly appalled to see such high praise for this show, and it troubles me to think that this might somehow be The Best Thing On Television Right Now. The show centers on the follies of a gun running motorcycle gang in a fictional California town, ostensibly ran by a young blonde man named Jax who appears as though he was ripped, pixel for pixel, right out of an Abercrombie and Finch magazine ad. His mother, stepfather, and girlfriend get much focus as well, and a handful of other gang members get minor attention in an attempt to give the ensemble a little substance. However, each and every one of these characters are completely unlikable. They're nasty, manipulative, murderous, sexist criminals. This group of alcoholic racists (the non-allowance of blacks in the group actually becomes a plot-line) runs guns (and later, drugs) and seems to pull in huge profits in the process, and yet still live relatively meager lives in modest homes. There is never an explanation as to where these funds go, and there is only a half-attempt to explain why the gang even carries out this type of shady business in the first place. Now, stories centering on anti-heroes CAN be enjoyable. Nabokov's Lolita, American Psycho, Dexter come to mind. However, this show feels as though it actually endorses the actions of our biker friends, and I felt as though I, as the viewer, was expected to give myself a high-five every time the Sons of Anarchy (the name of the gang) killed an innocent bystander or screwed someone over. The main pull for this show is simply watching to see if these thugs ever actually get what's coming to them. (Spoiler Alert: they don't. Not in the first five seasons, anyway). This brings me to my main peeve: the characters outside the inner circle. Rest assured, any character in this show that is not a member or affiliate of the Sons of Anarchy is going to be a cartoonish, one- dimensional, unintelligent tool that always seems to be just one step behind our lovely Sons. Authority figure, public official, rival gang member, it doesn't matter. For example (spoiler here), one character sets a scenario in motion in which Jax's best friend is beaten to death right in front of him. Then, this same character instructs Jax to turn over ANOTHER member of his gang to be murdered, and then leaves himself completely open for a strike from Jax as he carries out the task of killing the second member. This character is supposed to be a super- intelligent, insanely powerful person in the story, and watching him and other characters do insanely stupid things that allow Jax and crew to constantly get the scoop on them is absolutely cringe-worthy. Furthermore, none of the gang members, save for one named Opie, ever have to experience the consequences of their lifestyle. As I mentioned before, I don't mind rooting for the bad guys from time to time, but this show makes it impossible. The characters are invincible, and therefore completely unrelatable. The story lines are easily predictable (hint: Sons always win. Always). The acting is pretty good, particularly from Katey Sagal, but it's hard to revive the believability of such poorly written characters. Watch Mad Men or Breaking Bad if you actually want a story in which the characters are human beings. Watch this if you like motorcycles and brawls and gunfights, because that's about as deep as this show is willing to go.
8.0~I was recommended to watch this back in 2008 or 2009 by a friend, but always shrugged it off, as I am not overly keen on TV series and gang-related stuff in general. So it is not actually before now late in 2012 that I have actually gotten acquainted with the "Sons of Anarchy" series. And boy have I been missing out on something great. The characters in the series are well-developed, with lots of background story and motives to drive them on, and that is really one of the things that I really enjoyed about the series. All the characters are nicely portrayed on the screen and each given great chances to give us (the viewers) a glimpse into whom they are, what makes them tick, and follow them as they grow during the course of the running episodes. And for the cast, they had really, and I do mean really, gotten together some very great actors and actresses for the roles. Lots of familiar faces whom you know will deliver the goods, and all bring their own unique touch to each character. My personal favorite character in the show was Harry 'Opie' Winston (played by Ryan Hurst), as I found his character to have the most interesting background and the most dramatic of events happen to him. The fact that "Sons of Anarchy" revolves a motorcycle gang is not bad, it really made for a great breeding ground for plot lines and interesting approached the to the story. So, don't do what I did, shrug it off just because of this fact. If you enjoy series where you get to know the characters well, and if you are entertained by a deep running, solid storyline, then "Sons of Anarchy" is a definite must watch. And the way that the episodes are directed really leaves you wanting for more. There are some great cliffhangers and really good continuations of the storyline from episode to episode, and a superb red line throughout the entire series. This is great entertainment and lots of fun.
8.0~The series has a special place in my heart. It shows how violent behavior occurs in a certain group with their intention to make peace and keep the order. Overall i don't have much to complain but for the ending. The main hero resigns on his own task to make peace, goes on a killing spree and wishes with that, that his son may have a better, peaceful future. Now that's a bummer. He knows that all of his emotions and mistakes carry over to the next generation. But at that time he was too deep into the dark path, and his mind was too clouded to see any other options. That's no end for a hero but for a madman. Regardles, a very thought out, well written example of how violence occurs. I'd recommend it for almost any one with a strong mind & heart.
10.0~Beautifully written and impeccably executed drama series. The story is unique, it develops slowly and nurtures every character individually. The show's biggest victory is in its ability to lure the viewers into the characters so deeply that as you go along you feel the happiness the characters feel, their pain becomes your pain and their triumphs give you joy. Being a big fan of smart television shows, I hardly thought that a drama focused on a motorcycle club could throw up such intelligent situations that would rival or even better what other stellar TV series have done. Sons of Anarchy thoroughly educated and satisfied on so many levels that it feels unjust to write about it further, lest it spoils the journey for you. So watch the show, the ride with SOA will blow your senses.
1.0~Inconsistent, full of cliché, cock-and-bull, ... A movie for low IQ people. Really don t know if those five stars raters are mentally sane ! A "skinny" scenario full of inaccuracies about a motorcycle gang struggles to emerge law. The main actor seems rather an idiot led by a decrepit mother who killed his father and then his wife. If all the bad guys would resemble Jax Teller then America is the country where the police profession must be very boring. The most spectacular character is a priapic, Tig Trager, others are a colorful bunch of idiots easily fooled and blinded by instinct rather than ruled by reason. I wonder if the real villains from America were thought to protest against this series which seriously affect their image.
10.0~Sons of Anarchy is one of the greatest shows of all time. I just finished it today--a little late, I know. It took me about forty days to get through the first episode to the last episode. I had to be very conservative, vowing to watch no more than two episodes a night, which didn't work out very well. Sons of Anarchy did an incredible job of keeping things interesting from the beginning to the end. I suspected the show would lose its sparkle as it progressed, but it only seemed to get brighter. Pay full attention when you watch. You won't want to miss a second. Watch with care. Enjoy every minute of it. I wish I could watch it again without knowing what happened. It's one of those.
10.0~There is nothing about this show that isn't fantastic. While, at times, it can be a little too realistic (with levels of violence rarely seen on TV), the characters and plots are wonderfully written. You find yourself rooting for characters that you would normally want to hurl abuse at. These are not good guys, but they love their family and do whatever they can to keep them safe. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal are amazing, as are the rest of the cast. You can tell that Kurt Stutter loves this show as much as the fans do. Although Season One is now over, I can't wait for the newly announced Season Two.
1.0~I loved this show, and have given it five stars up to now. However when Kurt Sutter sank to a level of such sadistic inhuman depravity as to graphically rape himself on screen, well, that went a little too far. This scene was so overwhelmingly disgusting and viciously brutal it will forever be burned into my memory banks. Remember you can't "unsee" something. You see, it was then that I realized what this show is really about: Kurt Sutter's graphically sick, self-indulgent, self-absorbed, twisted vision of human life. Really, that is his true intention, and overall the only value this show has to offer. Is it interesting and engaging at times? Yes. Is it full of awesome acting and, I'll admit, plenty of good writing? Yes. But that doesn't excuse the rotten core of this vile excuse for creativity. Breaking Bad had similar scenes, though not quite as disturbing. Kurt Sutter wishes he could be Vince Gilligan and fails miserably, in the most awful and egregious way. While Breaking Bad was cosmic in its character study (for which the violence was in the service of), Sutter's Suns is the exact opposite: he uses his characters as a backdrop for the vehicle of his own sick, personal projections. At least Quentin Tarantino had artistic vision. What an utter waste of celluloid.
3.0~I binge-watched the first couple of seasons. What really made me love it was actually how un-apologetically awful the characters could be. It was so refreshing to not have that "they might be bikers but they're really good persons inside, I swear" take on them for once. No attempt to make us forgive or diminish the horrible things they do and no turning them into victims. Of course, they have their own set of principles, values and code of honour - you can feel drawn to their quests because you can follow the logic even if it's not one you want to endorse. I loved the characters for that even if there is no denying that they would be horrible real-life persons. the third season is when I started going from disappointment to disappointment. 1. The main plot line of the season is really drawn out unnecessarily in a bit too much angst and when it FINALLY comes to it's resolution, we fall right back in a plot line that is so similar it made me literally roll my eyes. 2. Jax (the main character) started to get on my nerves. Instead of having significant character development, the writers have him constantly wallowing in man pain but recurrently doing mistakes - like killing the wrong person or trusting the wrong person (sometimes resulting in horrible consequences for someone who didn't deserve it) but never modifying his behaviour accordingly. 3. The portrayal of women. I know many of you will dismiss that point but not only is it gross, but it speaks of poor writing. No but I know the world of gangs is sexist and redneck, but you can portray sexism without being sexist. You are deemed to hate all of the women on this show. There is only two feminine archetype in it, really. The first: Gemma. The mom is a Machiavellian Lady Macbeth type: Controlling, manipulative in the worse ways and castrating. Plot- wise, she is actually more of an antagonist than an ally and she would even be a good one if they didn't burden her with being the only feminine character with any sort of power. The second type is embodied by absolutely all the other women we have met up until the end of season 3. They are bland, vapid and to varying degrees, "whores" (as an archetype). The women are not characters but plot devices and tools for "furthering the man pain". I mean Tara: lets talk about a poorly written character. I admit that a 3 is still too harsh, but I really feel the need the compensate how over-rated this show is.
2.0~Two stars for some of the actors, who are gamely doing a good job with very thin material, and the musical scoring, which is outstanding (CDs of the show are highly recommended). Otherwise, this is a fantasy of an office worker, who thinks being a biker means being able to commit crimes with impunity and living a porn-fantasy life of sleeping with every hot woman, including strippers and porn actresses, and zero consequences. Needless to say, real criminals who act this way end up in jail, and quickly. It is the conceit of this series that the "Sons of Anarchy" motorcycle club, in a tiny rural California town in the Inland Empire, can openly be a criminal gang and not be shut down ASAP by the FBI. (Yes, an FBI agent appears briefly in Season 1, but gets the crap beaten out of her and is eventually murdered, with no repercussions.) The local police are in collusion. I was in Daytona Beach last month, and all the biker stores featured logo items from this show, so it clearly has a following. However, I see it as just cartoonish nonsense. For a show about BIKERS, there is astonishingly little actual motorcycle riding. The "club" exists to run guns, not Harleys. They appear to have no money, yet run elaborate military-style black ops crime sprees (or revenge sprees) and never get caught. At the end of Season 3, they actually go to Ireland, on the silliest plot thread imaginable -- Protganist Jax Teller (played by beach-boy pretty Charlie Hunnam, with a very unconvincing American accent he can't hang onto) has had his baby son (Abel, like "Cain & Abel", duh) kidnapped -- to IRELAND -- and they all go there, apparently WITH their motorcycles (but no PASSPORTS), to get the baby back....words can't describe how silly and unconvincing this is. For starters, outside of a placement shot of some Irish countryside, this is clearly not shot on location and is obviously still in California. The difficulty of someone getting on a plane with a baby they have no papers or passport for, and then getting into a foreign country, are never explained. (Hint: it would be incredibly difficult, and of course they are making themselves incredibly conspicuous; not too bright for a criminal gang!). Also we are to believe there is a "branch" of the Sons of Anarchy in IRELAND. (Is there a branch in the Gaza Strip, too? Fallujah? Kabal? Bosnia?) All through the series, the acronym SAMCRO is used for Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original. I had to look this up. It is NEVER explained; like many here, I thought it was a PERSON (Sam Crowe). This is how it is pronounced, which makes no sense. Katey Sagal is basically reprising her Married with Children role of "Peg Bundy", only with streaked hair and brooding attitude. I keep waiting for her to break into comedy. Early on in the first episodes, her character Gemma is dealing with menopause and I thought there might be some serious introspection going on, but no. Ron Perlman looks great, but is too gentle and nice to be leading a vicious gang of thugs. Charlie Hunnam is too pretty and British to be convincing, and like I said, his accent isn't nailed down. Also: would a vicious motorcycle thug actually run around in white sneakers and clean white t-shirts all the time? REALLY? Maggie Siff is particularly poor as a DOCTOR, a physician (!!!) who is in love with Jax, and helps him in his crimes, including escape from police and outright murder & assault. Apparently she cares very little for the medical license she worked 10 years or more to get! I can't even say enough how ridiculous this idea is -- maybe it could have worked if she was a NURSE or dental hygienist, but I simply can't buy the idea of a doctor getting jiggy with a criminal thug motorcycle gang member. Not to mention why she'd be willing to relocate to a tiny poor rural hospital and stymie her career in that way either. Siff is a weak actress as well, looking slackjawed and dull-witted as she does unbelievable stuff like make love with Hunnam's character NEXT TO A CORPSE. I'm only at the end of Season 3 and it's only gotten more ridiculous episode by episode. I've seen more convincing science fiction with flying saucers and jellyfish aliens. Two thumbs down.
10.0~It's more some thoughts about the show than a review, but since they got rid of Threads i 'll leave it here. I was watching SOA for the last 1.5 month for the first time. I completed it yesterday and today rewatched the ending just for some more pain and read various theories to cover my questions. Just wanna say that the Show is awesome. I can appreciate a drama but i am more a comedy or -Happy Ending and they live happily ever after- guy. But even that this series is so brutal and cruel i enjoyed it and got attached to the strong characters. It's also all about Loyalty. Ending was really tough even though i think everybody expected it. I expected since the start of the Season Juice, Gemma and Jax ending up dead but the fact that i knew it didn't make it any easier. I was still hoping for something to be salvaged. I get all the Jesus references (after all they kept saying it through the whole series a bunch of times) and i will choose to think that Jax sacrificed like Jesus, Juice was probably Judas(his name is similar after all) but i think that's kind of unfair to Juice cause i liked him and i think he was just naive or made mistakes, not on purpose or with bad intentions. The Homeless Girl must be the only not realistic thing in the show, probably a Reaper/ Death - The mom that died from J.T. combo. BTW Jax is also a J.T. so that's another similarity with his father. The Truck that met Jax and Mylo the guy who helped Gemma was also a butterfly effect warm and tough touch. And the Crows for me except the song were combined with the SAMCROW stuff and also bonded with Gemma cause she had crows and love birds.. So she could even became one and flew above Jax in the end. I won't drag any longer just some summarized random things i want to point out: -I saw where this was going and that a lot will be dead, but i think Bobby's death and tortures were just unfair. One of the most good guys and always wanted to avoid troubles. -Also unfair is everything that happened to Opie's family.. Wife, Father, and eventually him... That was so sad for them and the kids. -Same with Jax's kids. Lost their Grandma, mom, father and Abel learned about Tara for a tough growing up. That's why i hoped that MAYBE Jax could live with his kids away from the Club, mostly for them to have a good ending. -Glad that Chibs and Nero lived cause they were also of the good guys. -As i said before, Juice's demise was also sad cause he meant well and not wanted to cause the bad things. -All the 7th season Crap that happened was Gemma's fault. So many lies and betrayals and paybacks with collateral damage... -Finally i think Jax believed in the end what Juri said about J.T. committing suicide that's why he decided to go the same way with his same bike.. And The title and the truck(oh my God when i saw the truck Logo... knowing the title...) also suggest that he behaved like his father. p.s. That was the second time Charlie Hunnam. First was at Green Street Hooligans, another awesome movie. It was one hell of an emotional and tough Ride SAMCRO. Thank you, be well.
9.0~First of all, what i'm going to write next it's only my opinion. This is a huge serial, that i loved from beginning to end. I think SOA it's a perfect case of study if you are trying to learn how to write a script. It's my favorite serial even though the cinematography isn't' he best. I didn't like the color correction through the entire serial, i think that sometimes it lowers the cinematography level. I really enjoyed the script, the way you get to know the characters is amazing, the plot twists in every season are huge. I sincerely recommend to watch this serial to every serial lover. It doesn't matter where you come from, this serial will catch you.
6.0~Well the end finally came and I was very disappointed as I am with about 90% of Final episodes to a series. Following a series for this long you expect "soft" seasons along the way and you accept them, but for the final you want some thing to reward your loyalty. The final season was so complicated with all the business dealings with the "Club" that it really confused me but that aside the final 2 were just a cop out. Sutter was trying to be so Shakespeare that he abandoned the real evil of what the MC was about. He was nasty all through the series on how people were put down but when it came to Gema and Jax he sold out to being too soft. (Jax as Jesus)? Shawn Ryan of the Shield said on the after show (Sutter was so wasted) that Sutter was a great writer but ended shows much "too soft" well you all saw it here. Best endings Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, Shield Maybe Lost but SOA was a big flat disappointment to me. Sutter is a very weird man as most artist's are. Thank you.
1.0~When compared to other shows involving crime/criminal gangs SOA is by far the worst. The show involves many murders, including murders of police and government agent. More then half the time the members of the SOA don't hide bodies or any evidence yet they rarely get arrested. When they do get arrested they always mange to get out of trouble in the most crazy, unreal ways. Not only are the members of the SOA immune from the law but also bullets/fatal injury. In almost every shoot out with any other gangs the SOA are always the winner and usually unharmed. Whether its neo-Nazis, street gangs, Mexican drug cartels, the IRA, rival biker clubs, or drug kingpins the SOA are always on top. When members are shot the always have a doctor ready to fix them up. Members rarely die. The wives and girlfriends of members are also very violent and immune to the cops and injury. Some of the police also help the club get away with many crimes. The show also gets very annoying when you have to hear "Jesus Christ" and "Christ" 30 times in every episode. Like the writers couldn't think of another word for every time something bad is shared with other members. I do not recommend this show to any one looking for a serious show about biker gangs/crime. But it is defiantly a great show to share some laughs at the ridiculous fight scenes and police escapes with a couple friends.
3.0~Who the hell hired that fat dumpy prospect that merely nods his head and offers nothing to the show. Obviously, he has a relative that is affiliated with the show or is owed something by the producers. This is an example of Hollywood nepotism that leaves the audience asking questions that will never be answered. Sometimes, comprimises are made to finish a project, we understand that. But don't make things more confusing because you're lazy. Long live SamCro. Always read the manual. 8 glasses of water a day isn't bad if it contains beer. Measure twice, cut once. I'm out.
10.0~It's not often a show comes along where you cannot find fault but this one nails it! I stumbled across it through a friend as we only get the mainstream shows in the UK (you cant even get the DVD over here!)and I never thought I'd be interested in a drama about a gun-running motorcycle club but it's so well executed that I couldn't help but get hooked! The characters are complicated, unpredictable and totally believable (the casting is spot on). You don't always agree with the decisions they make or like the things they say and do but it's so well thought out that you just get pulled into the world of SAMCRO. Season 2 has already opened with a great storyline and I'm enjoying it even more than season 1.
9.0~I am in awe of Katey Sagal. I've loved her as a comic actress for so long that this show really threw me. The first episode I ever saw was season one episode six (Skateboard scene), she was amazing, crazy, strong and vulnerable all at the same time. Quite a shock for someone who thought she was a great mother figure in 8 simple rules... I immediately started to search for past episodes online and continued to watch each episode as it came out. She and Ron were a perfect match, there's chemistry between them and in every scene they are together they steal the show. Charlie Hunnam is convincing as an American despite his British origins (I know he's been acting in America a few times but the accent's hard to lose, trust me!) and he's got a great talent, he's totally believable as a new single father. With it's subject matter this show could have been so much darker but there's humour throughout it all. Every character is well rounded and perfectly cast. I recommend this show to people all the time and now I do it here to, with it's amazing season 2 ending I have been on edge for weeks now. September's on it's way and so is season 3, I can't wait!!!
10.0~It's my favourite tv series ever ! I am a huge fan of GOT and other stuff, but no show ever had an impact on me like sons of anarchy. Great cast, dark atmosphere and outstanding soundtrack (!!). It's so authentic and you just feel with every character in the show
3.0~I finally succumbed to the hype and have been watching this series. Where do I start. The scripts are unbelievable; the acting mostly ordinary but sometimes atrocious; the Irish accents laughable and the music covers of classics by Katey Segal unbearably bad. How it rates alongside of real classics like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad mystifies me, but I guess that there is no accounting for taste (or the lack of it).
10.0~This is by far the best show I have watched in my life. Excellent actors and from the first second you are drawn into the crazy world of Charming. The road takes very drastic plot changes during the show which no one saw coming. I have never experienced a show with more excitement in it in all of the episodes. You feel one with all the characters of the show and especially Jax of course. That makes it so hard you see him getting in deeper and deeper until there is no way back. The finale was thrilling, great ending.. Kurt Sutter, you made one hell of a show there. Loved it, every bit!!
7.0~No show has ever given me the desire to stop watching, but still watching, more than SOA. It flails on that edge between not enough strong story writing to carry and too much violence for its own good. Instead of building storyline, the viewer gets thrown into violent themes which are then explained. There is constant turmoil turning from one disaster into the next and missed chances at character building. These missed chances are where the show hurts and gathers its 7 star rating. There is so much more available from Callie's and Perlman's characters who are the deeper and more complex of the show, and so much attention given to the other character's in a one-dimensional manner, with the lack of shocking violence, the show might actually bore me. A constantly brooding Jax wife and over the top meddling mother makes for an annoying predictable show at times. A constantly vengeful and sensitive Jax drives the show one dimensional. But the turns and spins keep me coming back for more. Polk's death completely threw me. Juice still alive I just knew wouldn't happen. I was certain Kim Coates character was a goner and Opie would be around to the end. Which brings me to Coates' character. The over protective dog and woman loving psychopath does give the show a needed comedic relief at times. With that said. It's a very violent and sexually graphic show.(For TV) The violence is at the point of uncomfortable in Season 5 with a very graphic de-tonguing and jail rape scene which will probably keep the show at a 7 for me.
6.0~The series was well cast and performed but the writing was a bit hit and miss. I just got tired of the same unredeeming plotlines that never gets you completely sympathizing with the lead.
8.0~One of the best series written for TV... there are few criticisms... (imagine the extreme violence, profanity, nudity, and absence of most all moral values would turn off many though). But like all great series television, it has everything (good and bad)... great writing, acting, casting, directing, production-values.. everything. And there's not just one or two top notch acting performances.. the whole entire group is near flawless... awards can go to any number of them. Now running an amazing seven years, its damn near unbelievable to maintain that high quality level for that length of time. It might end soon, but that's not so bad. We just all have to truly appreciate what we've experienced during these many wonderful years (ok.. up until S7). PS-... as the show has now gotten long-in-the-tooth, it's real problem is there's hardly now any characters truly likable remaining.. and the loss of one of the shows main leads, and the 'nicest' individual in the production was a huge blow. Through the years its gotten darker and more gory (if that's possible), and ya get the distinct feeling it's going to be getting lots worse. (Question- ..with all the killing spree mayhem now going on in this little town.. how could armed storm troopers from state and federal government not be all over the place??)
10.0~Guarantee you, Rat is a rat. Not saying he's the one selling out the club to others, but I guarantee you he's an undercover FBI, DEA, or ATF. Just look at how he acts when something starts to go down. Almost like he's thinking, "Is now when I should break my cover?" "Is this going too far?" Technically, he should have broke cover long ago, since he's not supposed to let people die, but it's a TV show after all. What do you think? Overall, I love the show. I mean, it can get a little extreme like when Jax just offed the other Prez without really clearing it with anyone. I mean, he's been doing a lot of things that people are afraid to tell him to slow his roll, and they're just going through the motions right now because they know he'll do like Clay and off anyone who doesn't agree with him, but even that was a bit much. Just my opinion, though.
7.0~If u love gritty stories relatable characters and violence and can get past the cringey and outrageously crap Scandinavian sounding Irish accents, then this is the series for you. I am currently watching season two and love it. Apparently Season 3 has even more bad Irish accents in it! but i cant wait to keep watching and get through this series to find out what happens. I would highly recommend this show to any one who enjoys regular violence and is into the biker/heavy metal lifestyle. Overall this shows great and at the moment I'm just writing filler so that i can post my review I've said all i felt necessary so if you do decide to watch this go ahead and enjoy it.
3.0~I got roped into watching the first few episodes of this clichéd pablum and won't be coming back for more. James Bond meets the Dukes of Hazard meets Duke Nukem to fulfill every adolescent white trash fantasy imaginable. The show in a nutshell: unlikeable, one-dimensional characters traipse about a small town assaulting people, bedding hot ladies and getting wrapped up in soap opera nonsense. Also, there are bitchin' motorcycles. The objectification of women in this show makes Entourage look like The Vagina Monologues. A beautiful female agrees to sleep with a creepy stalker in exchange for a few hours of passion with our hero. The girlfriends of the dudes whose asses he whups, the checkout girl at the local grocery, the schoolgirls walking down the street, his ex-wife, his doctor: if there's a remotely attractive woman in frame, one can be sure she's enamored with our mulletted protagonist, Jax. It's later explained that beautiful women are apparently willing to serve in club harems for years in exchange for a slim chance at becoming some specific thug's "old lady". Be still, my beating heart. In addition to the blatant alpha male wish fulfillment, the show is terribly unrealistic in other ways as well. Despite being a bunch of misogynistic, drunken idiots; gang members are quite capable of running a complex business; hacking into FBI computers; executing (casualty-free) precision military operations; and outwitting "the man" at every turn. Law enforcement ranges from corrupt to ineffectual but for damn sure won't do anything important in this series. Considering that the idyllic small town of Charming, California is more violent and lawless than Ciudad Juarez, one has to wonder why everyday citizens hold gangsters in such high regard. The message here seems to be that policemen making any attempt to do their jobs are just annoying buzz-kills getting in the way of everyone's fun. The audience is meant to identify with the rowdy bikers because, despite being ruthless criminals, all but the obvious bad guys have hearts of gold. And besides, Jax is secretly conflicted about the moral implications of his chosen profession. Perhaps by Season Five he'll have morphed the gang into a hippie commune -- just like daddy wanted. The acting is passable and production value is decent. If the show could ditch the corny comic relief and introduce some subtlety or complexity or realism, it might be worth watching. As it stands, Sons of Anarchy is little more than Blaxploitation for poor white people. 3 stars.
7.0~I have to disconnect a bit to truly enjoy this show because, if I don't, the unintentional comedy keeps getting in the way. My beefs: 1) "Red, no blue...arrrgggghhh!" Any geek who has ever played an adventure game (from Zork to Grand Theft Auto) knows the routine. The plot is moved by a chain of quests and little else. I need to exit the dungeon, but I need a key. The wizard has the key, but to get it, I need the unicorn. To get the unicorn, I need to get the princess. To get the princess, I need to get the rose. To get the rose, I need to get the painting. ...and so on, ad nauseam... Once you pick up on that dynamic within this show, it becomes sort of laughable. Every time they encounter and interact with any external person or entity, they are left with a quest. Seriously. They could approach the local grocer to pick up a gallon of milk and, somehow, leave with no milk until a task to set up the grocer's son with a prom date is completed. This method is not unique to this show, so it is not a deal-breaker. 2) "If it wasn't for bad luck..." Jack Bauer is the only dude I know that has more problems in a given day than Jax Teller and his pals. I understand why Bauer's day is so unfairly loaded with horrible circumstances - that's the premise of the show 24. With SoA, however, the sheer number of horrible events in a short period of time is, frankly, exhausting. It feels unnecessarily compressed. They finish up their Irish adventure, return home, immediately deal with the Kim Bauer, er (sorry!), Tara kidnapping situation and, whew, relax for 10 minutes. Enjoy it, cuz, tomorrow, you're all going to jail! Real humans saddled with such an utter concentration of tragedy would have an uncommon tendency to find out what the business end of a pistol tastes like. Just sayin'. I think the show's creators recognize this which is why they, very occasionally, show moments of levity or even (*gasp*) normality. 3) "Imperial Stormtroopers meets the A-Team" This SAMCRO gang can do *nothing* right. Nothing. Even routine criminal activities reliably end in failure. They are the Gang That Can't Shoot Straight, yet almost always emerge unscathed. Handing off some scripts/drugs to a black market doctor? By all means, do it outside, in full view of the neo-Nazi guy! All the "bad guys" going to a rally? Simultaneously have your club show up with automatic weapons *AND* arrange for the cops to be at the scene! It is confounding. There is very little reason for me to believe this numbskull SAMCRO outfit would remain in business for more than a few weeks. I don't know who would pay them for "protection" or risk getting pinched buying guns or drugs from them. 4) "Beefcake! BEEFCAAAAAAAAAAAKE!" I get it. Jax is "hot". My wife tells me so. Given we're watching the DVD release and there are no commercials, I actually appreciate the occasional Jax-shirtless-Diet-Pepsi-commercial thing - my cue to hit the kitchen. (Jax's accent - especially when he has to act alongside dudes with any accent native to the U.K. - drifts in and out, which is a riot.) We dudes are hosed, though. To paraphrase Cleavon Little's character from Blazing Saddles, "Where all the women at?" We got a fairly worn out Peg Bundy, a tramp-stamped doctor with more baggage than sense, prostitutes and porn stars, and psychotic lesbian federal agents. How about throwing us a hot chick with a head on her shoulders and, just for good measure, make her immune (if not hostile) to Jax's, um, "charms". I'll keep watching in spite of my sneaking suspicion that I have been Jerry MacGuire'd (tricked into watching a chick flick). The writing is pretty nimble - they haven't painted themselves into a corner quite yet. They have a sense of humor about themselves - I particularly enjoyed Jax telling the Porn Lady that he wasn't there to "Adriana her" (a reference to Jax's ex-wife's character on The Sopranos) and Gemma saying she'd rather go bald than red-head (Al Bundy is predictably indifferent on the subject). There are some fine moments with nice payoffs - even if you see them coming in advance to some degree. So, it's a video game in TV-show form and it will make your wife hot for scumbags. It is simply *loaded* with supporting characters from all over the entertainment spectrum (You will spend a fair amount of time wondering exactly from where you know Characters X and Y...and who knew there was a *low rent* version of Eric Roberts out there?). You know, you just haven't lived until you've seen Gerry Bertier empty a MAC-10 into the back of a chick's head. Strong side, left side, indeed. By all means, enjoy this show. I know I am. Just, please, please, spare Billy the posthumous gymnastics and refrain from the Shakespeare comparisons. It ain't that, at all. Also, spare us the indignation of decrying the "glorification" of the lifestyles portrayed. Those clownshoes at SAMCRO aren't an advertisement for much beyond making birth control very available and supporting your local law enforcement. NUTSHELL: A very good watch, but be sure to laugh *quietly* at any nimrods (guys or gals) you see sporting SoA merchandise (cuts, shirts, hats, etc...)...for they know not what they reveal about themselves.
9.0~Love love love this show... hate hate hate how he kills off too many main characters and his wife's death just killed me... I swore I wouldn't watch the last season for this very fact but couldn't help myself.. need to know where Charlie goes from here.. argh... Im also frustrated that I have to write so many lines to submit my review. I mean, if you really want peoples views, I don't think asking for so many lines is necessary.. how much can you write about the show without giving everything up to the watcher. I highly recommend this show if you want to pull your hair out, cry and feel overwhelming anger for so many people. Will miss Ron Pearlman. He was a well hated man.
10.0~This is my favorite drama series of all time. the acting in this show is extremely good, and it makes you hate some characters with a passion, and love others. This show gets you so emotionally invested, and I found myself choking up and shedding a tear on multiple episodes. watching this show makes you feel like you are a part of the SAMCRO family. The drama also keeps you on the edge of your seat, especially in the later seasons. This show is also extremely badass, all the gangsters on the show seem authentic, and the violence in the show does not hold back at all. This show has great violence, it is never overplayed or pointless. The death in this show is also planned out so well and really hits you hard when a character dies. They are also not afraid to kill off main characters, which is heart wrenching, but makes you love the show even more. If you like violent crime TV shows, this show is for you.
9.0~Cmon everyone, plug in your rating. Hard to believe this show hasn't received the minimum 5 votes. It obviously has received enough attention to garner a following. Perhaps the viewers of the series don't find it necessary to vote. However, I think it helps others all over the world get a sense as to whether the show is worth even checking out. In this case, it definitely is. At least for the guilty pleasure factor. The show could be a little better if they laid off some of the generic TV series scenes. But, ultimately it is better than 90% of what's out there. However, I have only seen the first 5 episodes, so it may be that I'm being set up for things to get a little darker. I'm enjoying catching up on the first season and look forward to the second season beginning in a few weeks. I appreciate F/X supporting a series like this, as TV needs to challenge the audience more. Shows like "The Sopranos", "Six Feet Under", "Big Love" are the gold standard, so let's keep it going.
10.0~When I first started watching sons of anarchy, after 3 episodes I almost quit. But then the plot intensified and I was on the edge of my seat. In season three up to episode 7 I also almost quit. But the finale was so good It made the whole season fantastic. The whole show fantastic. I realised then that Sons Of Anarchy has a slow start in every season, but the ending is so good it makes the whole series is fantastic. I can only compare it to the satisfaction felt once completing a jigsaw :) The more you continue to watch this TV series the more you will like it. It has also changed my music taste with the great music involved. I have one recommendation. Always continue watching!
10.0~This is my all time favorite show !!! At first I didnt want to see it but a friend convinced me and now I cant believe I almost missed out on this !!
2.0~I gave this show ample opportunity to impress. Unfortunately I look back and strongly regret giving it time. The acting was ok, the characters were awful. Very undeserving of the praise it has received. After watching Stranger Things and Ozark, maybe the bar had been raised. I wad looking for the feeling of finishing the season and just thinking WOW!! I was disappointed in this occasion. Don't waste your time on this rubbish
10.0~I rarely give something a full star rating, but this one deserves it. Last thing I would want is let yet another show get thrown off the air due to ratings. So many networks fail to realize that shows take awhile to get popular and many people download shows in order to watch them when they can, causing low ratings and cancellations to good shows. Well I would be sad to see that happen to Sons of Anarchy. Unfortunately I live in Canada so we only have Season 1 right now and I am forced to download Season 2 as our networks haven't even started them. But I will contribute to the show by getting Season 2 once it's on shelves, and if it means watching it on TV when aired to help I will. Word of mouth is a powerful thing and with Facebook and social networking, i'll do what I can to keep the show running. People already covered all the fantastic aspects of the show. Those 2 that had the lowest, did not watch it far enough to even merit understanding to the crappy comments they had. If you are on this site to look at the rating, curious if it's worthy, all I can say is give it a shot, because it sure is!! As a girl, I am not usually into "biker shows" so much, in fact I started watching it because others were and i had nothing else to do. I watched all of the Season 1 box set in 2 evenings. That's how good of a show it is. I never expected it to be that good. Watch it for yourself. I highly recommend this series to anyone. "Biker" or not.
9.0~No words to describe this show. The story, character development, the music all excellent. Just watch it. It starts out slow, but then it goes boom!
10.0~When Jax popped Alice it was the best single bullet discharged ever. The off-shoots that this show takes only adds to how much this show impacts every aspect of everyones lives. People think it only about bikers and the crimes they commit, but it is so much more. There are so many incredible actors involved in this show, you just can't help like this show. Jimmey Smits, Maggie Siff, Ron Perlman, and Katey Sagal are all standouts. When you have premium actors lining up to have guest appearances on this show says a lot. The suspense of the show has developed into an incredible foray of suspense. Goggins is such an awesome actor. The Shield, Justified, and SOA proves he needs an Emmy!
3.0~So I recently started watching this show based on the reviews here. I couldn't be more disappointed. While occasionally this show has some bright spots the rest of it is so contrived and full of horrible acting that it just falls completely flat. The main gang is a bunch of completely despicable set of human beings except for perhaps one guy but he is so back and forth between complete asshatery and an attempt to do whats right that it makes a mockery of the whole thing. The whole show seems to be one pathetically boring attempt to justify showing bikers fighting or blowing things up over and over with little or no purpose other than they are blowing stuff up or fighting. I started watching this after going through the first three seasons of Justified this crock was recommended based on that show and the two couldn't be any different if they were designed to be. Justified was witty and fun while this thing is bogged down in simplistic motivations and violence for the sake of violence. After 8 episodes of this dreck I am giving up maybe it gets better later on but I am not willing to sit through the pain it would take to get there. I have no idea how this show won any awards. Nor can I figure out how it gets the ratings it does here. I wanted to like this show but I just cant find anything redeeming in it whatsoever.
7.0~i hope i can meet the write (without i have a whip mixing with salt! very risky) and asked him a basic question! are you humiliating our mind and treating it as kids minds!) for good seek how terrible you solve some challenges faced to Jackson! you need to come up something real NOT a miracle fallen from the sky. I gave a 7 of 10 for its realistic, gritty portrayals and convincing acting. This show is medium written and well acted. Only a little "Hollywood" phony stuff here. I originally rented it to learn what Hollywood was saying about bikers. Being a motorcycle rider myself I just had to see what was being portrayed. I like it for showing the mindset of those in outlaw biker clubs. We get an accurate look at what goes on in the club and in the heads of members. Emphasis is on "outlaw" here. There are many law abiding motorcycle clubs out there that are good for the community helping with fund raisers and other events. Maybe this series will open the eyes of those contemplating joining an outlaw M/C club. Murder, deceit, illegal activities that can bring prison time or a bullet to the head are all aspects of outlaw clubs. All the emphasis on camaraderie, 'family', and brotherhood make it seem like a good thing. Having a group of friends you can count on is good, but if they are outlaws you most likely will end up in trouble with the law sooner or later. Pay attention to how they use money to corrupt the local law. Most of them live with the motto, "Start no s**t, there will be no s**t. But that only applies if you don't annoy them first. Then there is the illegal activity that may one day spill over into your life. Selling guns illegally to other outlaws does not put them on my Christmas card list. But again the positive side of this series is that it shows quite accurately what goes on in clubs like this. FIRST EDIT: After thinking more on this series I am finding myself more intrigued wondering what the writers will do with the characters. I intend to view all of the episodes so I can better comment on series later. A guy I knew from work tells me this stuff is pretty darn accurate as to what goes on in outlaw clubs and between them. They talk very casually about wasting someone who is a danger to the club. Take note and give clubs a wide berth. To their credit outlaw clubs have a code that they stick together and woe be unto anyone who breaks that code. At least they have honor amongst themselves. One thing I like about this is that no one with any brains would be rude to these people in the SOA. They know the consequences. There are now many rude people in our society because we decent folks allow them to get away with it. We sometimes hesitate to tell off the rude ones because we fear a situation or even a law suit if things get out of hand. Every time we allow that we "enable" the rude ones to continue their behavior. This show has convinced me it is time to cease allowing rudeness.
6.0~Given the popularity of this show, i gave the first 2 seasons a go. At the end of the second, that sneaking 'Dexter - post season 4' feeling crept into my stomach, reminding me of the lost hours on boring, mixed up story lines and questionable acting ability. The main character, Jax, to start with. He bounces around the screen with his good looks and flowing locks, guided by a sense of righteousness without any real conviction. Not to mention his terrible American accent given the actors Northern English heritage (i think).... Again, a sucker for authenticity, the entire Irish cast or at least the ones i heard speaking all have terrible Northern Irish accents, particularly the main fella in the second with the history with the Scottish biker with IRA connections. Now, i'm not saying the odd Scott didn't move over to 'the cause' at some point, but the assumption here is that the Scot is actually Irish...... Ahh,and the questionable 'family values. of the bikers ........ i cannot go on.
