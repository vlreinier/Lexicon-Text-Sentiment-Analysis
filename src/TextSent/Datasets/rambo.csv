8.0~A lot more believable and grimmer than the previous installments.... legendaryunderdog Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone I feel did a very good job in writing, producing, directing and acting in this movie (something he has become accustomed to over the years). The CG effects are not all that bad, a lot of the CG is used for bodies exploding apart and whatever gore Stallone could manage to throw in. The plot is very simple (maybe simpler than previous Rambo films) and the "rescue mission" if you will, is right on key. It's like this movie took the Rambo edge to the next level, all the acting is very believable and the genocide scenes are horrifically exact. A lot of brutality and blood flows in this film and this is definitely not a film for the light of heart, take caution lighthearters! I really feel that this movie should earn an award because it was so well done in comparison to the other Rambo films, the score for the movie is great as well, nice classical music that adds an eerie feeling to your gut while your watching it. 8 out of 10 stars no problem.
9.0~RAMBO fully unleashed nokiagrios Sign in Permalink The best in the series IMHO! John Rambo is a soft, gentle soul until its time not to be! Amazing movie directed by the man himself! See it you won't regret it!
3.0~This is not John Rambo Ziya90 Sign in Permalink You know, Stallone made a new Rocky movie too, Rocky Balboa and a new Rambo movie, Rambo (it would be better, if the title was called John Rambo) In Rocky Balboa, Stallone's direction and script were subtle, so I had expected the same thing in Rambo, but it was a huge disappointment. I still don't know why Stallone did that, has he changed? or something else? Firstly, besides the lack of subtle direction, there is not lots of action like the previous movies (I mean the second and the third one, not First Blood) in the movie. In the first half, I had waited action, but 'the introduction' was too long, so disappointed, I don't count the short boat scene. The movie consists of only three action sequences, but even if it seems enough, somehow unsatisfying. As for the claymore scene, I had not seen such an explosion before in my life. It is also weird that in this Rambo movie, Rambo is like a supporting actor. After years and years, I had expected to see him on the screen more, but instead watched the rescue team, the missionaries and the Burmese army. I thought to myself, is this because of the duration of the movie? It might be, but the previous Rambo movies were not long, almost the same duration, so it shows that there is something wrong in this Rambo movie. I felt like it was one hour. The biggest flaw of the movie is Rambo himself. He was like a totally different guy, it was not John Rambo. It seems that this guy enjoys killing people and in extreme brutal ways. It seems that he is hunger for blood, violence, he is not hunger for rescuing or surviving. For example, the boat scene, remember what he does to the pirate who leaves behind. However, there are much more worse scenes, Rambo tears a soldier's throat like a savage, like a monster or he breaks a soldier almost in half by his machete, innards are scattered etc. Where is John Rambo we know? In terms of direction, it is the same either. It is not Stallone. It is not the man who directed Rocky. The long final sequence is probably the most brutal, violent and extreme battle scene of all time. Soldiers are disintegrated, heads, arms, legs and bodies are disintegrated with lots of blood. Of course, this made gore fans glad that's why its rating is such high. I cannot believe that how Stallone did that? There are more flaws unfortunately. The script is third class like some shots. There is a bizarre scene that we cannot understand what is going on? A group of Burmese soldiers keep a few girls in order to rape, but they use a kind of firework, then the place is filled with smoke. So? The disagreements between Rambo and the rescue team, the attitudes of Lewis, the relationships which are vain at the beginnings and get better later and the rebels's support are cliché and also all these make the movie cheap. Linda cannot be a new Co Bao, instead sorry, but her acting and sometimes even her existence (in the combat zone) were annoying. She just screams, what is the point? By this movie, Stallone made critics right about violence. Probably, now they cheer up which is so frustrating. May be, he vented his anger on critics, may be he just has changed.
10.0~Stallone is Back! ciminoproductions Sign in Permalink Now this is how an action movie should be made. Going to see this movie was a great experience. I went to the midnight show with my girlfriend and two buddies. When we arrived there was a big line for the movie and the theater manager was convinced to open a 12:15 show. The second the credits came on, the audience applauded like crazy. Every great action scene was met with numerous applause. And the ending, which I thought was a classic ending, had the entire audience give a standing ovation. As for the negative movie critics and their reviews... This is not an "Oscar" movie, but who wanted it to be? It's Rambo, classic action that got everyone to remember growing up with the other Rambo movies. I think this one was as good as "First Blood". It also had a realistic feel to it,as well as addressing the situation that's happening right now in Burma. Sylvester Stallone is kind of like the New York Yankee's. You either love him or hate him. But I think this film as well as last years "Rocky Balboa" shows that Stallone is truly gifted as a writer-director-actor. To direct yourself, especially in an action movie is very hard work(like Mel Gibson in "Braveheart")and I think Stallone did a wonderful job with it. People are hard on Stallone cause maybe he had a few bad movies out there, or they think in real life he is slow and talks like Rocky(why I don't know, it's called acting, it was a character he played)what ever reason, I think Stallone deserves more respect than what people give him. Hopefully, these two new movies he made can help him get his respect.
10.0~What we've all been waiting for chrisward46 Sign in Permalink I can remember being a fresh-faced nine year old when 'First Blood Part 2' came out, and at school one of those horrible kids who looked about five years older than what they were said that he'd seen it, and Rambo shoots someone in the face, cuts another guy's head off, etc. Obviously, when I got round to seeing this movie, it wasn't as bad as had been described. Now finally, twenty three years later, Stallone has made the movie that was promised to me back in '85. 'Rambo' starts off with real-life news footage of atrocities in Burma, which segues into the actions of the now-fictional Burmese army - already Stallone has set the tone of the movie, and frankly, if there were no named actors in this movie, you could be forgiven for thinking this was all real footage. One thing that's been great about action and horror films for the last five years is the use of grainy film and lack of colour filters - thank you '...Chainsaw Massacre'. Plot rundown is pointless, as you already know if you're going to want to watch it or not. Some people have criticized the movie for showing violence against children. Obviously this will upset some people, but as far as the movie goes, it was necessary to show the brutality of the soldiers and their actions. These things do go on in the real world and by cutting them out, you are diluting the impact of the movie. It's there, on the screen, and if you don't like it - don't watch it. As for the rest, there's beheadings, people getting cut in half, flying limbs, disembowelment's - and it's all shown in full, with no cuts or hints of suggestions. All that's left to say is - 'Thank you Mr.Stallone - you redeemed yourself with 'Rocky Balboa' and you surpassed yourself with 'Rambo'. You've made this lifelong fan believe again.'
10.0~Makes the other Rambo movies look like Disney films The_Light_Triton Sign in Permalink I remember watching the first Rambo film and thinking about how awesome it was. it had it's share of gore, violence, and the like, but it didn't hit as hard as the 2nd Rambo, which delivered more violence, but to a lesser extreme. but almost 20 years later after Rambo 3 (which i've heard was bad) a new Rambo comes out. and thanks to Computer graphics, Sylvester Stallone's imagination, and the cruelty of the world, this movie is just excellence all the blood splashing way. Rambo lives his life as a farmer in Thailand. he lives in peace, until one day, a group of missionaries from a church in Colorado ask him to take them upriver to war-torn Burma. the leader of the missionaries claims he knows what to expect, but Rambo tells him better of what to expect. the missionaries go anyways, and end up being captured. Now, i usually won't do this, but there are a few things that must be said about this movie. For one, it's gory beyond your wildest nightmares. unless you have no soul or heart, you'll be begging for the movie to end. Another thing is, you won't just feel a single emotion from this film...you will feel every emotion there is to feel. Sadness, fear, excitement, everything. If you like gory details, heres a few memorable scenes to watch out for. -Several people are shot. the bullet holes are the size of bowling balls. -children are held down and shot by soldiers. -In the pirate scene, Rambo literally blasts the brains out of the pirates' heads. -Women have their arms dismembered. -Rambo slices a man's neck open. -Rambo uses a turret gun, and rips a man's torso apart with it. -in the same scene, Rambo also blasts a man's leg off. -one man is literally blown to pieces by a mortar. -The sniper shoots a guy in the head, blasting it to bits. -In the camp rescue scene, A dancer is stripped of her top, and just for a moment you can see her breasts. then later she is gang raped. -A pig eats the leg of a dead man. -Rambo cuts the head off of an executioner. (Trivia: In the internet preview, it actually looks like Rambo punched the man's head off, because the quality of the preview was bad.) -And there are Several scenes of people being tortured. I thought this movie wouldn't be as bad as it was, but trust me, you might want to have a barf bag ready when you see this because it is going to make you puke up your popcorn, because it's so damn gory. And just to note, if you liked 300, you have to watch this. Bottom line: of all the 80's movies remakes lately, from rocky, to Indiana Jones, this one is certainly bound to be best. 10 out of 10
10.0~When you're pushed... killin's as easy as breathin'. Jerry_Sprinkle Sign in Permalink This doesn't "necessarily" contain spoilers per-say. But I do suggest that only people who have seen Rambo read this. Words can't express how satisfied I am with this movie. First I'd like to start off saying that this movie was so good, I plan on seeing it again tomorrow night. I'm afraid the overload of ass-kicking might have been too much to fully appreciate the first time around so perhaps revisiting this film will bring out some of the nuances that really make Rambo great. For instance, the violence. Burma must totally be the absolute worst place in the history of the planet. My absolute favorite part was the violence against children in this movie. Never before have I ever, EVER seen someone take an infant and throw it into a barbecue pit then having a guy come in with a flame thrower to top it off... wow. I loved loved LOVED the land mines! That game they played was fantastic! An excellent touch was Rambo ripping a guys throat out with his bare hand. I would have been satisfied by the time Rambo got to the 50 caliber anti-aircraft gun, but this movie was relentless. Most useless award goes to the Burmese rebel alliance in the final battle sequence. By the time they arrive, Rambo is already in 50th f'in gear and half the population of Burma is in a bloody pile of south east Asian carnage the likes of which the world has not seen since Pol Pot. The biggest mistake the Burmese army made, besides messing with Rambo, was when they didn't take the opportunity to retreat when Rambo ran out of ammo. This movie makes it VERY clear that Rambo is living his life to kill. Sure, in the final scene he returns home to some ranch in the US, but that was just one of his dreams. You know Rambo got up the next day and mailed more pamphlets about Burma to churches and mission centers in the States then waited... If there isn't another Rambo movie I'm going to seriously question the artistic integrity of Sylvester Stallone.
10.0~A Great Ending, to a Great Series... SmetyBoi Sign in Permalink As I was sitting in my seat before the fourth installment in the Rambo series I was not in high spirits, or filled with any hint of great expectations. Boy, was I wrong. This film brought the best qualities in any action movie together. Does this movie contain a lot of gore and violence? Yes. Is it senseless and over the top? No. To my surprise, this movie had more carnage than any I'd ever seen before (that I can recall) but I was not disgusted or upset by it. This was realistic violence, it didn't try and censor or hide what would actually happen when certain events took place; normally in a movie with Rambo's level of violence, I would simply roll my eyes and think, "Here we go again, stupid unnecessary gore..." However Sylvester Stallone knew what he was doing, it's comparable to "Saving Private Ryan" in being realistic, but probably even a little more grisly. Sylvester Stallone was completely 'Bad-A' in his acting, he did a great job, as old as he is. So, as a huge Stallone fan I was very pleased. Overall this was one of the most (if not the most) fast-paced, exciting, realistic and enjoyable action/thrillers I have ever seen; and the plot was pretty darn good too! The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because it was a tad bit short and I just wished it was longer, but by no means did the shortness take away from the storyline or movie in general. It's definitely a movie I would pay another $8.00 to see again. On a final note, the ending is very heartwarming and uplifting. Rambo, the final movie of the series, is great in nearly every way, go see it as soon as you can!
8.0~So much violence packed into 90 minutes. Rambo IV is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. stewiefan201 Sign in Permalink Rambo IV is the most recent bloody violent adventure of the world famous, you named it, John Rambo. Part IV all takes place in Burma, Thailand where an enormous genocidal war is brutally raging. John Rambo (Stallone) transports a group of aid workers to Burma in order to help the wounded innocent citizens, who are constantly plagued by the violent and horrible infantry soldiers. The soldiers kill them, rape them, and torture them everyday of their lives. Rambo warns the workers that if they're not bringing in weapons, there are no lives that will be changed in Burma. However soon upon arrival the aid workers are abducted by the soldiers and held captive. It is now up to Rambo and a small group of mercenaries to sneak into Burma, and save the aid workers' lives from the hands of over 100 soldiers. I have never seen any of the Rambo films, there I said it. I'm sure that after seeing this movie that that's going to change. I enjoyed just about every minute of this violent, brutal, and surprisingly effective film. As most of us know there is genocidal ethnic cleansing taking place in Burma. Rambo IV contains scenes that show extremely graphic killings of Burmese citizens. These scenes are not portrayed to excite you or shock you. The scenes show us just how violent and awful a genocide really is, and very effectively for that matter. It's even more effective to know that this is actually going on in the world. However the movie is a very good action flick, once it gets to the parts where it's more appropriate to cheer as Rambo slices and dices soldiers left and right. Rambo IV is very well made with excellent cinematography that captures the gritty atmosphere of its jungle environment. The editing is very quick moving probably because if it wasn't, this movie would be getting an NC-17 rating. The violence is graphically bloody and gory, among one of the bloodiest movies I've ever seen. If you are squeamish here's a huge word of advice, stay as far away from this movie as possible. Here's what you're looking at: Soldiers' bodies getting shot apart with limbs and body parts flying through the air, people getting slashed and having their intestines fall to the floor, and people getting blown apart by grenades. So yes, like I said...It's very violent. The weak points of Rambo IV are very obvious. The one you probably expect even before you see the film, is that the dialogue is garbage. And although I wouldn't call it garbage, it's definitely not a Shakespearian masterpiece. However the dialogue all has to do with the movie's story at hand, and thank God Rambo does not start shooting off one-liners. One-liners work in some movies like Die Hard, but they would make Rambo less of a bad ass. Some audiences even criticize Stallone's acting skills, saying he can only do action flicks but never a serious film. Well I'll tell you that the "Rambo" action doesn't start until a little while into the film. Stallone gives a strong performance throughout, and definitely in good shape. Rambo IV also contains a lot of scenes with a great amount of build-up and suspense. And when it gets to the payoff, it's quite an awesome payoff. The disturbing depictions of the genocide in Burma also gives you a lot of reason to hate the soldiers, and want them to die an excruciatingly painful death. Although I'm not sure whether or not that was a morally correct thing to root for, it didn't matter cause it was mind blowing action. I don't think I have ever in my life seen more deaths in one movies, or as much bloody violence. Rambo IV tops them all in terms of violence. I must educate myself in the Rambo movies by watching the trilogy. This one assured me that those films are very likely good as well. Overall Rambo IV is mind-numbingly brutal and an all out action packed movie. It is somewhat short but I barely noticed the time length. I give Rambo IV a 3 out of 4. I expected blood, gore, and a grisly whirlwind of awesome violence, but never expected the effective side of it. One of the best action films I've seen in quite a long while.
6.0~Oh dear neil-476 Sign in Permalink In this fairly unpleasant film, Stallone makes an ill-advised fourth foray into the world of John Rambo. The first film was great. Based on David Morell's excellent novel First Blood, it was an interesting examination of a man with no place in the society which had turned him into a killing machine. It had serious points to make, and made them well in the context of an entertaining action thriller. The second and the third movies had less to offer - they were simply action thrillers. This fourth film purports to be the same thing, but is fatally compromised by two things: one, the story doesn't have much to say (there is a set-up for missionary Michael's "All killing is bad" viewpoint to be examined after he kills one of the bad soldiers, for instance, but this never happens) and, two, there is an unsavoury and rather gloating glorification for making death as graphic and grisly as possible. There is no character development of any consequence, no moral, very little story, just a great deal of exceedingly violent killing. I was neither enamoured nor impressed.

10.0~John Rambo finally comes full circle! dantooinedepot Sign in Permalink I have to admit, as a die-hard FIRST BLOOD fan firstly, and a Rambo 2 & 3 fan secondly, I really had my apprehentions about RAMBO 4. How could the Rambo character transcend into the 21st century, post 911 world we now live in, where all sequels and things revisted years later, have a more serious, surreal adeptation to them. It's not going to be Stallone vs. the bad cop, or the VC, or the cold war Russians, so all I could think was, "How will this work out?" Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised, that despite all the violence and gore, (which was integral to the story, and incredibly realistic), the story is still about what it was in FIRST BLOOD...John Rambo's inner struggle to come to grips with what he really is, and finding his inner soul and worth, beyond the killing that he did in the name of his country. The most telling line in the entire movie, is when he is responding to how he got on that side of the world. He says "I was drafted in Nam" I nearly fell out of my chair. No where that I can remember does he say he was drafted. Being such an efficient killer, I always assumed he had joined the army. The movie was good, and I'm glad to say it worked out much much better than most revisted franchises. The ending is kind of a bummer, because you know it's the last one, but then again, it had the same feeling of the end of FIRST BLOOD, which is perfect, because it really is about closure, and finality, all these years later. I don't think it was better than FIRST BLOOD, but that is just my opinion. I think FB stand alone by itself very well, and of course RAMBO 2 and 3 were not much more than "80's Fight Fest" oportunism at they're best. RAMBO 4 is definitely for those who like the FB the best. But be warned, it is brutal. I'm glad that Stallone decided to do this movie, and bring closure to the character, and for the fans as well. -Tom, Cleveland Ohio
5.0~ehhhmm did u guys actually see this movie? coffeeblack Sign in Permalink i could'nt wait to see this and finally did yesterday.... i'm a big fan of stallone and just cant understand how he accepted this script? i watched it with my girlfriend and we were so let down..yes the effects were good and the subject matter was shocking but it was just cliché after cliché and the director just could'nt make it work.. stallone of course carried the whole movie on his shoulders but that just was not enough i'm afraid.. i like to think i'm fair with giving a review because i know how much work goes into a movie and that of course we all have different tastes but guys and girls give this one a miss and try and forgive stallone for selling out for a huge paycheck making us fork out money to be let down.. i gave it a five for the subject matter and for stallone being present...
7.0~Violence unlimited......but with a story about Burma jacksilverz09 Sign in Permalink Stallone's attempt to give Rambo a final go went blazing berserk. It seems to have gunned down everything on screen and might have, just might have taken the audience down as well. The prospect of what a final Rambo and a Rocky movie could be has always been a dream for the audience I guess. So expectations were always high. Stallone punched spot on for Rocky but seems to have missed the target with Rambo with a touch too much violence. But one would also ask if not this then what else?? Rambo afterall is and has always been a one man army, a killing machine forged in Vietnam. This movie certainly makes that point more than clear in Burma also making an attempt to bring out the injustice happening there coz of the Civil War. One notable difference in this movie is his indifference to his feelings for his home country and his rise as a messiah for humanity itself!! I guess internet caught up with Rambo too bluring boundaries. He's developed a soft corner for Julie Benz's character too!! Imagine Rambo a softy!!phew!!Muscle maniac who can be mellow inside too!! This Rambo movie doesn't show Rambo in captivity and him escaping from it and saving others in the process, it concentrates just on saving others. He is never caught or tortured. But once again Stallone has pulled that Rambo look marvellously. In fact Rambo 50 plus looks even more a rugged soldier. I guess when Rambo was younger he had to look a bit cute however savage for the female fans......and come on the guy is a looker. Rambo 4 is all muscles yes, but the eyes store something much more deeper, something much more scarier. His face is like a tree's trunk, it has a story, a savage one. So the makeup team did really good. And Stallone, now a veteran actor adds on to their effort with a stone face radiating with tons of deep but intangible emotion. All this Stallone achieves without having to visibly move any of his cheek muscles. Mark of a great actor I guess. The direction, well, if you are gonna judge Rambo by the number of bad guys getting their butts obliterated, well this one scores the highest points!! If Rambo violence agrees with you, don't miss this movie. It's got a bullet for every minute!!
10.0~Every new town just seems to bring you down CuriosityKilledShawn Sign in Permalink I'll get my one and only gripe out of the way first. I don't like the title. Rambo 4 or John Rambo would have been far more appropriate but I will call the film Fourth Blood in this review to avoid confusion between the characters name and the film title. For the past 20 years John Rambo has remained in Thailand since his rescue of Colonel Trautman in Afghanistan. He lives a quiet life as a snake hunter and fisherman until he is propositioned by a group of simple and naive American missionaries from some quaint country town (think of Ned Flanders and his pals) to take them up river into wartorn Bhurma where carnage, rape, mutilations and amputations are a daily occurrence so they can help the sick and teach bible or some other such Mother Theresa uselessness. It takes some convincing but Rambo agrees to do it and is only happy to see the back of them. But when the missionaries are kidnapped (which was inevitable) he leads a ragtag bunch of mercenaries across the border to annihilate every Junta in their way. But Rambo doesn't merely shoot the baddies, he rips them apart in ways so bloody it would make Jason Voorhees blush. Yes, it's a rather thin story, but so what? The only people who would point this out are those desperate to hate the film. But if your film taste usually involves Keira Knightley in a frock or Cameron Diaz doing romcom then what the hell are you doing watching a Rambo film anyway? I had worries that the Rambo character might not be relevant anymore. He hasn't been around since the 80s and he stood for something rather different back then. Stallone has always played him as a cynic and someone who mostly doesn't care about the world after what it's done to him. With all of the carnage and cheapening of life that happens daily on our planet it does seem fitting that Rambo would retreat to a quiet corner until mankind needs his ruthless efficiency for killing again. Stallone looks great for his age and this, his seventh film as director, is certainly his most hardcore. At 61 it seems that old Sly has more testosterone pumping through his arteries than ever before. Another thing that worried me was the loss of Jerry Goldsmith and Richard Crenna. A Rambo movie simply cannot be a Rambo movie without those classic, signature themes. Brian Tyler, who is certainly not the best composer in Hollywood, does a competent, if not exceptional, job of blending his own tough action noise with Goldsmith's memorable tunes. Richard Crenna on the other hand is one of those actors that really should have lived forever without aging. His absence is not explained in the movie but Stallone claims that 'Trautman died the day my friend Richard died'. Though I did love the black and white dream sequence at the halfway mark. Rambo has vivid flashbacks to the previous films with images of Colonel Trautman. His voice calls out to him 'John...John!' until it fades into the voice of a Pastor calling for Rambo's help. It's like Trautman, Rambo's only real friend/father figure, is still trying to give him guidance from the next world. It could have been longer, but legend has it that Stallone has a director's cut in the works for DVD and it's surely a great night at the movies. It finishes of the Rambo story perfectly will surely please every single Rambo fan on the face of the earth. Fourth Blood is a real action movie, no PG13 Live Free or Die Hard garbage here. This is what an action film, a MAN'S film should be.
10.0~Brutal, merciless, angering, and excellent. Cocacolaguy912-2 Sign in Permalink The opening credits set the tone for the movie; we get a montage of all the violence going on in Burma. Rape, murder, mutilation. You know within the first 5 minutes that this film is not going to be light-hearted. It is dark, far darker than any of the other Rambo films. And Rambo is still Rambo. Bitter and upset with the world. And it doesn't help that Christian aid workers want him to take them up the river to Burma so they can make changes. He tells them they won't be making any changes if they don't have weapons. But as the film needs a plot, Rambo agrees to take them up to Burma, and from then on we get a suspenseful, angering, and a gore-fest of an action film. This movie is not cheesy at all. No clever lines, no crap. Just Rambo being Rambo. I applaud Sylvester Stallone because while I believe he was trying to make the film entertaining (as any filmmaker would do), I honestly believe he was aiming to show the world what is going on in Burma. Who would have thought that a Rambo movie could actually make us aware of the madness that is taking place in a lesser-known country. I admit that before this film, I hardly knew Burma existed. I don't have much else to say. Oh yeah, the tagline is one of the best ever. "Heroes never die...they just reload." Genius. If you are a Rambo fan, an action fan, or if you just like movies that are intense and/or anger you, I highly recommend this film.
9.0~So, so awesome!!!!! Eric_Cubed Sign in Permalink I must admit, I'm a little biased when it comes to this one. The first BIG R-rated film I ever saw was First Blood, and like an archetype, I imprinted every last minute of it. The evil sheriff, the shadowy, disconnected mentor Troutman, the missionless drifter, I bought it all, and with a sphinctering zeal utterly unencumbered by adult awareness. This experience was gratuitously repeated with First Blood Part 2, and to a lesser extend in part 3, when it appeared the series was beginning to ride off the back of it's own ridiculousness. And then a miracle, like sweet, sweet baby Jesus: RAMBO. A cynical snake collector still living in 'Nam, John Rambo still "cares about something," but needs Dexter's beautiful blonde wife to remind him of it. Strangely, as I hate CGI, I couldn't help but to love the never ending computer scenes of bloody limbs and spurting body parts littering the celluloid landscape. It is my most heartfelt hope, and deepest desire, now that Rambo is home, to rid his small redneck town of meth-huffing skinheads. Please Sylvester, make it happen.
8.0~Rambo is at it Again! Kings_Requiem Sign in Permalink "When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing". Stallone is back as John Rambo in a big way with this all out action extravaganza. The 20 year lay off for Stallone didn't make any difference because he doesn't miss a beat in this film. He steps right back into the role so seamlessly, it's as if he just did the last Rambo film yesterday. And the result is awesome... Not only is Stallone back in the lead role, but he also acts as producer, writer, & director on this film. He does not disappoint in the acting and directing department, but the writing is a different story. There isn't much plot to go off of and the acting is certainly not Oscar worthy, but in a film like this, the strengths lie elsewhere. Stallone is at the top of his game when it comes to directing this beast. The man definitely knows how to shoot an action sequence and he kicks a$$ at it. The action is very fast and very bloody. Gunshots, stabbings, and explosions are aplenty. To say that the violence in this movie is over the top would be a HUGE understatement. The violence is so ridiculously brutal that the body count is well over 200. None of this however is a bad thing because that's what the Rambo movies are all about. Kicking a$$ and taking names is what John Rambo was born to do and he does it to the biggest vicious extreme. 50 cal machine guns ripping people in half and a homemade knife disemboweling a corrupt Burmese general are just small tidbits of the brutality Stallone offers up in this flick. As I said before the acting is not Oscar worthy, but everyone does a serviceable job. No need for Academy Award winning acting here though. Just straight up bloody f**king fun. Whether or not Stallone ever decides to revisit the world of Rambo again... He will have no shortage of fans lining up to see it and his mind will have no shortage of the brutal over the top craziness it takes to continue showing why Rambo is one of the most classic action franchises of all-time.
10.0~Just kick ass fun! Distearth-1 Sign in Permalink I never go to movies anymore because of the whole downloading thing but I had to go see this. When I was a kid-tween, Rambo was pretty damn cool. Explosive tipped arrows! Hell yea! So I went to see this for old times sake and relive a little youth and it worked. I was back, wide eyed and cheering for Rambo. MUCH more bloody than any of the previous but that's what the crowd has to have now so, it's there. Only complaint would be the inter struggle Rambo always has, which I took for granted it seems, was not as there and I found that I missed it. I also wish they had given a little more info on the Burmese issues just so more people would notice the horror that is really going on there. Anyway, by all means go to the movies and see Rambo not one moment of this movie was a waste of time. Every minute was a blast!
7.0~a good follow up to the Rambo series camkid8 Sign in Permalink I am one of those people who usually thinks that the last movie of a series is probably bad. (Let's not forget Indiana Jones) Especially one where the main actor is 62 years old. But this movie is actually really good. The action was outstanding, and I liked how Rambo was kind of haunted by the things he did in his earlier days. He has a best inside of him thats just dying to get out and it does. Rambo was super cool. I'm not so sure if there should be a sequel though. I think that it was hard enough to pull this one off and I don't know how they could make another one. But you know how Hollywood is. All they want is money and they really believe in the phrase "A sucker is born every minute."
1.0~Man I thought this movie really stunk but you decide for yourself nextblockbuster Sign in Permalink Stallone even said he couldn't come up with any good script ideas for another Rambo.( HE WAS RIGHT) THE MOVIE WAS SO BAD I TURNED IT OFF BEFORE IT WAS OVER IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SHOT WITH A VIDEO CAMERA AND THE FX WAS JUST AS CHEESY) Stallone looked wore out and beat up like a old dog but i don't mean that in a mean way, its like they tried to deliberately make him look that way also their were no characters that i could hate or like this is one film that should have never gotten made what a damn wast of money, but I guess Stallone needed the money, it ant cheep living in Beverly Hills. I still love Stallone though even after all my negative comments I wish he would make another Rocky. I didn't like the fact that Rocky lost the fight in the new film Balboa Mark Pfeltz aspiring indie film maker
7.0~This is a Grindhouse Exploitation Movie...Not Machete dirtypolo Sign in Permalink For nearly 10 years we of all people say that Robert Rodriguez's Machete is a homage grindhouse movie... we where wrong, that movie is just a crappy political thriller after the intro which is awesome. After Grindhouse in 2007, before Machete in 2010 along came Rambo aka Rambo 4 or John Rambo in 2008. When I watched Rambo for the first time I thought it was just good because I was that pumped and over hyped for Machete, well I was wrong because after all this time I know Rambo is a proper exploitation movie as well as a damn good bad ass sequel. This movie you have all of the cool action and sleaze, heads getting blown off all practically done very well, evil scum bad guys killing children and of course Rambo killing the bad guy at the end with a mean f@%K you look on his face. Rambo should be played along with Grindhouse: Planet Terror/Death Proof and Hobo with a Shotgun.
7.0~Full Circle! Ninja_Sinai Sign in Permalink What can I say. Just watched John Rambo this evening an I was glued to my seat for the entire duration of this classic! Even after the movie had finished I was held down in my seat with my jaw still open staring at the screen contemplating on what an amazing movie I had just seen. I say you can keep all your trash like Titanic, all your Spidermans, an most of the other expensive big budget crap that studios churn out every year. Stallone has shown that the man KNOWS what the people want. Movies that you actually ENJOY and REMEMBER! Which cant be said about most movies nowadays where you forget about the movie as soon as you walk out the cinema. This is the best movie Stallone has ever directed and a class ending of the Rambo story. In the first three Rambo movies, the Rambo character doesn't want to kill or harm anyone, an is pushed into killing. Here Rambo finally accepts who he is, an the skills possesses. He comes 'full circle.' We've never seen this side of Rambo in any of the previous movies. This is the killing machine that we've all heard about in the previous movies but never saw at his full capability. The ending made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Have to thank Sylvester Stallone for making a really good movie. The movie does not drag for even one second. 9.5/10
10.0~A GREAT action movie hmatharo Sign in Permalink I saw Rambo over the weekend and I was thoroughly impressed. I am a big fan of the Rambo films and Stallone films in general so my opinions are probably going to be a bit biased but I think most people would agree with me when I say this is "A great action movie." I gave RAMBO a 10out of 10 rating because I think this movie was created to achieve a certain goal--to convey a message about the atrocities going on in Myanmar (formerly called Burma) and at the same time conclude the story of one of America's most famous and popular pop culture icons. In my opinion that goal was met with taste, with dignity, and with a lot of heart and hard work from Sylvester Stallone and his crew. The movie is superbly entertaining...the story is believable, the action is intense, the sounds effects are excellent, and the acting is on par. It's an excellent film that I would definitely watch again. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it. Excellent job Sly!
10.0~The Best Rambo of All seyfriedjustin Sign in Permalink Don't worry, I'll justify that. For those of you who don't know the plot here it is in a nutshell: Rambo, now living in Thailand, escorts a group of church volunteers into Burma to help the Karem people constantly murdered and abused by the government. When they are captured, Rambo goes back into action, only this time with the help of a group of tough-as-nails mercenaries. I have to warn you: this movie is, like many of the best recent films, extremely violent. But not in the traditional "graphic gun-fights with the occasional stabbing" formula, uh-uh. And it certainly doesn't have any reservations towards showing the brutal reality of genocide: small children shot, bayoneted and burned alive, innocent people mowed down by uncaring and indifferent oppressing soldiers. It also has no qualms in showing the devastating reality of modern warfare, showing exploding bodies, sheared off heads and people ripped in twain by heavy caliber weapons in a way not seen since Spielberg's masterpiece Saving Private Ryan (director Stallone apes the directing style as well to great effect). Stallone can never be criticized again for romanticizing warfare. Where the previous Rambo sequels were gung-ho, commie-bashing epics, the new one is merely grimy and disgusting. The bad guys are just as corrupt and ruthless, but the exciting conclusion where they "get theirs" is less beautified and exotic than the previous two Rambos, replaced with a sense of chaos and ugly slaughter. But in the end, Rambo (and the audience) know it was worth it. In conclusion, let me tell you that while inspirational, uplifting and pushing Stallone's righteous rage policies in a way the previous Rambos didn't, this is not for the squeamish or faint of heart due to its blunt realism (and not mere action pornography as so many hack critics put it). For everyone else, be aware that this might be the best movie of the decade, and IS Stallones best effort since Copland ten years ago. SEE IT!
6.0~Great Action one-76 Sign in Permalink I guess they didn't thought much about the story. The movie is all about great realistic action. It showed how a war field look like. How dirty, oppressive and violent it is. How killing and torture can be for fun or to feed an instinct. War can show what is people made of and how different they are. It showed in some way that nature of life which war can reflect. I found it a good movie. I think it could be a lot better if the story was modified. It wasn't a waste of time at all.
8.0~Back with a vengeance juneebuggy Sign in Permalink Well holly hell Rambo is back with a vengeance here. Probably one of the most violent films I've seen but I will say once the audience got over the initial shock at the type of visceral, brutal and gratuitous violence we were witnessing we started cheering with each blood spraying kill. It was entertaining in a grisly sort of way. I've been a lifelong fan of the Rambo franchise and this fourth instalment is excellent, granted a very different type of film then the originals. It's a bit light in the plot department but set in a backdrop of real life atrocities in Burma. We join Rambo 20 years after his little Afghanistan extraction, John is living the quiet life in a rural village in Northern Thailand, he has given up fighting, found a shirt and now spends his days capturing snakes for local entertainers, and chauffeuring locals in his old PT boat. He's also gotten pretty bitter with age, world weary and tired so that when a group of Christian missionaries ask for his help in reaching their aid camp in war torn Burma he refuses, his response at one point being "fu** the world". After pretty blonde Sarah Miller tries again to get his help (this time giving him a necklace -seems that's all the girls have to do to get his attention) he finally agrees to ferry them upriver. Some time later the mission is attacked, the do-gooders taken hostage and Rambo is now asked to transport a group of mercenaries, on a rescue mission and that's when hell rains down. The violence from this point on is brutal and gratuitous, with video game style killings, bodies blown apart, blood spraying the camera, tons of explosions. After that savage attack on the village you don't have much remorse though. The closing scene is just perfect...the long road home. 1/5/16
8.0~More Violent, More Mature shariqq Sign in Permalink John Rambo, as the title sequence called this movie, is indeed a movie that finally completely proves how violence can be used to preach anti-violence. This movie has such realistic gore, without ever glorifying it, that I had to convince myself while watching it that it is just a movie. Rambo's insanely calm and cold-blooded demeanor while he massacres an entire infantry is reminiscent of how killing so many people has killed him of human emotions. Sly Stallone is indeed a good writer; a better writer than a director. The movie makes no pretense in sophisticated urbanism. It plays out exactly and as simple as expected from Rambo's POV. This man lives only because he is alive, without ever forgetting what he really is. His mundane life is interrupted and eventually unhinged due to a simple decision - to help others, and only because he can rather than he should. The movie is equally linear in its plot and telling, yet leaves an impact as powerful as after a Saving Private Ryan. In First Blood and the two sequels, John Rambo has fought bigger battles and faced situations of a lot more peril. He has run away from 'what' he is, or accepted and despised his self. But here, with age and the maturity it brings, he finally comes to peace with 'who' he is. And that is where as a personal story, this scores well over the first three movies. Like for all muscle-men, Stallone's physique has taken away any recognition he deserves for the mind he has. Multiple Razzies and stereotypical roles has him always judged as a bigger better version of Van Damme. But with a lot more creative control and less media focus, he is finally able to continue what he started of as a nobody in the first Rocky. Overall this may not the best Rambo movie (First Blood still takes that cake), but it surely is the most effective one.
7.0~Brutal (If Predictable) Storyline Leads To Great Character Growth zkonedog Sign in Permalink After nearly 20 Rambo-less years (1988-2007), I was a bit skeptical about what to expect from this film. Sylvester Stallone seemed a bit old to be playing the lead role, and the character had been "on the shelf" for so long that his viability in American culture was very much in doubt. Fortunately, though the writers/producers didn't get everything right, they pleasantly surprised me by providing a film that is quite enjoyable and worthy of the Rambo title. For a basic plot summary, this film explores a much darker side of the John Rambo (Stallone) character. Found in the deepest regions of Indo-China, an emotionally lost and severely conflicted Rambo reluctantly agrees safe passage to a group of missionaries bringing supplies to the war-ravaged region of Burma. When the peace mission goes awry and the mercenaries are called in, Rambo feels compelled to once again enter the war zone he has tried for so long to avoid. Really, the only glaring problem with this film is that the plot is very predictable. You know that things will get screwed up somehow and that Rambo will be called in to fix the situation, so some of the Burmese-territory exposition is a little tedious. If you can get past this, though, it truly is an entertaining film. The aspect that stands out the most is the brutalness of the entire picture. What the film loses in predictability it makes up for with some brutal scenes that will really make you despise the Burmese war force. The slaughter of women, children, animals, and the complete burning of villages are shown with no detail spared. Plus, it isn't as if the brutality is just being played for bloody special effects, either. Stallone did his research this time and tried to replicate the shock value of civil warfare/genocide, and the result are some very shocking scenes. What really sets this movie apart, though, is its focus on the John Rambo character. Whereas parts II & III of the series were just shoot-em-ups, this installment actually tries (like the original) to delve into what makes Rambo tick. In fact, a lot more time (the film is only 91 minutes long) could have been devoted to the inner-workings of the Vietnam Vet and it wouldn't have been boring. Thus, if you are at all skeptical about coming back to the Rambo franchise after such a long layoff, please dispel those notions and see this movie. It is easily the best effort in the franchise since the original First Blood.

2.0~Pointlessly violent Spaceygirl Sign in Permalink It's not only that Sylvester Stallone is getting too long in the tooth for this kind of role. It's not that it's got the worst script in moviedom. It's not even that the 'acting' is laughably bad. It's that it's so BAD. John Rambo should have been killed off ages ago. In fact, give it up Mr Stallone. You cannot act. You never could. Please, for the sake of future generations, GIVE IT UP. It's also needlessly, pointlessly violent. The audience that watches "Rambo" doesn't CARE about the millions being killed in Burma. All they care about is the action. In fact, when I watched it, several youngsters actually cheered in the massacre scene. WTF? Had this kind of violence been in a movie directed by, say, Oliver Stone, the audience might sit up and take notice, like they did in "Hotel Rwanda" and "The Last King of Scotland", but the target audience of "Rambo" is not of that ilk.
7.0~Graphic, extremely bloody and a very good finale to the Rambo series guardkid Sign in Permalink A great effort from Stallone(who directed) and definitely ends the Rambo series on a high. As an action film and a Rambo film it stands up well on both counts. My score after one viewing is 7.5/10. This places it second on my list behind First Blood. I'll mention the negatives first: Negatives: The film was too short, and seemed to have a "chapter" missing. The way the Christian Aid workers just turned up asking Rambo to help them take them up the river to Burma was done abruptly and pretty clumsily. Instead of starting with Rambo in the jungle catching snakes, they could have started with the missionary workers making their way to Rambo's location- with a bit of explanation of who they were and whether they had already heard of Rambo. In the film, the woman talks to Rambo as if she already knows him and these early scenes are over-dramatised and get all heavy and pretentious- when all she wants is a lift up the river! These early exchanges weren't the best. Rambo in turn is portrayed as uninterested and unsympathetic and there's a brooding sense of old-man pessimism about him. For me another negative was Rambo's opening line ...the first words that we hear from Rambo in nearly 20 years.... is an expletive. Hmm...unfortunate but does set the harsh tone of the movie. Later the Minister comes to inform Rambo of the groups disappearance and if he will escort a rescue team of mercenaries - this again echoed the scenario in Rambo 3 (official turns up with the bad news....cue Rambo involvement.) Also a scene where the mercenaries are introduced to Rambo before setting off on the trip would have been far better than just instantly showing them altogether in the boat mid-river. The escape sequence through the jungle lacked a couple more action "set-pieces" prior to the explosion of the big WWII bomb. It would have been great to see Rambo for the last time, taking on a couple of small units of enemy soldiers using his old survival skills in the jungle. I didn't like the British character who led the group of mercenaries- supposedly ex-SAS- he seemed stereotyped- basically a foul-mouthed, obnoxious, ageing yob with a machine gun who would have looked more at home picking fights in a pub. His introductory scene on the boat was overplayed and unrealistic given the dangerous circumstances- as he was very hostile towards Rambo who was doing them a favour by "escorting" them upriver as the "boat-man" (although Rambo has other motives for making the trip). I just wanted Rambo to knock him over-board for being so disrespectful but here a mature Rambo instead shows restraint. Lastly the ending was a touch weak and attempted to bring Rambo full-circle and give some sense of closure to the series. I thought this scene was just tacked-on the end(Stallone appears quite older in this last scene, without the headband and greased-back hair - and you know this is the end of the Rambo journey). Positives: Actually there are some refreshing changes in this Rambo. It could have been so easy for Rambo to go through the old favourite "captured, tortured, escape and dish out retribution" sequence -but that wouldn't have been original and credit to Stallone for not going down that old plot-line. We don't see a shirtless Rambo either, muscles pumped, doing the infamous roar as he peppers the enemy with dozens of rounds of bullets. That wouldn't have looked right considering Rambo is a lot older. Also Rambo eventually fights as "one of a group" instead of the usual one-man-on-a-mission, as he helps out the mercenaries in their quest to rescue the doomed missionaries. I thought that Rambo's life was more in danger and that he was more vulnerable (this was mainly due to his age) - he was not portrayed as the invincible fighting machine of the past- Ironically though Rambo suffers the least physical injuries by far out of all the films... a bullet to the shoulder. His vast experience of conflict/violent situations does come through as he takes pretty much everything in his stride (you won't see the classic shots of Rambo with his "eyes wide open" during moments of danger). Rambo still has that smouldering pent-up anger, and when the time comes for him to kill- he shows absolutely no mercy to the enemy who are real scum in this film. The scene where he takes out the river-pirates was classic Rambo. Rambo as a film, in some ways is more true to the original -First Blood in that there is hardly any of the '80's cheesiness' that was present in Rambo 2 and 3 and thankfully there is a lack of corny one-liners (the absence of Colonol Trautman helped in this regard). There is however a black and white 'flash-back' moment where various clips are shown -mainly of the first two movies. I didn't really like that- as Stallone did exactly the same in Rocky Balboa - its a blatant "signing off" montage of the franchise. The violence is intense and graphic and this has to be one of the bloodiest films of all time- limbs, various body parts can be seen flying around the screen- it really is grim stuff and is backed up by the stat that it has the highest body-count of all the Rambo movies. Yes, Rambo does what he does best and takes out so many of the vile baddies- its breathtaking action at its finest and is great to watch on the big screen. If you are a Rambo fan- I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
5.0~Watch it or . . . else! you_the_man_77 Sign in Permalink Now I bet all of you have been put off by the new Rambo and after watching it all I can say is what are these critics on?! I feel that people are overreacting. Okay it is violent . . . very violent but you can't say you haven't been warned if it bears an 18 certificate and says contains strong bloody violence! Personally I thought Rambo was quite good. It does take a while to get into but once the action begins, you don't want it to stop. Although some scenes are a bit intense. One example being a sick game of which civilians are forced to run across a field full of land mines. I'm sure I don't have to draw a picture. The only thing I didn't agree with was a few 30 second clips of children being killed. Although if you've watched Hostel II, you'll be fine. Apart from that, me and three other people actually wanted the film to be longer. The only reason I could think why this film lost points was because it was full of heavily clichéd moments and characters. However, Slyvester Stallone has still got it as Rambo, considering the dude's 62?! Providing us with some memorable one-liners! (Live for nothing or die for something . . . make the call!). Personally I liked it. The violence, though intense, did appear slightly like you were watching a cartoon in bits but there were some very creative executions. I'm not giving examples . . . watch it! Watch this if you're: a Stallone fan, Rambo fan, into action, gore and I mean gore, and violence, strong bloody violence! If you don't like these things, don't watch it! Rambo, although clichéd, has still got it but think before you watch but judge it for yourself. Not everyone is right, even me!
8.0~New Levels of Bloodshed Explored. gautamajovi_95 Sign in Permalink John Rambo returns after years and you know what, other than some facial lines and dark circles, this man is as fit as ever. Sly looks like a brick wall in this film. I've never seen him so angry and I've never seen him so alone. The subtle emotion of his character is powered by a sudden eruption of anger and flashbacks, something which we see throughout the film. He really acted well in this movie. Sly's work doesn't end with just the acting, he's back as writer and director of this film. His direction abilities are shown just by just observing the other actors and his writing is, as usual, amazing. The "talking-bits" are minimal in the film and the soundtrack consists of good melodious pieces and not just gunfire. The violence in this film is raw and brutal, something I've never seen before. The body count is colossal. Limbs and heads fall off bodies almost every minute of the film. Like most Rambo films, Rambo has something personal, this time, a woman. This relationship isn't one of romance but maybe one of self-understanding. Rambo 4. John Rambo. The Killing Machine is back. One of the best action films ever!
10.0~The best action movie in over a decade Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink I remember the first time that I saw First Blood, I thought it was going to be a typical silly action movie, but it turned into one of the best action movies I had seen. I remember hearing about the Rambo sequel which was at the time titled "John Rambo" with "Rocky Balboa", I saw Rocky and was very disappointed, so I was assuming the same was going to be with Rambo. But after some promising reviews, I went ahead and saw it today and this is seriously the best action movie in years. I couldn't believe how incredible this movie was, it was brutal, terrifying, but had a great story. Sylvester Stallone still has it, and is incredible, I can't believe how great he looked and how he still hasn't lost his edge. The reason why this movie worked is because I think he really understands John Rambo, this movie could have never worked without his touch. John Rambo lives in Vietnam as a guide of the river, he makes a living collecting snakes for a sport for the villagers. There is a huge war going on, a civil war, where the Vietnamese are brutally killing villagers if not taking their boys and making them into soldiers, and violently raping their women. When a peace group who is convinced that they will change everyone's ways asks John to bring them into the war, they go into more than they expected when they are captured. John has to go back into action to save their lives and bring them back home safely. Rambo is seriously the best film that I have seen so far in 2008, the only thing that was disturbing to me is that the civil war is not far from the truth at all and how brutal it was, but it was nice to have a good guy to root for and have hope that some people can regain their faith in the goodness in people. I was thinking today how weird it is, this is a genuine action movie, the one people have been waiting for years to have, and it took the old school to bring back that exciting feeling. I highly recommend Rambo, believe me, this is an excellent movie and I can't wait to have it on video. Sylvester is back and he's better than ever, Rambo is still awesome and so much fun to watch. 10/10
9.0~Great great movie juventusturin2002-1 Sign in Permalink Next time a movie comes out, I won't read the critics, they are spoilers!!!!!! Anyways RAMBO was just one heck of a movie, being a Rambo fan and owner of the Rambo DVD collection I must say this should be put on DVD as soon as possible and added. The action was great, non stop, very simple story line and meaningful catchy phrases. I must say Sly looks great at 62, and his acting and directing job was just excellent. A lot of people thought this would be a bust but, HELL NO, RAMBO PROVED YOU WRONG. I hope more sequels like this come and I really hope a Rambo V doesn't come out, IV is enough. Long Live RAMBO
5.0~Not a great end to a fantastic series... markymark70 Sign in Permalink Where do I start with Rambo ? Let's start at the beginning. When I first saw First Blood in 1982, I thought it was one of the best films I ever witnessed. Not much has changed since then and my opinion of that movie still holds strong today as it did then. Great story, good action and good, solid acting too. Stallone, Dennehy and Crenna based the film superbly. As for Rambo: First Blood Part II - I was 15 at the time and completely bought into the hype and was washed away by Stallone's seemingly un-put-outable shining star. He was at the height of his powers - Rocky, Rambo, even Cobra brought in the money in the millions. Rambo III started the downfall. Although not a bad film overall, the whole military pull out of Afghanistan by the Russiona troops 10 days before the film opened in the cinemas, cut its box office takings badly. And now we have a barely 75 minute long film to finish the series. John Rambo is one of the most recognised movie characters of all time and for that Stallone has to be commended. After all, he did co-write the first film's screenplay also. But for me, this was a film too far - or if not a film too far, then a poor film too far. After last year's great success with Rocky Balboa - Stallone revisits his other iconic character for one last final hurrah. But where Balboa was an understated, sensible, even somewhat thought-provoking film - Rambo is none of those things. And that is a pity. First Blood was all that - trying hard to deal with a man's isolation and non-acceptance into a country which he had fought hard for. His unit were all killed -one way or another- in 'Nam and even though he was in charge of millions of dollars worth of equipment in the war - he cannot hold down a job washing cars back in the U.S. Rambo - the film - just has no real heart to it. In the original, John Rambo kills no-one. The one kill attributed to him was really an accident. But now, in his own words - "killing is as easy as breathing". And the more graphic the kill, the better apparently. Heads exploding, bodies literally cut in two from machine gun fire, limbs torn apart are just standard fare in this movie. I was a HUGE Rambo fan of the 80s and was delighted to see him make his return but the final film is just a mish-mash of sequels 2 and 3, set in a different geographical location with not one thing to drive the story of the character forward. Well, maybe one thing. The notion that Rambo "may have a father, somewhere". The end scene of Rambo is very reminiscent of the opening scene of First Blood and I am sure this is something Stallone wanted desperately to portray - but for me I reckon he is secretly disappointed by a film that could have been more brain but ultimately turned out a brawny exercise in killing. 5/10.
10.0~Return To Old School!!!! Few_are_chosen-1 Sign in Permalink It has taken many years of tireless boring repetitive action movies i.e. 007 movies (Which have completely gone off the rails)& of course Terminator 3, need i say more?. Rambo IV is something that basically needed to happen for the good of action movie fans, to the excess of blood & gusts, limbs flying and sheer brutality, Sylvester Stallone to me personally has been on a role lately with Rocky Balboa now Rambo IV. So i will give this movie 10/10 because it is enjoyable, bad ass and completely worth the money (Although being from the UK and having to go out of my way to see it as the Odeon would not show it). So please don't waste your money on other pieces of garbage i.e. Meet the Spartans and if Sly does intend to bring out a 5th instalment then i say bring it on!!!
2.0~The Mince ! elshikh4 Sign in Permalink Why to reuse, rather revitalize, Rambo after 20 years of its last movie ? It's easy. The name has fame, the star is still alive, and there is no new original writing right now in the first place! And when it comes to Stallone. Well, the man needed a hit too. Needed desperately a hit! But maybe there are some circumstances that made the character of John Rambo, not as a wounded soldier but as a killing machine, is so desired in 2008. Circumstances that can make Rambo not a relic from Vietnam's swamp of the 1970s, or Hollywood commercial take on it in the 1980s.. But a symbol of expatriation, new redemption and the necessity of war ! This movie, on so many levels, bothered me to the max. To begin with, it is downright action but poor and without a touch of singularity, being a small, so usual, B-movie about gorilla war and "let's-rescue-them-from-the-savages"; which was popular in the 1980s through dozens of movies like (Uncommon Valor), (Let's Get Harry), (Delta Force 2).. etc. Stallone, as an actor, was at his worst. Except the final scene, he delivered such a shaky performance between quivering features and sleepy face. The dialog sounded outwardly deep while it's really dumb. The climax was so weak. Stallone as the writer had to solve everything with one crazy cannon over a mountain. That briefed the battle to make it so close to the Rambo parody in one sequence of (Hot Shots 2)! Therefore you as a die-hard fan of Rambo, action, whatever.. must leave your seat unsatisfied. Deeper matters : the first Rambo was - supposedly - anti-war. OK. The next 2 movies were anti-America, some Asians and the Soviet Union through hell of a war every time! So, let's not be poetic in the wrong place, Rambo movies are war movies with no message but to entertain where the main entertainment comes from the equation of One Army vs. One Man Army. This round Rambo maybe discovered that he's a Made-in-USA monster (so Stallone refused ideas for this late sequel where, in one, Rambo is a diplomat working in the UN, having a wife and son). Being a monster could have made great drama. But unfortunately Stallone just utilized the side of "monster", with a message was that bold to be anti-peace! Rambo, at last, selected to come back to his home (why not from the start ?) so his wandering soul may find its salvation. YET after one unforgettable bloodbath I've never witnessed in a movie before! He fought not for victory but for the extermination, transforming into a walking genocide! Look at him at the end wiping up all of Burma's soldiers off the earth without even taking internees !?? He proved this time that being a mad ugly monster (aka : Rambo) is the only way to survive in this crazy world. But see who's making it this way! It's where Rambo can't be anything but an American war more than American hero, and a tool to make some box office money, not a character with any depths. So his coming back to home isn't his long-lost inner peace. The war has become that, as the "something" he would die for, and there is no "living" without it! Aside from disturbing moral, Stallone, with only $50 Million budget in his hand, must've thought what could be done to attract the new generation to his resurrected character and old so-80s hero? And he found the answer. It's not the philosophical dilemma or the great action. It's the Mince! The man went with his story to the rated-R limit, to make whatever he loves of gory ruptures, diffused torn-off limbs and inhuman violence (or inhuman movie-making!). I just can't forget the climactic scene in which Rambo fires his devilish cannon devilishly, killing - sorry.. literally shredding - the stereotyped enemies into hundreds of pieces (Body count : 236!!!), finishing off half of Hollywood extras along with my stomach ! This is sick. So sick. Not the cartoonish violence of the first 3 movies. This is rather the nightmare that John Rambo himself lived in Vietnam with his friend which he told in the end of part 1. So, as you see, Rambo's movie became as evil as war, and we - the poor viewers - got to be as psychologically complicated as him ! I hated this movie. It's bloody and horrible. Apparently that became the only way to make profits since there is no fine script or fine budget. And for your information, out of the $50 Million it came up with $47 million profits. That's, in Tinseltown, considered a flop. So, despite all the mince in the world : this was a bad come back, not a comeback! Finally, and burningly, "Live for nothing. Or die for something" ?? This can be perfect as recruitment propaganda catchline for bringing new American soldiers to fight in Iraq (yet another pointless dirty Vietnam where the real mince is being made). Otherwise, why not living for something as a change ?!
7.0~Brutally violent yet stunningly entertaining freaky_dave Sign in Permalink I had qualms about going to see the fourth Rambo movie, but through word of mouth I decided to go see it, and I was not disappointed. Rambo is one brutally graphic film whose second half made Saving Private Ryan's first half hour seem tame. BOdy parts explode and limbs fly. I can't believe it didn't get a NC17 rating, but with movies like Hostel and Saw still getting R ratings, I'm not surprised. JOhn Rambo now leads a tame life of catching snakes for a living not far from the Burma border where a ruthless military unit is murdering innocent people. Rambo stays uninvolved in all this until a group of Christian aid workers come to him to rent his boat to go into BUrma and help these innocent people who are being hunted and killed daily. At first he doesn't agree, but after the persistence of one of the Christian aid workers named Sarah Miller (Julie Benz), he takes them upstream and drops them off. Not long after, a man comes to him and asks for his help in saving these Christain workers who have been captured by the same ruthless infantry unit who has been killing the Burmese people for years. With the help of a group of mercenaries, Rambo makes his way back into Burma to rescue the workers. WHat follows is some of the most graphic violence I've seen in any Rambo movie. THe good point is that with this latest entry in the Rambo series, Stallone is not a one man killing machine. He has assistance, and this helped me to suspend any doubts I had about the movie. If they had made him a lone soldier who wipes out an entire infantry unit by himself, I would've scoffed at the ridiculousness of the film. Stallone did the right thing by making his character more human and less of an indestructible killing machine. I still had to suspend some disbelief, but with any action film you have to. THe story is basic. THere is no deeper meaning here other then how ruthless the world around us really is. If you can accept the basic storyline and take Rambo as the violent action film that it is, you will enjoy the movie. It is rather short at slightly over an hour and a half, so that also helps with the pace and makes up for some of the slower moments before the real action starts.
5.0~very improbable return antoniotierno Sign in Permalink A bigger Rambo, conceived for the new generation, more violent and brutal, but with a different spirit from the one of its predecessors. Stallone is less believable of course (he's more aged than 60 on the other hand..) and gives the impression of being focused too much on the past rather than on the future. In some respects the story and the scripts are even ridiculous but it's exactly what the audience expected it to be, after so many years of waiting. Moreover Rambo's reinvention could have been less full of prejudices against the Asians, but on the other hand biases were necessary for justifying such a bloodshed. Fortunately this one has been the last of the saga..
3.0~Stupid white kinghting pasany Sign in Permalink The whole movie revolves around a (pretty stupid) white chick. Everything happens because of her. She convinces Rambo (with some utter bs long talk) to give up his peaceful life for another suicide mission - even though he was quite unwilling to do that before. Than he goes back for more when the chick gets kidnapped (how predictable!), and does the whole usual Rambo thing - wrecking havoc, killing hundreds of men, getting almost killed - for this one girl. No higher morals, no riches, no nothing - just a "Thank you!" from a silly white girl! They don't even really care about the locals! At least this film has some pretty good action scenes. That HUGE fighting scene near the end compensated for my lost hour before that. But I still consider this a bad movie.
8.0~For those rambos fans.. brad12d3 Sign in Permalink I have been a Rambo fan for many years. In fact I have fond memories of building forts out of couch cushions as a kid while watching Rambo only to destroy them through wrestler type body slams. These movies always got me hyped up, and for good reason. They were balls to the wall hardcores military movies that were more about showing the incredible force that a single determined soldier could bring. Which was a an incredible action experience. However, make no mistake,... Rambo 4 is a different movie from the rest. This movie does not follow then same theme from the rest. It is in a universe all it's own. Yet it is just as good. It has a heart to it not seen in previous films. A main plot point is a Christian group going into a trecharous world that only a bold soul would venture to. Being a Christian myself I find the portrayal of the Christian missionaries very tasteful. Rambo will please the action fans looking for intense action. It is as hardcore as an r rating will allow. Rambo fans will not be disappointed with the action but will need to understand the new direction the rambo series has taken. It isn't like the others. The theme as changes, but the action is still taken up a notch.
8.0~A Great Finish! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink This movie takes place twenty years after the last Rambo and Sylvester Stallone still looks good at 62. This movie is probably the most action-packed of the the four films. There was hardly any drama but that's okay. I liked the action immensest. Rambo decides to live a quiet life in Thailand after his busy years. But, some Christian missionaries want him to take them up Burma where there is a civil war going on. He agrees and that may have been the last thing he wanted to do. I really enjoyed this movie. I had doubts because I thought Stallone has gotten old for these kind of movies. Well, it turned out he has not. He was also fantastic in the Expendables. Overall, this is a good finish to the Rambo series. I think it may have been the best one. I rate this film 8/10.
10.0~Outstanding predator72 Sign in Permalink Does it exactly what it sets out to do. After the overly long excesses of There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, this is short, sharp, sweet, and to the point. Stallone's directing is surprisingly good with a real talent for timing; in a proper cinema, the soundtrack and effects are just staggeringly good; there are killer one liners; and a well judged, balanced look at war and its effects - this is not simply an 'America is great' flick: there mercenaries are multinationals, there is not an American flag in sight, and Rambo is reticent in his role as the killing machine from hell. This just goes to show that you don't need to be an 'intellectual' or an incredible original 'indie' director (who has this idea that no one else seems to get but the world must see, involving 27 different plots, a tub of Vaseline, and sign language) to fashion a great film.
3.0~F the World ferguson-6 Sign in Permalink Greetings again from the darkness. John Rambo is back and he is as optimistic and jovial as ever! I realize no one has ever anticipated the next Rambo movie because they couldn't wait to see how the storyline developed, but COME ON ... he is a cobra hunter?? And the skipper of a boat that makes the one in "Apocalypse Now" look like a yacht?? And a blacksmith who forges his own propeller?? OK, those are the most believable parts of this story. After that, we are to believe a handful of god-fearing goody two-shoes are heading into the Burma war zone with only a couple of backpacks? And just to top it off, one of them is a bleached blonde who doesn't bother to chop off her shoulder length hair? Sorry ... the point of Rambo is violence, killing, explosives, etc. There are loads of these things. Sometimes we aren't even sure what is blowing up or why. Or who is dying and who is killing. Some L.A. critic claims to have an accurate body count. One thing is for sure, he doesn't have an accurate body PART count! There are limbs flying throughout most of the movie. If you are after blood and guts and explosions, this one will deliver. If just once, you would like to know why ... don't expect Stallone (actor, writer, director, producer) to let you know. What could have been the coolest part of the movie and a perfect ending is just left dangling for 4 minutes over the closing credits. Who would have been the perfect R. Rambo ... John Rambo's dad? Since he is roughly 60 yrs old, it would have to be a pretty old guy, so most of the best choices are already dead (John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Lloyd Bridges). The best one I could come up with is Hugh O'Brian ... macho, strong and silent. Sadly, we are cheated out of even that bit of fun.
6.0~Fabulously Violent, Hurt-me-Plenty Cinema gunstar_hero Sign in Permalink Before writing anything else, I cannot resist a small spoiler: Rambo ends with the greatest cinematic nosh-up this side of Saving Private Ryan, in which Stallone demonstrates that the best place to be in a firefight is behind a 20mm cannon. In fact, this 20-minute piece de resistance is so explosively violent (quite literally) that the rest of the film pales in comparison. I can't even recall what happened before. Something about missionaries? Trapped in Burma? Rescue team of ex-military hard men? Who cares, really? The Rambo franchise jettisoned the ethos of First Blood so long ago that nobody in Hollywood remembers what the point was. However unjustly, Rambo became fixed in the popular consciousness as an agent of mindless destruction and vengeance, and in the fourth instalment art has clearly imitated life, simultaneously setting a new bar for on-screen gore. In times gone by the measure of an action movie was in how many blood bags you could stuff under an actor's shirt. Rambo 4, surely, has instituted the era of dismemberment: so many CGI arms and legs and heads catapult off in every direction, followed by great torrents of blood, that the only apt comparison I can find is Japanese anime in its more bloodthirsty moments. Make no mistake, this is a trigger-happy, back-to-basics shooter in the vein of Arnie's Commando. Get your grandmother out of the room and tell your girlfriend to close her eyes. And for pity's sake, don't get on the wrong side of John Rambo.
7.0~Pleasing for the easily pleased matthews-burgess Sign in Permalink I think that for most of the people from this generation of blood thirsty video gamers, Rambo will be absolutely loved. For the rest of us though, its quite hard to follow and over the top most of the way through. Obviously its an action film and the special effects are great but the emotional bits are cheesy and all of the main characters are introduced too quickly because they were just trying to throw more dead bodies in. i just watched the film and i myself was fairly entertained by some of the extreme special effects but tend to prefer a movie with a little bit more dialogue and a little less heads flying in the air. My brother however, quite easily pleased by all of the action, thought it was the best film he'd ever seen so maybe it just wasn't for me. I gave it a 7 because it was OK, just never was going to be a great
10.0~My favourite RAMBO film, and one of the greatest action movies i've ever seen. mixta110 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie, especially on the big screen, I woulda given it a 10 rather than a 9, but i wanted to see more old style Rambo stealth kills, eg.. like the mud n water scenes, saying that however, I felt Stallone cut down a lot on the 80s cheese, yet still gave us an 80s looking film. (In a good way.) Also, the direction and camera work was great, the movie had elements of film graininess which was kinda nice to see in this all digital age. It felt more real and filmic. Rambo4 had an almost grind-house quality about it. Rambo of course isn't gonna sit well with everyone, blood thirsty, violent and minimal storyline, but for me, those were all pluses. Its not the kinda film you would take you're mother to for mothers day, nor is it the kind of film you would see if you were a Mark Kermod style film critique. But Rambo IS a balls out, macho FUN joyride, it made you despise the villains so much that you would wish horror upon them, and Rambo did not disappoint there neither! and it did actually point out a serious situation that is going on right now in the world. Unfortunately for the real Karen people of Burma, from what I saw in Rambo, the only real remedy for that actual situation, IS RAMBO, but unfortunately he is not real, so i guess that situation and many like it, will probably never get solved, but i feel the governments need to step up a gear. Finally, i just wanna thank Stallone for a valiant and refreshing sequel. The trailers for this movie alone had me giggling like a schoolgirl, and i was so hyped for this film. It didn't disappoint, but i will say, Stallone, if you got footage of some Stealth scenes or anything extra, i would buy an extended cut.
6.0~great, but not so great. patriotjme22 Sign in Permalink I went into this movie having high expectations and thinking i was going to see a really good action-adventure movie. It was pretty good, but what i didn't like, other than it barely being 80 minutes long (which i really hated, was the storyline being so short (mainly because movie was so short) and Rambo doesn't do much stealth/creative fighting except in just a couple scenes (i think just one, when they sneak into the camp/base). Like at the end, he just mans a huge artillery machine gun and just shoots. there is no using different weapons, or running, or crouching, or sniping (by Rambo), or hand to hand fighting. It was basically just lots of killing, way too short, and not very creative. But there were a few parts i really liked. So... overall it was pretty good but not long enough at all, nor very creative.
8.0~The unexpected fourth Rambo in the series is well made but also quite shocking. hu675 Sign in Permalink It's been 20 years that John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is been living in Northern Thailand as a snake handler. When a group of Christian missionaries (Led by Julie Benz and Paul Schulze) asks Rambo to bring them in Burma. Where the poor villagers both adults and children's have been brutally killed and raped by a ruthless Nationalist Army Soldiers control by Major Pa Tee Tint (Maung Maung Khin). When Rambo brings the aid workers in a longboat and returning back home. The aid workers have been kidnapped and some are viciously killed along with most of the villagers by Major Pa Tee Tint and his men. When Rambo heard the news, he been hired to bring professional mercenaries to rescue the Christian missionaries before they are killed. But these mercenaries are not as experience or good as to John J. Rambo. Directed by Sylvester Stallone (Rocky Balboa) made an intense action/adventure/thriller that is somewhat different to the original Rambo series. Which it was very popular action series in the 1980's. Stallone's character Rambo is closer to the spirit of the first film "First Blood" and some of the wild action sequences of the sequels. But this new Rambo is actually much more realistic towards the violence in this one, which is quite disturbing and tough to watch to be entertained at times. Even some of Die-Hard "Rambo" fans will be surprised at this. The two-disc set of "Rambo". DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 EX Surround Sound. DVD also included an interesting audio commentary by the director, seven featurettes, deleted scenes and previews. The second disc includes an digital copy of the movie but it didn't quite work in my computer sadly. If u enjoy special features, you should get the two-disc edition. If not, just get the single disc of the Widescreen edition. I was a bit disappointed, when i seen "Rambo" at the big screen at first. I thought the movie was way too violent to be enjoyed. But i felt the movie played better during the second viewing. But the script by Stallone and Art Monterastelli (Buried Alive, The Hunted) have its problems at times. While the pacing of the feature is fast, it feels too short as well. Especially when the movie plays for 80 minutes and then over 11 minutes worth of end credits. I was glad Stallone kept his character quiet most of the time and he's also quite good at staging action sequences. There's a few silly stuff to be sure, when it's intentional or not but Rambo character certainly aged well over the years. Certainly film-making has changed over the years, the look of the movie is very different from the previous three. There's some obviously CGI Blood and Guts. But Stallone as a co-writer/actor and filmmaker kept the film moving. B-Movie Screenwriter Kevin Bernhardt was also one of the writers of this feature but he's not credited. Music Composer Brian Tyler (AVPR:Alien vs Predator:Requiem, Bubba Ho-Tep, Frality) does an fine score here and as well giving tribute to the late Oscar-Winning Composer:Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Gremlins, The Omen). Which Goldsmith did the music of the original movies. This new "Rambo" is not for the squeamish. Super 35. (*** 1/2 out of *****).
10.0~No filler - a pure joy! sim_roberts Sign in Permalink If you're old enough to remember the Rambo films of the 80's this will give you a warm nostalgic inner glow. But it's much more violent and visceral than the old films. It's fantastic (in every sense of that word) - best action movie and best comedy of the year. The film establishes that the baddies are REALLY bad early - so bad that they deserve to be killed in gruesome ways - that's where Rambo comes in. No time wasted devising plans - a short scene establishing what sort of characters he is taking along for the ride (a grizzly ex-SAS guy and a friendly young sniper) then straight to the action - body parts flying everywhere - and you, the audience cheering Rambo along (in spite of yourself) while he turns the baddies into lunch-meat. Nice!
6.0~Pretty much another Rambo 2. CousinBagunca Sign in Permalink Plot (5 out of 10): Generic action movie that stars John Rambo. Thrill (6 out of 10): Although sometimes you are anxious towards what might happen, Rambo's persona pretty much settles down the anxiety once you remember he's pretty much unstoppable. Entertainment (7 out of 10): Brainless, but that's all we want on a Rambo movie, right? Soundtrack (5 out of 10): Meh. Special Effects (6 out of 10): Some weird CGI blood effects here and there. Final Score: 5.8 (6). Summary: Just another Rambo movie. They try to put some drama in the scene, throwing in some humanity stuff, but you don't care. Most of the time, you're just waiting for the slaughterfest and, at the end, that's pretty much what this movie is.
8.0~Rambo's back on the real violent sly- Live for nothing' or die for somethin' PeterMitchell-506-564364 Sign in Permalink Stallone has created full on action masterpiece. The bloodiest of the Rambo's, I like this one the best. It doesn't hold back to on the explosions, violence, including children that's running rampant in Burma, where limbs, ligaments and torsos go flying in an insane slaughter. Now a snake hunter who tells his boss to F off, as coming back with a less than adequate quota, this reminds us, Rambo hasn't changed one bit, although he's not as fast as he used to be, and his face has fattened up. Again his peace and tranquility is invaded when a Christian aid group, requests, he lead them into Burma (big mistake) to rescue the people, kids and adults who are being tortured, killed, and kept slaves by the merciless Burmaneese. One troupe of hot Asian girls put on strip shows, for these Burmeese scum, while being groped and having stuff thrown at em'. Note: If you aren't strong stomached, avoid this one, as it makes the other Rambo's look like kid's flicks. Rambo who first declines, takes them down river, where they run into a bit of trouble, but it's nothing our boy Rambo can't handle. Later Rambo gets word, that they haven't been heard from. So he, and an enlisted bunch of mercenaries, set out to find them, their head honcho, a British guy, and Rambo, first getting off on the wrong foot. One fantastic line later on, where the British guy declines the mission, and Rambo has to set him straight, should go down as one of those legendary lines in the history books of cinema. We see how nasty these Burmaneese people are, one baddie, who likes to take little boys into his quarters and have sex with him. His death by Rambo, the last brutal scene, is memorable, as he cuts the baddie wide open with a machete. Talk about taking a gut full, the trademark scene of violence in this. It'd be great not to have any more Rambo's as this is a great one to finish on. Even perfect. We even see Rambo revisit his home, a farm property, in a long duration of end credits. Truly masterful filmmaking from our masterful Sly, in a role, no other actor could fit into.
10.0~That's what I'm talking about! konya-s Sign in Permalink Rambo would punch the hell out of Bourne. And I love Bourne! I mean the Bourne movies are great, but something's always bothered me. The rating system! PG-13 for an action movie? Come on! Back to the eighties and see the action movies like Cobra, Rambo-movies, and Schwarzenegger's classic the Commando. Those are awesome flicks! Now, in 2008 new century etc. Stallone is now 61 years old, and honestly I didn't believe in him when I first heard about that fourth Rambo-movie. I was worried I can tell you. But one day - when they put the first footage of the trailer on the internet - something of a miracle happened! I was amazed when I saw the footage! And I mean it! I almost fell off the chair, my jaw was on the ground. Now let's talk about the movie! As many people said before me this movie is not for the squeamish and definitely not for the faint of heart. Brutal with capital 'B'! The violence is on the top, and Rambo is meaner and angrier than ever. When he's killing, he's KILLING! As the tag line said: "When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing." That's not just another "The tag line is great and that's gonna sell the movie"-type of line. Sly raise the bar with the action scenes in the movie, in the third act everyone goes nuts, all hell breaks loose, and that's good! I am happy! Sly is back after all those crappy movies like the Driven. He's back...With a vengeance!
4.0~This could have been a good TRAILER for the movie Rambo clubber2k Sign in Permalink Making a sequel is not an easy thing to do and maybe as a stand alone this could have been an o.k. movie. but facing the previous movies done even so long ago, this one surly doesn't have what it takes. 62 year old silvester stalon still gives a good show but it seems as he started out to be a good movie he latter set out to take an afternoon nap. I'm not sure on what did they spend the 50 million budget since this movie doesn't even come close to some of the action combination scene in previews movies. I can't help but wonder where are the plot twists gone, why didn't I worry for any lives ? and where oh where is the standoff between an apache fighter helicopter an old Russian tank and maybe an unarmed stalon ?? the only plus which I hope to see in future genre movies is the real-like ultra violent death scenes. you just have to see it to believe it. its not gore, its just freakin realistic. You can watch this movie, and even enjoy it .. or you can watch one of the previous ones as well .. time is money.
10.0~Amazing Movie! bestrob263 Sign in Permalink I just came back from seeing Rambo and I am honestly speechless. This movie completely lives up to its hype and has some of the most amazing action scenes I've ever seen in my life. I don't care what people say about his age, Sylvester Stallone did an amazing job acting and directing this movie. In fact, I think he did a better job now then in the previous movies. You will love every part of Rambo in this one; his voice, his little emotion, the only one being anger, his very few diologue. Rambo is not for everyone though. Before seeing it just realize this movie has basically no plot whatsoever, just complete killing and you will see why this movie was almost NC-17. I highly recommend this movie to any action fan and am giving it a 10 out of 10.
3.0~As intelligent as Bush dan-frederiksen Sign in Permalink I was quite disappointed to see that it was not a movie of 2008 where the dirty secrets of our past has become common knowledge through the enlightenment of the internet but rather low brow from the Bush school of 'thought'. Christian missionaries are portrayed as foolish helpless people who desperately need Rambo's brilliance to tell them what to do as we all know that all problems of the world are obviously solved through massive destruction. anything else is simple nonsense. It's dreadfully stupid in a time where that kind of thinking has so clearly demonstrated itself to be poor. The satanists/republicans no doubt greatly appreciate his effort though as it fans the flames of the stupid. the subtitle could well be 'support the troops'
2.0~Last Blood? McFrogg Sign in Permalink "Rambo" is the fourth movie in the series of violent action films starring Sylvester Stallone as the Vietnam Vet John Rambo. It's a more "realistic" movie than the ones from the 80s. It's less cartoonish and cheesy. Sylvester Stallone even keeps his shirt on. Sadly, the extreme and sadistic violence drags it down. Heads explode, people are eaten by pigs, women and children are raped. And in one of the most disturbing scenes, a Burmese soldier grabs a baby out of the arms of the mother and throws him into a burning hut. The good thing about this movie is its religious themes, and that it deals with the persecution of Christians in Burma. But it feels exploitative...the sadistic violence against those people is only there so the audience can cheer when Rambo massacres the badguys in the most gruesome ways possible. I remember some people cheered and clapped their hands when the sniper took one soldier's head off. I'm not saying that it's always wrong to go to war or act in self defense. I'm not even against capital punishment for the most dangerous people. But killing is a serious matter. It shouldn't be fun. We shouldn't enjoy seeing people get killed... This movie should just have been a drama movie, like Gran Torino. Imagine if people went into this movie, expecting a violent Rambo movie, and got the exact opposite instead. A thoughtful movie about war and faith. Maybe Rambo 5 will get it right?
10.0~Blood, Guts, Rambo tarimenel Sign in Permalink I saw this movie last week and was shocked by the graphic violence (highly realistic, no holds barred, vital to proving the point) and impressed by the story line. Overall I think it an excellent movie simply because it does portray what battle is really like and pits two ideologies against each other with a clear winner at the end. Stallone also has placed focus on the 60-year-old problem in Burma, and he has woven all these things together in an elegant, understated manner. The mercenaries are shown as rather inept in the beginning and (to me) provide a bit of comedic relief. This movie is extremely intense and is not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached, but totally worth seeing on a big screen with surround sound. I suspect it will not translate as well on anything smaller.
1.0~Dreadful grezza_2004 Sign in Permalink Due to one of my friends being a Rambo fanatic, I agreed to go and see Rambo despite not having seen the first 3. I didn't have any high expectations, but what I was expecting was an enjoyable fast paced action film. What I got was a boring, repetitive, ridiculous, gratuitous mess, that has clearly been made to make its ageing star as much pension money as possible before he can't do these mad stunts, with no emphasis on even a hint of quality. There are many reasons why I thought Rambo to be so bad. The acting is dreadful, most of the cast are just annoying (especially that bald commando guy, who deems it necessary to swear at least 4 times per sentence) and the plot doesn't make much sense. For instance, when the Christians first approach Rambo, he refuses to help them and it is made clear he has absolutely no interest in doing so. Then enters the entirely bland and unconvincing Julie Benz, and it takes her about 30 seconds of dialogue for her to convince him. My main argument may sound quite bizarre, but it is the violence that makes Rambo stand out as a poor film. I was obviously expecting a lot, but here it is way over the top, very repetitive and horribly gratuitous. It is of those films where the makers just put as much violence in as possible to appeal to 'action' fans, just because they can't think of anything new, and want to show off how many ways they can viciously slaughter random characters. 230 odd people die in the film, and about 150 are in the last 10 minutes, and it gets incredibly boring. Stallone is the only actor to come out the other side with any credibility, basically because Rambo is the quietest character. *SPOILER* He is also the only character we really know anything about - the rest of the character's development really is non-existent. For instance, at the end when Julie Benz's character and her boyfriend (supposedly) get back together, a load of epic music is blasted at you, as if you care. How can we care? The guy only has about 3 lines in the entire film, and they're only brought about when the Burmese psychopaths are attacking them. *END OF SPOILER* I honestly can't believe this film still has a rating of nearly 8. It really is awful, unrealistic and gratuitously horrible. I don't mind violent films if the violence is justified (e.g. Oldboy), but don't just bombard us with violence to try and cover up how inept your actors are. A lot of reviewers on IMDb have said things like "The re-birth of old action films!" Well, if this is like an old action film, thank god someone thought to make new ones.
5.0~Action, Blood, Death, and more Action philsmith2222 Sign in Permalink If you can get past the crappy story and three pages of horrible dialogue you will get to see some serious carnage. Rambo has done it again with over the top yet completely satisfying deaths. If action movies are you thing this film is for you. Rambo is still walking the same silent bad ass path answering questions with questions or one word answers. All of the supporting roles seemed like cheap Chinese toys that eventually get moved into the garage never to be seen again. But honestly, do we even care about any of that. What you really want in this movie there is plenty of. If your in the mood to see hundreds of people die horrible bloody deaths then Rambo will get the job done for you.
8.0~Excellent, Go see it sexplstols Sign in Permalink Just come back from seeing it & was very surprised at how good this movie was. I ignored all bad reviews & persuaded my woman to come along. How glad i was, what an excellent movie this is. A bit of advice, IGNORE ALL BAD REVIEWS. Stallone looks as fit as ever, i hope i can run around like that when i am his age. Well done to the bloke he has done a great job on this movie & the effects are unreal on the blood n guts. The main special effects which was an astounding piece of work was the big explosion, absolutely awesome! Go and see it!
3.0~Dreadful action film Buddy-51 Sign in Permalink There's something inherently distasteful about taking a real-life tragedy - the genocide in Burma - and using it as fodder for yet another fantasy-fueled "Rambo" movie. After a 18-year hiatus, Sylvester Stallone returns to one of his two signature roles (the other, of course, being Rocky) - that of Vietnam War vet, John Rambo, the world-weary and cynical reluctant warrior who, in this installment, is hired to lead a group of mercenaries into Burma to rescue some American missionaries being held captive there. Rambo may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, but he is certainly capable of wiping out a whole cadre of Burmese soldiers all by his lonesome. The poor people being systematically slaughtered under that regime will, I'm sure, be relieved to hear he's on his way. Despite a terrifically high body count and endless footage of stomach-churning carnage, it's amazing just how utterly dull an action movie "Rambo" turns out to be. Stallone, as always, mumbles and grunts his way through his part, which, considering the laughably pretentious dialogue assigned to him (especially in "reflective" voice-over narration), is probably the wisest choice he could have made under the circumstances. Graham McTavish displays some fire in the belly as a belligerent mercenary, but he's the only one on either side of the camera who seems to be putting any real effort into the movie.
7.0~Ropey CGI, questionable acting and plenty of gore - Rambo is an entertaining 80s throwback SharkByteAudioProductions Sign in Permalink As a kid I loved First Blood Part 2 and with Last Blood coming out this year, I thought I'd give this entry a go in the franchise since it missed it first time round. While the action set pieces aren't as good as First Blood Part 2, Rambo definitely has its entertaining merits in that it's very gory and the kill count is high. It's only 90 minutes long and doesn't feature much continuity to the older films. Granted the excessive nature of this film might out casual viewers off, especially with the amount of gore and brutality shown here and it's used to dehumanise the antagonistic forces Rambo is up against. It's easily the most violent and excessive entry in the Rambo franchise yet and it does make you question the entertainment of some sequences. It looks and sounds like an 80s action movie, which is fun, but the choreography and camera shot composition doesn't hold up to action movies such as John Wick that feature continuously shot scenes. However, you probably won't care as limbs and buckets of blood scatter scenes. It's nothing special, it's an unnecessary sequel but it's fun if you love old school violent action movies.
9.0~A masterpiece sveknu Sign in Permalink Thank you, Sylvester Stallone. Thank you, for keeping the action genre alive. In a time where most of the more action packed movies are taken over by CGI, shaky camera, girlie-men, sissy boys and in general total boredom and lack of anything positive, it's a great relief that at least one guy is faithful to the genre. Rambo is a gritty, tough, brutal and quite hardcore piece of action movie that gives the fans what they've been waiting for. It good vs. evil. It's MEN. It's guns. It's explosions. It's gore. It's bad guys getting massacred in huge numbers. It's the return of the real action movie. It's a masterpiece. Very few people could pull this off in the times we live in. But Sly could! Thank you, Sylvester Stallone.
6.0~Live for nothing, die for somethingRambo jaredmobarak Sign in Permalink In what must be the most awkward sequencing of titles for a film franchise, the fourth installment, titled as though it was the firstRambo, shows the side of the character that I was expecting while watching the first film. We get John Rambo in all his Green Beret glory, taking no prisoners and killing all in his wake; quite the departure from his introduction as a misguided ex-pat pushed too far into exploiting the bigotry and weakness of a local sheriff and his deputies. I guess having a faceless enemy in Asia helps aid in his lack of humanity. We don't get any background on the Burmese people or general leading the charge. They are the bad guys and Rambo and his mercenaries are the good. I guess life is easier and a whole lot more brutal when it is so starkly black and white. The film is entertaining and surprisingly well put together, however, where the taut thrills and emotional/philosophical battles in Rambo's head brought some depth to First Blood, the carnage and mostly silent soundtrackbesides the explosions and gunshotsof this new creation bring the adrenaline level to a boil if leaving any semblance of story way behind at the ten minute mark. I think that Sylvester Stallone may speak fewer words here per minute than Arnold Schwarzenegger did in Terminator 2. His "thousand yard stare" is prevalent throughout and, while comical at times, delivers on its meaning. Here is a man beaten and done with America and all the hypocrisy of letting their people fight for freedom yet share in none of it upon their return. He has found his way back to the jungles of his rebirth as a killing machine, living a quiet life in Thailand, hunting snakes and ferrying people up the river. When a group of missionary aid doctors arrive, looking for transportation into Burma, he reluctantly acquiesces to their request. Only when those men, and woman, are captured does he feel the burn for blood and revenge. He doesn't go back with the mercenaries hired to find them for complete bloodlust, though; he goes back because despite his warnings, these aid workers went into the chaos to help. They decided to live their lives with meaning, despite the consequences, and that dedication woke the sleeping giant inside of him. Stallone is actually quite good, albeit a far cry from his debut in the role over two decades ago. He has the conflicted silent face down pat and the anger brewing inside perfectly released when necessary. As far as his writing goes, there isn't all that much to the film besides finding a reason to go into Burma and take out some genocidal maniacs. Directing-wise is where the surprise came. How much credit goes to him and how much to his DP I don't know, but the display of brutality is handled well through extreme close-ups and realistic dismemberment. He never shies away from showing off blood and guts, which at first was appropriate, then later a bit excessive. To show one or two heads explode is OK, when they keep coming, you start to get bored and realize he is doing it to cover up the lack of plot. The effects are totally just used to pad the runtime, but for what it's worth, they do their job. As for the supporting cast, we are given a lot of people in very small roles. Unlike First Blood, where we got a couple characters that were fleshed out fully and allowed us to either like or hate them, these people here are mostly just pawns used in the game. Julie Benz is actually not that good as Sarah, one of the missionaries. When we first see her she has a look of fear and shyness, not quite in her element while her boyfriend asks Rambo for help. However, when he is turned down, she all of a sudden takes control and works her feminine charm to gain his services. So, maybe it wasn't her fault as an actress, but Stallone's as a director. Whichever the case, her character just didn't know exactly what it wanted to be. On the other hand, "24" regular Paul Schulze is great as the leader of the aid workers. He plays the prick well and as the film goes along, his evolution as a person is accurately portrayed. The mercenaries have their charms also. Tim Kang is a favorite of mine from his multiple commercials and it's good to see him in a feature film while Matthew Marsden as Schoolboy is great playing the one gun for hire that has some morals and does it for more than just the money. Whether not seeing the two entries that are sandwiched between First Blood and Rambo helped or hindered my enjoyment, I find the two films very nice companion pieces. We are first shown Rambo as a man trying to assimilate back into society and have compassion for his fellow man while also knowing he must get to them before they take him down. But then, with this new film, we get to see what it was that made him into who he is, the skills and ability to take down an entire army on his own. John Rambo is the consummate badass and Stallone shows that even with age, that stigma can come across and still not feel completely out of place.
10.0~Possibly the best work of Mr. Stallones career Blekkhart Sign in Permalink I have watched this movie many times and had a chance to evaluate every part of it...the story, acting, directing, cinematography, soundtrack. And I have concluded that this movie is quite possibly the best movie of Mr. Stallones career, and without a doubt one of the best and most intense action movies of all times. It just gets better and better every time you watch it. This movie will grow into legend and live on long after its release, much like Predator. The return of Rambo, 20 years after the unfairly ridiculed third installment (a highly underrated action movie), seemed impossible. Sylvester Stallone was already way past 60. The Rambo franchise was by many considered totally political incorrect, out of date and cheesy. I guess even the fans must have been worried if Sly could really pull it off. But not only did he pull it off, Sylvester Stallone created a legendary action movie that has reached new levels of intensity and grittiness. Something never seen before. It even comes with a political and philosophical message, focusing on the situation in Burma and dealing with pacifism. Sly co-wrote it, starred in it and directed it. This is his baby. But he did get a lot of good help from all the people involved. They have all done a superb job...Brian Tylers beautiful and haunting movie score is very important to the atmosphere of the movie, all the actors are perfectly casted and play their roles well...my favourites being the team of mercenaries. The filming, editing, locations...I can't see how this movie could have been much better. And the final battle scene is beyond intense. It's crazy. Most of the criticism against the movie seems to focus on the violence. Yes, this movie is terribly violent and gory. The necessity of such a level of violence should be open for discussion. Is it speculative or necessary to give a realistic depiction of the themes involved ? Personally I imagine this movie might be a fairly accurate portrayal of genocide, massacre and the horrors of war. Most of it didn't seem out of place to me. But I can understand that many have reacted to it. But it can't take away from the fact that this movie is a brilliant piece of filmmaking and possibly the most intense and gritty action movie of all times. If you are an action fan, you have probably watched it many times already. If you haven't, what are you waiting for ? Full respect to Mr. Sylvester Stallone for a remarkable achievement.
1.0~One of the worst films I have ever seen Eggy499 Sign in Permalink This film is an eyesore. The only thing that this film has is buckets upon buckets of blood and guts and guns. Stallone has a very "Black Bear" approach to acting in this, usually struggling to deliver his lines through the botox, and so they come out as enigmatic grunts. The story and the characters are all shallow, including Rambo himself, and I think that the mercenaries Rambo meets later on in the movie were too stupid to give themselves names. Lets see now....... there is Rambo...and then there's Sarah.. and that's all the names that we get. The country of Burma is so stereotyped that they could have just went out to the Everglades in Florida, put up some paddy fields and hey presto! they have a Burma which is as shallow as the pools that the rice grows in. Many other action films even have characters and story lines, such as Die Hard or even perhaps I am Legend, but Rambo has a pure bulk of it devoted to the most sickening gore that is well across the fine line that separates fun, adrenaline-packed gore and sickening, gritty gore. All that seems to be thrown at the audience is a few (grunted) swear words, clichés or severed heads. I know that the bad guys are very shady and linear, but the way they are killed is perhaps even more deranged than, let's say, The Hostel. Whereas Bruce Willis is superb in Die Hard, I think Rambo falls well short at the first gory kill, and then it all just goes downhill from there. All of the film was made, written and directed by, it seems, a gib-thirsty fifteen-year old, who plays Doom 3 a little too much. In some films, the gore is evenly divided so that it can co-exist with the story, whereas in Rambo, the gore far outweighs the paltry story and is purely sickening. Men blown to pieces... Bad guys blown to pieces....good guys blown to pieces.....innocents blown to pieces... bad guys decapitated..... and when the shallow characters die, you do not feel remorse for them, even though this TRIES to force you.... The ending sucked, Stallone sucked, the gore was relentless (and anyone who says "well that is war" is stupid. Rambo is not war, because it blows it's buckles, and besides..war has stories and characters and heroes, whereas Rambo is a puffy-faced botox bear who is more of a butcher than a hero) and far too over-the-top to watch more than three minutes of and no people, do not take creed to those who say that this film is great, because it just ISN'T! 1/10
7.0~Peep This Reviews newblu Sign in Permalink John Rambo is an interesting and iconic film character. My first association with Rambo (which was the second & third movies, video games, cartoons, action figures, etc.) was as an over the top one man army in a foreign country winning unbeatable wars and saving American hostages. Then I saw "First Blood"....It's a gritty and realistic thriller on US soil. Yes, he's a one man army but he's going against a local police department that doesn't want a returning soldier in their town. It really surprised me the first time I saw it and remains a gripping action classic, plus it contains Stallone's best dramatic scene he's ever done. So I just wrote a paragraph about a movie that's not even on this list. My point is that he seemed to be a different person in each movie. And then for many years I forgot about those movies. Then this 4th installment seemingly arrived out of the blue. And just wow...this is probably the most graphically violent movie I've ever seen. Rambo seems to be a broken version of the cartoon character he had become. This is a most welcomed return to form. The horrors of war are seen on multiple levels and from various points of view. It is a brutally beautiful film, it has the perfect blend of some of the over the top violence these films are known for and the gritty realistic aspects that it originated in. (Spoiler: in the novel that "First Blood" was based on Rambo dies). From a technical stand point many would argue that this is not the best Rambo movie, but they would be wrong. For a character who was suppose to die this is the best alternative way to conclude his story.
7.0~Makes "First Blood" look like "Candyland". The_Centurion Sign in Permalink The best action movie I've seen in years! Sylvester Stallone makes a triumphant return to the series that transformed him into an action icon. If this is the swan song for John Rambo, Stallone made sure the ultimate badass went out with one hell of a bang. Story lines in action movies are generally where the genre comes up short, although "First Blood" set a standard there that lost its way in 2 and 3. "Rambo" features a simple and straight forward plot line, but it possessed enough of a soul to make you feel invested in its outcome. In fact, I actually felt myself slightly moved by some of the events that took place, and for a straight up action flick this is almost unheard of. Stallone managed to breath life into the characters, and I found myself pulling for each one of them by the movie's end. The one weakness of "Rambo", and the primary factor that kept me from considering this an extraordinary film, was in the screenplay. The writing wasn't overtly 'bad', but there were some moments that felt a bit too cliché. Other than that, I loved the story. Stallone went to great lengths to make you hate the bad guys. He pulled no punches in the portrayal of them committing heinous acts, and when turnabout has them getting (literally) torn apart by the good guys, it makes you almost want to stand up and cheer. The special effects in "Rambo" are amazing, but not for the squeamish. This is not the kind of movie to take your girlfriend to. Heads are flattened and limbs are torn off by Rambo and his sniper pal. You've been warned. However, if you're the type of person who thinks that bloody explosions are something wonderful to behold, you will be in awe of the action sequences in this movie. The message behind the film tracked with me as well, and I found that to be yet another unexpected plus. "Rambo" really is loaded with entertainment, and not just on the lowest visceral level. If you're looking for Shakespearean drama then you're turning over the wrong stone. If you want an orgasmic no-holds-barred action fest with a decent story to go along with it, "Rambo" is a definite can't-miss film!
9.0~Intense with more depth than you might think Wuchakk Sign in Permalink "Rambo" (2008) is the fourth installment in the Rambo franchise after "First Blood" (1982), "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985) and "Rambo III" (1988). I'm a huge fan of the first one, which I think is an action/adventure masterpiece, but the next two films are merely okay; although Sylvester Stallone never looked better and the locations are fabulous, the stories are too comic-booky and the characters are cardboard. There's very little depth. This third sequel makes up for all that because it's not cartooney at all and there's quite a bit of depth, albeit not much in dialogue form. THE STORY: John Rambo is alone & bitter and living hand-to-mouth in Thailand when a group of Christian missionaries enlist him to take them into Burma (aka Myanmar) to aid a village. Rambo discourages them in light of the political instability of the country, which includes heavy persecutions and mass slayings, but they insist on trying to help so he does it anyway. Weeks later he learns the missionaries have been taken captive so he goes back with a group of mercenaries to bring them out, if possible. "Rambo" combines elements of "Apocalypse Now," "The Killing Fields" and the first two Rambo films and is ultra-serious & intense from beginning to end, not to mention it's one of the most violent film ever made. The picture powerfully illustrates the best and worst in humanity. The Christian missionaries are willing to risk everything to help the villagers, whereas the Myanmar militarists revel in slaughtering scores of unarmed people for "fun;" they're also shown abusing/raping women and boys. Obviously they've given themselves wholly over to the darkside of their natures. Such reprobates are only worthy of one thing: Utter annihilation. Numerous important themes are addressed in the picture besides the main theme: -- Bitterness/despair and deliverance. The beginning of the film shows Rambo in a complete state of bitterness: He's just existing. He has no friends. He doesn't talk much and, when he does, it's very few words laced with expletives. The male leader of the missionaries is completely unable to talk him into helping them. Two Biblical proverbs state "a gentle answer turns away wrath" and "a gentle tongue can break a bone." The female missionary (Julie Benz) knows this and skillfully talks John into helping them. Yet there's more going on here. This woman with a heart of gold is Rambo's "golden connection" out of the horrible rut of bitterness. Despite his gruff exterior, she sees something in him, something in his eyes -- a good heart, even greatness, a genuine glimmer however faint. Is Rambo helping the missionaries or is she the one helping him? John instinctively realizes the rope she's throwing him and takes hold of it. There's nothing sensual about their relationship, despite her attractiveness; it's solely spiritual. She stirs in him the hope and faith he's been longing for. -- Violence is not always necessary. Although this is a very violent film it skillfully shows when pacifism is appropriate. Note the incident on Rambo's riverboat when the lead mercenary continuously insults John and tries to provoke him into a fight. Rambo completely ignores him, choosing not even say a word. In other words, he refuses to allow someone to victimize him and draw him into a conflict that has no positive purpose. It takes true strength to do this and Rambo has this strength. Indeed, John treats the guy as if he's a bothersome gnat. What do you do when a gnat bothers you? Do you break out a machine gun or merely ignore it? -- Total pacifism does not work. The New Testament does not support the idea of absolute pacifism. Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box with loads of money and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves and murderers. Also, Romans 13 clearly states the righteous laws of human governments are God-ordained for the purpose of punishing criminals, including the right to execute when appropriate. The vast majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists who refuse to be BALANCED with the Scriptures on this subject and insist that conflict and especially armed conflict is NEVER appropriate. The lead male missionary in the film is such a person, but perhaps he'll learn the error of his ways before the story ends. The simple fact is: Some people are so degenerate and evil that execution is the only just ultimate reaction (notice I said "ultimate"). -- The possibility of Rambo's spiritual rebirth ** SPOILER ALERT ** Although the first two sequels are cartooney they show Rambo searching for truth and flirting with religion and spirituality. In the second film he gets a Buddhist necklace off the Asian woman he befriends and at the beginning of "Rambo III" he is shown working at a Buddhist temple helping the priests; later, he meets and wins the hearts of moderate Islamic villagers and gives his Buddhist necklace to a Muslim boy who helped him. In "Rambo," as previously noted, the female missionary is key in John's positive transformation; at one point she gently asks him whether or not he has any family in the USA. He mumbles that he might have a father, he wasn't sure, and obviously didn't care. She later gives him a cross necklace for helping them (he wouldn't take money). Anyway, the end of the film shows Rambo back in America walking to his family ranch. Obviously John had a profoundly positive spiritual metamorphosis in the story. The precise nature and extent of this change is not known, unless there's (hopefully) a fifth film ** END SPOILER ** "Rambo" was written and directed by Stallone and filmed in Thailand. Personal Grade: A
7.0~Sly the main man. awpkiller2 Sign in Permalink I love Sylvester Stallone and his great. This movie is a great return of the hero John Rambo. The timing of this movie couldn't be better. Now the movie has delivered what everyone had expected and even more. Even the pickiest ones came out of the theater with a stupid smile on their faces. Sly kicked ass as usual and his performance never came short. The others were OK too. The action scenes where great, and Rambo did the killings like the way he always does, but he was even more brutal on the enemies this time. This movie is so far the best action movie in 2008. Let's sees what the future brings. There are many good action movies on the way this year. This movie is a must seen for all you Rambo lovers. God bless Rambo!:P
2.0~Same old plot with gorier killing scenes JAGUAR-5 Sign in Permalink It definitely was not in the same level as First Blood but at least it was somewhat of an improvement over Rambo 3. What about the plot? He Sly waits all these years, turns down good parts and comes up with yet another "let's rescue the Americans from an Asian country?!! They could certainly have thought of some slightly more original or at least not done to death. There's really hard to comment on this one: on one hand they did well on what they were trying to accomplish which seems to be the clichéd story line with awesomely action packed battle scenes. On the other hand there is not much else to recommend this flick. You were waiting for a repeat of the old stuff then I wouldn't miss it, but if you had been hoping for even the smallest improvement then you can wait for DVD or at least the second run theater showing of it.
9.0~Rambo's return draws more than just first blood, it draws box office power sharkattack1978 Sign in Permalink Anyone who thinks that Stallone is showing signs of ageing, you couldn't be more wrong. Just watch this Rambo film for example. Finally I got to watch it and I loved it. The story was thought provoking and has Rambo now retired from his tours of duty and living the life of a simple boatman on the rivers of Thailand. He also does a bit of side work providing snakes for daredevil in a Thailand betting house. He's living a relatively quiet life until he is asked to provide transport to dangerous Burma. Of course nothing goes to plan and a few are brutally murdered and Rambo knows what he must do to get back the ones still surviving and the one way he can do that is release his now dormant retribution side. Good to see that even though Stallone and Rambo have gotten older, the power they both have still burns deep. Stallone does a great job as both Rambo and Director, he capture the action sequences beautifully and keeps them fresh and exciting. Possibly after starring in the first three RAMBO movies he has obviously picked up tips from his fellow directors on how to make action scenes and war moments memorable and shocking. The action scenes are tightly done, Stallone captures exactly what he wants to put up there on the screen and displays it with plenty of firepower. There's explosions, plenty of gunfights, brutal violence and human drama which actually does shines through the violence. Stallone does exceptionally well in depicting the pure horror of Burma. These people are just pure evil. There were several times in this that I winced at some of the things that they did. They were truly vile and barbaric and I couldn't wait until Rambo got hold of them. Rambo shows no emotion during the fight scenes and that sums up the person who Rambo really is; a one man killing machine that executes with no mercy, just like how the Burma soldiers were with their pray. Well you know the old saying *What comes around, goes around* and that what Rambo gives them, a taste of their own medicine. There is also a nod in this towards the people idea that Rambo is old and worn-out when the Mercs who have been organised to rescue the workers see Rambo wanting to join in the fight and tell him to stay with this boat as they think he is a simple minded boatman, boy they couldn't be more wrong. Rambo shows them exactly what he is capable of in spades. Stallone's Rambo is backed up by some great performances from his carefully chosen cast. Julie Benz does a great job in her role as Sarah, a Christian aid worker who befriends Rambo to help them achieve their mission. Matthew Marsden is great as Schoolboy, a merc with a powerful sniper rifle (and I mean powerful) Graham McTavish as the lairy cockney SAS SGT who i felt give Londoners a bad name by the way that he treats Rambo. The extras were exceptional as the nasty Burmese soldiers. They depict the right amount of malice that the real soldiers still have in Burma and make you really hate them so much so we love it when they die for their horrible crimes. Everyone is going on about the violence in this movie. Yes it's is shocking because it's suppose to be, unlike other Hollywood films, the violence is depicted in it's rawest form to show you the viewer what horrors happen in that country. It's not sugar coated popcorn violence, it's real and thats how it is portrayed. During some scenes with the innocent townsfolk being tortured, raped and murdered by these Burmese soldiers did get me so enraged that i had my fists clenched so tight in anguish that my knuckles went bone white. They were just pure evil and i relished even ended up cheering when Rambo appeared and eliminated them in the only way he knows how....with extreme force. I didn't find the violence excessive like everyone says it is. Maybe I'm becoming desensitised to violence in movies as i have seen it many times. The violence in this film is necessary, Stallone wants the people of the world to see just what is going on over there right now as they sit in the cinema eating their popcorn. The violence and horrific acts are vile, vicious and vindictive so the violence that Rambo reciprocates back to them is entirely justified. Them soldiers deserved everything they got (and they got plenty). RAMBO also has some scenes reminiscent to the first two Rambo movies, the infiltration of the camp and the siege in the forest for example. Stallone takes every aspect of what of the fans love about the Rambo films and gives it fresh blood. RAMBO is a pure adrenaline thrill ride from beginning to end. It doesn't lag or get boring and the action is in your face and comes thick and fast. The only thing i didn't like about this film was it didn't seem very long and i felt sad when it ended. I think that Stallone still has a few more Rambos in him, although I'm not sure that he will be able to beat this one but i welcome another sequel. "Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet"
7.0~Best since the original?? Giuffra316 Sign in Permalink With a combination of grindhouse style gore and the sickening display of torture and war, Rambo is back and it's easy to lose your head in it. Goodness knows, half the cast did! Much more violent than the previous films, this movie takes violences beyond the necessary limits. However, due to the nature of the villains, you may not feel bad about the extents of the violence bestowed upon them. While the story steals a part of the story in Blood Diamond (and I do mean part of it, not all of it), the violence is turned up beyond measurement. If you like going to the movies to see how much violence you can stomach, then give this a shot. If you get sick from even the little blood, go see something else. I enjoyed this more than First Blood II and Rambo III and on the same level as First Blood. The difference is this is a simpler story with much more in the way of gore. Have fun!
9.0~Rambo, f@%$k yes! gonzoparkinson Sign in Permalink Great continuation of the John Rambo saga. He's older but still a bad MFer.
1.0~Ye Gads, what a Bad Movie! loufalce Sign in Permalink Rubbish! Yet another sequel by the king of sequels that takes place some 20 years after the last sequel{Rambo III} of this franchise. In this sequel, Rambo comes out yet again to help a group of do- gooders find some prisoners that are being held in a third-world hellhole. Violence, more violence and extremely graphic gore in a film that is so devoid of any substance it is pathetic. Films like this sequel and last years miserable Rocky Balboa sequel{you knew I was going to use this word again} show how far- or rather how little Stallone has come as an actor over the last 30 years. Lets face it people, this guy is just a two character actor. This really is an August movie that was released in January. These months are "dumping times" when Hollywood releases its worst of the worst. Amazing thing is that this seq...er film was shown to critics. So there you have it. If you saw Rambo 1, Rambo2, or Rambo 3, you already saw Rambo . Beyond bad, this film is insulting to anyone with an IQ of over 20. Thank me- I just saved you 8 bucks! Truly bottom of the barrel swill, there is absolutely no reason for you to see this movie.Films like this{and Rocky Balboa} give sequels their bad name. Stay away! Zero Stars.
6.0~Rambo Returns... fmarkland32 Sign in Permalink Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is working in the jungles of Thailand (?) catching poisonous snakes for a living, when he is asked to help lead a band of missionaries to a very dangerous hot spot, Rambo agrees to get them there and that's it, but when a preacher hires a group of mercenaries to rescue the missionaries, Rambo is asked to lead and so he becomes a one man army. (Again.) Despite what many will tell you, this is not as good as First Blood or Rambo:First Blood Part II. For one those movies are artifacts and proved classics of 80s action cinema. That being said Rambo is a case of delivering what is expected and for what it promises, it reasonably delivers. The biggest problem I had with the flick was that villains weren't given enough screen time and was quite dull. We learned little about what he wanted to accomplish, why he killed those in the villages and why he would kidnap American hostages. The villain has hardly any dialog and if he does speak it's of a foreign variety making the villain one-note, clichéd and overall pretty dull. Stallone however does work rather well in the role and despite his age, carries off the action quite convincingly. Indeed one would've liked to see more one-man army heroics from Sly then a group of mercenaries who add nothing to the plot and I would've liked to find out what happened to Col. Sam Trautman and much more. The action is typically well handled, except for the ending when the over-edited camera starts moving to fast or shaking to distract from the shooting. This is of course a shame because the action itself is decently staged enough to work on its own and needs to camera trickery. I personally hate that and wish they would stop doing that in action films. Once again Rambo isn't perfect but it is effective action fodder that is worth seeing once. Especially if you liked the first two. (Which I did) * *1/2 Out of 4-(Pretty Good)
7.0~Not bad but hardly fun at all gevalero Sign in Permalink Very different from all the other Rambo movies. While the other three are as cartoonish as can be, this one seems to be trying to educate on the horrors the people of Burma are going through more than anything else. This results in a rather depressive movie in which the last thing you'll be able to say is "I had fun". My favorite Rambo film so far is III. As grissly as some of the deaths were in it, the picture was full of hilarious lines and plenty of action. Halfway through IV one would like to ask Stallone to try smiling a little even though it would be completely out of tone with the picture he tried to make. All of this doesn't make such a bad a picture. It's just hard rooting for a hero who seems to be going through a (not so)middle-age depression.
10.0~Rated "R" for Rambo rnabessosu Sign in Permalink OH the Haustacity. Yes...I will say it again, HAUSTASTIC!!!! Rambo at his best...I don't care, he may be old, but crap man. This movie is awesome. Stallone definitely took a step towards the Mel Gibson approach in making it realistic. That is what a .50 caliber round does to a man. The genocide scenes are rough and graphic...definitely not for young audiences, but for everyone else. HAUSOME!!! The story is solid. It doesn't take long at all to get to the action. This is a must see for any person looking for some great action. Rated "R" for Ridiculous, rampaging, reoccurring Rambo
8.0~Rambo: The legend we've been waiting for faithnomore70 Sign in Permalink Where do I begin, with something that started when I was a kid?! Obviously, there's nostalgic reasons for wanting to see another Rambo movie, starring Sylvester Stallone, who has been an Icon before this franchise started...up until now. Even if his recent movies hasn't given him the credit that he actually deserves. Rambos job is to lead a group of Christians into the jungle with medical supplies, followed by a group of mercenaries. Rambo declines at first, because of him being a marked man due to traumatic episodes from the war. Suddenly all hell breaks loose, when they are being attacked by a group of soldiers. The story may not be fulfilling, but the action value is on a very high level. Stallone is more than 60 years old, but that doesn't really matter, cause Stallone doubled or should i say quadrilled, on the violent sequences of brutality. Even small children dies bleeding from their faces as they're getting stepped on...Innocents being killed when soldiers makes a sadistic sport out of land-mines. I was really surprised by the the giant explosion in the jungle which Rambo activates and then avoids the bomb before it triggers...I mean the range...and the pressure of heavy sound effect. I was blown away. Stallone remembered to make some references to the previous movies from the giant franchise...even the voice of Richard Crenna R.I.P. as colonel Trautman. This may be one of the few thing missing, because they had such great chemistry. The musical score is updated, but he made sure to keep a theme for Rambo. The score is very pounding, whenever the fight-sequences begin... Note: my primary objective is focused on the action, cause on the acting level, well..let's just say that it is not too much of a character description, we get in this one... and the team of mercenaries didn't seem like good actors......no..all hails for pure action from the old-school. I was so focused of having Rambo back in action, and I must admit, even if it lacks some dept, this movie makes up for it thanks to a great effort to make one of THE most violent action-movies of the year, without compromising
8.0~Great blood and guts killer movie... sandmanviper18 Sign in Permalink I don't think this movie is for the weak at heart for those who don't like bloody movies but everyone else this is Great. This has some awesome action scenes. If you want to see someone get blown apart by a big gun then this is the movie for you. Like any other movie you do have an occasional part that is slow or drags on but when the action starts don't blink because you won't want to miss any off it. There are some parts where you wish Rambo would have just hit someone but when he does get going you don't want to get in his way. This movie is definitely worth a look but you have to see this one on the big screen for optimal experience, trust me spend the money, don't wait till it comes out on DVD...
3.0~Rambo is a full throttle action movie. Blood, guts, graphic violence, Stallone shows it all! galileo3 Sign in Permalink Rambo (2008) Plot: Rambo kills everyone. If you have seen this film or are thinking about seeing it there are several things you should consider: 1. Am I a person who enjoys a vacuous 90 minutes of action? 2. Do I enjoy a film with virtually no storyline? 3. Do I like shallow characters, acts, moments, words in a film? 4. Do I enjoy graphic, bloody, intense violence? and most importantly... 5. Am I a dedicated Stallone/ Rambo fan? If the answer to all of those is yes or the answer to 5 is yes you will like the film. This is such a long way away from First Blood, a classic, raw action film, because Rambo IV is a far fetched, outrageous and even morally reprehensible film. However it is at times entertaining and it superficially covers and bases itself in parts of the world which are torn apart by violence and the film even manages to show (in limited and rushed areas) how war has skewed and demoralised John Rambo as a man. Anyway before I sound like an idiot for trying to provide a backbone to this film, let me remind you again... RAMBO KILLS EVERYONE Although this is easily a 1 or a 2 out of 10, I do give credit to Stallone for reintroducing one of his most famous screen characters and incorporating him into the 21st Century, other than that unfortunately, Rambo is pretty much a bunch of bullshit. 3/10
8.0~Great movie but... beckman81 Sign in Permalink First of all: John Rambo is kicking ass! Great action movie, the actors in supporting roles are fabulous and the story is fantastic. At last there is a movie about the political situation in Myanmar and the violent regime. The movie shows a big part of the reality without any "Hollywood-beautifying!. But: What a lame ending! Well, of course the final shootout in the jungle is what people expect from a new Rambo movie. But Mr. bad guy runs away, John Rambo waits behind the tree and then "bam" and done? therefore minus 1 star! And end titles that last 12 minutes and that's why the movie finally got 93 min. instead of 81 min.? that's a little bit poor, isn't it? so: minus 1 more star. But all in all surely one of the best action movies in 2008. Don't miss it!
8.0~An old and scary friend knocked at my door... tormentorclone-1 Sign in Permalink First, excuse me for my bad broken English... I loved the 80's and Rambo was one of the icons of my teen age so my expectations from this movie were very high and I was not disappointed. Stallone made a great work closing the circle of the story of this disturbed veteran. In "First Blood" we know that he became a drifter because he was unable to adapt himself to civilian life, maybe seeking for an answer: this is summarized when he is resting and having one of many nightmares of his past life... After the meeting with the minister he finds this answer: "You didn't kill for your country, you killed for yourself" , so, don't search a pretext for your problems in your fellow countrymen that never cheered you when you came back from the Nam, or an excuse for your killings in patriotism, you did it because you liked it, because you're a killing machine, so let's do what you are born for and leave the damn snakes live their life... Stallone made a beautiful work bringing back Rambo in the places where he belongs, a jungle in some south Asian forgotten country, I mean, f**k the damn boring desert and the annoying terrorists, Rambo is made for buldozering Vietnamese-like nasty armies in the jungle with an arrow and a knife, no better, with a Tarantino-fashioned machete (!!!). There is so much in this movie that reminded me of the classic war movies that I use to like, the element of the river for example, do you remember "Apocalypse now" ? You can see the scene of the boat inspection reversed here with a first bit of the brutality and efficiency of the beast inside Rambo giving the last shot to the wounded pirate like good'ol Captain Willard did to the girl some wars ago. The Burmese army camp is so "Deer hunter" like, the wooden cages, the pigs, the soldiers having fun torturing and raping prisoners... Then there is Rambo at his best. Some people complained that there is not a lot of action and weaponry used by Rambo but I liked the way Stallone came back to the first movie: Rambo uses what he finds on the field and he uses his mature age skill to own the rest of the armed people around, this includes the "dirty dozen" Australian mercenaries that awake to real life war-zone just seconds before dying looking at the testosterone pumped old fart while making the right use of a .50 caliber gun: make big holes into things. The last view we have of Rambo in a battlefield, his expression, show us that it's all done, he had enough, he has seen the same scene a lot of times and he found the answer, now it's time to go back home. The last scene of the movie is so right: Rambo, now dressed with the same jeans and military jacket of the first movie, now unflagged, looks at the road, then to what is supposed to be home, and choose home. The end of the road. A last note: I gave the movie 8/10 for two reasons: Rambo should be really right at his age with a lot more of grey hairs, showing better that aging means nothing for the beast inside him, and the other reason is that there is more to be shown and probably I'll see what is missing in the DVD's director's cut in a couple of years (sigh). If you haven't done it yet take a look at the R-rated trailer, the point of views are different from the movie and it is a little masterpiece by himself.
8.0~A brutal, uncompromising movie prestonmarlowe Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone, like Arnold, Jean-Claudde, and the other big time action hero's of the '80s and '90s, may not be the greatest actor or filmmaker of all time, but he can deliver but good when he wants to. Rambo here is proof of this. The plot centers around John Rambo as he is forced to transport and subsequently rescue a group of missionaries in the Burmese war zone, all the while grappling with his own inner demons. The plot isn't entirely new, but its not just throwaway either. Stallone delivers his acting with Halo's Master Chief-esquire charm, which leaves the supporting characters (Julie Benz as the good-hearted female missionary, Matthew Marsden as the collected mercenary sniper with the Barrett Light .50, and Graham McTavish as the perpetually angry, foul mouthed mercenary leader) to do most of the emotional heavy lifting and curse laced one liners, but Stallone still manages to give a good performance that can only be described as such: hardened, brutal, and uncompromising. This film is not for the faint of heart. While the cinematography is gorgeous (bruised lighting tinted with the green of the Burmese jungle and sand of the village scenes) the screen will be filled with what seems like a sea of blood. Villagers are chased into minefields and are shot and blown up, soldiers are dismembered, beheaded, blown up, disemboweled, and maimed (complements of Rambo and his home forged machete). Children are murdered, gang rapes take place, and the last battle scene may cause a few people to lose their most recent meal. But its all in good form, and the sheer gore makes the film worth watching again and again. If you're looking for the next generation of film, look somewhere else. But if you're looking for a true blue, unbridled vision of guerrilla warfare and one mans battle with both a vicious enemy and his own haunted past, then get Rambo.
4.0~Rambo's gone up a few pounds, taken up fishing and looks more peaceful than ever, but Sly wants us to believe that underneath lies a mean killing machine. EijnarAmadeus Sign in Permalink The story in this fourth Rambo-movie is glued together as a jungle-adventure / rescue mission in which our hero barely gets any real action to deal with, in the first act of the movie he feels like the slowest cat in town, now he agrees to help a group of Christian relief workers into war-torn Burma - now Rambo drops them off, and as soon as they have arrived, they get attacked and are taken prisoners. Rambo gets the news, and goes for the rescue - armed with his ridiculously sad-expression on his face. Now we expect Rambo to deliver explosive action, and Rambo goes heavy on the gore; the exploding heads, blood squirts and torn limbs will satisfy the audience's blood lust, but sadly Rambo gets sidelined by this terrible Christan group and the even more terrible mercenary-soldiers who helps out Rambo killing the bad-guys. Sly returned Rocky Balboa to the big screen with success, because it was just as much the story of Sly himself taking place, an actor/boxer who needed one more round in the ring makes sense - and after all, Rocky's a soft character with heart and soul. Rambo's heart and soul is made rock, he's a tough nail and he's a killer - in the best sequence here we see Sly acknowledging through a dream sequence where Colonel Trautman (the great Richard Crenna) tells him to stop denying what he truly is. But when the movie's best scene features Rambo looking into the past and showing good ol' times giving nostalgia,, you'd rather watch the true 80ties hero in a 80ties movie, than watching him out of place in 2008.
10.0~You are war, no God is going to change that. cyborg2040 Sign in Permalink I went into this movie with high hopes, and Stallone surpassed them. I thought this movie was simply amazing, and I had to watch it again. Me and a group of friends I went to the theater with watched two back to back showings of this film, and happily forked over $13 to do it. I'm 26 years old, and my friends are 19, 23, and 33. We all left the theater with ear to ear grins on our faces. Once the action starts about 30 mins into the movie, it never lets up. Most movies give you a chance to catch your breath between all the explosions and dead bodies, but Rambo gives you 30 minutes of character development, followed by over an hour of non stop killing. My estimated body count in this movie is around 200 - 250 kills. Do yourself the favor and see it in theaters. I would have never forgiven myself if I had passed this one up.
8.0~After Rocky Balboa, Stallone does it again!!! ben_mister_s Sign in Permalink At first when I heard that this movie was going to be brought out, I was pretty cynical about it. Like for a couple of other actors, the 21st century hasn't really worked out well for Stallone. Eddie Murphy, Steven Seagal, Jean Claude Van Damme, they all had pretty terrible movies. Stallone walked the same path. I did think that D-Tox was okay, but my family was a little more critical then me, they are still making fun of that movie and it's been 8 years ago!!!Oh well. Anyway, this movie didn't really get me enthusiastic about it. I didn't even watch it at the movies. However, I did get the DVD when it came out. I was amazed!!! It was great, it was probably even better then Parts 2 and 3. I won't deny that it's a little over the top at some points. Heads being blown apart, guts splattering everywhere, and Rambo actually cutting someone basically in half by thrusting his machete in that person en yanking the blade from side to side. I have some knowledge in the human anatomy and I just don't think that's possible, but hey, it's a movie and a fun one. See it!!! Positive things about movie: Location, action, Stallones acting. Negative things about movie: Some VERY annoying characters "we are here to stop the killing" Yeah blow it out your *ss buddy. "I know that you think that what you did was the right thing, but taking a life is never right" p*ss off!!! And maybe the movie could of been a little longer, 80 something minutes is a little short. Perhaps a little more story and extending the movie to the 2 hour limit. But don't let that stop you, enjoy this movie. Congratulations Sly, along with Rocky Balboa, this is your second 21st century bulls-eye.
4.0~Bloodbath with awful one line dialog. wynonasbigbrownbeaver Sign in Permalink This was a truly disappointing movie. Those who have seen the three Rambo predecessors have an idea who Rambo is and how he came to be. Where was the character development in this movie? The mercenaries and the relief workers were over-looked through the whole movie. Did the mercenaries die? What happened to them? It was the Sylvester Stallone movie. It was all about him and he wanted us to know that. The dialog in the movie just didn't make any sense and it was so bad they could have made various grunting noises and made it ten times better. "Either you live for nothing, or die for something." Dying for what? He must have killed 2000 soldiers just to rescue 2 people in the whole movie. The mounted machine-gun would have overheated by the time he killed 15 of them, and it looked like he shooting all over the place, instead of watching his aim. The bad guys had some depth. But it was only the evil that the producers wanted us to see, they rape, they cause genocide to villages, they kill, they pillage, they torture and maim innocent people, and their general rapes young boys. That much they proved to us in this movie. But it wasn't justifiable enough to make such a poor production. The only reason why I didn't give it a worse score was because of the special effects and its creative kills.
10.0~Stallone will always be remembered with this-his best movie!!! stallone-9 Sign in Permalink Well what can I say.I just returned from seeing Rambo for the 3rd time.This is truly an amazing film not only because it has kick ass action but great and touching story also.Stallone proves to be not only a great actor but a skilled director also.He tells a story which is quite scary but also true and happens in modern day Burma.I've read that the soldiers there are savages,monsters.Stallone captures this sad and heart tearing reality and transports it well on film.Men,women and children are killed with no remorse in the most disturbing ways imaginable.The savages even throw mines into the swamps and bet who of the captive people will survive while running in fear.A shocking reality but sadly true at the same time.Now to get to the real part-THE ACTION!!!And what an action it is.People get teared apart to pieces when shot.It was made so real.The violence here was crossing the NC-17 line but that's why it was great.And Rambo is the man.He shoots people with arrows through the bodies and heads.He chops heads,he rips throats,turns people to paste with a huge machine gun big enough to level a house to the ground.There is also a big kick ass explosion with a pretty nice blast wave that destroys quite a bit of jungle.The final 20 minutes are the best when Rambo grabs the machine gun and kills dozens of soldiers.He's assisted by a skilled sniper who blows heads like balloons.The main bad guy is a real piece of work-a twisted homo child molester.But he gets what's commin to him:Rambo stabs ,than opens his belly till the intestines fall out.Overall Rambo is the best movie I've seen in a long time and in my top 10 action movies of all time.Be sure to check this movie in the theater it has the best sound that will blow your ears away.
8.0~Good Brutal Punch In The Face ritera1 Sign in Permalink This movie isn't for everyone. It shouldn't even be viewed by the mentally unstable. But it was ideal for me. There are the "fun" action movies. "Avengers" comes to mind (excuse me: Marvel's The Avengers). In the "fun" action movies the good guy(s) beat the bad guys in spectacular fashion. The only problem is that we overlook the pain that just caused. Like Avengers, the good guys have a good laugh at the end but fail to acknowledge all the dead bodies under the rubble. Even for me, that is kind of creepy. But "Rambo" doesn't do that. I don't want to give too much credit to Stallone, but there is an inherent truth to this film. It doesn't pull its punches on violence and how it looks. The pain. This is Rambo NC-17. People don't get shot and then drop. They are torn to pieces by gunfire. First a good amount of good guys and then a lot of bad guys. But I would doubt that Stallone is much of a peace-nic. I also can't say this was a absorbing depiction of the human condition. I liked that Rambo didn't have any faith anymore. And the jaded blind faith of the women and her arc was good. The main driver on this, though, was to vent on all the bad guys of the world. And not with a giggle at the end. This was a movie for me: a peaceable fellow with two cats who also likes death metal 'cause it's kind of funny.
10.0~THE action film of the year! YOU need to see it on the BIG screen! subdivision525 Sign in Permalink okay folks.... this is proof right here that action films can still be done right..... I wholeheartedly recommend this film to ANYONE who has ANY interest in it whatsoever..... at first I wasn't sure what to expect, but I just saw RAMBO today at the theater, and IT BLEW ME AWAY..... It was an intelligently told story, and the acting was top notch..... Sly Stallone still has his star power, and Rambo (like Rocky Balboa) proves this..... This is a movie that you must see on the big screen..... I won't give anything away, but the character arcs are awesome and touch your heart.... AND, the ending just freaking blew me AWAY!!!! A perfect ending to an awesome series.... I WILL buy this on DVD the moment it is released.... Congrats to you, Sylvester Stallone.... you've done it again!
10.0~Back to basics AzeriNY Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone should be lauded for coming through with a great action movie. In an age when action genre is nothing more than pretty boys with collection of stuns(think Bourne Identity, Mission Impossible), here is an old school action star showing everybody how to make a 100% pure violent action movie. The bad guys are just plain evil with no crazy gimmicks or gadgets. They are just plain mean SOBs. Rambo is our relentless hero who always comes through and delivers the justice in his own violent manner. I remember a while ago I was watching Rambo 2 and thinking to myself that they just don't make action movies like they used to. Stallone made this movie for action fans who have been longing for some pure violence, without any gimmicks or complex plot lines. Good guys on one side, the bad guys on the other and when it is all said and done, only one man will still be standing. Enjoy the movie. It sure is a good one.
10.0~What i have always wanted to see tbythomason Sign in Permalink Rambo is the movie that i have always wanted to see. Someone (sly) finally had the balls to make it, whilst blowing 50 to 60 brains out at the same time. Much like John Rambo needs certain things before he marches into burma, a few things are required from you as well. First you must a have a brain so that it can get properly blown out of the back of your head. Second you must have a set a balls so that they to can get blown of your midsection. Third and last, you must have a deep appreciation for movies, you must appreciate how ridiculous they are and how they are able to shape you life as a child and as an adult. I have not had this much pleasure in a movie since die hard or well, rambo 2.
8.0~better then I expected. jay632 Sign in Permalink I was expecting this movie to completely sucked, since it was murdered by critics, and commercials looked so cheesy, Stallone getting too old, him admitting taking human growth hormones. So I expected this movie to totally bomb, but too my surprise, like rocky balboa, this movie wasn't too bad. Storyline wasn't bad, when you take a look of these kinds of movies, your not expecting any storyline at all. But surprisingly, there was a little storyline, and it wasn't too bad. Film seemed kind of short though, but then you run the danger of making it too long. Similiarlly to rocky balboa, Rambo got some character by them adding flashbacks from the previous movies in it. Considering he didn't say much in this movie. All and all, not a bad movie, i gave this movie an 8 out of 10, maybe too high.
10.0~A massive bloodshed. HumanoidOfFlesh Sign in Permalink John Rambo is leading a near-isolation life as the cobra hunter near the Salween River near the Thailand-Burma Border.In the neighborhood Burma there is a civil war where the Burmese Military is fighting with the Karen people who comprise of poor laborers and farmers and the fight has been going on for over 60 years with lots of bloodshed and genocide.A group of human right activists headed by Dr Michael Burnett along with volunteer Sarah approach Rambo to give them a safe passage to Burma so that they can give medical assistance.When he does take them to a neighboring village,the militia brutally attack the villagers and take the activists hostage.A rescue mission is sent to get the hostages alive.But they need the support of only one man-John Rambo.One hell of a violent flick!The action is fast-paced,the violence is brutal and bloody and Sly Stallone looks more stronger than in his previous Rambo movies.10 out of 10.
8.0~Older & wiser? kosmasp Sign in Permalink Well that's for you to decide, but one thing is made clear here: Rambo seems to have a problem staying "retired". But then again, I'm not complaining! Quite the contrary, I really liked this movie, that does not take any prisoners (or at least Rambo doesn't take any!). That of course means that the movie is pretty gory and explicit in it's portrayal of violence. Although some might have become numb to the whole blood on screen violence, it does it's best to show how gruesome death can be. While I thought this wouldn't be as political as the first installment of the "Rambo" series, it does shed some light on an actual conflict, that goes on for years now. I don't know if you can call it a good thing, but some rebels are using quotes from the movie for their fight for the good cause.
8.0~The Fantastic Ode to Senseless & Gratuitous Violence; by Sly Stallone. Coventry Sign in Permalink Now that he has reached the respectable (at least, for an action hero) ago of 61, it seems as if Mr. Stallone can do whatever the hell he pleases! At several times during watching the brand new and almost indescribably violent "Rambo", it's almost like you hear Sly thinking: "Screw everybody, I'm doing this film MY way!" And good for him! "Rambo" is quite possibly the most nihilistic violent film with blockbuster ambitions ever released and, albeit entirely pointless and forgettable, it inarguably delivers thrills and great entertainment. And, pardon my bluntness, but  if you walked into the theater expecting anything more than extreme violence and senseless shootouts, well, than you only have yourself to blame for the disappointment. John Rambo now peacefully lives in a swamp in Thailand, where he fills his days fetching venomous snakes and fabricating his own boat propellers. He turned his back on warfare as well as on peace initiatives, and when a group of American missionaries politely requests him to guide them over dangerous rivers & swamps in order to bring medicines to helpless villagers in Burma, he simply replies with "F*** the World". However, when a beautiful female expedition member makes the same request, Rambo accepts But he still objects. And with good reason, of course, as the missionaries are captured and imprisoned by the sadistic Burmese army. The pre-credits opening sequence already illustrated that Burmese soldiers enjoy toying around with their POW's, like for example forcing them to run through an a mine-infested meadow and then still executing the ones who made it, so the volunteers' fates don't look too hopeful. Hired mercenaries are sent in to free them and guess who joins the party?! If you really do feel the need to defend this film, you could always say the setting and background of the story are original and absorbing. No movie script ever revolves on the dramatic situation in Burma, probably because there isn't much foreign involvement in this war, but the documentary-styled images of famine and dying children at the beginning of the film are just as haunting and nightmarish as those of the wars in, say, Rwanda, Vietnam and Somalia. But seriously, in spite of the presumably ambitious political undertones, you should primarily watch this movie because it's John Rambo kicking arse; more relentless and barbaric than ever! There will be blood  and lots of it  but there will also be exploding heads, arrows through the eye, disembowelment (how I love that word), slit throats and gigantic explosions! One particular and extraordinary adrenalin-rushing sequence simply shows Sly operating some sort of powerful machine gun (sorry, I'm not an expert) for several long minutes and single-handedly massacring the entire Burmese army. You know what you're watching is preposterous and just plain wrong, but it's so damn freaking awesome at the same time! Say whatever you want about Stallone, but he's still extremely fit for his age although I did appreciate that he kept his shirt on throughout the entire film this time. His acting performance is more than satisfying as well, and he receives excellent support from several other impressively build beefcakes (Graham McTavish, Matthew Marsden, Jake La Botz, ) and the lovely Julie Benz. I wouldn't exactly recommend to see "Rambo" on your first date with that lovely girl you always dreamed of, but for all other occasions, this is great stuff, pure testosterone on film! Oh and stunningly superbe soundtrack, too!
10.0~Mind Blowing kian089 Sign in Permalink I got only one thing to say. When i was watching the movie. My heart was beating faster and faster.When i checked my pulse rate it was like 120-125 OMG!!! But after some time when Rambo hold the machine gun i got some relief and it got slower.Sounded funny for me. Its a real carnage thing. An action movie without nude scenes unlike James Bond.Its simply mind blowing.Effects are realistic. Actions are very well done.Best one is when he put out someone's through with bare hands.OMG!!! After all he is Sylvester Stallone...He proved himself as a very talented action protagonist as well as action director.But its simply a pure strong extreme action movie......
10.0~RAMBO! EasternZZ Sign in Permalink That is all you need to hear. If you love RAMBO (like me), you will love this movie. You get to see RAMBO rip a guys throat out with his bare hand, stabbed a dude in the stomach and take out his intestines, jump on the back of a 50 cal. mounted machine gun and turn people into mince meat, cut a dude's head off, say some itty gritty philosophy stuff about killing when you are pushed, and seeing RAMBO attach a mine to a mini bomb and having it explode, destroying an entire forest. Highlights of this movie are; Rambo killing some pirates, Rambo saying "live for nothing or die for something," Rambo ripping a guy's neck out, Rambo on the 50 Cal., Rambo cutting a guys head off, Rambo making a machete that he will eventually use to kill, and the final shot of Rambo on American soil again. 10/10
10.0~The Best Rambo Movie Ever!!! allypk2000 Sign in Permalink Hey He's Back!!!! and back out of Hell as we watch the best Rambo movie ever, No more sleaziness no BS but all best action ever.Sly must be old but he is the best there is and there will be..... More killings More gorre but all natural, true and full of sequences which are true... The best movie of the Year i would say.... Where in the U.S. we saw Rambo first appearance and as moved we saw the Afghanistan movie but apart from all Burma movie showed reality and true action. Sly Directory skills have grown after the movie of boxing which sucked but this movie rules..... Oscar for best action and set if there is one. TA TA Tarintino.. Be Ware Rodriguez as Sly is in Action...
8.0~Horrorific, yet I swear it has a pulse. lukepic123 Sign in Permalink Rambo is nothing short of one of the most blood thirsty movies to hit the cinemas in a while. Sly has decided he would not only direct but also write this one, on his behalf he could have given the plot a little more depth. Apart from the slightly 2D plot there are some great tag lines in this movie and some terrific acting and sly does Rambo perfect as usual. The action is very solid, even though the movie is super blood thirsty with unbearable gore there is a pulse to the film which stops you from tearing away from the screen which really makes this film powerful. Apparently the actions of the Burmise soldiers and the killing of villagers is a true and actually happening. But this film did seem like they used this "true" story thing and took it as the perfect excuse to be able to plow as much violence as possible in Rambo and get away with it. I gave this a 7 and even though I though a lot of the content was too much for an action film the film is superbly made and I think Sly did a great job at directing. Every explosion and shot will make your heart miss a beat because every time it's horrific. This is a powerful movie but without the good direction, acting and horrible gore the plot is too shallow. Overall I would only recommend Rambo to a very selected audience who have very strong stomachs and will not be offended by violence.
10.0~is it me or was this movie absolutely bad ass? skiderella Sign in Permalink i wanted to see rambo just because it was rambo, i honestly expected it to be bad. but this is seriously one of the best action movies of all time. good lord from the first guys he kills it just gets your heart pumping. stallone really really delivers on this. don't believe the reviews. outside of the action it actually has a compelling story and enemies that you really want to see dead. i give it 10 stars because i left the movies not being able to stop smiling. im proud of you sly. good job! i don't really want to give anything away but there is this one part where he gets a mine and...well you really have to see it. words don't describe how awesome the action was. see it!
7.0~Its Nice To See Rambo Back, But Not As Much Action As You May Think devinshee Sign in Permalink I give Rambo 7 and a half stars out of 10. I really like the Rambo movies, First Blood, Rambo 2, and Rambo 3. They are the action movies that started all those typical 80's action movies in the late 80's. I think Rambo 2 is pretty much the best one. It is nice to see Stallone doing Rambo again. The action is pretty cool in the movie. But it is not really packed with action. It is very bloody, and gory. It has pretty graphic violence. Limbs fly off as people are struck by bullets, bloody gunshot wounds, blood spurting and spraying, chuncks of flesh fly everywhere, heads explode, grisly images, a guy's throat is ripped out, tissue, arteries, human bodies explode into pieces, a guy is blown in half, (I especially like the part where Rambo shoots the guy in the driver seat with the 50 cal., old school, the guy just blew up, and blood and flesh flew everywhere), all that stuff, some of the blood and gore is kind of CGI. But there is not as much gore and as you may think, its not exacally all over the place if you ask me, there is a lot though, but it is not constant. And i also like the part where Rambo shoots that truck load of Burmese soldiers, and blood and chuncks fly everywhere, he just mowed them all down, that was old school. The thing that bugged me, is that Rambo was not running around with an machine gun and shooting people and throwing grenades around like the good old days. The only time he was shooting a machine gun was at the ending battle, he did not shoot too many people, but he shot an even amount. It kind of seemed like the Mercenaries were hogging all the action, but i guess Rambo did enough action. I like the part where Rambo cuts out the main bad guy's entestines, and they spill all over the ground. That guy deserved it, a very ruthless and sadistic person. And also, Rambo shot a few arrows at people, and that was about all he did. He did not say too much in the movie. And there are explosions in the movie too, but not a lot. Rambo did not say too many bad words, he said a few. But those Mercenary guys where swearing like crazy, saying the F word a lot. And those were pretty cool guys, good characters, especially that bald guy, he was always angry. The Burmese soldiers were some pretty bad people, raiding villages and killing everyone, and talking their children to be soldiers, they were evil, but that stuff actually goes on over there from time to time. It seemed Stallone was trying to recreate Rambo 3, they seem kind of identical, he goes in, rescues the missionaries, the rebels come at the end, all the bad guys die, and that is that. Rambo is a back to the basics kind of movie, it is old school. It is very violent. And it is like one of those good old guy movies. The movie is very entertaining, but i guess i expected a little more. I wonder how the movie will be one DVD, maybe better, who knows, deleted scenes and stuff. I hope Stallone does another Rambo movie, or another action movie at least.
8.0~In many ways, the best of the bunch IDs_Ego Sign in Permalink On a Hollywood level, I've enjoyed all of them. But of this foursome, you have 2&3 that were Good Cheezy Popcorn Action, and then you have 1&4 that have Soul and Spirit. I really admire Mr. Stallone for returning to the icon of Rambo the way he did. As an editor, to me, that dream sequence was perfect. In this one, he shows us the basic brutality of war and military murder, and puts it under a brutal light. And John Rambo is not by choice a machine-gunning war monger; he, like most of us, just wants to be at peace. Why isn't Mr. Stallone directing more films? Does he have to be in all of them, is that the deal? He really knows the craft. Anyway. Some would say it is a gore-fest. Sure, as is "Saving Private Ryan". Face it, "Rambo"'s violent mess is a hell of a lot more true, I suspect, than a tank playing chicken with a helicopter gunship (First Blood 3). If anything, it could have been longer. The mercenaries were well performed but inevitably one-dimensional. This is a very different film from what you'd expect of the Rambo mythos, but if you like Rambo at all, you'll love it -- if you haven't seen it already. -D
10.0~EXCELLENT - What action films used to be like. *May contain small spoilers* dreggy Sign in Permalink I have used IMDb for a while now without registering. I saw this film last night and felt compelled to right a review of it because this is what action film used to be like. I knew I would like this film because I loved the other Rambo movies but this is totally different. Its grittier and a lot more violent. Also the used of CGI is kept to a bare minimum. Also I cant believe Sly is running around the jungle at his age. He looks half his age and I would absolutely love it if he made Rambo 5 but this is probably unlikely. Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant. I Loved it. As another IMDb user said "This movie reeks of awesomeness!!! Well directed too. and for once the story line is slightly believable. Sly, we salute you!
6.0~"Sly"ghtly Overrated! longojr Sign in Permalink It is a good return, but very little more than that. It is a sort of Rambo meets 28 Days Later kind of action: gory and filthy. I was checking the IMDb's rating on the original, First Blood, and it averages 7.2, so I guess this one shouldn't be more than a 6.0 Same as I saw in Rocky Balboa's #6 return last year, I did on this as well. The main thing is keep fighting, which is what most fans of the genre want anyway. I guess there's no need to tell the plot, it is the same thing as previous ones, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, whichever country were the United States army is invading, the plot and Rambo are as well. If you're a fan, should watch it, otherwise, watch "The Killing of John Lennon".
8.0~Get in, get out, no distractions. kpbtm Sign in Permalink As the rather contrived title of my review suggests, this film is rather like the mission which it portrays. It exists to serve one purpose: Deliver a level of (literally) visceral action we have not seen in 20 years. There has rarely been a vessel better suited to this type of endeavour than Stallone as Rambo. Rambo has become the movies' definitive man of action over words. The history of the character (and of the actor playing him) imbue the entire film with the sense that once that low activation energy has been reached, a chain reaction is set in motion which cannot be stopped. Put a bee in Rambo's bonnet, and he doesn't so much shake it out as eat the freaking hat, bug and all. Do not go in expecting a parable for modern American foreign policy, or any astute political observations on the Burmese situation. Do not expect award-worthy performances or dialogue. This film is here to punt your balls into your throat, and it does so with no mercy and no remorse. The only reason it doesn't get 9 stars is because it's too damn short.
5.0~A Total Disappointment ! terry_rocks85-1 Sign in Permalink I am a die hard Rambo fan and am so totally disappointed after watching this film. What was the director thinking? There was hardly any effort. New age Cinematography spoiled Action Classic look of the previous movies. There was no need for the mercenaries. Burma was a waste and the movie was terrible. Sly was still good: cold and strong. But somehow he was a sidekick in the movie. Why was that female crying i still can't understand and Why did that Brit mercenary hate his job so much. Whole lot of cribbing and skinny Burma soldiers made to look mean and tough which would make any Rambo fan laugh considering the baddies in Afghan and Vietnam. I would advice any Rambo fan to stick with the first 3 parts and let this one be !
9.0~Rambo delivers the goods: Tons of blood, action, violence, nostalgia wesleywisejr Sign in Permalink Male/24/Detroit, MI --- I saw the Rambo movies growing up and obviously saw John Rambo as an iconic figure. I recently re-watched the trilogy and obviously was most impressed with the first movie. The 2nd and 3rd were pretty cheesy but still great fun to watch because of the mindless violence and action. THAT'S RAMBO!! I went into this movie expecting nothing less than what I got. A ton of blood, violence, and good ol' Rambo kickin' some foreign wrong-doer's asses. The beginning of the movie actually gives us a peak into the real travesties occurring in Burma, but after that it's straight fiction at it's best. I also loved all the new ways you see people getting killed in this movie. I think I muttered HOLY S**T about 15 different times. If the theater had been at least half full, I know we would've heard some cheers, rather than the occasional "ooh" and "aahs". I really enjoyed the flashbacks to the old movies although I did think they were a bit oddly-timed and not used enough. I think Rambo's past should've been utilized much more. Other than that the consistent action and not-so-bad storyline (minus the religious group being total idiots) made this movie very enjoyable to watch. For those who love relentless violence and action, which is the essence of the Rambo flicks (aside from the first, I suppose), you will absolutely love this movie. For those expecting anything else, go see # 1 Meet the Spartans which doesn't deserve to grace the big screen alongside Rambo.
10.0~Action packed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! nadinecarter Sign in Permalink Sly still has it! Kept me entertained the entire time. Hate to see the Rambo series end. At 61 Sly still portrays a good action hero. Very glad I got to see this movie. Not suitable for young children though. It did bother me in some moments of the movie. Not so much the gore but with the women and children. Makes you think how lucky we are living where we live instead of the war stricken areas of the world. It makes me want to go and watch the old Rambo movies now. Man I'm gonna hate it when Stallone stops making movies. The new action hero's will never capture an audience like him. If you liked any of the old Rambo movies you will surely like this one as well.
7.0~Rambo is back and better than ever! Norse_Sage Sign in Permalink I saw this at an advance screening in Oslo, and going in, I didn't expect it to be any more than a cheesy and somewhat gory tribute to eighties actioners by a star/director/producer/writer who was desperate to relive past glory. That latter may or may not be true, but my former assessment was plain wrong. This movie is authentic, shocking and unlike any other comparable movie. Given its genre, the movie is a masterpiece. The story is simple but solid, and works on several levels. The action scenes are unparalleled, more intense than "Black Hawk Down", "Saving Private Ryan" and "Stalingrad" put together. The level of brutality and gore will shock and fascinate, and no doubt cause some level of controversy. Stallone proves himself to be an excellent director, as well as in excellent shape for his age. I had little faith in him going in, and I stand corrected. This is a Rambo who has come to terms with who and what he is, in a movie that holds up when compared with the original "First Blood". Well done, Sly. Well done indeed.
4.0~Is this like.... a joke?? eflemieux Sign in Permalink Good Lord... what's Stallone's mental age? This movie is idiotic! I've never seen a dumber movie since I stopped watching Ninja action flicks. The bad guys are so bad, they're laughable. The mercenaries are walking clichés. The missionaries are straight out of the "Singing Nun" and Stallone... well... he's Stallone. The guy can't act and he doesn't speak, he mumbles. Julie Benz is eye candy but her character is a complete idiot. The whole movie can be summarized as 40 minutes intro followed by 40 minutes of senseless violence. I've got nothing against violence in movies but this is a pure massacre, without any purpose except blood splatters. Only one funny thing - there is a huge typo in the credits. "armourer" is spelled "Amoureur" - for a French guy like me, it's hilarious. Oh, and the movie is made in Thailand, with a local crew, so not only did they make a dumb flick but they did it for cheap. That's the way of the future, let's outsource the crappy work to Asia :-) A movie to watch on evenings after your brain has overheated - no risk of additional pressure on the neurones!
5.0~John Rambo saves a bunch of missionaries by killing everyone vipluv-aga Sign in Permalink It is a gore fest which is what a Rambo film should be however unlike the previous action movies the action is simply Stallone using a big gun and shooting down Burmese soldiers who are apparently trying to murder Christian missionaries. The funny part is that the Christian missionaries are in Burma to save the lives of the rebels or some such but their misadventure and Rambo's trigger happiness generates the maximum body count of all the Rambo movies. My disappointment with this movie is that there is nothing clever about the tactics or the manner in which the killing takes place. Think about the way in which Rambo kills the Russian helicopter pilot/general in Rambo 3 or the superhuman military skill with which he fashions booby traps and bows and arrows from the jungle in First Blood. It is a shoot em up alright. Fun for a while but not all that good as a decent action movie
10.0~The first EPIC of 2008 pinkliz41 Sign in Permalink The fourth movie in the Rambo films outdoes all the other three and stands bold and firm among other action films. After the success from Rocky Balboa, Stallone could only get better and thats the exact case in this scenario. He may not be the greatest actor in the world, but Stallone remains one of the greatest action figures of our time. His best coming from Rambo! It excludes the three other petty films before it and becomes a daring, disturbing and magnificent epic. Action movies these days cant really grab the thrill, excitement and adrenaline, but this is by far not the case with Rambo. Sly delivers fast paced action. Bloody, brutal and in your face. It's that type of film that nobody under the age of 18 should ever watch. Each act of violence significantly gets 100 times more brutal including the classic Stallone finale. But taken above the violence is in fact a real emotional story. Think of it like the first Rocky film but without the gloves and a hell of a lot more violence. Think of it like the first Rocky film but without the gloves and a hell of a lot more violence. Sly Stallone is still here, and has reinvented the action movie as we know it.
8.0~Rambo is back after 20 years! cibyll-1 Sign in Permalink After Rocky Balboa, Stallone is back again with his another cult character Rambo. In the 80's these movies made him what he is today. On of the most known action star. The new Rambo is brutal and bloody, full with fantastic action scenes. Stallone is in good condition enough to play his famous role again. Fantastic with age 60! The story is simply but enough. Civil war in Burma, innocent people dies, and Rambo goes angry. But! It's too short, the entire film is only 80 minutes. The oldies are 90 or 100. And it's a little bit fast. There is not enough emotion or feelings. Rambo kills and kills and kills. I think it would be better maybe when the story follows the older ones. Rambo will kidnapped and he must escape and survive. That's my only big problem with Rambo 4. OK, the visual is perfect. Explosions, bodies falling in pieces, everywhere is flushed with blood and brain. But, the character is a bit simply and empty. Yeah, I know, Rambo is alone since ages and he want's nothing but his piece...he can't find it again. He's a Terminator! He must kill! He's back!!! And still perfect, congratulation Sly!
10.0~Part 4 is better then the first 3 jacobjohntaylor1 Sign in Permalink This is a great movie. Very fast pace. Very well written. A lot of action. Very good acting. A lot of fun. It is better then the first 3 Rambo movies. All the Rambo movies are good. And this is the best one. Great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it see it. It is a very good movie. Any who likes action movies should see this. It is the only Rambo movie I saw in the theater. That is because I was to young when other ones came out. And the first one came out before I was born. All 4 of this movies are some of the best action movie ever. And this is the best one. See it. It is a most see. All the Rambo movies are most sees.
7.0~Action hero kills all the bad guys! jim-j-moore Sign in Permalink If its action you want, well here it is. There's nothing at all to tax the intellect, just violence on automatic fire pretty much throughout the movie...which is exactly what most people who choose to see Rambo want. If there was a weak spot, it was the missionaries. What a bunch of muppets! While obviously I understand what their role was in the movie (and hence why they acted the way they did), I couldn't care less about their fate. With a bunch of mercenaries called in to rescue them, I'd have left them to it. But then I'm no Rambo and it wouldn't have been much of a movie if all he did was put-put-put up and down the river. Anyway I digress. Great action, plenty of machismo, blood and exaggerated weapons fire. It's what Rambo is all about.
7.0~Trying to save a life isn't wasting your life, is it? lastliberal Sign in Permalink Rambo takes some missionaries into Burma. When they are captured, the government, as usual, does nothing. Now, it is Rambo's time to act. You know what comes next. Pastor Marsh (Ken Howard) shows up with mercs to try and rescue the missionaries. The first thing you hope is that they get captured, too. Things get real bloody, but no bloodier than the government troops did as they cleaned out a whole village. Rambo still has the goods: He can stare you down with the best of them, spout the platitudes (Live for nothing or die for something), and can rip your throat out as he did when saving Julie Benz (8MM2, "Dexter"). Action with a capital A and enough blood for anyone. Hurry up with Rambo V!
10.0~Thanks for the cold water in the face Sly ! janus-20 Sign in Permalink This film just knocked me for six, i cannot begin to say how good i feel it is. As my title says, it was like cold water in the face after 20 years in the wilderness. The action heroes in vogue right now carry magic wands and do tepid impersonations of Keith Richards, cgi and pg13 films have done their evil work over the last decade and a half, all we get now is vegetables (in every sense of the word), with no meat. Well if meat is what you want, here its hanging off the bone and bloody. Its been so long since an action film has paced itself getting to the slam/bang, letting the threat of violence hang in the air. Once the action does start, its sudden and gritty and i don't have to remind myself i'm watching a film and not playing xbox. I cannot recommend this highly enough, i fully except its a strong taste not to everyones liking and their view is valid, but if you like bad, bad guys, brutal good guys, machine guns, explosions, blood, liquifying torsos, well i think you get the point, then this bullets got your name on it.
9.0~Hellyeah!! bigbadduude Sign in Permalink Rambo 4 was by far the best film ever made in the history of mankind. It exceeds every one of the previous ones by far; every frame is perfect, the pyrotechnics are bad ass, the dialog is sick, the sound design is the best so far and the bad guy gets it really good at the end! It will make you root for Rambo as if you were in kindergarten rooting for the god damn Teletubbies. If you haven't seen it yet, please do, because I want Rambo 4 to be the highest grossing film to date in the known Universe. It really deserves it. RAMBO frigging' RULES!!! For those of you who wonder why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10, figure out the gay ass system IMDb employs and you will realize that 9 is actually a much higher score. f.ck romantic comedies!
8.0~Very very good action movie bgrande2 Sign in Permalink This movie i must say pretty much wraps up RAMBO the way they should have. The movie really brings it all together, especially at the end. Don't get me wrong its a action movie 100%. Its brutal, its cold, its absolutely kick-ass, (pardon my french) the whole time you'll be wondering "whats he gonna do next? where is he gonna go? is he gonna die? whats he doing now?" you'll never be disappointed in the results that follow i can gauruntee that! To sum it all up its pretty much a fast paced brutal action film with some nice "get to know yourself" things thrown in along to way. So if you have seen the first 3, or even if you haven't...i strongly suggest that you do...you should drop by a theater and witness the concluding end on legend of war himself...RAMBO!
10.0~Best Action Movie Ever! joe1858 Sign in Permalink I have been a member on the site along time and never felt it necessary to post a comment, however after watching this movie I felt I had to. In terms of pure entertainment and action, this movie is second to none. Stallone kept it true to the rest of the series, but at the same time took it places it has never been before. The action will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire 1hr 33min. The entire crowd at the theatre was enjoying the movie the whole time. Don't miss out on this movie! Stallone put together an instant classic, that any Rambo or action fan will truly enjoy! Go today and see the best action movie ever made! I also have to say thank you, to Sylvester Stallone for giving my family one more great Rambo movie to enjoy!
7.0~Not disappointed bk-87668 Sign in Permalink I just received The Ultimate Collector's Set of all four Rambo movies and here are some of my thoughts of the latest effort from Stallone. Spoilers ahead, that meaning I'm going to reveal details of the gore (the real meat of the movie) - not the plot. The movie is not perfect, it's far from it, but holy crap. Hats off to the crew for making me feel like I was watching the original three movies as a kid. Everything in the movie definitely over the top, it's kinda like some old cheese you forgot in the refrigerator in the 80s and now that you found it... Stallone has understood a new Rambo movie in the 00s can only succeed if it took what has happened to movie violence in 20 years and then bringing it back to the 80s and then added an iconic character to the equation. Back in the days of First Blood Part II or Rambo III (I'm leaving First Blood out of this, since it's a very different movie) when someone gets shot at and dies it's just a body falling down. And maybe a patch of blood on the chest. But in this it's the body exploding in two halves. Heads get pulverized. Also, babies are thrown into a flaming buildings. In a way, the violence is similarly over the top as in most 80s shoot 'em ups, except it's in great detail and probably much more realistic (or, fits in the current version of realistic cinematic violence). After so many years, John Rambo has become such an iconic character that you don't think Rambo ripping the Adam's apple out a bad guy's throat is unbelievable (I didn't make that one up). It's just natural progression from the no-shirt Rambo in Afghanistan. The fact is that Rambo can't die, ever. Period. Even if he gets shot at by an army while being basically the only one shooting back (without a shirt on). Here the suspension of disbelief is bargained quite logically: For example, Rambo is able to kill five bad guys that are standing in front of him only because he shots first. While Rambo again has the biggest gun in the end and mows down henchmen by the hundreds, it's because 1.) the huge gun is mounted on a truck, 2.) he is actually seen reloading it and 3.) the gun is well armored so Rambo cheats death in a realistic way instead of movie magic. What I didn't like was that the movie was maybe a bit uneven in that while it ends with an expected shoot-out, the intensity of the final battle doesn't grow up to explode in a huge bang (taken literally or not). I was expecting something more. Now the most evil guy just tries to run away but collides with Rambo's knife. End of movie. Another thing that I didn't like was that the gore and violence was obviously CGI most of the time. It just sticks out. Although, when it worked - which was most of the time - it worked well. The plot was just an excuse to find a place on Earth where there could be a bunch of really evil guys and no rules. What I liked was while you could think Rambo's motivation for fighting one more time was the captured woman missionary, it was actually what she represented. Even without the "Rambo returns home" ending it is clear that there was no romance involved when the woman runs to her husband. I guess adding a love interest was one of the three possible ways to ruin the movie. Also, while you could say the characters were overall very thin, it could be seen that at least they weren't the usual brightly colored stereotypes. This is Rambo's show. That said, I wasn't disappointed. The excess gore made me feel like secretly watching a very not-for-kids movie as a kid. John Rambo was not a watered-down version of the original character. Did I mention the over the top violence was morbidly entertaining? The movie was an extremely realistically drawn cartoon.
5.0~Ram-Blow: First Bad Movie of '08 spoonmanfan Sign in Permalink There's a lot to be excited about when deciding to watch this movie. Such as: Extreme violence Great special effects & sound Extreme violence Actually that's about it. Of the very short 1:33 minute film there's 15 minutes of great footage. Beyond that you're getting an uninteresting story of Ram-blow, the mysterious ultra invincible tragic hero who is willing to sacrifice everything to save a woman and her Christian missionary friends. The acting of Julie Benz (who played the female lead) really left a bad taste in my mouth. I honestly felt Stallone gave a pretty gritty performance and was easily the most convincing of everyone. In fact, each scene with Ram-Blow in it I was highly captivated. When he wasn't involved my mind wandered quickly. My main beef is the horrible story. I just felt like it's been done a million times and really had a hard time staying interested. There are several scenes that will have you saying, "HOLY $HIT!" but they're so few and far between that it's not worth it to suffer through the hour and 15 minutes of garbage. Even to fans of 80s shoot em' up action flicks (which is the audience this clearly is targeting) I would not recommend seeing this. Go watch Blood Diamond or Apocalypse Now if you want to see something similar but better. 5/10
1.0~Hardly Rambo fanpuck33 Sign in Permalink Frankly, I was appalled by this movie. Disgustingly violent and foul. I've had no problems with those things in the other Rambo movies. I don't think I've heard that many F words in an 80 minute span in my life. It was ridiculous. Well placed curses can be a good thing and add realism to dialog. Saying it this much is just ridiculous and annoying. Then there is the violence. This movie is many times more violent than the older Rambo movies. On top of that, it was silly. People being cut in half by shots fired from a gun. People's heads completely exploding from rifle shots. One guy got shot and flew 10 feet in the air. It was so ridiculously unrealistic that I laughed. All the blood and gore looked so cheesy that it didn't seem the least bit real. It was as if there was a sale on fake blood and they had to use it all in one movie. Some of the worst special effects I've ever seen.
9.0~Stallone does it again! Wonderful! Rambo comes full circle lotus_chief Sign in Permalink I've always been a huge fan of Rambo; although the intriguingly complex character has since become a cliché of sorts; jokingly referred to in the tail end of jokes. The series began to falter a little with 'Rambo 3', and the character fell into obscurity. Now I'll be the first to admit that I laughed at the idea of Stallone revisiting the Rambo character, as well as Rocky. I was proved wrong with 'Rocky Balboa', as that was a VERY good film. And I'm proud to say that Sly is "2 for 2" with 'Rambo'. We find Rambo completely removed from the world, living how he wants to live, content with being away from everything. Similar in premise to Rambo 3, while trying to avoid fighting he is inevitably pulled back into it. But its how he comes to fight that is different from all times past. In 'First Blood' he has no other choice. Not expecting a war at home (and not looking for one), war is declared on him for all the wrong reasons; and his switch is turned on immediately. In 'First Blood Part 2', he's asked to go back to the hell called Vietnam to rescue forgotten POWs, and is betrayed once again. In 'Rambo 3', his mentor and 'the only man he trusts', Trautman, is captured behind enemy lines; and he's the only one willing and able to go in and save him. In this final installment (as of right now), an older, colder John Rambo has given up on the world (and for good reason) and just wants to live out the rest of his life in whatever kind of peace he can achieve. This time its Christian humanitarians who seek his help getting into Burma to provide medical relief. Learning that they're traveling without weapons in the war-torn country, he essentially laughs at their cause, telling them that they're in no position to 'change anything' and doesn't want to be a part of it. He's later convinced to help them by the only female in the group, who reaches the only human part of his soul left. He does help them, only to learn that they've been captured by the Burmese. He's pulled into war once again....only this time he finally comes to the understanding that he can no longer fight what he truly is.a killer. A warrior, who wasn't just trained as such by the Green Berets, but who he always was from the beginning. One line really struck, and also surprised me: "you didn't kill for your country, you killed for yourself." I found this very interesting; as I never did get this from the Rambo character. He was bred as a killing machine, and always wanted to turn it off but never could. What Rambo learns is that he was always a killer, and he did what he did for himself, not his country.that he went to Vietnam to kill, to Afghanistan to kill..for HIMSELF. This is VERY telling that Rambo is truly a cursed soul. What follows is one of the most gruesome, brutal action/war films ever made. Straight to the point, in-your-face action, holding NOTHING back.the images and happenings are as cold, stern and bold as Rambo's aged face.and it all works WONDERFULLY. People tend to forget just how talented Stallone is, and it's so pleasing to see that at age 62 he still has it; not only physically but mentally. still with great knowledge of how to do an action film. He is indeed a mastermy hats off to him. While everyone laughed at Sly when they learned there was going to be another Rocky movie, and another Rambo movie.he proved everyone wrong (myself included). And I couldn't be happier. Whether or not there's another Rambo movie after this wouldn't matter to me. John Rambo finally came full circle, with himself as well as his character's realization for his fans. Any doubt that action movies are dead? Look no further, Stallone still got it. 'Rambo' is one of the year's best. 9/10
4.0~Stallone sets out to test our memory-span! janyeap Sign in Permalink Just another of Sylvester Stallone's recent films that seems to scream out: Stallone has a fixation of fighting to be immortalized as a non-aging 'dinosaur' character! At 62, he dyes his hair in raven-red, swings, punches and kicks as if he's still 25, and, of course, just as egoistic in trying to preserve his Rambo's ancient avenging and violent streak and tactics. Oh yes, for all that youthful image that Stallone sets out to project, there's one thing he has failed to do: prevent the portrayal of his creative process and imagination as having aged over the 20 years. Even Julie Benz's sweet damsel-in-distress doesn't to help erase the image of macho Rambo's aging years. Yep, there's nothing refreshingly new to this Rambo's revengeful fantasy, nor in Rambo's exhibition of his fighting skills and tactics. He keeps exploding in his killing spree, whipping out his weapon to blast opponents into multi-body parts - just like we've seen Rambo doing, flick after flick. And ferociously evil foreign government militia, attacking scared villagers through fields, littered with land mine with the unlucky ones being blown to fragments? Nothing refreshingly new, but can be considered as pretty stunted in creative imagination. Hey, we are seeing this same old scenario being repeated in so many war flicks. Unless Stallone actually believes that the audience do have short-memories and believe they are seen creatively new spins! By the way, are those Asian militia thugs the leftovers from the Vietnam wars in Stallone's imagination? Ah yes, nicely flavoured with Asian jungle atmosphere? Of course, it would be rather tricky for a Rambo, with aging brain-cells to flex his brawn and weapons in cities, cramming with spy-cams and cam-detectors. That would take better brains, like James Bond or Jason Bourne, than guns and muscles alone, to defeat any ugly and vicious militia government. This film would have been fine, if seen in the 1960s. During contemporary days, it comes through as a very predictable film with nothing that's refreshingly imaginative or creative. It's like paying precious dollars to see repeated action scenes from other flicks. And that's pretty insulting to the hard-core film audience!
10.0~Best "ACTION" movie I have ever seen since the Original "DIE HARD" motormouth16 Sign in Permalink Rambo is an excellent piece of cinematic action. This is what real action looks like! It has it all that a great action movie needs: a little story to it, great balanced acting, extreme amounts of gore, even some humor, and TONS TONS of bodies. I am serious when I say I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie, and the only other movie that did that was The Dark Knight! Stallone is nowhere near the caliber of being called the best actor in the US or the world, not close to being voted for the Academy Awards best Actor.... he doesn't need to be. He is known as two things in this world anymore in my eyes: RAMBO & ROCKY! Rocky has the heart & willpower; Rambo has the courage, strength & knows how to shoot and destroy anything he hates!!! I highly recommend this to any action buff, you WILL NOT be disappointed at all!!! And also, the last 15 minutes of this movie will probably be the goriest you will EVER see in any movie of any genre, even more than any Rob Zombie movie! A++++ in my eyes!!!
9.0~Just look at the tagline: "Heroes never die........they just reload." rhapsody-zaman Sign in Permalink Just watch it, words don't justify it! People didn't believe Sly still had it, but they were so wrong. After the the great performance at Rocky Balboa I expected another great performance for him. But this was even better than I imagined. You don't have to be an Stallone fan to enjoy this movie. If you like action movies, this one is for you. A word of caution though, this isn't for the light hearted, there are some serious violence in this movie. I am gonna say this is one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. But you don't have to take my word for it, just watch it. It's better than the previous Rambo films. Expcept for about 15 minutes in the middle, the whole film is action packed. You can't possibly be bored. If you hate action movie or if you have something against violence, this isn't for you. But if you are not, than sit back and enjoy the legend that is Rambo for one last time.
8.0~Very entertaining and much better than I expected Argemaluco Sign in Permalink I was never a fan of the first Rambo movie (First Blood) ,but still,I think it's a good film.Then,the other movies about Rambo were pathetic and the character became on a parody of himself.Now,director and actor Sylvester Stallone resurrects Rambo after twenty years.I honestly did not have big expectations for this movie but the final result really surprised me.The movie is not excellent but it's very entertaining and intense.One of the fails I found on this movie is that the combination of social message with violence is a little bit unstable.The other fails are minor.But,still with that,Rambo enormously entertained me and it did not bore me even one second.Stallone does not show glamorized violence.He shows very realistic and intense violence and I really appreciated that.My expectations for Rambo were very low and the film totally surpassed them.Yes,the movie has fails but it brought me a very entertaining and intense time.
10.0~Greatest movie of all times Samever99 Sign in Permalink I gotta say, two minutes after the movie has ended i found myself still sitting in the cinema all alone except for two of my friends, totally Speechless. And if you're just like me, who prefer the old time Action movies which lasted for 2hours with nothing but Blood, guns and a smalltime story, nothing fancy but it's just there to hold the movie together. Then this is the perfect flick for you my friend. This movie got the most gruesome action sequence i've ever seen, and on top of that Sly probably did his best performance as an actor too. Ohh and btw (kind of a spoiler inc) at the end when all the bad guys are dead and Sly is standing on top of the hill with the fantastic epic music in the background, if you ask me that Scene itself should win an Academy Award. 3 weeks ago i thought Die Hard 4 was a mind blower and one of the coolest movies ever, but Rambo is so much better it's embarrassing. 10 out of 10, no doubt about that, but then again it might just be me who feel this way.
5.0~7.1 a joke ? anton-208-19828 Sign in Permalink First sorry for the bad English i'm German You don't expect an Oscar Film with good Dialogues but you expect a film with good action and an entertain factor like the expendables , but Rambo isn't reaching even that it's a dumb that entertains a bit but you can't talk this film in any way serious . Rambo is an overrated film with many plot holes and only in the end good action When you expect a dumb entertaining film like the expendables you will be disappointed. Don't watch this film watch better action films like crank or other great action films that have a lower rating than this one.
10.0~People of Americans and Europeans must know, this is truth!! genco-5 Sign in Permalink I know there are lots of Americans and Europeans didn't believe this film, but you are wrong!! Stallone made a very correct point on this issue. White people are wrong!! I am a Taiwanese, I know what exactly going on in Burma, in Burma, this is real thing, this is truth!! I was tearing in my heart and grateful for Mr. Stallone making this film. Thank you Stallone, you are so right, you are so nice to ASIA. I have to say this one more time, this is real!!! This is not just a movie, in Burma, this has been happening for many years, even in 2008, it is still happening. You just don't believe it doesn't mean you really know it. These army won't let you know when they are killing their own people!!
9.0~Surprisingly good! erdne Sign in Permalink I have to admit that my expectations were low before both Rocky Balboa and Rambo. The latest string of Stallone movies have been mediocre at best. But then I went to see Rocky, and it was, apart from the original, clearly the best one. But still I didn't expect much from this one either. I am happy to tell you all, I was dead wrong! This is by far the best movie in the Rambo series, and probably one of the best movies in the war-genre ever made. Not because of a fantastic storyline, but hey, this is an action flick. The action, intensity and realism is unparalleled in my opinion. You should definitely check this one out! Be aware though, this one is not for the faint hearted...
8.0~Better than ever basilisr Sign in Permalink I saw the movie one month later, and that because of my concern that it could be just another desperate try of Stallone's return but thanks God I was completely wrong... John Rambo is a well acted movie and Stallone still is a good performer and he just proved it again, no matter his age, he still has the instinct of action especially when that's combined with a quite good cast a pretty high budget. As about the plot, it is a bit short but enough to keep you totally hooked, the action is continuously and blood is spread everywhere . When the movie ends you have the felling that you get what you expected to get, what else "the action" of course and a bloody battlefield. The only thing I really missed from this movie was the perfect body of Stallone. Many greetings to every one who contributed to this movie.
8.0~Completely over the top, just like it should be Sandcooler Sign in Permalink "Rambo" is one of those franchises that adds a more confusing title with every new installment. So we started out with "First Blood" (alternate title "Rambo"), then got "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (who's really going to call it that?), then it started making some sense with the third one "Rambo III" and this one is..."Rambo"? Huh? How hard is it to just put a IV at the end there, end this madness once and for all. But anyway, the movie itself is pretty awesome. It doesn't quite have the character development of the original, the dialogues are stupid, the side characters are lame, but can you honestly hate a movie that has our complex hero kill a herd of "bad guys" (many of the soldiers appear to be recruited against their will, which kinda makes the whole thing bittersweet) with machine guns using a bow and arrow? Or one that constantly has Rambo shoot the biggest gun I've ever seen from a massive open space but leaves him unscathed throughout? This series gave up being intelligent after the first one, but it didn't hurt it one bit. "Rambo IV" (I'm sticking with this) is tough as nails, incredibly gory, packed with action and has a body count in the triple figures, is there anything else you really need to know?
1.0~Ram-BLOW JimS_8686 Sign in Permalink Got free passes to see the new Rambo. Figured it might be good for a laugh and a little excitement. Got an hour into it before walking out. All this stuff you've been hearing about nonstop violent action is complete horseshit. I can honestly say what I saw of the film was mind-numbingly boring. The first hour moves at a snail's pace. I swear I am not joking. The "violent" scenes i saw happened so quick you could barely even tell what had just happened. Blink and you'll miss a cheap-looking CGI effect of some guy's head being blown off. To say the new Rambo is nothing more than a copycat movie is putting it mildly. You've seen Rambo's by-the-numbers premise executed dozens of times before with far more entertaining results. The first half hour blatantly steals from Apocalypse Now's going upriver on a boat theme and the action/war sequences strive for Saving Private Ryan's gritty realism - but fall considerably short due to the film's obvious budgetary constraints. There's also a scene where Rambo rips out a guys trachea just like in Roadhouse. This film tries so hard to rip off other movies that have come out since 1988's "Rambo III", it has the odd distinction of being a sequel that has very little in common with the previous films in the series. You almost get the impression Stallone secretly wishes they never existed. Given the fact the last Rambo film had the title character join forces with the Taliban, I can't say I blame him. So glad I didn't waste a nickel to see this idiotic piece of garbage. The dialogue and acting are atrocious. The one-dimensional stereotypes passing as characters in the film consist of: good American, bad Asians, annoying Brit, and naive woman. The bad guys are the personification of evil - but luckily for Rambo - still dumb enough to keep the Americans they abduct in bamboo cages so they can be rescued easily. The slow moving first hour felt like an eternity, consisting solely of setting up the clichéd, nonexistent plot, which is nothing more than a variation on the Rambo II premise and countless other action movies that came out in the 80's. Good GOD what a horrible piece of crap. Stallone has made yet another forgettable, unwatchable turd to add to his already lengthy and unparalleled list of cinematic turkeys. This probably ranks on the suck-o-meter somewhere between "Rhinestone" and "Staying Alive". And what happened to the explosive-tipped arrows that can blow up a tank from Ramblow II and III? Who knew that one man could wipe out entire armies with a bow and arrow? And if Rambo's been living a life of solitude out in the jungle for so many years, where's the nearest gym for him to get those bulging forearms? I'll never watch a Stallone film again. I should have learned my lesson 10 years ago when I stormed out of the boring and pointless "Copland". I remember back then, Stallone's fans tried generating "Best Actor Oscar" buzz for that. Now, the Pied Piper of cinema has rallied the troops to try getting this smelly piece of manure on the IMDb top 250. It's not going to work. My advice: save your money and stop rewarding this second rate movie maker and so-called "actor" for continuously churning out unwatchable crap. I have nothing against mindless action movies, but this is a moronic exploitation film posturing as geopolitical commentary. It's offensive to all five senses.
10.0~bang bang bang bang bang bang bang..... panzersam Sign in Permalink He is back and I haven't seen so many dead bodies before. And the bodies don't stop falling this ultra violent movie. I haven't had so much fun watching a Rambo movie than this one which I believe to be the best out of all the 4 Rambos. Rambo is a movie to sit down and watch when you are feeling frustrated or drunk. Its Meir lack of depth in the story and duologue makes it fun which not many movies have now. The Movie never lacks a moment of excitement and never looses it(well in Rambo standard). The weapons sound brilliant and visually much better than before. If there is one violent body count movie you are going to see. make it this one.
6.0~lack of nostalgia and attachment to the previous movies in "Rambo" series interfan7 Sign in Permalink As it's own, it's a very mediocre movie; no deep plot, no good idea, some good effects and no emotional or spiritual deepness. Rocky 6 was very emotionally attached to the previous movies and thus was a wonderful end to the series. Rambo 4 had some flashbacks from the past, but nothing more, it was very artificially connected to the plot. I expected much more in this area; I don't want to spoil, but in the end of the movie I would get something of the linkage and nostalgia I expected, but it was too short and especially too "cheap". It's a pity they haven't followed the principles from Rocky 6. If you're Rambo "fans" I'd suggest you to watch it but expect little, or maybe not to watch at all if you're hardcore fans who're afraid of reputation loss. If you just like to watch an OK action war movie, so go for it; Stallone acted well to my mind.
7.0~I got my money's worth atliel Sign in Permalink I'm not sure what has inspired Stallone more in resurrecting his iconic 80's films, the influx of bad Hollywood flicks that use fx instead of traditional stunts or the fear of being forgotten as he grows older? Whatever it may be, his latest work shows that he is inspired, tapping back into the old school way of making action films which is sorely missed in today's cinema. As a character Rambo has disassociated himself with America and whatever changes that now affect it. Basically he's trapped in a time capsule and Burma (modern day Myanmar) suffers from the same problem. Both the cinematic and the real Burma have disconnected themselves from the rest of the world because of its brutal regime and have been that way since the 1980's. How perfect then that Stallone (who co-wrote) chose a land frozen in the same era that spawned Rambo. That being said this film could have gone wrong in so many ways but Stallone has discovered how to resurrect the primal essence of what hardcore action is all about. He understands the genre conventions that belong to it, the expectations that an audience brings and is able to raise the bar to gory heights. What can you do? We are a desensitized audience and anything less would have forced the film to join the ranks of mediocre fare such as Crank and Transporter. That being said the film more than satisfied my expectations. It's all there, blood and gore and explosions and one-liners. The blood and gore is outrageous and most of the fights are memorable. If you are a Rambo fan then you won't be disappointed and if you are an action fan then this is a must see to believe.
9.0~Stands with the best of action pictures: memorable! merrywood Sign in Permalink We can think of only a few actors who have mastered a niche, committed to it and remained in it to deliver solid entertainment for more than one generation. Very few of those actors have been equally as good as screenwriters and directors. With Rambo, which comes along a generation after the last in its series Sylvester Stallone unquestionably steps onto the stage as an extraordinary feature director. The film is the best in the series, curiously enough, tracing back to the earliest one in the character's ascension into consciousness, albeit the most horrifically violent one with brutal scenes bordering on surrealism. While we are mentioning all this good stuff we might also add that few actors have also created franchises on two distinctly different character lines. In fact just now no one comes to mind. While being an action picture, Rambo is not without subtlety, nuance and some depth: The embittered and sour John Rambo is somehow touched by a missionary in poetic, visual realization so light on dialog that we remember why good films tower when it comes to the communication of emotion. The missionary, a role beautifully rendered by Julie Benz, whose looks and talent should have long ago launched her into the "A" list seems to have been perfectly cast. The final scene in this film is inspired. This film puts to rest any further questions about the talent of Sylvester Stallone, who will age like fine wine. If we were to type him we would call him a brawnier and brainier Charles Bronson, whose many memorable vehicles would fit Stallone to a "T." At this juncture it looks like Stallone would even improve on them.
10.0~Rambo is simply great!!! zdenkolino Sign in Permalink Rambo is a great action movie and reminds me on how the action movies were made in 80's. The plot is developing very fast and the pacing is very good. Sly is doing all his stunts and doesn't speak much. Mercenaries were good in my opinion and without them the movie would be to unbelievable and unrealistic. Rambo displays the war like I've never seen it before and believe me I've watched many war movies. Camera is beautiful, music is perfect and fits to the action scenes. Bryan Tyler's take on Goldsmith "Home coming" theme is in the beginning and in the end of the movies (ending is great). I have 3 objections: 1. - the acting of Julie Benz was too unbelievable to me. 2. - maybe more drama and less action (not necessarily). 3. -camera work in some places is to "shaky" for my taste, but on the other hand it gives a lot of tension to the action. Everything else is great. My expectations were high and now I am pleasantly surprised. I had my doubts about the movie (especially after some negative critic reviews), but now all I have to say thank you Sly for giving us Rambo IV. I must say the movie may not be for everyone because of violence, but I think every Rambo fan and fans of the action movies of the 80's will be happy with this movie. My theater was filled . I hope it does well at the US box-office because Sly deserves it. I have no doubt that the movie will be success in other parts of the world also. Rambo is definitely back!!!
8.0~A good send off for another favourite character dave88-2 Sign in Permalink Well he did an admirable job on Rocky, and now he does it again. He's not a one-man army this time and that's all to the good. The English soldiers are great in this, they cracked me up. The only real hole in proceedings is the church guy turning up and bankrolling the mercenaries, I didn't believe that really. But it does not spoil things, and even very serious films have the odd plot hole without ruining the whole. This made me want to know more about the real situation in Burma, so for me its not just a bullet-fest, though its obviously an excellent example of that. Rambo doesn't say much but he's not ridiculously taciturn either. He weighs his words and he speaks when he has something to say, fair enough. As some others have said there is some strong stuff in this, though I would say the editing helps a bit by not lingering too much on any particular act too long. Most horror films make me feel sicker than this did, and I don't think anything here is sick-for-the-sake-of-it. You are meant to be horrified by what people do to others, its a good test of your desensitization to violence. If you're not shocked or at least dismayed then yes there is something wrong. Despite what many critics will probably say of this, this is not a turn your brain off, violent load of crap. It's a good fast pacy action film, and in many surprising ways it may make you think a little. Action films are not my absolute favourite but this is simply very good. I hope things change one day in Burma, at least Stallone shines a light on it before we all forget.
7.0~Action, Action and Action!!!! sauravjoshi85 Sign in Permalink Rambo 4 is the fourth instalment of Rambo series and as expected has loads of action. Sylvester Stallone is as usual at his best. There is not much support from the support cast but that will not disappoint you. Acting of Sylvester Stallone is great. Screenplay is good, location is good. You can be disappointed by the storyline as the story was expected and has nothing new to offer. Background music supports the scenes. Overall a good action movie.
10.0~When I say most powerful action, I mean most powerful action dragonheartr-1 Sign in Permalink This is probably one of his best films. We usually go to cinemas hoping for something and get a little bit of what we hoped for. You get it all with Rambo. I almost jumped out of excitement and it was all I could do to keep me from shouting "Heck YEAH!!". It also provides a moral insight on the great work Churches do and the tremendous suffering some people in this world undergo. I watched then I went out to the next show room and watched it again. Believe me, it takes a lot to impress me! The team work is great. I just have no idea why Hollywood is incapable of producing such great films all the time and instead rely on the power of advertisement and getting our hopes up. This time, it definitely worked with them and they produced a top class action. It felt like you were right there. Enjoy!
6.0~A Cynical Excercise In Exploitation Cinema Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink You can see a major problem the producers of the RAMBO franchise have . RAMBO 3 was made in 1988 and since then the world has changed beyond recognition . Communism has collapsed . All the countries in South America are democracies as is much of Asia . Saddam was overthrown in Iraq by the coalition as was the Taliban in Afghanistan whilst Ghaddfi was friendly to the West before he was overthrown and Lebanon has been at peace for many years . That doesn't leave too many bad people for John Rambo to exterminate and that's a problem . Perhaps the producers could have done a story set in Columbia where a bunch of narco terrorists have captured some CIA types while the subtext of " Just say no " is bludgeoned in to the audience ? For some reason the producers never thought of this and decided to set the movie in a real world context The mistake the film makes is obvious in the opening scene where we're shown graphic newsreel of atrocities committed by state forces in Myanmar aka Burma . Are these atrocities real ? Certainly ? Is the violence one sided ? well that's the problem . Being very much a closed state the conflict in Burma isn't something I have a great deal of knowledge of and just because it isn't reported doesn't mean it's not happening . Stop to consider the reportage in the Middle East - Israel builds Jewish settlements on the West Bank thereby breaking international law which is a leading headline on world news while the Syrian regime of Assad drops cluster bombs on a town killing a dozen civilians and it's a very brief news item . Length of item and number of features on the news doesn't equate the real tragedy of a situation . I actually had to consult the wikipedia to find out about the conflict in Burma , a country that is in fact finding tourism a growing industry . Nevertheless it seems wrong that a political situation like this is used for an excuse of exploitation cinema And make no mistake RAMBO is exploitation at its most graphic and brutal . Not only is it the most violent of the movies in the franchise it's also one of the most brutally graphic films a major studio has released . It's not enough to see someone die from a bullet wound director Sylvester Stallone must show someone's head exploding in to a million pieces . When someone gets blown up they must literally get torn limb from limb . This extends to the characters . Is it enough to show Burmese soldiers murdering innocent civilians ? Of course not - they're shown as gang rapists and being the officer in charge being a rapist is not enough he must be shown as a paedophile . Even the mercenary anti-heroes are a combination of black and white with the older mouthy Brit only interested in self preservation and money juxtaposed by the younger idealistic brave Brit. To call them cyphers would be too much of a compliment This hurts the film greatly because the action scenes work very well - if it was 87 minutes of totally blood thirsty mindless fun which is what the film is . However you always aware of the fact you're watching a movie set in a real country and you're also aware it's trying to preach a messege that the military regime of Burma is not very nice . I've no doubt that isn't very nice but it's the same for a few places on Earth . Do the Ksshmiris like being occupied by India ? Do the Tibetans like being occupied by China ? No they don't as I've seen in my travels across the world . But RAMBO should at best be viewed for what it really is - entertaining rubbish and not a fly on the wall documentary featuring areal life political on going conflict
10.0~John Rambo beastwarsfan Sign in Permalink "John Rambo" is pretty much the same for the Rambo series what is "Rocky Balboa" for the Rocky series. Incredibly strong return after all these years, Stallone brings back his character in a way that stays true to the original and redeems the series after the not-so-good sequels. This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. The camera, the editing, the light, the sound - it makes you feel right there, you might want to clean the blood and the dirt from your face after you leave the cinema. I'd describe the style of "John Rambo" as Mel Gibson' Apocalypto with machine guns. The movie has simple and realistic plot, which also manages to give a message to the audience. After I saw the movie I spent hours on the net reading about Burma - a country I only knew where to look for on the map. I live in Bulgaria, and really had no idea about the situation there. And this movie made me really care. The conflict of the film might be military and political, but it's also an inner one - a matter of morality and faith. The idealism versus the harsh reality. You won't change a thing on you own, but somebody has to start. John Rambo started. I hope others will join.
10.0~Returns to the excellence of the original... tccandler Sign in Permalink Do you want to know how good "Rambo" is? Well, if it had been released in 2007, I would have had it ranked just outside my Top 10. It is somewhat embarrassing to admit that -- after all, the franchise had become a joke after the 1985 and 1988 sequels. Those two efforts had completely undermined and overshadowed the brilliance of the original, "First Blood". This latest effort from actor / writer / director, Sylvester Stallone, is a gut-twisting, soul-pounding action adventure that will have the squeamish running for the aisles. It is so intensely violent that it boggles the mind how Stallone managed to avoid an NC17 or an X. Then again, with the MPAA's hypocrisy never in doubt, I am not that shocked. Years after our last encounter with the lonesome warrior, we find him living as peaceful a life as possible on the banks of a Burmese river. John Rambo has severed all remaining ties with the outside world, choosing to survive with his knife, his arrows and his boat. That existence is turned upside-down when a peace group consisting of doctors and missionaries ask for his assistance in getting up river, deep the heart of a genocidal Burma. Rambo's initial reaction is to shun the group, telling them to "Go home... nothing can be done here." His defiance lasts only until Sarah (Julie Benz), a fair-headed beauty, guilt-trips him into doing something more with his life. She says, "When you're trying to save a life, you're not wasting yours." I suppose that if there is a theme underlying all the extreme violence and carnage of this story, it is this -- "that it is better to die fighting for something, than to live fighting for nothing." When the peace mission goes horribly wrong and a village is massacred, "Rambo" and a team of mercenaries are called upon to go in and rescue Sarah and her colleagues. What ensues is an astonishing sequence of brutality, the likes of which has never really been seen in a mainstream release. I am pretty good at holding my lunch under any circumstances, but "Rambo" pushed my boundaries to the limit. There are some scenes which obliterate the senses in every way. If you are looking for a visceral cinematic experience, make sure to see this film on a massive screen with a cranked-up sound system. The 19-inch Sanyo will not do this film justice. I loved every single second of this bloody, disgusting barrage. The scenes were directed superbly, keeping the audience fully aware of the unfolding events without any of the typical confusion seen in most action flicks. The visuals and the sounds combine to literally move you in your theater seat. "Rambo" places you in right next to the explosions... right next to the relentlessly rhythmical bass-line of gunfire. There are no cut-aways in this movie. With all that praise heaped on the action scenes, it might be easy to overlook the unexpected. The acting, the dialogue, the music, the cinematography -- each and every aspect of the film is far better than you would typically suspect from this franchise. Stallone and Benz are wonderful in what amounts to an unspoken attraction between two very different people. Their scenes together are among the strongest moments in the movie. Stallone manages to do here what he managed with "Rocky Balboa" -- he returns to the roots of the character, creating two finales that rival the originals in both franchises. They are both so supremely well done that one can easily forgive the directions they took during the mid to late 1980's. Listen... I went in to this film expecting very little. I hoped for some action, some brooding Vietnam resentment, and some of that familiar Rambo theme music. I got everything I asked for and a whole lot more. Without giving anything away, there is a moment, late in the film, when Rambo stands atop a hill, staring down at Sarah -- That moment got to me the way I never expected possible from this character. It is a very lonely moment. I felt for the guy. But I wasn't crying... that was just popcorn seasoning that got in my eye. I swear! TC Candler IndependentCritics.com
9.0~Wow! Very well done! One of the best in the genre. bacontrees Sign in Permalink I was going to put this one off, because, well it sounded like a cash-grab. I was totally wrong. I think it even surpasses First Blood on some levels, and I know it's difficult to improve upon a classic. I like the idea of adding dirt and grit to projects in an age of digital cleanliness - more action/thriller filmmakers ought to do that. Rambo is dirty and gritty and bloody and fast and freakin' furious! I haven't written a review here since, like forever, but I had to for this one - what a gem! I didn't like the way the blood was done. If not for the sound effects, the blood wouldn't be as effective. But, that's a detail, if you like the great action movies of the 80's, 90's and 2000's, you'll have to add this one to your collection and put it on the same shelf as Die Hard and The Road Warrior (and Robocop - because of the insane amount of bloody violence).
10.0~"Till You Come Full Circle." MacKrazy Sign in Permalink Wow where to begin, RAMBO! this film is one that I can safely say, delivers. If your a fan of the series you won't be disappointed, if you thought some where a little over the top after First Blood, you still might enjoy this. Like the other films and to an extent the Rocky sequels, this film is it's own thing, one of the things that makes these two series great is the fact each movie can almost be a different genre, Rambo III and First Blood are chalk and cheese. This can turn people off though. How I'd describe RAMBO is if Rambo III was as realistic as First Blood, actually showing you what would happen if one man was to go up against an army. Actually even more realistic, no jumping up and grabbing helicopters or firing repeatedly at enemy soldiers and nothing happening but a little hole in there uniforms. Another problem cynics had was the gap between this and the last film, mostly due to Stallones age. Now they could have made a Rambo IV in the 90's It probably would have been big and action packed, probably something like True Lies, and it probably would have been entertaining but the time has added to the film and the character if Stallone had tried to make another Rambo III it would have been stupid, instead he made a film about an ageing warrior, Rambo is darker inside, very much like he was in First Blood. Stallone's not just playing him as the super cool action hero but as an angry grizzled war dog, an ugly killing machine which I think is better than the others. The villains in this film are plain evil, I've never hated the bad guys like this for years, not even the villains in the other Rambo's where this bad in fact they where like Indiana Jones villains, we're bad just because we are. Where as the Burmese soldiers are shown doing what they do, it's sickening and you really are routing for them to be killed not just watch Rambo killing targets. The real footage from the beginning is really horrifying and the ultra violence throughout really slaps you in the face and says, this is what war is! If you are a huge fan you will feel very much like Stallone respects you, there is references and little nods throughout to all three films, involving a great montage sequence that gave me goosebumps. Goldsmiths music score is used as masterfully as the music was used in Rocky Balboa. As a Director Stallone has very much improved, the gap between Rocky IV to Balboa and this you'd think it was a different person, not that I thought his directing was bad in the past. The plot of the film on paper may seem old and predictable but it's the way the film is executed (No pun intended) that makes it so great, Stallone knows what emotional buttons to push which make this a heart pounding drama. The ending (I'm not gonna give it away) I heard people didn't like it, I loved it I thought it was the perfect ending, not only for the film but for the whole series. Just like Rocky Balboa it makes the whole series better as a whole. Trautman. "You're always going to tear away at yourself till you come to terms with what you are, Till you come full circle."
7.0~How a film can change your opinion...lean, mean it has to be seen!!! The_Dug Sign in Permalink When i first heard of a 4th film in the "Rambo" series i wasn't interested. The third one wasn't even that good when i first seen it twenty years ago and there had been so much in between 'Rambo 3' and the now proposed sequel. Then i seen the two rough cut trailers that had everyone talking. Since then i have read the various posts on I.M.D.B throughout the last year regarding the fourth entry in the series. The more i read the more interested i became in the new film. Maybe it was a slight touch of nostalgia or just the need for something more hard hitting in the action genre that i personally think has been sadly lacking from most releases, "Rambo" came out in the U.S a month before the U.K and i slightly spoiled the movie for myself by reading reviews and various discussions on the new film. Just last night i viewed 'Rambo' and all i can say is the new film was terrific. The overall feel that is expected from a Rambo film is present and correct with the violence at an all time high. Maybe it's just me, but for the first time since First Blood the story gives more depth and outline to the Rambo character. This film feels like the one and only true sequel to First Blood. (the 2nd and 3rd movies are still canon, but personally i think that everyone involved in this new 'Rambo' were aiming for a far more realistic and believable story than we had in the previous 2 movies in the series) Obviously the film has had its critics, but if your reading this all i can say is be your own critic. The film has flaws (don't all films), but this "Rambo" does exactly what it says on the tin. Lean, mean with no flabby sections that bog down the storytelling. No stupid in depth explanations to bore and confuse the viewer. Just another chapter in the Rambo characters existence. Enjoy it. I certainly did. As for all those who moaned that it was too short i again personally think it was just the right length. As for the ending. For some it has given closure to the series. For others it is a new door open for one final film. I would like one more set on Rambo's own turf. Just one more square go with whatever baddies come his way. I give it a good solid 7 out of 10. (i don't think there are any 10 out of 10 films) For someone who originally wasn't interested in a fourth film i have had a real turn around and have once more begun to enjoy Rambo. Regards, The Dug
10.0~Welcome Back Rambo brunod_1987 Sign in Permalink The best...is simply the best. Starting from First Blood: Part One and till the last part Stallone never disappointed me. Hell of an action, hell of a hero. I can say he's one of the best action actors ever. Before seeing Rambo i doubted in Stallones performance and the only reason was because of his age. He did a great job in Rocky but you have to say that Rambo and Rocky, except the same actor, have a lot of differences between each other. While on Rocky you have to fight in the ring versus an opponent, on Rambo you have to fight in the jungle versus an army, killing, trying to survive, trying to save lives and to save yourself and that's what Stallone did. He gave everything he had so that he could make Rambo a big 2008 hit. A realistic movie, not wasting a minute to get in the action and making Rambo in the end understand that he can't give up on his country, he can't give up on his people. Even though this might be the last part of Rambo one thing is for sure: He's gonna be a legend, he's gonna be the unforgettable movie action star, he's gonna be everybody's hero. Watch this movie and you will never regret. 10/10 - Everything was perfect.
7.0~Excellent Sequel theonepf Sign in Permalink Stallone provides a solid ending to this series. The action was intense and graphic, but it definitely kept you interested. Stallone does a superb job of portraying the much older hero who has slowed down a little and has become even more cynical. He was in good enough shape and did an excellent job keeping credibility for our hero without trying to be the super hero of Rambo 2 or 3. This movie erases any criticism regarding the series being nothing more than an unrealistic action series glorifying war to make a dollar. You will walk out of this movie realizing how disgusting war is and can be, and that good will and positive thinking is not always enough to make a difference in the world. The weakest part of the movie is the acting performance of the main female character, but it was not bad enough to ruin the movie. Stallone wrote an excellent ending for Rambo, John J. that was not expected, but makes you believing things will work out for him long term. It was a simple ending, but extremely effective.
9.0~More Timely than Today's Headlines - 2008's Best So Far vitaleralphlouis Sign in Permalink An action film with a real honest-to-God story, and characters you care about, Stallone comes roaring into 2008 to show the coke-sniffing lefties how to put together a movie. Boasting the finest cinematography and the best editing of 2008, the movie's 1 hour 20 minute running time shows the empty-heads like Peter Jackson how it's done. When the film was made and released few Americans knew much about the suppressive regime in Burma that today is letting their people die rather than accept outside disaster relief. The slaughter of civilians, including children, sometimes made into a fun-and-games sport by the Bermese government might just shock your everyday Liberal Wimp. Well, boo-hoo! Worse, the film portrays real ideals of heroism in a way that'll appeal to young viewers. Imagine the mental anguish to the Cut-and-Run crowd. I think this movie got caught up in the squabble when the Weinstein Company (formerly Miramax) split from Disney, otherwise the promotion of it would have been better. Stallone is still strong box office, but in any case it's now right there in DVD. See it! No, don't wait; I mean right now.
7.0~Last entry directed by Stallone with lots of frenetic action and plenty of blood and violence ma-cortes Sign in Permalink Thrilling and moving Rambo episode in which he returns to war and to rescue American prisoners . The famous trilogy has been completed by this recent ¨ John Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand ; nevertheless the best considered is the original . Violent movie with Rambo character who started in ¨First Blood¨ and that launched Stallone career going on his successful Rambo episodes . Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is top-notch , he was a previous Green Beret , now retired and living a pacific existence in Thailand . He has retreated to a easy life in a rural Thai village next the Burmese frontier , capturing snakes for local entertainers, and transporting visitors in his old 109 PT boat . But John Rambo joins a group of mercenaries (Graham McTavish, Matthew Mardsen) to venture into war-torn Burma, and rescue a group of Christian aid workers (Julie Benz,Paul Schulze) who were abducted by the ruthless local infantry who carries out a brutal massacre . He then frees the prisoners but cruel soldiers sett off in pursuit and Rambo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares , puts dangerous traps in the jungle woods and mountains . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers . From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of explosions and some of the best action scenes ever made , including an impressive machine-gun attack . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel one army man and excellent Julie Benz as suffering missionary , in addition the veteran Ken Howard and including some flashbacks of deceased Richard Crenna in an enjoyable homage . The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed on location in Arizona, USA ,Chiang Mai, Thailand and Mexico . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by the cameraman Glen MacPherson . Splendid and rousing musical score by Brian Tyler. This nail-biting film is well played , produced and stunningly directed by the great Silvester Stallone . The motion picture is preceded by the original ¨First blood¨ by Ted Kotcheff with Richard Crenna , David Caruso and Brian Dennehy, in which Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully imprisoned and he pulls off the break-out ; Rambo II by George Pan Cosmatos with Martin Kove, Steven Berkoff and Julia Nickson, in which he's forced to go Cambodia in search of American POWs , and followed by ¨Rambo III¨ with Kurtwood Smith and Spiros Focas and of course Richard Crenna , in which Rambo against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan and he goes behind Russian-dominated enemy lines too rescue his former coroner from jail . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans . It's a movie for adrenaline lovers and frantic thrillers buffs. Rating : Good, entertaining but violent , two thumbs up . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this exciting film still has its magnificent moments. This large-scale and lavishly produced pic attempts a peculiar atmosphere with spectacular results . Rating : Better than average , well worth seeing .
6.0~Rambo returns to doing what he does best, soaking jungles in blood and guts. TheMovieDiorama Sign in Permalink Admittedly, I've never seen any of the previous instalments, so I was unsure what I was letting myself in for. Safe to say that the certification it obtained was very much needed because this was extremely violent. Outrageously bloody, packed full of bullets relentlessly severing limbs and Stallone being a total badass as usual. Just a shame about the supporting characters and clichéd plot. John Rambo has been quietly living in Thailand, to which he is soon tasked with saving the lives of various captives from a group of savage Burmese military officials. Very few words are spoken by Rambo, as he lets his piercing arrows do the talking. Cracking craniums, detaching arms and slicing bodies in half. His weaponry is the stuff of Gods. Stallone puts the majority of the camera's focus into the blazing action and visceral savagery of these freedom fighters, often far too distressing to watch. Seriously. Inhumane actions that manage to convey some totally unexpected emotional impact. That's before Rambo continues his rampage across the thick jungles of Burma, making you fist pump the air as he decimates an entire squad like some sort of avenging deity. The "damsel in distress" plot is somewhat outdated and acts as flimsy motivation for Rambo, detracting from the true monstrous story at play. The innocent group of individuals wanting to help civilians and the mercenaries sent to save them were functional as characters, just slightly dull and unmemorable. A few stupid scenes, particularly the atomic bomb explosion, diminished the realism of its environment and possibly made me face palm. Also the CGI gore was noticeable at times, yet fortunately infrequent. The concluding thirty minutes of bodies flying in every direction and exploding like blood-filled water balloons can be mind-numbing, but I'll be damned if this wasn't some old-school fun.
6.0~Great homage but could have been better! homey104 Sign in Permalink Okay, after hearing about the new "Rambo" film before it was released in theaters I was siked up about it! I even watch the last three "Rambo" flicks on youtube.com in order to get pumped for the fourth installment and after the day finally came to watch for what I thought will be the best action film to date with full anticipation and expectation... Well, the film actually delivers but not much, the film was actually good but I expected better and it had a lot of potentials aleast enough from keeping the film from being a complete disappointment and were only a few flaws in the mix. First off I was expecting the film to be on the same level & on the same league as the last two films if not higher but apparently it's just not there! Warning: Spoilers The film puts John Rambo in the heart of Burma where it's been said that the Burmese war has been raged on for 60 years, the Burmese army have abuse their authority gunning down villagers, kidnapping their women & children while killing some of them and warned them that they will be consequences of they defy them! Mostly raping their women and forcing their children to become Burmese soldiers! I including many have expected John Rambo to be put into a different new environment but instead Rambo is once again put into an Asian jungle, but I'm okay with that! Burmese army are so ruthless as they are despicable, in fact you'll hate them so much you'll be urging to see Rambo kill them all! The action was undoubtedly violent and gory at best which was the point of the film! The only flaws were the film felt so rush through but above all there was no climatic style battle not even in the end, instead you just see Rambo using a truck mounted machine gunner most of the time decapitating Burmese soldiers and stabbing then slices the Burmese leader in the end, and that was it!!! We see Rambo get into a Helicopter vs. Helicopter battle in the second installment then a Helicopter vs. Military Tank in the third installment but in the fourth installment instead of something spectacular we get what was stated earlier! Personally I hope this isn't the last we see Sylvester Stallone portraying his role as John Rambo! But still the film is a great homage to the previous "Rambo" films aleast thats all it's good for anyways!
7.0~One of the best action films in recent years master-yoda99 Sign in Permalink Critics hate Rambo, it seems to me that in modern days. People judge whether if a film is worthwhile by several factors: 1.) complex story line 2.) CGI effect 3.) plots with twists. Personally, I don't really appreciate any of the factors I listed above besides CGI effect. The truth is, I often find modern day films (films made in the last 5 years) contain complex story line and characters yet, without any sort of motivation or purpose. Movies such as the Bourne trilogy, 300, or any of those movie that preach the idea of "how to live a better life" movies, are essential empty in essence. Rambo, just like Rocky Balboa both contains one dimensional characters and story line. Rambo is a ex-solider who is haunted by his past war experience and has somehow lost faith in everything in this world. Yet, in the end he was able to come to realise that he should use his ability as a war machine to bring about some change in this world. Even if it is just saving one couple's life. The film also exposed what really is happening in Burma, while the world is focusing on the Middle East for the interest of oil. People forget that there are other places in the world that deserve if not more, equal amount of attention from the international community, and Rambo exposed this truth to everyone. Therefore I think this is actually one of the most purposeful movie since Rocky Balboa last year. A 7.7 at IMDb is an insult, this film deserves at least an 8.5!
8.0~THIS MOVIE WAS Awesome paul291971 Sign in Permalink When I went to see this movie i was not expecting much from it other than entertainment value. However I was wrong this movie was awesome. I wouldn't recommend this movie for all audiences due to the graphic violence, and trust me without giving anything away here the violence is very graphic. The story line was very solid to me it appeared that Stallone had put a lot of research into the film and the direction of the film was excellent. If you are looking for an all out action movie with a great story I highly recommend this last installment of the RAMBO sequels. I give this an 8|10
1.0~2.59 killings per minute. darin-wissbaum Sign in Permalink Someone needs to tell Sly its time to either kill off Rambo or put it to rest. This saga is starting to drag. This film is no different than the Rambo sequels since part II with lots of blood and gore. For a guy that was haunted by war as Rambo clearly was in First Blood he seems to have no problems since then accepting missions as some cold blooded mercenary for hire that involve a lot of explosions, dead bodies, lots of blood, guts flying all over, stabbings and whatever else Rambo can think up to kill someone. I guess he is over his post dramatic stress disorder. First Blood was a stylish film that at least made some sense. I mean it is plausible that some Viet Nam Vet or someone haunted by war can be pushed to the limit and almost destroy a small town. Now Rambo is nothing more than some killing machine that I no longer sympathize with.
9.0~Astounding! zuccozoid Sign in Permalink This ain't your daddy's Rambo- this a powerful, expertly made action thriller with a pure and powerful message: GOOD is worth fighting for! Stallone is perfect: he is the Dirty Harry of the jungle; no silly dialogue, no unnecessary humor - he plays it straight down the line; the worst I can say is that it may be too much like Apocalypse Now - but it dovetails nicely with that film, and this RAMBO is done with power and respect - bravo, Sly! Caution: although the violence is highly stylized a la Peckinpah, RAMBO is EXTREMELY violent and NOT for kids who don't understand right and wrong..
2.0~John Rambo IV rajdoctor Sign in Permalink John Rambo Sylvester Stallone  the name sounds so much nice memories of movies that we loved and enjoyed, especially the series  Rocky and Rambo. The last (hopefully) of Rocky series was released last year, and Rambo followed in the footsteps. Just as a tribute to the old legendary hero I went ahead to see Rambo. This time the setting is in Burma  the ruthless Junta Government, and Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is asked to help some missionaries who want to go and help some villagers. Rambo helps them to reach the remote Burmese villages, but goes full fledge into his usual combat mode when the missionaries are kidnapped. After lots of gun battle and fights finally the missionaries are saved and the troop of Junta government killed. There is not much to the story, and the narrative is also something picked out from eightees. The added stuff here is the video-game version of killing shown on screen, which is appalling and unnecessary. Sylvester Stallone tries to bring back his usual mannerism  cold and angry style, but to vain. Those times are gone-by. Nothing much to write about this bloodied movie, which is directed by Stallone himself. I think, by going ahead and making Rocky and Rambo again  at his age, Stallone has tried to prove a point to someone. Who knows to whom  but the output is not as good as we would have expected from Stallone. SS, we want to see you revived in a new genre of cinema, that suits your age, profile, and cinema that is today's  intelligent and contemporary. (Stars 2 out of 10)
10.0~A fitting finale to the Rambo series... slcbill Sign in Permalink This is a tremendous film. Stallone has proved, once again, that he can exceed even himself. He has given us a fine career. His last two movies, "Rocky" and "Rambo," are the proof positive of his multifaceted talent. This film also brings us to the realization of some fundamental realities. First, it is completely realistic, not just with the violence and gore, but with the actual circumstances among the people of Burma today. As seen in the recent flooding, the people of Burma live and die under one of the most oppressive, inhumane and unjustifiable military juntas the world has ever seen, and have for decades. Why the world allows this to continue is a testimony to the deterioration of conscience in the general populace and the unwillingness to sacrifice for the good of humanity. There will never be another "greatest generation." The second reality is the visualization of a few dedicated individuals who, under the worst of circumstances, risk and give their lives for the betterment of others. A moving film, Mr. Stallone, you make us proud...
10.0~The return of the flawless action movie dswindle07 Sign in Permalink I went in to this movie expecting it to be great. I saw how even after 20 years Stallone can make a miracle such as he did in Rocky Balboa. Stallone completely blew me away in this film. This movie takes action and explosions, mixed with blood and guts, and lightly sprinkles a little bit of drama on top. Not only will this movie keep you on the edge of your seat, it will keep you amazed that even after 20 years Stallone can stay in shape. We never get to see Stallone's bare chest like in the previous Rambo's, but you can clearly see his bulging arms and veins. If you want blood, you got it. If you want suspense, you got it. If you want explosions and violence, you need to go see this film today. You will not be disappointed at all. If you are only going to see it to make fun of it, go see it, you will be surprised. You may end up liking it after all. "Live for nothing, or die for something. Your call."
3.0~Are you joking? coldwaterpdh Sign in Permalink Aside from the excessive gore, this movie is so sad. First off, why did they call it "Rambo?" I mean besides the obvious attempt to cash in on a classic action flick, what does this movie really have to do with the original "First Blood" series? Oh wait...was that John Rambo in "Rambo?" We had to be reminded of that with several weak 'flashbacks' to the previous films and by his name branded on his duffle bag. Aside from those lame reminders, this film has nothing to do with the classic action series. Why is John Rambo a boat captain catching snakes in southeast Asia, just miles down river from the war torn Burma if he is 'laying low' and 'trying to forget the war?' It's ludicrous. And speaking of the war in Burma, we the viewers are treated to the usual modern Hollywood Hostel-style violence: children being butchered, women being raped, children having arms cut off, people getting slaughtered in the name of amusement at the hands of a 'brutal regime.' This movie is about as creative as a coloring book. We are treated to loads of slimy and visceral brutality just for the hell of it. If you want to see shocking, I recommend Italian horror and exploitation films. Not big-budget Weinstein brothers schlock. "Rambo" was sorry. 3 out of 10, kids.
7.0~you'll enjoy every spill in this mercenary-style movie phantomastray Sign in Permalink Believe me when I say, you will feel what a single bullet can do to human body and how devastatingly chaotic war is, all while watching this movie. From a evil military general portrayal of Burma and his merciless soldiers to a group of determined Christian aid workers willing to walk right into death (well until they're in awe and it's too late), to the equally shrouded rage pumping through the so-called 'boatman', every single moment in this movie will give you qualms. This pure adrenaline action watch would unleash raw blood fight, the likes of which are rare to find in even the most brutal action films. **you'd be surprised when you realize Stallone himself directed this momentum masterpiece**
5.0~Somewhere in the middle. crendine Sign in Permalink I tend to agree with other reviewers here that this installment in the Rambo series is not quite up to par with the previous three. It does contain an excessive amount of violence and graphic butchery and the plot line is a bit weak. However, there were a few elements of this film that I feel are worth mentioning and deserve some merit. First, upon careful examination of the mercenary team traveling with Rambo on this rescue mission, it's clear that these characters became the template for the team around Stallone in The Expendables series (ie one has a British accent, one is a weapons expert etc). Also, the fact that Rambo is part of a team instead of a one-man demolition machine sets a precedent for this character and at the same time, establishes the groundwork for The Expendables. Secondly, the actual character Rambo is supposed to be an aging war veteran who wants no part of violence anymore. Here, we have Stallone portraying an older version of Rambo not simply trying to revive his earlier roles. Lastly, the final scene of this movie clearly signals the end to the Rambo saga as he "comes full circle with himself". This, I felt, was very unexpected given the nature of the character. All in all, this film is far from a classic but rather a final chapter in the life of a very recognizable action hero.
10.0~By far the best movie directed by SLY, Amazing!! Touching! oscarzone Sign in Permalink forgive my poor English but I just saw one of the best movies I have ever see in my life! RAMBO! BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE DIRECTED BY SLY, AMAZING! TOUCHING! I woke up early morning and I run as fast I could to the theater for the morning screening. I was alone in an empty cinema so I can't tell u how the audience respond to Rambo , THE MOVIE STARTED as I expected and during the film I was thinking all the time that this movie is superior than RAMBO 2 AND 3 but not better than FIRST BLOOD until the last scene came WITH THE TWIST THAT I DIDN'T EXPECTED TO BE and I totally change my mind! yes my friends this is the movie of the year! the remarkable comeback of Sly! THE BEST RAMBO MOVIE EVER!!!!!! FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I GOT TEARS IN MY EYES WATCHING A MOVIE. Am a rocky fan and less Rambo fan but the last -5 minutes of RAMBO TOUCH me so much that I couldn't believe it! AS A FAN I RATE THIS MOVIE 11/10 THANK U SLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE KEEP DIRECTING YOUR MOVIES! YOU ARE MY FAVOTITE DIRECTOR/ACTOR
8.0~Delivers exactly what it promises garretsr Sign in Permalink This "Rambo" film delivers exactly what it promises: A great shoot-em-up style war film. If you want in-depth character development, or a sophisticated plot, look somewhere else. But, if you are looking for an afternoon of watching the famous (infamous) John Rambo take out evil-doers with a variety of weapons, you're in for a treat. If there is a deeper message here it is (thankfully) buried well beneath the surface. I rated it an 8 because, although I think this was pretty close to the best it could be, and would love to give this a 9 or 10. However, there is little character development or story. While I think that including either of those would probably have damaged this particular movie and possibly converted it into a "bad" movie, this means that it can be a very fun and entertaining movie, but can never be a "great" movie; at least by my standards. A word of warning: This movie is very violent and not because of "cartoon-like" violence. I would not take children to this unless you are sure they are old enough to separate movies from real life and are not squeamish.
10.0~As a BURMESE, let me give comment on this movie dragonlin5 Sign in Permalink I was one of the big fan of RAMBO series all time. I have been always loving all series but this one shocked me up lots. You all may have seen this as an ordinary film. For me, as a BURMESE, I know this is the true situation in BURMA and feel so sorry for people who suffering exactly as the same way as mentioned. Rapes, touches, Murders and breaking all of the human rights by the military governments are clearly film cast. I personally would like to Thanks to the director for letting the world know the current situation in BURMA. Stallone! you rock! Moreover I wish there will be a lot of RAMBOs in real world out there who will save many lives of innocent BURMESE people.
1.0~Bullshit...nice try at PR spin, Sly phatfreemiguel Sign in Permalink So let me get this straight. "Rambo" gets a rating of 8.8??? That means that this movie outperformed "Black Hawk Down" (7.6), "Blood Diamond" (8.0) and "Bourne Ultimatum" (8.3). Really? It's really THAT much better than those three critically acclaimed, box office favorites? Is it really true that viewers, in a frenzy of Stallonic appreciation, spontaneously entered remarks like "a masterpiece", "simply excellent", "as good as it gets", "the best of the series so far", "this movie will rock the world" and (my favorite) an action movie "with a message". All glowing comments entered within 24 hours of the film's release. Almost exclusively written in short, punchy, professional prose in less than 150 words. Really. More likely these so-called rave reviews are part of a "buzz" campaign engineered by the film's promoters. In Marketing terms, this is called "Web Raiding". And it's sad to see how something so obvious has made its way unchecked into IMDb. Sorry but I'm not buying it.
10.0~"Rambo" - The Movie For Guys Who Like Movies eckhouse24 Sign in Permalink "Rambo" is definitely one sick action flick that brings the genre back to where it was back in the 80's....It's a Movie For Guys Who Like Movies where the baddies are super bad and the hero doesn't take that kind of crap. It's balls to the walls action that doesn't pull any punches. Stallone is awesome once again as John Rambo and his writing and directing seem just perfect for this kind of film. We don't get bored by 30 minute build-up...the action starts pretty quickly and for the most part, doesn't let up. How this film didn't get an NC-17 rating is unknown to me, but I am glad Stallone had enough balls to make sure it was Rated-R and didn't try to pull out some PG-13 "Rambo". The film is in your face violent. It shows no fear in showing young kids dying, women getting raped, blood and guts getting spilled around. These bad guys are pure evil, just as they are in the real world. You can't wait for Rambo to get his hands on these evil bastards. As in most action films of the 80's, the acting is sub par at best with Stallone actually giving the best performance. The direction is better then expected with steady shots in time of peace and more camera movement during times of violence.... All said, this is definitely one of the best pure action films to come out in a long time, the kind of film where you can check your brain and still have a great time. A must see for all who love the Action Genre. ***1/2 out of ****
6.0~Second best. First watch First Blood. Mr_Arcus_Tangens Sign in Permalink This movie is the best Rambo movie after the original First Blood. It has plenty of action that finally (after Rambo 2 and 3) respects the laws of physics. Story is simple, but engaging. Bad guy is bad all the way and Rambo is of course unstoppable, but more in the sense of the First Blood (and not Rambo 2 and 3). The down side is that there is no epic feeling to the story. If you don't know who is Rambo, this becomes just some simple B movie with the high budget. But even if you know who is Rambo, you will remember this movie just as another action rampage. So, the action is on the spot, story could have been better, and Stallone is in good shape for someone born in 1946.
8.0~Gimme' the 50 Caliber...and be Sly about it... sirvertual Sign in Permalink Watching the 'extras-snippets' section (on the DVD, after the movie), I found myself enthralled in learning about weapons, like the Barrett .50-caliber long-range Army-sniper special forces, bad to the bone rifle. 'Engaging' targets at up to 2,000 meters 'with incredible, smack-in-the-middle precision...while taking the 'entire' back of the skull with it...'THIS IS NOT A TOY'. (hehe)... Lightweight, exotic-alloy, frame-mounted, bolt-action sniper rifles with multi-coated ex-low dispersion optics, sending rounds rifling at an astounding 4000 feet per second. Yes...this shoulder-fired, recoil operated semi-automatic .50 caliber consistently delivers fire-power against enemy targets that are usually considered outside a trained rifleman's limitations of range, size, location, mobility and visibility. However, in the hands of a trained sniper, it can surgically take out strategic targets while minimizing collateraldamage. It is capable of slicing through personnel targets (bad guy's heads, brain matter, eyeballs, etc) as far away as 1500 meters while causing extensive & explosive gory damage and pierce material targets built of welded cold-rolled, steel, like the bad guy's military vehicles out to 2000 meters (causing massive damage and hopefully carrying a few of the bad guys!)...It's what dads everywhere 'really want' for Father's Day!...I know I do and I'd never even heard of one before today! Good grief!, Man! Gee-Beav, that's just the 'tip of the iceberg' here! I mean 'heck' we haven't even started on Burmese 'factoids'...or any of the'inside the movie production biz's insider's-info that's included in thesnippets-extras section of the DVD!)... Oh, the movie!?!...a good, solid (yet predictable) storyline and of course it's incredibly gory, gritty, sweat & rain-soaked Rambo-Enigmatic mystic-realism with a powerful, on-the-money sound-bed hitting every note(in precision-perfect tempo with every head-popping, blood-splattered, gut-ripping explosion...and you can't overlook Rambo's own handmade & very lethal 'survival' knife action... In reality, It was a little disappointing when I realized the movie was drawing to a close, at what seemed like 'a bit too soon because there were still some nasty 'bad guys' left running away that coulda' used a lil' more .50 caliber action up their mean-asses...and you just kinda' knew there was gonna' be some(semi-forced) self-reckoning scene on the horizon...probably back in 'the hometown'...with a sunset in the same horizon...But you'll hafta' watch it yourself to see, cause I'm not spoiling it. At any rate, it gives anyone a great glimpse (and more) into the creative-type work ethic of Sly and crew...I'd think this DVD should be 'must watch material' for any film school student, plus the storyline is pretty good (dealing with the real-world...yet not quite news-covered) insanity going on south of the border...Burmese-style.... Rambo is definitely worth the time and actually left me wanting it to last a little longer...Yeah, this one's pretty slick...er, Sly...Make sure to check it out...Even if you just want to know a little more about the Burmese situation, or the movie biz and skip the movie altogether...It's worth the time, without question...
7.0~Returns to the roots of "First Blood" while providing plenty of gutsy action (literally!) and fun MovieAddict2016 Sign in Permalink First things first - "Rambo" is by no means a "perfect ten" film. The reason I'm giving this a full-star rating is because, in comparison to other films of its genre, and taking into consideration its aim as a film, it really succeeds on all levels. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's brutal, and it's way better than the last two films in the series.. Fortunately Sylvester Stallone approached "John Rambo" (or "Rambo" as it was retitled and which I'm not too keen on to be honest) with a fresh mindset. He had been developing the script a while but unlike "Rocky Balboa," Rambo is a fairly outdated franchise on almost all levels. Rocky is still respected by many people on an overall basis and he holds an everyman appeal as a character; it's not just a family film franchise that appeals to viewers of all ages, it's something that speaks to people for a number of reasons. Rambo doesn't have that legacy. He's not an everyman. He's not a symbol of hope and can-do spirit and self-empowerment. Nobody was really sitting there biting their nails waiting for another Rambo movie. Sly had a hard time finding distributors and made his own trailers to show off for potential investors. It was finally picked up in 2007 and the online fanbase of '80s action flicks cheered in victory, but most people I met in "real life" guffawed at the thought of another Rambo. It's easy to mock Stallone for apparently trying to resurrect the only two characters he's remembered for, and I really couldn't have cared less about another "Rambo" film since I only liked "First Blood" and thought the other two were pure rubbish; but as soon as I saw "Rocky Balboa," and read comments by Stallone about his Rambo script afterward, I became immediately interested in how he was going to approach this film. First of all, the action is well-staged. People keep talking about the 3-deaths-per-minute average -- but really, most of that is in the last 15 minutes during which a number of people aren't even killed by Rambo. There are dozens of soldiers fighting and it's really no different than an average large-scale battle sequence; Rambo does kill plenty of people, of course -- but hardly as many as in the other two sequels, or at least not quite as exaggeratedly; the action is far more realistic here than any of the previous sequels; Rambo is still, of course, fairly superhuman, but thanks to solid direction and gritty cinematography it "feels" very realistic; it's guerilla film-making on par with the original that the other sequels completely lacked. Rambo became such a symbol by 1988 that it was really all about Stallone flexing; not so much here. Rambo is downtrodden and world-weary and subdued again - much like the original character in "First Blood" was presented. One thing I have to admit I hoped for more of was character development; Sly seemed to keep communicating how intent he was on getting behind the psyche of the character, but most of it is very much surface-value stuff and the character still comes across as kind of stiff and wooden. Sly's very smart and articulate off screen but he's always had trouble with dialogue and "Rambo" suffers here as much as "Rocky Balboa" did in the same department; luckily Rambo doesn't talk much, but some of the early scenes between him and Julie Benz teeter on the edge of cheesiness. It doesn't help that Benz's role is underwritten; I got the sense that many additional scenes were either trimmed down before filming or deleted in post-production; there simply isn't enough room to expand the relationship, which is a shame, because it needs an expansion to really work as well as it should have. I will say, though, that it was refreshing to see Stallone avoid a romantic subplot - that would have completely pushed it over the edge into clichéd sentimentality. He avoids that which I give him credit for. I don't quite buy into the whole political/social commentary about Burmese brutality that Sly keeps pushing in interviews, but it does provide an interesting backdrop that gives the film an additional sense of realism that the others lacked. The action sequences are all staged very well and there's no excessive CGI or quick-cuts or Michael Bay-style editing -- it's very much old-fashioned, up-close, nitty-gritty action with real stuntmen and real special effects. The gore is as realistic as "Saving Private Ryan" which kind of shocked me at first since the other sequels were so goofy and over-the-top, but the film definitely benefits from this realism. Overall I was entirely entertained by the movie. It doesn't exceed expectations by a long shot - the character development as I mentioned above could have used a bit more work and certain areas, like "Rocky Balboa," come off as trying a bit too hard - yet it's still way better than it could have been and I don't buy into the critics complaining about the excess of violence; it isn't exploitative or overly brutal. It's a hard action film. It's rated R. If you don't want to see people getting shot and blown up, you shouldn't be watching a Rambo movie to begin with. But for what it's worth, this is the most intelligent and realistic Rambo film since "First Blood" - and I honestly wouldn't mind seeing a "Rambo 5" (as Stallone says he's currently penning) if he approaches it the same way. I hope his rejuvenated career doesn't cause investors to throw too much money at him and have him start over-using CGI, etc. -- the thing this film benefits from the most is its old-school back-to-basics style. I really enjoyed the movie and was pleasantly surprised that someone out there is still capable of making an old-fashioned 1970s-style action film without all the silly camp that came with the '80s.
10.0~I underestimated Stallone strawbalehouse1 Sign in Permalink After I was disappointed by Bocky Balboa I feared for the worst with Rambo. I thought it would be slow like Rocky 6 but I was wrong. It is not slow at all. Very fast, (I'm forgiving some of the mild dialogue and how quickely the christians change Rambo's mind). I also think Stallone deserves mucho credit for shining light on this situation in the world. I was not aware of the horrors taking place in Burma. We are very fortunate to live in the USA where we don't have to see children speared and there parents shot or tortured as a regular accurance. It is very sad to see that this kind of thing is more common than the freedom of America! Thank you Sylvester Stallone.
8.0~The epitome of graphic violence mtali42 Sign in Permalink I had very low expectations, especially after seeing 'Rocky Balboa'. 'Rocky Balboa' was too unrealistic to take Sylvester Stallone seriously. But after taking the gamble, and watching it, I am not disappointed. This is the type of film that I'll never get tired of. Big guns, graphic violence, a big knife, the classic Rambo bow and arrow, and awesome one-liners. The story was nothing new compared to the other Rambo films, but the action, as always with Rambo, was all that was necessary. Most certainly not losing a step from the first three classic films. Sylvester Stallone who's career was certainly dying, came back with a defibrillator and boosted it back to where he left off since 1996's 'Daylight'. I can't wait for his next film. Hollywood needs to go back to the 80's type of action films, ridiculous, but awesome.
10.0~Stallone still has it! the_headless_cross Sign in Permalink OK, I will admit when I first saw the trailer for this I had not seen ANY of the Rambo movies. Don't not ask me why, I don't know either. Well, I prepared myself by watching them all and out of this sweet series I have to say the latest one is the best! Now if you're looking for something a little more...what's the word... story driven, see any of the Oscar nominated movies. If you want balls to the wall, no holds barred action Rambo is the movie for you! Is Stallone seriously in his 60s? Well, I guess 60 is the new 40! The guy can still move, still ripped (never takes his shirt off in this one, but look at those arms!) and everything else! And the violence? Well I don't know the last time I ever squealed like a school girl at an action movie! Even when the carnage was over my smile still stayed on my face ear to ear! What a blast! Oh and what was it that Tango said about Rambo in Tango and Cash? Well, sorry Tango, you have just been proved wrong!
9.0~Rambo Delivers!!! bample47 Sign in Permalink Please note: I posted my review on several message boards, just editing it for user guidelines and to save time. this is not a web raising attempt by the industry. this is from a true Rambo fan and may contain a few spoilers. OK, here's the deal. I was really disappointed that they were coming out with a new Rambo. I thought with the unrealistic (yet some how entertaining) Rambo 3, the fourth installment would surely be the massacre of another 80s iconic character. Much to my ignorant surprise... Rambo delivers!!! if u are expecting a plot, an Oscar winner, or a drama...go home! this is clearly not the movie for u then! this is for the early 80s kids like me that know what a true action movie is and what it's worth. Action movies mean real stunt men, blowing things up, no overabundance of cgi, and a fast-paced movie...and did I mention action!!! if u liked the success of transformers and thought it was a good re-inventing of a legend, then you'll most definitely like Rambo. there isn't a minute after the first 30 minutes where this movie slows down!!! Seriously, if Sly wanted to end his career as an action star (on a good note), this is the way to do it. Absolutely do not listen to the critics!!! they were way way off on this one! one critic called it boring?!?! the whole thing is a blood bath...how the hell is that boring?!?! When that guy dissipated with that stationary machine gun (as shown in the trailer) I was left wanting more!!! When Rambo used that machine gun period the audience wanted to join in he action! Now as I try and calm down because I am pumped up like a U.S Green Beret giving an a** kicking, I will tell u...if u haven't seen Rambo and want an entertaining old school action movie, GO SEE IT! It does not disappoint! If u want to see "A Beautiful Mind", "Monster's Ball", or even "Atonement", which are good quality dramas, then DO NOT see Rambo. Sly does not disappoint this time around! Just keep the following things in mind: (1) There are no Matrix-style effects. (2) Expect minor plot, with TONS of explosions true to the old school action movie way. (3) Do not listen to the critics on this one (4) And lastly, do not compare Rambo to Rocky. This is the classic Sly mistake. Yes, they're both his iconic characters, but no...they are not even close to being the same. Rambo is dark, Rocky is uplifting. If you keeps these little things in mind, you will most likely use this clearly as an "entertainment" experience, seeing as Rambo obviously is not real life.
6.0~This is not a Rambo movie nicolovvassil Sign in Permalink I was waiting for this movie for a long time.I love the Rambo movies, especially Rambo II and III. But to me Rambo IV doesn't fall into that category.If you want to see top quality on-screen violence you should see that movie, but if you are expecting the magic of a Rambo movie you will be disappointed.Stallone is too old and too fat(you wont see Stallone with a naked upper body here) for this.He is doing not much of the action in the movie himself, because this time he has the help of mercenaries.So I would say that the good old days when John Rambo killed his enemies all by himself, mean and quietly, are over.In this movie Stallone only fires a couple of arrows and a machine gun.Another important thing that makes out a Rambo movie is the score. I was again disappointed to hear the famous Rambo theme only at the beginning and the end of the film.The lenght of the movie is something above 1h 20min, which I find pretty short in the era of the 2 hour film. On the other hand the movie compensates with unseen brutality:children murdered, women raped, heads chopped off, body parts flying around and so on.So I think Stallone hit the right spot with the expectations of the audience.But it takes more to make a real sequel than just to follow the main idea of showing violence.Stallone did good with the last Rocky movie, it was authentic, which I cannot say of Rambo IV.
1.0~Pure pornography MOscarbradley Sign in Permalink "Rambo" is actually the first Rambo' film I've seen and it will probably be the last. This is an appallingly and sickeningly violent movie, pure pornography, in fact, that exploits the dreadful events that happened in Burma in the name of 'entertainment'. It may be very well made and the action sequences are certainly very realistic with severed heads and limbs flying every which way but it serves no purpose and leaves a very bad taste in the mouth. Stallone not only reprises his role as Rambo but also co-wrote the film and directed as well. He should be ashamed of himself.
8.0~Live for Nothing... or Die, for Something! freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink Rambo has finally come full-circle after the success of First Blood and 2 poor sequels. Along with Rocky Balboa, this film has helped kick-start Stallone's career and give his title character a heart and soul again. Rambo is also re-introduced to a new generation. Rambo is set 20-years after the events Rambo III. Rambo is an older character and living in Thailand as a boatman and capturing snakes for locals. In neighbouring Burma the civil-war against the Karen people was becoming more brutal and dangerous. The Burmese army was using a extremely brutal commander who struck at villages at will, killing masses of people, forced boys to join the army, force people to run over minefields for bets and capturing women to perform sex acts. A group of Christain doctors planned to go Burma to work in a village and believing they could make a difference. They ask Rambo to take them but he refuses at first until Sarah (Julie Benz) convicts him. Whilst in Burma the village the Christains were in was attacked by the Burmese army and the missionaries captured. The head of the Christains ask Rambo for assistances, asking him to take a group of mercenaries. The mercenaries think Rambo is no more then a old boatman and don't want him involved in the mission. But as they witness a small group of Burmese soldiers torturing some civilians Rambo is brought into action and convicts the mercenaries all they can to save the missionaries. In Hollywood there is a trend to revitalise franchises from the 80s, partly to save some actors characters. This happened with Terminator, Die Hard and Indiana Jones and there are talks about sequels to Lethal Weapon, Mad Max and Ghostbusters. Stallone's career had really hit the rocks after flops like Judge Dreed and a remake of Get Carter. Rocky and Rambo revisits basically got him back on task. The success of Batman Begins and Casino Royale show that re-boots do work and that's what happened with Rambo. Whilst Rambo II and III were cartoonary Rambo takes a more realistic approach, which worked for Saving Private Ryan, the Nolan Batman and the new Bond. Rambo is a more humble and a more reluctant hero and has an even more bleak out-look. Rambo doesn't do any super-hero feats and is a more down to Earth character and the violence much more realistic. It was good to see how brutal warfare can be and more serious. First Blood had a serious message about the treatment of Vietnam veterans. The second two films were just Neo-con pieces of trash. Here Rambo finds his soul again and tackle a serious issue; the Burmese civil war and the pile of the Karen people. The series fines it soul again, criticising a really horrible regime which we have all seen on the news. The film is very popular with the Karen rebels and Burmese critical of the regime. Stallone offers a strong performance, and some of the other actors are note worthy, especially Matthew Marsden as Schoolboy and Graham McTavish as the foul-mouthed head of the mercenaries. However, Julie Benz was more hit and miss. This film was derided by some critics and has a low rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But this is a case of the critics getting it wrong, with the film popular with fans and non-fans of the series, and has a good rating on IMDb. I personally think you don't need to see the previous Rambo films to enjoy this one, but First Blood is worth watching. Rambo is also a surprising short-film, lasting 1 hour and 20 minutes. It handles everything it needs to and doesn't drag the film out. Rambo is a bloody entertaining film (and I mean that in more ways then one). The film has the highest kill-per-minute rate in film (hell yeah!), but surely that honour shouldn't go to Terminator 3 seening nuclear bomb kill 3 billion people? There is talk about another sequel, but I feel that the film and the series ended nicely and a sequel isn't needed.
8.0~Updated 80's action aesthetic breaths fresh, yet familiar air into an industry filled with 'pretty boy' heroes. brmanuk Sign in Permalink In an industry clogged up with sorry multimedia cash in's, neutered to guarantee widespread commercial success with the (13-17 year old) masses, Rambo (2008) breaths fresh, yet nostalgically familiar, air into a system which in recent years has all but abandoned actions films in favor of recyclable light shows for the Playstation generation. Whereas many recent action films (The Matrix series, Die Hard 4.0, Bourne, MI:3 etc) have relied on an overuse of CGI, MTV editing and what can only be described as 'shaky camera', Sylvester Stallone has nixed this style in favor of returning to the old school aesthetics, and indeed ethics, of the 1980's action film. The film is undeniably a throwback to days gone by when 'action' films were exactly that - scenes of violence pieced together by a flimsy patriotic story held together by cartoonish characters who ooze absurd amounts of testosterone. Whilst Rambo undeniably harks back to 80's action films, the film has updated the bloodletting for the post-Saw generation of film goers. Whereas Rambo: First Blood Part II displayed Rambo as a killing machine mowing down hundreds of Viet-Con troops, Rambo displays Stallone mowing down hundreds of Burmese solders; albeit with a lot of bloody gratuitous violence. This, as mentioned earlier, makes for a familiar yet all too refreshing change from the commercially friendly action films thus far of the 00's. Whilst most action films this millennium have relied on fast cuts, montage and cut aways to seemingly 'suggest' violence (and receive a lower classification rating), Rambo goes balls-out to display it in a gloriously exploitative manor, much akin to the torture-porn aesthetic of so called 'horror' films as of late. Where Bruce Willis failed to produce what he promised would be "Kick ass, old school action" for Die Hard 4.0, Stallone has succeeded in successfully updating this formula for a generation of movie goers who long for the action films of yesteryear yet expect the blood-letting of recent titles such as Hostel. Whilst I don't believe it'll happen, I certainly hope the films success at the US box office will convince producers to repeat the updated 80's action aesthetic Stallone has carved with this film. No more flashy, filter filled, shaky films please. Bring on the second coming of the 80's action film.
10.0~Great movie but with a message marrio415 Sign in Permalink I see comments about the violence and gore being totally unjustified in this movie well to fight violence you need a greater violence and one which gives them just that.But if you think the violence is there just because it has to be well your wrong it actually needs to be as this movie is about a real live situation that is happening right now in Burma and with the junta regime.What they are doing to the villagers and rebels of this country is barbaric well it's genocide and this movie captures all that is happening in that country.I won't go into saying much about the movie except to say be prepared for some realistic action and battle scenes(Very gory) and scenes of torture.
8.0~trailer does not do justice devilsguy5 Sign in Permalink lets start off by saying wow................ i was shocked by this movie, i went in with extremely low expectations with this one because of the previews for it. the story line is simple but very effective it is on the same grounds of saving private Ryan, mercenaries are called to rescue some captured missionary workers, Rambo is hired to be their guide since well he delivered those missionaries, this wouldn't be a Rambo movie with out sly having some scenes of action in it and this movie does not disappoint, it is by far one of the most brutal movies i have ever seen, it surpasses saving private Ryan, black hawk down, we were solider, and any other graphic war film you have seen because well that is what this is a war film. i did not give this film 10 stars because well there are some parts that just do not fit and that is the female lead, her acting was bland and not very believable and of course some of sly's scenes but we are not watching this movie to see sly be emotional honestly and he does show some, but we are watching this to see Rambo kick some major ass. overall it was a great action movie, not the best action movie of 08 but it is up there, the trailer does not do this justice at all.
3.0~Opps, I bought the wrong movie david-sarkies Sign in Permalink Don't you hate it when you are down at the video shop (or Cash Converters as I was) and you buy a DVD thinking that it was one movie and it turns out to be something completely different. Well, that is what happened to me with this movie. I thought it was First Blood, but for some reason my mind did not register to the fact (at the time) that the first Rambo movie was called First Blood and not Rambo. Actually, my mind had also completely forgotten the fact that a forth movie had ever been made, though I do vaguely remember it, it was sort of one of those things that you don't even let enter your mind for fear that it might crowd out something more important. To say that this movie was rubbish is to give a bad name to rubbish, which, to be honest with you, is something that I really don't want to do here. In fact, it is difficult to describe this movie without actually using any profanity (which IMDb doesn't like me using, which is okay, because it forces me to be more intelligent with my use to language in describing how bad a movie is). Okay, I have so far spent two paragraphs telling you that I really did not like the movie, and not why I did not like the movie. Well, for one thing, it wasn't the gore, because Quentin Tarrintino uses gore, but he uses it in a very intelligent way. This movie seems to not only over use it, but it gets to the point where you just shake your head and go 'so what is the point.' Actually, the point was to raise awareness of the plight of the Karin people in Northern Burma, and to demonstrate how brutal the Burmese army was. Okay, that is a noble purpose, but I have seen much better films deal with human rights issues than simply have John Rambo go bursting into Burma to blow away a whole battalion of Burmese soldiers with armour piercing bullets. The one thing that I didn't like was the representation of the Christians in the film. Come on, they were just normal people that had the label of Christian on them for the sake of us being horrified when they get captured by the Burmese. Seriously, churches do no hire mercenaries to go and rescue missionaries that get captured (it sort of goes against everything they stand for), though I would not be surprised if it did happen. Secondly, Christians generally don't go on short term mission trips into countries such as Burma (actually, that is also false as I have known of Christians going into Lebanon after the war with Israel, however time had passed, and Lebanon is actually a lot safer than say Burma, or Iraq. I have heard of Christians going into Afghanistan, but short term there was six months). I also suspect that Christian missionaries going into Burma would be incredibly experienced and thoroughly mentally prepared for the off chance that they would get captured and torture. Simply having them as sniveling scardicats simply did not rub it with me. What would I expect them to be doing? Well, I would expect them to be doing what Paul did when he was imprisoned, and that is singing hymns, psalms, and praising the Lord. A true Christian does not fear what the world throws at them because they know that their salvation is secure, and that they are free even though they may be imprisoned. However, I would not be surprised if you do actually get wet behind the ear Christians like this going into Burma and getting into trouble. Mind you, I would also not be surprised if some of them went off their head at John Rambo when he saved their life by killing a bunch of river pirates, but once again, a true Christian is likely to be thankful that their lives had been saved.
8.0~The Best of All Four xequtor12 Sign in Permalink I had previously heard about the Rambo movies and with the fourth one coming out, I became very interested in them. I decided to watch the 3 first movies a week before the new one came out. The movies were pretty good and I enjoyed all three (Second was best). But now, in all honesty, all three combined do not even come close to Rambo. Absolutely amazing. The action scenes are so well made that before you know it the movie will be over. If your a gore hound run to your nearest theater and watch it. It is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. People get blown up in blurs of organs and blood, heads are blown off, limbs are cut off. Squeamish people, STAY AWAY from this movie. You will leave in the first 30 minutes. If your a Rambo fan, it is a must see. If your more into the whole deep story thinking thing, you might not like it but you should still give it a try. It's has to be good because me and my friends actually sat down and talked about how good it was for 30 minutes. Excellent movie. Best action movie I have ever seen. MUST SEE.
7.0~Rambo at rest tightspotkilo Sign in Permalink In the Rambo universe this is the best Rambo movie of the lot. Admittedly we're talking about a limited and perversely esoteric universe, but, hey, that's a given going in. Why does this film enjoy this lofty perch? It's hard to put your finger on it, but I say it's Sylvester Stallone's relative evolution and maturity as a film maker. Stallone built into the story and into the Rambo character itself some understatement and subtleties not before seen. Understatement and subtleties were never Rambo/Stallone's main calling card, preferring instead brooding and vengeful extreme blunt force trauma, and make no mistake, we get heaping portions of the latter here too, but Stallone layers a little texture into the plot and into John Rambo not much before seen. "Not much before seen" rather than "never before seen" because in truth the first Rambo film, First Blood, did contain texture to the story and to the character, but it was of a different sort (Rambo as mentally unstable, a victim of an unpopular war). Besides, since that first entry Stallone took the franchise and character off in a different direction. The story begins with Rambo living somewhat contentedly in semi-retirement as a snake hunter and riverboat operator in Thailand. The inner-brooding Rambo, and maybe even traces of the inner-simmering Rambo are still there, but he seems to have to some degree come to terms with himself and the world. He is approached by a team of American Christian missionaries to take them upriver into Burma. The team's leader, Michael Burnett (played by Paul Schulze) earnestly tries to persuade Rambo to take them, but Rambo is having none of it. During this early scene some of Stallone's newly found understatement and subtlety shows itself. Michael, negotiating with Rambo to take them uppriver, tells about their humanitarian mission, while Rambo is tending to his caged snakes. While tersely telling Michael that Michael can't make a difference, Rambo unobtrusively feeds a little white mouse to a snake. Where the old Stallone would've highlighted this act, focused the camera on it, and then made an ostentatious display of the snake devouring the mouse, the mature Stallone does not. The focus is on the conversation and the mouse is in the background, and it happens quickly. We the viewer are left to ponder what we fleetingly saw, and only later realize the conceit of the metaphor. Rebuffed, Michael gives up. Undeterred, the only woman in the group, the comely Sarah (played by Julie Benz), picks up where Michael left off. She pleads with Rambo in just about every way possible to take them to Burma. Rambo still says no. More than once he tells her to "go home." After pleading doesn't work, Sarah resorts to basically stalking Rambo. In a conversation on the dock in a monsoon-like rain Sarah is able pierce through Rambo's impenetrably hardened exterior, touching him inside. "Maybe you've lost your faith in people. But you must still be faithful to something. You must still care about something. Maybe we can't change what is. But trying to save a life isn't wasting your life, is it?", she asks him. There's something about Sarah that reaches Rambo unlike anyone else, this Rambo or any previous Rambo. And we know at this point that Rambo has in some manner bonded with Sarah, because he finally relents. As an aside, I briefly wondered if this wasn't a set-up for some sort of love interest for Rambo, however counter-intuitive and implausible given their age differences, but at the same time it seemed possible, being uncertain about the state of Stallone's ego nowadays. Sarah informs Rambo that she and Michael are engaged, and that changed the dynamic, but didn't necessarily dispel the notion. Instead, it was Sarah's persistence and ability to reach Rambo on a purely human level --in no way sexual-- that dispelled it. At one point she says to Rambo, "You have family back home?" Rambo: "Father, maybe. I don't know." To which Sarah says, "Aren't you curious to see how things might've changed back home?" That simple exchange left Rambo at least contemplative, working on the soft inner Rambo, the Rambo of First Blood, who couldn't find his way home after all he'd been through. The first action scene follows soon, when they are overtaken by well-armed Burmese river pirates. The pirates quickly focus on Sarah, with obvious malevolent lascivious intent. At crunch time, with no way out, Rambo kicks into action, dispatching the numerous pirates with extreme and bloody prejudice in seconds flat. At this point we know that Rambo hasn't lost any bit of a step since we last saw him. We also now see that Rambo has bonded with Sarah, and that he's got her back forever and ever. Rambo ultimately drops the group off in Burma, where they'll go overland to their destination, and leave that way too, so they bid themselves adieu. But we know it's not really adieu. What follows for the next 60+ minutes is pretty much your standard issue search and rescue operation, Rambo style. Modern special effects galore. A veritable blood-fest . The film, despite its sensitivities and appeal to the soft side of Rambo, is perfunctorily taken out of the chick-flick genre. A little different twist though: Rambo works with a team of hired mercenaries, led by former SAS commando Lewis (played by Graham McTavish). Also of note is former SAS sniper extraordinaire, "Schoolboy" (played by Matthew Marsden), a loyal and efficient operator who has Rambo's back. Rambo shows himself a capable team player and leader, in addition to being a one-man doomsday machine. At the end, we see Rambo back in Arizona walking up the drive home to his father's ranch, presumably for the first time since he left oh so many years ago. Is this the end of the franchise? Maybe. Probably. We'll just have to wait and see. I'm betting it is. Rambo at rest.
7.0~Saving Private Rambo Treeman222 Sign in Permalink I'll admit, when I first heard about another Rambo in the works, I shook my head and laughed, while at the same time my inner 15 year-old did a back-flip. I knew I'd be there opening weekend. How could I not be? Either it was going to be mindless fun (parts I & II) or a horrid train wreck (Rambo III). Either one should be entertaining. Thankfully, its the former. Rambo was one of the best times I've had at the movies in awhile. It helped that the sold-out crowd was TOTALLY into it - cheering and clapping every time John J. went into action. It was more than just mass euphoria for the good old days of Sly's straightforward shoot'em ups though. I always thought Stallone was a by-the-numbers director, but here he proves that he really knows what works on a visceral level. This movie has some serious action scenes that deliver the goods with a punched-up, in your face intensity. Call it Saving Private Rambo. The film wastes no time setting up the scenario of well-meaning missionaries in danger, and then follows the rescue/chase pattern of most other Rambo films - once the action starts, it gradually escalates to a bloody crescendo. I don't know what was louder, the 50 caliber that Sly blasts away with for a good ten minutes, or the cheers of the crowd watching him do it. Some may call it dumb, but dumb really doesn't do a film that works this well justice. Simple is a better description, but who ever said K.I.S.S. was a bad thing? Sign me up for your next campaign Sly, I'll be there.
8.0~There is only one John Rambo. michaelRokeefe Sign in Permalink The ultimate warrior John Rambo is living peaceful and almost carefree in the mountains and jungles of northern Thailand. Not exactly mundane, John operates a longboat on the Salween River and captures cobras and pythons for sale to snake fighters. A group of missionaries arrive wanting to hire him to take them up river into war-torn Burma. After reluctantly delivering them with their medicine and religious materials, they are captured by Burmese National Army soldiers. John for the sake of one of the captured, Sarah(Julie Benz), shifts into attack mode and ends up leading a team of mercenaries to the rescue. The violence is grisly and extreme. Don't think about a body count...it is more like a piece count. Graphic and bloody mutilations and all the trappings of war. Also in the cast: Graham McTavish, Tim Kang, Paul Schulze and Maung Maung Khin.
10.0~Forget the Macho ways this is Stallone Stallion's Breathe! elnegroflowers Sign in Permalink If you ask me: do you want go to see Rambo IV? I say nope thanks! I just like "First Blood" and was pretty fine when I was young... how can I forget that shoulder suture?!... someone insist me, finally I saw "John Rambo"... and let me say: is not Rambo IV. If you like bloody action this is a "must see": This movie delivers and update the power of the action films from the '80s, you can feel along 95 min. the "First Blood" 's emotions again, is not just gory effects, is a blasting, burning, unstopping and realistic war action, and I say from now, a new era for the 21 century's action films. Nobody can do this better than Sly, great performance, great direction and a plain solid plot, a perfect cocktail of violence, drama, humanity and redemption, all done by him and... who cares the aging? acting is wine: improves with time. Thanks again Sly for your inspiration and all the people that was working with you in this masterpiece. Y hasta la vista John Rambo nunca te olvidare! 10/10 for action movie fans, just gore for the rest of casualties.
7.0~Live for nothing or die for something kirk-246 Sign in Permalink In this latest Rambo installment, John Rambo has retreated to a simple life in a rural Thai village near the Burmese border, capturing snakes for local entertainers, and transporting roamers in his old PT boat. Following repeated pleas, Rambo helps ferry a group of Christian aid workers into war-torn Burma, where the local Karen villagers are regularly tortured and massacred by Major Tint's sadistic soldiers. The humanitarian mission is going well, until the village is attacked and the missionaries are kidnapped, and Rambo is once again asked to transport - but this time a group of mercenaries, assembled by the missionaries' minister on a deadly rescue mission. This time he doesn't stay behind. So far,this is the only Rambo movie besides 'First Blood' that I have seen so far.Although, this movie isn't as comparable as 'Commando', it's is an entertaining and bloody movie that action fans will just want to see.
4.0~Rambo jboothmillard Sign in Permalink I had a feeling this film would be not all great even before I watched it, but with all the hype being put on it, and apparently lots of violence, I knew I should at least try it. Basically Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone, also directing and writing) now lives a secluded life in Thailand, where he spends time catching snakes for entertainment, and chauffeurs local people in his small boat. Even though he wants to avoid trouble, trouble finds him, a group of Christian human rights missionaries, led by Sarah Miller (Julie Benz) and Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze), want to rent his boat to go to Burma. For over 50 year, Burma has been a war zone, where Karen peasants and farmers are ruled by the brutal, murderous Burmese military, and they struggle to survive each day. Eventually Rambo agrees to take them up the river, and they end up in a raid and most of them taken captive. Rambo escapes, and as you'd expect, numerous deaths occur in his path, most obviously are made by him. Also starring Matthew Marsden as School Boy, Graham McTavish as Lewis, Tim Kang as En-Joo, Reynaldo Gallegos as Diaz and Jake La Botz as Reese. Stallone doesn't have the edge he used to in the three previous films, his age obviously is part of this, the story and dialogue are really lame too. For me, the only good reason to see this film is for the high over-the-top violence and blood spill from severing limbs with high calibre bullets and the old machete blade, that's it. Okay!
9.0~You think they'd know not to mess with Rambo! ltckeats Sign in Permalink If you love action with a bit of a political twist, Rambo has it for you in spades! The monosyllabic, flawed, but idealistic hero is back, big time. John Rambo is living in Thailand eking out a living catching snakes, renting out his boat (looks like the African Queen) and working as a blacksmith. When Christian Missionaries (including a doctor & dentist etc.) ask him to take them into Burma, "behind the lines" of one of the most blood thirsty dictatorships in the world, Rambo refuses. He tells them to go home. But like any good Christian Missionary, they decide they want to go anyway. Obviously the blood thirsty slime capture them and the Pastor of their church asks Rambo to take some mercenaries in to find them and bring them home. Those scummy bad guys should have never fooled around with people John Rambo likes!! The story is often gruesome and blood soaked, but not boring. There are positive messages of loyalty, well intentioned missionaries, a mercenary who decides to go beyond the call and that bad guys will eventually get their just punishment and you can enjoy it all!
10.0~Rambo - Finally "Full Circle" nrobison-2 Sign in Permalink "First Blood" and "Rambo" are films; "Rambo II" and "Rambo III" are entertainment. In "Rambo," Stallone finally brings his character full circle. In "Rambo," he is at least 60 years old (but it seems hard to pin down the exact date of action in "Rambo." Yet, he is capable of extraordinary feats (using the pistol on the boat is a great example; I know Green Berets his age that could do that). The compound bow is intriguing; it appears to be the same one as in "Rambo III," but there is no indication that the equipment survived. How could the bow, but not the other iconic Rambo accoutrements, have been retained? Also, what happened to the knives Rambo used in the second and third movies? I can't imagine the character discarding those weapons. Presumably, Rambo forged the third knife himself (I believe this scene was cut from "Rambo III"). One of the deleted scenes from "Rambo III" shows him retrieving weapons and making the knife for his mission to rescue Trautman (the scene also shows his dress uniform - I've been trying to get my father, who is an ex-Green Beret that is Rambo's age, to interpret it for me). I have no idea how this equipment could have been conceivably retained. The "machete" creation scene could have been replaced with Rambo retrieving the Rambo III bowie knife. Employing this as part of his preparation for "killing" might have made a stronger presentation. The middle of the film, the flashback sequence, is brilliant. With this, one can ignore the second and third movies. If you watch "First Blood" and "Rambo," then you understand Stallone's Rambo, not David Morrell's original Rambo or the ones from his movie tie-in novels. The end of "Rambo" parallels the beginning of "First Blood." Being from Arizona, I can certainly envision the ranch he arrives at (it is a fantastic visual image and setting - probably pretty close to reality). Bowie, AZ is just east of Tuscon. "Rambo II" indicated that he was of "Indian/German Descent." Interestingly, the books suggest that Rambo had a Navajo background, but they are in Northern Arizona. There's no sleeping bag over his shoulder at the end of "Rambo;" there's the M-65 Field Jacket, of course, the blue jeans, and an army duffel, with "J.Rambo" stenciled on it. All of Rambo's experiences, maybe even some equipment and gear (remnants of his past), are metaphorically contained in his bag. It would be a fantastic speculation to guess what is in the duffel. Rambo walks down the "long road," not to action and trouble as in "First Blood," or off to Vietnam, but to unpack his past. Bowie, AZ is certainly a "quiet little town" and maybe even "boring." Rambo's war is over, and he finally came "Full Circle."
10.0~An Homage maximusjakeus Sign in Permalink This is the type of movie that men in their mid-twenties have been waiting for. Growing up, we watched a great many kill-em-all actioners, such as "Commando," "Rambo 1,2 & 3," and so many more. We knew they were corny. We didn't take them seriously. They (hopefully I speak for all of us) didn't influence us to cause harm - we just watched them because they were great! Recently, most action type movies have focused primarily on special effects, fast-moving kung fu, and the like. While I don't want to take anything away from modern action movies, I hope I speak for a great many adults in their twenties and thirties when I say that this is a movie that we've been waiting for. Political correctness and all that stuff aside, this movie really serves as a testament to the great 80's action movies. If you didn't grow up, or aren't familiar with the classic 80's and early 90's action movies, you probably won't understand why some people think this movie is so terrific. Don't sweat it - sentimentality is a beautiful thing. Thank you, Sly!
10.0~A Stallone Masterpiece harryq Sign in Permalink If anyone doubted his acting ability this must surely set them straight. The role was perfectly presented and no unrealistic scenes were really present. Certainly when you consider the age of the actor and the character he portrays. Stallone's last performance in this and the Rocky conclusion before it has proved Stallone's absolute quality as a performer. I have watched Stallone not only bring to life two quality characters that have spanned generations and created new fans in each decade but I have also witnessed him bring them full circle in their on screen life in masterful performances. This type of accolade is only reserved for a special few actors that touch us all in different ways. Like him or hate him this film will rate as once of the greats in Hollywood history. Simply outstanding and a must see for Stallone fans and critics alike.
8.0~Naked idealism meets unrelenting brutality fredman5555 Sign in Permalink Action: 10 / 10 on action! It takes a few moments to develop, but then the action kicks off, and when it does, it just builds and builds until the climax. There's plenty of blood and gore as Rambo, sporting his trademark 50 caliber, blazes away. In fact, it's one of the few movies to shows how grizzly such an attack would be. Plot: 9/10. Overall, I felt that "Rambo" did an excellent job of portraying a world where the typical idealistic foreigners meet the harsh realism of a barbarian world. Many of us in the comfort of our homes feel like we want to "get in and do something" about the atrocities we hear of in the news so off we go with our ivory tower attitudes having little idea of the truth and reality behind man's inhumanity to man. Rambo (the ex-soldier) is portrayed as a perfectly wisened and jaded killing machine who tells the philanthropic party what they don't want to hear -- that they're in way over their heads fighting a fight they cannot win because their approach is so dramatically different as to be not even on the same plane. Surprises: 4 / 10 here. There are no surprises. You could write this one yourself, but it really doesn't matter. It's still enjoyable! Duration: 7 / 10. This is a surprisingly short movie as just shy of an hour and a half. I found myself wanting a little more by the time it finished. I think we tend to develop this internal chronometer of how long a decent movie should go, and this one only went about 3/4 of the way. Character development: 5/10. We don't learn much from character interactions. Rambo, reluctant as he is early on, seems to acquiesce in what seems to be a moment's time. There are also the typical showdowns between protagonists, antagonists, and so on, but these are quickly and incompletely developed. Synopsis: overall, I really enjoyed the movie. Yes, it has its shortcomings, but I believe its point is important enough for people to see, and the action certainly doesn't disappoint. I give it an 8/10! Enjoy!
10.0~John Rambo...a true action HERO carnie1257 Sign in Permalink My family and I went to see the much anticipated sequel to another Stallone movie, Rambo. I'm a huge Rambo fan, Rocky too. I was somewhat prepared for the blood and gore because of reviews I'd read months b4 the release. However, as a woman, it was hard to watch the bloody scenes...is blood really that red when people get blown to bits?...but as the movie went on I didn't notice as much. All I could do was cheer Rambo on while he scrambled thru rain-soaked Thailand terrain with his mercenary rescue force. I enjoyed watching the small tidbits of insight into the Rambo of First Blood..his battles w/ enemies and himself. A battle which, if u manage to notice above the action, he finally wins. What a fitting end to a sad story which I'm sure has been a reality to many men who have served their country. I have read many reviews here and for the life of me I cant figure out how anyone would find anything amusing about this film. Yes Sly is 61 and not as supple as he was but did u c his arms...laugh at that. It is a blow up, shoot up, gut, decapitate, mutilate, A C T I O N film. Nothing funny about it. No its not Oscar material but WHO CARES...ITS RAMBO!!!! Bravo Sylvester!
5.0~I was compelled to write a review here... witster18 Sign in Permalink If for no other reason than Rambo's rating sitting at 7.4 with the original 'first blood'. Rambo is a decent film, but in my honest opinion, it is a clear notch below First Blood. Sure, the production value is a bit higher given Stallone's financial status, but this film squandered a great chance to have John J. Rambo 'go out in style'. THis film has as much action as the previous entries and, by far, uses more gore and CGI than the previous films. If I were Stallone thinking about this one in pre-production - I would have concentrated on the character, his past, and what I could do to make this a more emotional and meaningful final chapter. Rambo needed more lines, his place in life needed explanation, his heroism needed acknowledgment(finally), and a tiny little bit of a love story might have thrown in a little wrinkle. Unfortunately, I didn't get any of that. This is a real 'cookie-cutter' action film - unfortunately it offers nothing more about John J. Rambo the man and doesn't have stand out performances like the original(stallone and dennehy come to mind)... For Me, everything just felt a little flat and all the action and gore couldn't save this acting-free action flick with no heart at all. Not a terrible movie... I say even with First Blood Part 2... a movie that depends on the action and nothing else. I wanted something else. We had some character development in the first film.... then they skipped over that point in the sequels - I thought Stallone could have really embraced that void here but he didn't... he skimmed the surface right when the credits rolled... he should have started the film at his parents farm instead of rolling the credits there. 54/100
9.0~Ultra-violent action pic truly delivers fertilecelluloid Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone, director, actor, and screenwriter, gets it right in "Rambo". This is a fast-paced, ultra-violent action pic that truly delivers. Rambo, now living in Thailand, is asked to escort a bunch of do-gooders up a river to Burma. As you'd expect, their good intentions are rewarded with rape, amputation, and bayoneted children. When a church leader pays a bunch of mercenaries to locate the missing do-gooders, Rambo is enlisted once again. As you'd expect, their narcissistic intentions are rewarded with massive bloodshed, gory dismemberment, and jungle justice. In a nutshell, this is a slammin' gorefest that is never boring. Heads are blown clean off. Human bodies are reduced to geysers of gore. In plain English, Rambo justifies his return. Stallone's performance is smartly low key. Although we know what he's capable of, he has fun making us wait for him to explode. The villains are sleazy Burmese military bastards with no redeeming qualities. Their leader even molests young boys when he's not breaking Geneva conventions. Being a big fan of aesthetically beautiful screen violence, I was initially skeptical of the promises this film's publicity was making. I'm overjoyed to report that the mayhem is gleefully realized and technically accomplished. The photography is solid, moody, and subdued, and the film's sound design is a winner. It's the best Rambo flick since "First Blood" and it manages to create a certain care factor that was missing from the previous sequels. The epilogue, which I won't discuss here, is an inspired stroke. Highly recommended.
7.0~Live for nothing, or die for something... paul_haakonsen Sign in Permalink With a gap of 20 years between "Rambo III" from 1988 and "Rambo" from 2008, then expectations were quite high for me towards this movie. And having grown up as a teenager with the likes of the "Rambo" trilogy, then the 2008 "Rambo" movie was long awaited. And now having seen "Rambo" a couple of times, I can with all sincerity claim that this 2008 movie was great. It is a good addition to the "Rambo" franchise, and it is right back in track and in tune with the old movies, although a hint of political correctness can be seen throughout the movie. But wanting to add a new layer to the "Rambo" movies, was an okay change of pace for director Sylvester Stallone (also starring in this 2008 movie). In this 2008 movie the story takes place in war-torn Burma. Vietnam veteran John Rambo is living a reclusive life in Thailand, away from his past and the life of a soldier. But trouble always has a way to slither back, and manages to do so again when Rambo is tracked down and asked to help a group of mercenaries trek into Burma. The story in "Rambo" was good, as it has been in the previous movies. But it is not the story which is the main attraction here, it is the abundance of action, of course. And "Rambo" offers more than enough action to satisfy us old fans of the franchise, as well as catering to a whole new audience. The acting in "Rambo" is what you would and could expect from a movie of this type. You know exactly what you get here, and people do not disappoint. Sylvester Stallone does what he does best here in this 2008 movie, and he proved that he was more than up for the task of bringing new life to the "Rambo" franchise. "Rambo" was missing Col. Samuel Trautman (played by Richard Crenna in the previous three movies). But given his death in 2003, it was of course not possible. I just think that the Trautman character was almost as much a part of the "Rambo" franchise as John Rambo himself. But of course, it is a matter of personal preference. I thoroughly enjoyed this 2008 movie, and it is right at home next to the other "Rambo" movies in any movie collection.
9.0~Adrenaline-pumping action in its purest form Mdgeist316 Sign in Permalink During this time of watered down sequels and fun for the family flicks, we badly needed a throwback to the 80's & 90's form of bad-ass, mindless action flicks. So who are you gonna call? John McClane? Nope. Dirty Harry? Wrong again. The Terminator? Please. Chuck Norris? Maybe, if he would get back into making those types of movies again. Our savior is John friggin' Rambo! This movie pulls no punches while managing to be extremely entertaining. You almost forget the fact that he's 62 years old, and he looks better than some young guys who would try a film like this. There is no slick martial-arts fighting or corny one-liners, this is a depiction of the savagery of war and a glimpse of the cruel activities going on in Burma. Thank you Stallone for bringing us back to the good old days before political correctness took over. Before we were introduced to films that wouldn't dare go the extra distance to make a few bucks. Rambo is by far the most entertaining action movie I have seen in years, and I hope Hollywood takes notice by giving us a trip back down memory lane more often.
1.0~Its nothing compared to Rocky sureshpandey001 Sign in Permalink Its the most boring movie , i have ever seen. Its a good thing that Rocky was released before Rambo or i would have missed a good movie. I mean whats to like i this movie. Just try and relate it to reality and you will see that "mercenaries" had no business in other countries. We have UN what the hell was "Aid Society doing" trying to cross borders illegally and causing military actions. And then helping the mercenaries? I don't think religion and war should be mixed in this way. Russia,US and Afghanistan was a good mix in earlier Rambo. This is just Boring, and just too tiring to watch.
10.0~Live and die for something... jon.h.ochiai Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone's "Rambo" has an emotional resonance. Stallone poignantly completes the John Rambo saga. Stallone gets it right. Not to mislead, "Rambo" is brutal and mercilessly violent. Unlike its predecessors "Rambo" is all realistic carnage, surrounding the Karen people's civil war against the heinous Burmese Regime. Director Stallone reminds us of this with opening images of the enslavement of Karen young men, and the rape and murder of women and children. Stallone's Rambo is a heroic icon. Though originally created by author David Morrell, John Rambo's mythology is really Stallone's creation. There is something pure and Zen-like about Rambo. Way back in the second "Rambo" movie, Rambo says, "To win a war, you have to become war" Rambo was trained to become the perfect killing machine-- who transcended to warrior. Like all warriors, honor is in his DNA. But what happens when there are no wars to fight, and you are without equal at killing? In "Rambo" I think John Rambo is Stallone's Shakespearean hero. Hold on there for a minute. The story by Stallone and Art Monterastelli brilliantly fleshes this forward. Perhaps, Rambo remains in self-imposed isolation in Thailand, because he feels that his usefulness has expired and that the world is better without him. The paradox being that the world desperately needs heroes. And Rambo is a hero. In a great narrative touch by Stallone and Monterastelli, Rambo is only known as "John". No one in the story knows of his past. However, his actions and courage soon define the hero anew. The world of possibility has evaporated from Rambo over the years. The idealistic missionary Sarah (Julie Benz) implores Rambo to take her party up the river into Burma, saying "We can make a difference." Rambo reminds her, "What you're trying to do is change what is" Sarah has faith. Rambo has lost all vestiges. Reluctantly, Rambo agrees to guide Sarah's missionary party that includes her insufferably pious and naive boyfriend Michael (good Paul Schulze). With incident Rambo gets them to their village in Burma. Eventually tragedy strikes and the missionaries are missing. The Reverend (Ken Howard) of their Church enrolls Rambo to find his people in Burma with the aid of mercenaries including former SAS Lewis (a good arrogant Graham McTavish) and sniper School Boy (charismatic Matthew Marsden). Here the storytelling evolves into the compelling. Granted the action is stark, brutal and visually enthralling. Stallone as Rambo is powerful. He looks amazing. He is vibrant and hulking of hard muscle. We all know about the HGH. However, in acknowledgment of Stallone, HGH and hard training is the deal. I think being older Stallone is able to tell a more human story, recognizing mortality. In preparation for his mission to rescue Sarah, Rambo admits to himself, "War is in your blood When pushed killing's as easy as breathing." Perhaps, "you can't change what is." Maybe you can only go with who you are, and ultimately make peace with that. Being a hero is about protecting the greatness of others. At a catharsis Rambo "pointedly" reminds mercenary Lewis, "Live for nothing or die for something." Life goes no, whether you're on for the ride or not. "Rambo" concludes touchingly. I applauded along with the rest of the audience at the Friday night show. John Rambo is an honorable hero, and deserves to find peace in the world. The supporting cast is amazing. Beautiful Julie Benz gives "Rambo" its soul. Matthew Marsden is exciting youth and strength. This is really Stallone's movie. He embodies in the aging Rambo the heart of a lion and endearing gravitas. Stallone eloquently and poignantly completes the story of John Rambo.
10.0~My favorite War movie of all time gavijayawardene Sign in Permalink Rambo is with out no doubt is my favorite War movie of all time. It's a well written story to me.Rambo is a character that i always cared for, another character like him is big boss from Metal Gear Solid both of these characters made me care about them.The movie gives me something i didn't hope for it brings back the stealth action that made First Blood a great movie,Sylvester Stallone always makes us/me care and feel for the characters example:- Rocky,Rambo.Unlike previous Rambo movies Rambo doesn't talk much instead he gives this Cold stare that makes my skin crawl.and of-cause the main 2 reasons that this is my favorite War movie of all time is that it has stealth action which most new action movies don't have and the final act is just mind blowing(literary),Arms fly off,Legs Fly off,heads Fly off and gets blown apart,it was just beautiful, it was one of the best action scenes ever to put on a movie and this movie had balls,just like Rambo Sylvester Stallone made the sub characters good too we care for them too.Sylvester Stallone can Direct,act and write movies very well and does a great job doing it.Rambo 2008 is an awesome war movie and it is my personal favorite of all time. thanks for reading ,take it easy.
9.0~Rambo Scarecrow-88 Sign in Permalink The synopsis is simple. A repulsive, completely evil militant group of Burmese soldiers are wiping out innocent Karen villages with Christian leanings. A small group of missionaries desire to boat to a specific village to help the lives of the people there. Rambo, now a snake wrangler and boatman, is asked to take them to the village. He reluctantly does. The village is attacked by the Burmese hyenas who take the missionaries prisoner. The Colorado pastor finds that his missionaries haven't returned, commissions mercenaries to find them. Rambo agrees to take the mercenaries to where the missionaries were dropped off. With resistance, at first by the mercenaries, Rambo soon(..thanks to his impressive use of a bow and arrows)is leading a charge into the jungle to save the missionaries that are under capture. Doing so, a battle begins with Rambo and the mercenaries shooting it out with the Burmese scum. Bodies are blown to smithereens by constant weapon-fire, with Rambo getting to use a new blade fashioned through fire. Truly one of the most violent films I've ever seen, and I watch a lot of horror movies. I had read previously about how violent this was, but seeing it with my own eyes brings truth to what has been written and spoken. The machine guns used do serious damage to bodies in this movie. Bodies are literally blown to pieces with limbs flying skyward and blood splattering. The climactic battle even shows heads being taken off and a man's stomach torn open with the guts spilling out. But, bullet-riddled bodies are a constant in this actioner. Not for the faint of heart. The film attempts somewhat, when people aren't getting annihilated, to shed light on the Burmese situation. The massacre/slaughter of the Karen village is horrifying..women and children are shot point-blank and Sly as director rarely pulls a punch. The rapes and humiliation of innocent young women aren't as elaborated on, but we get an idea of what the Burmese soldiers do to them. Like in Rambo-First Blood Part II, this film has rainy night scenes where John, and his mercenaries sneak into the village to retrieve captured prisoners. During this, Rambo actually rips a soldier's throat out. Pure bloody carnage, once the violence begins, it hardly lets up. The film even has Rambo igniting an old WWII dummy bomb with a major explosion taking out a large portion of jungle with John barely escaping. And, we get to see what mines do to both innocent Karen prisoners and soldiers' bodies. This is not a film for critics. The film is mostly a pure action film where there isn't any gray area..it's good vs. evil and we have identifiable heroes to root for and villains to boo. And, the violence is gratuitous and startlingly realistic. I recommend watching the behind the scenes special features on the newly released DVD just to see how painstakingly difficult it was to make this film.
7.0~A true Rambo flick! itjchawke Sign in Permalink Sly Stallone once again comes back with an incredible picture that stands true to its origins. As with Rocky Balboa, Stallone has stuck to the original principles of the three previous Rambo films and the fourth instalment is an excellent follow on. This film is very graphic, a lot more violent than previous Rambo films but it all fits in with the theme of the Rambo movies and the nature of the character. The film was directed by Stallone himself and as a result was able to make the film very personal to the main character as if it were John Rambo sat on the director's chair. Overall an excellent action flick that continues to build pace throughout, leaving you blown back into your seat and making the time past very quickly, I would say a little too quickly!
9.0~Should be Nominated livelovedream-1 Sign in Permalink I was looking at Stallone's biography and could't understand why he hasn't been nominated for any awards. It is said that such movies don't need any acting talent. I believe that in case somebody else instead of Stallone had those roles, Rambo and Rocky would have failed as movies. Besides, he has shown his acting talents in that film noir, but people where stuck to the action hero and couldn't see beyond. The movie is what all the previous were. A real action film. I can't pretend to be a pseudo cultured person. Rambo is one of the top films in its genre as are "One flew over the coocoo's nest", "taxi driver", "heavy metal jacket", "Donnie Dargo", "Fried Green Tomatoes", and so many other great films. Some of them are well known and have gained the respect they deserve, and some others not. I believe Stallone should have been nominated, and in case you don't like pure action films you shouldn't bother watching this movie.
7.0~Predictable continuation of the movies bastiaan0740 Sign in Permalink Alright. I still remember Rambo 1. How different it was from this movie. In Rambo1, only one man dies. It was a movie about the inability of a war vet to integrate back into real life. Basically you felt sorry for the main character, he was mistreated, and he fought back the only way he knew how - shooting stuff. In the later Rambo installments, a change of plot was needed. There was no longer any emphasis of Rambo being socially inept in real life, and no story about people not liking war vets. It was all stripped and Rambo was remade to a killing machine. He was also put back into his natural habitat; the war zone. And all opponents were generic Russians/Vietnamese/afghans, the natural bad guys with no personality, instead of US citizens; so he had no moral problems in blowing their heads off. Plots gave way for action; Rambo 2 had a less dominant plot of the government being corrupt somehow in not wanting to rescue Vietnam captives; and 3 was even weaker with a small mention of Afghans having a rich heritage and living in their country, wanting independence and freedom from the Russian occupation. And this line of thought has now reached its peak in this latest installment. Rambo is his antisocial self, just wanting to be left alone in some jungle catching snakes for a living. The motive is the capture of the over-the-top good Christian missionaries, wanting to bring peace and help to the locals, by the equally over-the-top bad local military that slaughters and tortures the locals for no reason. So Rambo unloads a machine gun for about half the movie on everyone, and the movie ends when everybody is dead. There is no 'I am one man fleeing from an entire army and i'll pick them off one by one with my skill' here. Just uber-Rambo unloading a gun on everybody. There is no theme whatsoever to the movie, with the possible exception of the missionaries realizing you can't save the world (or yourself) with good intentions alone. What this movie is, is an adrenaline, action-packed, blood-soaked shoot-fest. And if you don't care about the brain-dead story and that's all you want, you'll like it. Personally, I did. Only thing that bothered me was some of the obvious cgi.
10.0~Mangasm'd multiple times jcrook023 Sign in Permalink Grew up to watching Rambo and this is the best one. I know I know. That's saying a lot, but so much awesomeness in this flick. It's like Kill Bill (violence/gore wise) meets Saving Private Ryan ha both of those movies are obviously better, but just watch the movie and then that'll make more sense.
8.0~Not just mindless violence jboyd546 Sign in Permalink Before going to see this movie i had heard a lot of mixed reviews some of my friend told me that it was amazing and an all out gore-fest while i heard from critics that it was awful and just an hour and a half of mindless violence. I have always been a fan of Sly but i had to admit that Rambo 2 and 3 were pretty atrocious, but he really revamped himself for this one, to be 61 and in such good shape is one thing but to be able to take such a basic plot have hold the audiences attention for 1 1/2 hours is another triumph completely. You can't deny that there is a lot of violence in the movie but i disagree with anyone who says that Rambo kill just for the sake of killing every person that he guns down or mutilates in some horrific fashion is an immediate threat to, for want of a better word the good guys. While the intense rape and massacre scenes are graphic i believe that they are included to give the world a realistic glimpse of what war is really like. Im conclusion i came out of the cinema feeling well please with my choice in movie and now sly has done a double with Rocky Balbo and Rambo both turning out as impressive as the originals.
8.0~Violence Gallore f_strasser_king Sign in Permalink I'll give this move an 8/10. The violence and gore in this movie I don't think I have seen since Gang of New York. From a storyline perspective I think Stallone did a brilliant job in showing the world the true picture of current issues in Thailand. All round we see Stallone once again doing what he does best in army combat...This time aided by a team of special forces, we see more realistic fighting than the Rambo against the Japanese/Russian army we are used to. The army general in this movie portraying the villain is cold. He had me shook watching this at the pictures. This movie is NOT for the faint-hearted.
10.0~Stallone is still here! misel982001 Sign in Permalink During his career, Sylvester Stallone gave the audience many great times to remember him.From Rocky and Rambo, to Demolition Man and Shade, Stallone was always a true super star. As an almost exclusive action films actor, he brought to the audience for over three decades, high quality action movies. However, aging is always a problem for such actors and Stallone could escape it....a little though! His physical condition is tremendous! Let's not forget that he is almost 62. It is a fact that his last films did not manage to reach the quality of his previous successes. Driven, D-Tox, Avenging Angelo and Shade, were really good films indeed but their shine was not as big as Rocky or Rambo. That is why Stallone returned with his major two success roles. Rocky Balboa was excellent and meaningfull. Now it is time for...John Rambo! This film is simply excellent. Although it is mostly an action movie it has also deeper meanings such as ethical values and political messages. Just like Rocky Balboa, John Rambo uses the formula of the first movie mixed with this of the forth!Monosylabic dialogues from Rambo meet the political messages of the activists, The violent reaction of Rambo towards the brutal soldiers is justified by his ethical code with a deeper meaning that oppresion and injustice generates strong reaction! Acting as a whole, is very good and convincing. Stallone is really born to be Rambo and the supporting cast is made by young actors who meet the quality standards of Milo Ventimiglia. The project budget is 50m so as you understand there are many real-like explosions and effects. What is new is the ultra violent death scenes. They really look true!The story is interesting although ,as you expect, not complicated. To summarize, John Rambo is one of the best action movies that 2008 will probably bring to us.Also it is a must to see because not only it is a really good movie but also because it is the last Rambo film. Stallone even if he is 62, looks no more than 45 and his condition is impressive. A must for all action film fans and not only by them, Rambo is a really good film and you should not miss it.
5.0~Not Rambo, but his stereotype madameminty Sign in Permalink Childish, edgy characters, exploitation, gore and a lot of pew pew. Who would ever want more? Like a real plot, real social commentary, or maybe a real challenge for the protagonist, as opposed to the eerie equivalent of riding a lawnmower over a bunch of rats. Me, I guess.
10.0~Best action film I've seen in ages! leoric_27 Sign in Permalink 1st off I've never seen a Rambo film I tried watching the 1st one and just laughed all the way thru it,I got to the part where hes riding around on a motorbike getting chased then turned it off - wot a load of crap that was!!! This one on the other hand tho I have to say well done mr director whoever u are this film is the B******KS! The violence was just mental,the acting was good,I fort that bloke who kept mugging Stallone off on the boat was gonna get a slap but then he turned out to be alrite and made me laugh a couple times.. All in all this film was really good and I recommend it 100% and to the idiots who didn't like this film u muste have ran out of weed or booze,laterz ppl!!
10.0~Sylvester Stallone Does It Again vince200002000 Sign in Permalink Whenever I go to see his movies on the big screen I never worry of how it will turn out. "The movie stars Sylvester Stallone, all his other movies were great, this one will be too" those are always the words that come to my mind when I find out that he is going to star in a movie and I've yet to be disappointed by ANY of his movies including this one. This movie was so intense, it had me at the edge of my seat quite a bit throughout the movie. The war like atmosphere that the movie has is excellent as is his acting performance. He is in great shape for his age and looks a lot younger then he really is, I always found that quite amazing. The story was very engaging and made the movie a lot better to watch because it wasn't just a senseless shoot 'em up gore fest with no meaning behind it so that was good. The special effects were great also, very realistic and very cool. The movie does have some disturbing moments but not that bad for the most part. Anyone who likes movies that involve war should see this movie because it really sets the mood. Even if you've never seen any of Syvester Stallone's other films, there is enough action in Rambo to keep you interested and wanting to see it.
10.0~Greatest Movie ever and so much fun to watch jhaan-1 Sign in Permalink okay so right off the bat i was so excited to see this movie. I love the Rambo series. If you are a Rambo fan then you will absolutely love this movie. It does the series justice and if it is the last one it ends on a good note. Stallone makes the character very believable and that he isn't the young gun that he used to be. But he is still in amazing shape and can still kick some serious ass. This is the most realistic Rambo and shows how intense and horrible things are in Burma. The story line is believable. Then you just get to see Rambo wreck the lives out of pretty much everyone. The action is the best and you get really excited and it is so much fun to watch. I love this movie and the critics have no idea what they are talking about. It is a very gory and bloody movie so the little ones should stay at home. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you love action flick.
10.0~Stallone back at what he's best at doing!!! petroflemo Sign in Permalink What can I say? Rambo absolutely kicks butt!!! I love the Rambo franchise, and after his awesome Rocky Balboa entry I hoped Rambo would be as good. And it was! I couldn't believe the action and the atmosphere. It was so good seeing Rambo back on the big screen with a vengeance. Stallone was superb as the brooding action icon and it was so cool seeing a darker and less comic Rambo than the last two entries. The throat rip was awesome and the last action scene where he mows down the Burmese bad guys should go down as one of the most action packed and gory scenes in action movie history! Stallone should be congratulated on his writing and directorial skills, something he is so often overlooked at. Rambo packs a punch and is my favourite action movie yet. Plus, its great to see that John Rambo finally comes full circle. Congrats on a great film Sly!!!
7.0~An important movie but most reviews here missed the point menion3 Sign in Permalink After watching John Rambo, I felt it was offering a very important message and that is war isn't glorious, it's inhumane. I felt that was the real message behind the overused of violence. It's intent was to shock and awe enough so that the audience would get a real account of what war is and that it's not about ideals like fighting for your country, or justice. Rambo himself made the point he killed because it was for himself. It was for survival. That is what war is, survival. Ideals such as justice, or revenge, or liberating others, these serve no place on a battlefield. It's only kill or be killed. In a way, it's a very anti-war movie and it showed how the people trying to help did more harm than good. How did they help anyone? Nobody and people died because of these idealism such as justice or spreading democracy. War is hell and no one wants peace more than soldiers. I am also very disturbed by the comments by individuals who found pleasure from watching the graphic scenes. I myself was shocked but also realize it's true and it's intent is to remind me that right now in Iraq and Afganistan that soldiers are dying just like how it is depicted on that screen. Should it not be shocking that a father, a brother an uncle is being killed like that as we sit in the theatre watching this? Is it funny and pleasurable that someone you know is dying just like that? No real soldier would find this movie pleasurable and only reinforce the need of peace in the world. People who enjoyed themselves from this kind of graphic violence should be ashamed.
7.0~be honest with yourself... markitect-1 Sign in Permalink This is clearly not going to be to everyone's taste, although the only reason i'm writing this is because of the negative reviews. Look, one guys says Stallone looks anorexic!? he's the biggest guy in the film, Stallone looks like a monster, i don't think he was that big in the first two films!? secondly you said people walked out after five minutes because it was so violent, my god, its Rambo!! what did you expect? And also whoever said that Stallone had to make it simply to push out enough films, you really don't know what you're talking about. To sum up, if you like the old movies, general action movies, or the fact a 61 year old legend still has what it takes to keep making, raw, powerful action movies, then you wont be disappointed.
5.0~Story? What story? vidurr666 Sign in Permalink After the stunt Stallone pulled by making another great Rocky movie (imho the best since Rocky I), I was very thrilled about another Rambo installment. However, after seeing the movie all I can be is disappointed. First of all, this is the first movie where Rambo uses the F-word. I'm not against swearing, but it's not something Rambo would do. He never used the F-word in the first three movies and now says stuff like "F**k the world!" Secondly, his trademark weapon is not in the movie. Where's the cool knife? Why did they leave it out? Thirdly and most important: Where's the story? This movie is like a rerun of First Blood: part II, but with the plot left out. A he does is go to camp, kill over 200 people (most of the from standing on the same spot with a machine-gun) and then go back home. That's it, nothing more! Take that and the fact that all characters in this movie a complete stereotypes and there you have the recipe for a complete disaster. Rambo might not be "expendable", but this movie sure is! PS: I do hope that potential Rambo 5 is going to be made, so the series has a better ending instead of this piece of crap.
9.0~surprisingly good krzysiektom Sign in Permalink I was positively surprised by his film. Hats of to Mr. Stallone, who directed and produced it. Not only the action and violence scenes are extremely well shot, the script is clever too, at times even profound. The film is not a deceptively simple story about nothing, it touches on a subject of how and if people can stop violence and does religion have some, or any, answers. The film says that horrible things happen to innocent people and nations all over the planet but nobody usually does nothing, while something could be done. Not with words and prayers but with action. In a skewed manner the film indicates also that in this case religion and good peaceful intentions result in eliminating a lot of evil, though in a completely different way they intended too, as their religious and medical mission triggers all the events in the movie. But something has to be done, instead of ignoring the problem. I give it 9 and not 10 because it could have been a bit longer and more elaborate, but still it is an excellent effort. Because it is so good the time flies and the film seems to last about an hour! To those who criticize the film for too much violence: u get what u wanted, so u like watching action movies, shootings, attacks on villages etc? Well in real life it probably looks more or less like in this film. Real violence is brutal, unpleasant, random and unjust, not your typical Hollywood fare.
10.0~When you're pushed, killing's as easy as breathing... zushen Sign in Permalink The return of the 80's and early 90's classics have been hit or miss. Terminator 3, though watching Arnold as his greatest and most famous character was great, the movie was awful. Die Hard 4, though it had a good story and enjoyable cast, seemed to suffer with overdone special effects. I mean come on, Bruce Willis was surfing on a jet while stuff was blowing up left and right. Not to mention the movie was rated PG-13 and not rated R like the previous Die Hard movies thus appealing to a much younger crowd. But then came Rocky Balboa. This movie reminded me of what a great movie can be. It had a message, a story, great acting, and it didn't strive to be totally different from it's predecessors. With this sigh of relief I had high hopes for Rambo. Could Stallone make Rambo as good as Rocky Balboa? YES. This movie hits home. Everything about it is great. It's as if Stallone took every element that made the previous Rambo's good and mashed them all together to make one bad ass Rambo movie. The story was there, the action was there, and the level to which it was presented was very intense. This movie is chalk full of gore, and it works very well. Especially since the enemy is built up to be this mindless sick brutal force that thrives on killing the innocent. You can't wait until the first arrow cruises through a skull, or a knife slices across a throat. Very intense. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies because this is one of the best. 10/10
10.0~Live for nothing... or die for something paul-3555 Sign in Permalink I have no doubt that many of the criticisms levelled at this film are valid. The plot is wafer thin, and some of the characters are a little flimsy. But to criticise the film on this basis is to miss the point. Rambo isn't meant to be a deep character-driven drama. It's a stupendous action film with a decent-enough message behind it. So far as the action goes - and there is quite a lot of it - it's hard to imagine any film being more impressive. Although some of it is slightly exaggerated, much of it does feel quite authentic, and it's certainly the most violent film I've ever seen. The message of the film is fairly simple, and is best summed up by Rambo himself when he offers other characters the choice between living for nothing, or dying for something. It's almost like a feel-good movie. With massacres. All in all, this is a hugely successful achievement. Stallone is exceptionally good, and it's hard not to cheer at several moments when Rambo comes out on top. I'd recommend it to anybody with a strong stomach.
9.0~Quick thoughts s190895 Sign in Permalink Rambo VI was my favorite of all the Rambo movies. Some of the things in this film really captivated me after I watched it. The music always fit the scene. There was never music that seemed out of place, which just made the whole movie fly by without thinking about it. Some of the scenes were pretty intense. In fact, my girlfriend (who has seen many war movies) actually got up and left for a certain part of the film. It wasn't because of the gore, but from other scenes involving women and their treatment. Additional characters really made this film believable. Sure, some parts (not unlike many movies) were a bit over the top, but nevertheless a great film to watch. If you haven't seen the other Rambo movies, I suggest you watch them before you watch Rambo VI. I think that doing your homework will allow you to appreciate the Rambo VI more.
8.0~That's right America, he makes his own machete... ltmerriweather Sign in Permalink Rambo is back and he's more than the punchline or an homage to previous '80s bullet fiestas many feared he would be. In full control of the movie, Stallone has given us a Rambo who has finally come to terms with what he is: the (un)holy paragon of 20th century warfare; death incarnate. The movie starts with just enough back story to, deftly, draw us in and care a little about the pus--um, missionaries and their plight. After that, it's all Rambo, ALL. THE. TIME. Pistol, arrows, machete, bare-hands, .50 cal machine gun, claymore, giant bomb...all tools he uses to paint his masterpiece. Rambo celebrates blood, head shots and action heroics in the same way 'Shoot 'Em Up' did last year, although with a bit more of an attempt at heart and realism. The supporting cast is solid and injects all the humor and pathos 'Rambo' needs. If you're going to the movies for anything but classic American ass-kicking I suggest you park your sensitive rear next door to this flick, maybe see '27 Dresses.' I hear Katherine Heigl might hookup with her longtime platonic friend and maybe...just maybe learn something about life and love in the process.
10.0~It's about time rae_beth Sign in Permalink I really haven't been a fan of Stallone's for, well let's face it, the vast majority of my life. I don't like his politics, I'm not a great fan of his opinions, and for decades -literally- he hasn't made a movie worth seeing twice. Rocky and Rambo, that's pretty much it. Don't get me wrong, that's more than I have to say for myself, but as far as calling an actor on his movies, that's all Stallone's really had. I have to say though, Rambo(2008)is the best action movie I have seen in a long, long time. Long, long, long time. Anybody remember the end of First Blood? The speech they make him try and deliver. For me that ruined everything. A man of actions reduced to that. Just the crying quietly in a corner would have made more sense. This time he stands there, quiet. Saying exactly what he should. Is the movie violent? Not enough. Seriously. Its a war, what should it have? Bloodless, plastic violence like some made for t.v. garbage? I think they did a decent job of keeping Rambo from being a cartoon character like he became before. This is the best action movie popularly released in decades.
8.0~A Must For Rambo Fans ToppsyKretts Sign in Permalink Having grown up in the 1980's, I am happy to say that I am a Rambo fan. The movie series is, without question, a "guilty pleasure" for me and whenever I am flipping channels and see one of these films on TV, I'll always stop to watch. Is the writing genius or Oscar worthy... certainly not, but what these films lack in artistic measure, more than make up in the pure entertainment department. "Rambo" is no exception, and in the course of the series, is by far the best entry since "First Blood". This film delivers exactly what it promises and is a nice combination of "First Blood" and "Rambo: First Blood Part 2". It pulls no punches, unlike the watered down theatrical version of "Live Free or Die Hard". Rambo revels in it's brutality. Clearly Stallone heard the fans express their complaints when the new Die Hard movie lacked blood and profanity. Rambo has plenty of both. The bad guys are really bad and when they die they die really horrible, graphic deaths, all while the audience cheers for their hero. This film deserves 8 out of 10 because for a Rambo movie, it is that good. If you are a fan of the series you will absolutely love this film. If you are not a fan of the other films in the series, you probably won't like this one either. But then again if you aren't a fan, why else would you be watching a Rambo movie in the first place? Again, I loved this movie. Watching Rambo (vs, say Saving Private Ryan) is like eating a candy bar. It has very little nutritional value, but it sure tastes good.
9.0~"Live for Nothing, Die for Something. You Call" scion15 Sign in Permalink This movie took me by absolute surprise because not only is this a very solid action movie, but it's one of the best films of the year by far. We all know who Rambo is and his history as well as his story. It's a little more of the same here but Stallone incorporates clips in some parts of the movie with old footage from the previous Rambo entries. However you may ask yourself, does Stallone still have it? I mean he's 60? Well to answer you're question, YES!!! He's still f'in got it!! Even though his face looks a little deformed, and he looks way bigger but he can bring some action and gore. Stallone as John Rambo resides in Thailand as a snake wrangler for a snake amusement park and owns a small wooden boat. He is in Thailand minding his own business when a couple of American's from Utah have come to ask Rambo to help them get to Burma, where they plan to aid the people with supplies. After going there they are captured by a Burmanese militant group and held captive for 10 days. Let the action ensue from here because from here on it's all blood, gore, heads blown off, bits and chunks of humans flying all over and a lot of bullets. Trust me guys this is one movie you must see to add to your manliness or help transform you into a man. But all in all this is a great action film and should be seen, but proceed with caution if you intend to bring kids or a girlfriend/wife/fiancé that can't handle lots of gore and blood
1.0~Garbage! mcmtn Sign in Permalink who is writing the good reviews here?? what a bunch of nuts..I sat through this pathetic excuse for a movie with almost no storyline- I'm an action movie fan, but Rambo crosses WAY over the line of grotesque, gratuitous violence- multiple women raped, babies thrown into fires, heads blown off, one after the other, hangings, a throat ripped apart, heads cut off & put on poles, legs blown off, dissected & stabbed, people killed by missionaries using rocks- this movie makes Braveheart look like a fairytale..Stallone looks anorexic, plastic & barely alive- we knew he couldn't act,neither can he write or direct, either....this is a complete waste of time- several people walked out after the initial five minutes- wish I'd done the same- it was sickening- its time to put an end to increasingly violent movies- the kids in our inner cities watch these & think its OK to shoot & stab each other at will...
10.0~"Rambo" Without a Pause dee.reid Sign in Permalink There are any number of things that are interesting about "Rambo," the fourth film in which muscle-man Slyvester Stallone (who stars, co-wrote, produced, and directed the film) plays the ex-Green Beret/Vietnam vet/human killing machine John Rambo, the best of which is seeing Stallone in action, in an action film that remembers the good old days of the bang-bang-bang-shoot-'em-up without a conscience. To get this out of the way, "Rambo" is Stallone's best turn as the eponymous character since the original "First Blood" (1982). Rambo is much heavier, and bulkier, this time out in "Rambo," a sign that Stallone is using his age at 61 to his benefit in re-creating a title character who shows it in his world-weariness and disillusionment with the world, and for a 21st-century audience. It also goes without saying that "Rambo" is probably the bloodiest "R"-rated action film to date - disembowelment, stabbings, shootings, exploding bodies, babies thrown into the path of torches, you get the point. As the character who first saw life in the novel "First Blood" by author David Morrell, Stallone's John Rambo is now away from the world as we know it, in Thailand, catching live cobras for entertainment at snake-wrangling shows. When he's approached by a group of Christian aid workers led by blonde bombshell Sarah (Julie Benz, who shares a passing affection for Our Hero) on their way to the Thai/Burmese border to help the oppressed villagers there, his only words to them are, "Go home," because the world can't be saved. As it also turns out, a brutal Burmese warlord in sunglasses is massacring villagers left and right, and Sarah and the other aid workers are taken prisoner. So Our Hero and a team of mercenaries are paid to go back up river for a rescue mission, and so let the action begin. You won't find much rationalizing for the relentless violence and bloodshed on display in this film, which is decidedly a bold move on Stallone's part. He went before the MPAA and told them point-blank that this is what really goes on in Burma, which saw a failed pro-democracy uprising against the government there last year (a nice taste of current events, by the way). "Rambo" is a solid and brutal exercise that returns triumphantly to the days when action movies just didn't give a damn. And Stallone returns triumphantly as well, showing that age doesn't matter, only the size of your guns is what matters. 10/10
8.0~Well done Sylvester Stallone universalkinggamerguy Sign in Permalink What is wrong with the critics? Why is it that they praise tripe like Avengers: Endgame and many more which in reality doesn't serve any purpose but criticize a superbly made film covering a tough topic like Rambo? The marketing of the film especially came off as a cheap B-grade movie trying to cash in on the franchise, but the movie if you actually see it leaves you by surprise and gives top class entertainment value. In fact, Sylvester Stallone who is normally criticized for his voice and accent here has very few dialogues and conveys it all through his eyes, face and body language. The movie tackles the topic of the Karen rebels' living conditions and their fight for freedom and independence, but the movie also shows some of the brutal reality of Burma which films previously haven't really shown. Direction is top notch by Sylvester Stallone, this man is an underrated filmmaker Screenplay and story are superb, everything works well in context to the topic of freedom and the common man's fight and will to live a peaceful life Cinematography is fantastic Action is the highlight and best-in-class. There's no cheap scenes, all the stunts are highly entertaining without looking too fake and for once the blood and gore in cinema looks spectacular, is a visual treat, and doesn't seem OTT unlike horror movies especially the Saw franchise where the blood and gore aspect goes over the top Sylvester Stallone with limited dialogues conveys it all through his eyes, face and body and he gives a superb performance, Graham McTavish comes off as a Vinnie Jones ripoff, Julie Benz is pretty good and the rest are great
9.0~Rambo's back and he's not that mad! MovieWatcher1138 Sign in Permalink Rambo has changed! He's no longer an angry emotional wreck, but a cold hard rock who can't help but have a heart to help poor doomed missionaries who think violence is never necessary (even in self defense). This was a great movie because we see him get softened up, but not to the point of reliving his traumas. He's the older and wiser version of the guy from First Blood. This movie opened my eyes to the situation in Burma, and I am glad to hear that Rambo is being passed around as bootlegs to the proponents of democracy there. Apparently the film is causing trouble for the oppressive, murderous, raping hellions they call "Government" there. Way to go Stallone. You've lived up to your character by making this movie. Next time be sure to use more of Jerry Goldsmith's music and dump Brian Tyler. And give Jerry Goldsmith a proper screen credit this time!
7.0~An Awesome Action Film!!! Pumpkin_Man Sign in Permalink It's awesome to see John Rambo back in action! This movie is extremely violent and has tons of action sequences! Rambo is living in Northern Thailand and transports people in his boat. Michael Burnett, a missionary asks Rambo if he will take him and his associates up the Salween river to help injured people in Burma. Rambo tries to tell them is a very bad idea, but Sarah Miller really tries to get him to, so Rambo does it. After they arrive and help people, some Burmese army people come and try to kill them all, showing a bloody carnage! When Rambo finds out, Rambo and some soldiers return to Burma to kill the bad guys and save the innocent! So, if you love action, bloody violence, and the Rambo series, you'll definitely enjoy RAMBO!!!
8.0~Rambo is back.......so too is all that we guys love in action RCWjr Sign in Permalink Make no mistake about it, this film is an unadulterated, unapologetic, balls out action film. There is carnage, there is blood there is more carnage. The film takes enough time to re-introduce us to John J. Rambo; who now is absolutely disenfranchised with life, not his country, but just life in general. We see that Rambo is now capturing snakes and basically tending to the bare necessities of life. A mission group comes through needing a guide to get them through the waters in Bhurma. At first, Rambo doesn't want to have anything to do with them, but a woman in the group, who is equally committed spiritually as Rambo is disenfranchised, convinces him to take them down river. When said missionary is captured, some mercs are brought in and Rambo is asked to take them in. What ensues is Rambo having to recognize who he is and accept that he is a war machine that has one last fight in him. This film separates itself from the two sequels and hones into what made the first film great. The one thing different is the absolute no-holds bared manner in which the violence is depicted. We do not get cutaway shots, we see full on the devastation that violence causes. In the end, Rambo is able to excise some personal demons and heads home in a literal and mental sense. As with Rocky, Stallone has given his other alternate ego a send off that is fitting.
5.0~Violence is a constant bedfellow of this 'Rambo' rparham Sign in Permalink After a twenty year absence, John J. Rambo, former Green Beret and one-man killing machine, is back on the big screen. Sylvester Stallone, having successfully resuscitated his other major franchise, Rocky, a year ago, has slapped on the bandana again and treated us to a no holds barred tale of Rambo getting called back into service to save those in need from those who would do unpleasant things to them. The film that emerges, Rambo, is an interesting affair, not long on plot or dialogue, heavy on a message of noble bravery in the face of adversity, oh, and a whole lot of blood and guts. If you are the slightest bit squeamish, this is not the film to see. Rambo opens with a brief overview of the ongoing 60 year civil war in Burma (now Myanmar) between the military ruling body and the Karen rebels in that country. We are then re-introduced to John Rambo, catching snakes and driving a boat for a living in Thailand. He is approached by members of a church that is trying to get into Burma to provide humanitarian aid. At first Rambo rebuffs them, but Sarah (Julie Benz) convinces him to give them that boat ride. After surviving an attack by Burmese pirates, the church group enters the country, only to be quickly captured by the military. Rambo is then pressed into service by a pastor of the church who has hired mercenaries, led by Lewis (Graham McTavish), to rescue his flock. It is during the rescue mission that Rambo throws off his life of quiet solitude and decides to open up one big can of whup ass on as many of the Burmese army as he can find in his sights, because, you know, that is what he is good at. The character of Rambo began cinematic life in First Blood, an action film adapted from a novel by David Morell with a message concerning the treatment of Vietnam vets by the general U.S. population that reacted badly to an unpopular war. Each successive sequel has tried to work a message into its plot, and this entry is no different. It is uncertain whether the decision to set Rambo in Burma is because Sylvester Stallone has a particular interest in that part of the world, was trying to make sure it wasn't set in the box-office poison that is the Middle East, or if the script has just been kicking around that long that that was the best political conflict he could find at the time. Either way, we are treated to a tale about men and women being kept down by men of evil, who are not afraid to send peasants wandering through mine fields, and when all the peasants can't manage to get killed by stepping on the mines, the soldiers just unload on them with machine gun fire. Rambo is certainly a throw-back to the action heydey of the mid-80's. It provides us with a complicated political situation, people in distress, and the only solution, eventually, is a hail of bullets escaping from the barrel of a gun. The film has an strange dichotomy, featuring several scenes where individuals deride the ways of death and violence, and saying killing people really solves nothing, then violence lands at their feet, and maybe a fully-loaded weapon isn't such a bad thing after all. I suppose it could be a message on the naiveté of people who just can't realize how bad the world really is until they get a taste of it, but it is hard to tell. One thing about Rambo is certain: if you don't like violence, you had best skip this movie. The last 45 or so minutes is pretty much wall to wall carnage, and not light carnage at that. This is full-on, Saving Private Ryan level carnage, with legs, arms, heads and you name it flying about the screen. In fact, at one juncture, it becomes almost comical (in an ironic way), as shot after shot after shot is just one angle after another of a machine gun firing bullets and people getting ripped apart by it, seemingly without end. On the subject of acting, nobody in Rambo is distinguishing themselves. Sylvester Stallone mumbles out some dialogue between maimings and bicep flexing. His physical presence, at 61, is impressive, but the role of Rambo does not push the limits of his thespian skills. Graham McTavish does his best Jason Statham impression as the leader of the mercenaries, and Julie Benz and Paul Schulze are passable as the leaders of the church missionaries. More or less, you don't go to see a movie with Rambo in the title to check and determine the leading contenders for Best Actor /Actress awards for next year's Oscar ceremony. Is Rambo a bad movie? Not really, but it is not something that demands a viewing. If you appreciate action in the extreme, I think you will find something in Rambo to tickle your fancy, and if you were a fan of the previous entries, Rambo follows a very similar formula. But, for the most part it is an average piece of action cinema that those with a weak constitution may find difficult to stomach after a point. If that isn't the definition of a mixed bag, I am not sure what is.
10.0~The Greatest War Film of all time ramiro-raymond Sign in Permalink Yeah. This was the first R-rated Movie I've seen in theaters. I saw it with my parents, but I chose to sit about 6 rows in front of them. When the film started, it was one of the highlights of the film itself; Multiple News Reels of the Controversy in Burma and the bet on who will survive in the explosive-infested marsh. When I saw that, it drew me into the film. As a kid, the film was an extreme high octane violent awesome movie. But the big cheese of the film was the final fight. The Best fight scene ever to be in film. Rambo vs. Burmese Army and The General. This was one of them moments where i said constantly: "Holy $#!Z"
7.0~Average Daz3467 Sign in Permalink I found this movie average compared to the other movies Sylvester Stallone been as John Rambo. I was really enjoying this movie then all at once it was over with. I said, Whattt, come on, a bit more storyline could have been in there other than John Rambo killing everyone. There was more credits at the end of the movie than I thought, ten minutes of credits, wow. So the movie is actually on one hour ten minutes which was really short. The acting was not bad from the start but it is similar to one of the computer games, just killing. If you looked back at the Tarzan movies, they had a lot of adventure and killings in those movies, that is what Rambo should have gotten adventure and just not killings all the time. You would have thought he would get tired of killing all the time with those muscles you could boil an egg. Otherall it was not boring so I give it credit for that and I would see the movie but I would not let any children see it because too much blood and gore.
9.0~classic action flick alexsafc123 Sign in Permalink I had been waiting on tenterhooks for the release of this movie since I heard it was to be made, I really was not disappointed. First of all lets get the bad points out of the way, I think most people will agree Stallone is by no means one of the great actors of our time as is shown throughout most of the film as his dialogue is mumbled in a pretty incoherent manner (as usual I suppose) and some of his conversations with the missionaries were just plain confusing. Also I thought the film was too short. This may just have been because it was a blast and time flies when your having fun, but although it ended on a nice note, something just felt unfinished to me. But no-one should go to see this film in hope of enthralling discourse or truly outstanding acting (although Graham McTavish in particular was quite good). This film was all about the excitement that a fan of the series would have come to expect, and Rambo really delivers. All of the battle scenes are really top notch. The special effects are truly something to behold and make for some very gory but entertaining, and to some degree more realistic, action. There is also a political perspective that comes across very strongly especially in the opening five minutes of the film, about the atrocities occurring in Burma and I feel that not only will you come away feeling entertained, but hopefully more aware of the situation in this war torn country. Personally I have to admire Stallone and Monterastelli for trying to bring this situation into the public eye. In short though this is everything an action film should be. It has been a while since I have been to the cinema and come out feeling like I really got my moneys worth, but I was truly impressed by this (possibly?) last venture of one of the true great action heroes of all time.
9.0~Uh......One word...... SURPRISING!!! Mudbug711 Sign in Permalink I like a lot of folks out there went to see this movie with the feeling that this was going to be cheesy, and too nostalgic... Boy, was I wrong. As you read these comments, you can see that most people who viewed this movie agree. It has a great meaning to what really happens in third world countries, and to that, a lot of us in this country don't condone violence, this movie shows that when a hand is around your throat, you may have to push back with equal, or more force..Sad, but true. The acting was very good, on all levels. And of course the future implications will arise, when some ignorant parent takes their 10 year old kid to see it, not realizing the R... yep.. R rating is there for a reason, then goes, and complains of the brutal, but darn near realistic battle scenes. Sly has been sort of picked on by the uptight crowd, who believe that (I have nothing against this actor) Will Farrell is one of the best actors of all time, but Sly CAN act. In this movie, you can really see this. If you are looking for a film to sit back, and relax to... THIS is NOT the film for you. If you are there to see a pulse driven, steroid shot to the cerebral cortex, a kick to the mid-region, a nuclear blast to all senses, this is the film that you would want to see. Hold tight, it puts you right there with the action!!!!
10.0~A bloody good time! the_wylde_child69 Sign in Permalink I am a fan of 80s action movies! In the 80s we saw The Terminator, the rise of Rambo, RoboCop, Rocky's many sequels, Indiana Jones, the conclusion to Star Wars, etc. With all that said, I love mindless action, that is my biased. This movie took the idea of body counting and threw it out the window (it is really hard to keep track in this movie). When I found out about this movie I could not help to get excited. It is all out action! With out giving away any of the movie I will say that it is probably the goriest movie I have seen in recent memory. The violence level is extreme, and the blood flows by the gallons, but this time Rambo is not the only one shedding blood. If you like action movies I would recommend seeing this movie. On the flip side if you get queezy, or are not a fan of the action genre DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
8.0~A strong film that stands apart from Rambo II and III BroadswordCallinDannyBoy Sign in Permalink With "Rambo" we have yet another example of an action hero coming out of retirement. It seems to be a recent trend and has provided mixed results. John Rambo is now peacefully living along the Salween River in Thailand. he is still haunted by old memories of war, but he seems to able to deal with it. When some missionaries, that Rambo helped ferry to Burma, get taken hostage by the military he helps some mercenaries get them out. At face value the formula here is just like the Rambo II and III which were big overblown action movies for fans of the genre only, pretty much. However, in pulling one of his more famous characters out into action Stallone hasn't really created a sequel to Rambo II and III, but something that is more like a proper sequel to the first more seriously toned film. This, folks, isn't an action movie - yes, it is exciting with some very intense action scenes, but Stallone was out to make something serious here. And as far as I am concerned he did. He pulls virtually no sucker punches and sensationalist gimmicks in depicting some truly disturbing war time atrocities and paints a very ugly picture of an ugly war, but it feels like it is true. One scene has a young boy, aged probably 8 at most, get shot by a Junta soldier and another scene has a boy, who's probably younger, thrown into a house right before it is set ablaze with a flamethrower. That's right, folks, serious stuff. And it doesn't stop there. Some may consider that excessive, but the film is just about that. The story and plot here are secondary to the image of a war that is very real and not very known to many people. The film also has the "shaky-cam" style that is ever popular today, but unlike many other films that I have seen with this style, the camera here seems to be in control of the chaos that it creates. The action is, unlike many other films that use this technique, watchable. You can actually follow what is going on. And this camera-work goes hand in hand with the on screen intensity, meaning no pointless shaky shots during calm scenes. The main character John Rambo is also dealt with in a nice manner. And by the end of the film the Rambo as originally shown in the First Blood comes to a nice concluding arc that spares cliché. Overall this is a strong, well executed, and mature film that spares exploitation in showing some awfully violent things. The violence here serves a much greater purpose than to just entertain as it is did in Rambo II and III. --- 8/10 BsCDb classification: Ages 16+ --- violence/brutality
10.0~Absolute carnage. kyle-453 Sign in Permalink This movie is an absolute masterpiece. An instant classic. I went in expecting it to be good but I never expected it to be this good. It left me speechless. And my god, what savagery. I even saw one girl run out of the movie theater holding back vomit on two separate occasions during the movie. It received a standing ovation from over half the audience in a theater packed to capacity. Now, having personally spent over a month in the country of Burma where the movie takes place, I would like to say that this movie is a fairly accurate representation of Burma in many ways. It is a very good reminder about the kinds of horrible things that go on in Burma that most of us don't know about and our government chooses to ignore mostly because China supports them and backs them up. Many people in the world don't even know Burma exists let alone what's going on over there. I would like to thank Stallone and everyone else involved in this movie for helping to put a spotlight on that country and it's government. I highly, highly recommend this movie. It deserves your money. -kyle
4.0~More of what made the series stupid. SmokeyTee Sign in Permalink First let me qualify my appraisal of Rambo by saying I love Rambo: First Blood despite it's many flaws. Flaws that include the ultra-cheesy Colonel Trautman and the fact the film smashes the viewer over the head with its rightwing political poppycock. All it was missing was a Rebel Flag, or a coloured or homosexual women's rights protester being castrated or shot in the head in every other scene to really capture the rage of an emasculated white America in need of a hero like Rambo... That said it First Blood was a tense actioner and an early character study of the (now clichéd) haunted, war-weary reclusive, Ex-Vietnam, elite special forces dude fated to kick arse... once again. Where First Blood was bright and original, leaving aside the fore mentioned rightwing rhetoric, Rambo(4) fulfills it's obligations to the subsequent sequels, continuing their legacy, and making only passing nods to the spirit of the first film and offers very little to merit praise - save the massive bodycount and computer generated gore. The violence of Rambo was a talking, and selling, point. Sure war films have become more "realistic" with their violence recently with big films like Private Ryan, Thin Red, Black Hawk. However the increased violence has served the purpose of focusing the audience on the harrowing circumstances of war and is matched by the film-makers attempt to render the strain of combat upon the combatants involved and their relationships. Rambo makes abstract gestures at humanity that might be confused as genuine but it is ALL about the violence. Like the character Rambo the film feels fake, his motivation feels fake, the events seem ludirous. But according to Sly this is supposed to highlight the very REAL suffering of the people of Myanmar..? To whom is this message intended? Most of the people that are attracted to such a stupid, violent movie won't give a rat's arse about little 'Chinamen' in Myanmar. Such viewers actually believed Rambo sorted out their problems for them in Rambo 1,2 & 3 already. Rambo certainly delivers the violence but the Rambo of 2008 is not the Rambo of 1984. Firstly Stallone looks like a smooth plastic action figure that has been put in the oven to melt and contort. I doubt Rambo (the character) would have gone in for unnaturally distorting plastic surgery)... I appreciate the spirit of the project - presenting ultra-violent action because modern warfare involves ultra-violence. often distorted by media and Washington spin into some kind of sterile, clean affair for the boob-tube masses. The problem is Rambo is just as distorted and warped in it's depiction. The American, Rambo, only helps the Myanmarans because a big-titted blonde American woman is scripted to inspire pathos in us, the viewers by her concern for the poor Myanmarans. This is puke. Rambo goes in and kills all the evil Myanmarans so they stop killing the good Myanmarans. So once again a weak, coloured people require the services of the big white American 'cock' to come and sort out the other, weak, coloured, but distinctly evil, coloured people. Of course it is fascistic, violent pap, hell that is fine, but why do we need the tears of a white American woman, or Rambo, to make this plot work and the Myanmarans achieve their freedom, ostensibly from themselves...!!?? Answer: Hollywood.
5.0~Not the informative piece others may try to convince you it is RSKTwentyOne Sign in Permalink Am amazed by the "yee ha" themes which are constantly coming across in the reviews/comments on this film. To be frank it's gun (and knife, and mine, and bow and arrow, and flamethrower....) porn all the way. Now that's fine but attempting to dress it up as deep and meaningful is hugely disingenuous. In my opinion the whole Burma message and the massive over inflating of just how mean and nasty the villains really are combine solely to give some sort of justification for the incessant violence. This is an action flick plain and simple with SFX taken to a new level of realism over a prolonged period. Look at the stats on IMDb as to which demographics are giving the biggest thumbs up - male under 18 and male 18-29 - says it all really. To me it's not hugely different from the Hostel type films which co-incidentally enjoy the same type of reviews from the very same demographics on this and other sites. It's a tough watch but a good action movie if that's your bag. It is not a deep and meaningful film in any way shape or form despite what you may read on here. If you want a war and/or genocide based film with genuine meaning and poignancy go and watch The Killing Fields, Hotel Rwanda, Welcome To Sarajevo, Black Hawk Down or even Private Ryan. If you want good old fashion "kick-ass" guns, explosions and blood alongside Sly reprising the Rambo of 2&3 rather than First Blood then this is your film, just don't dress it up as a movie with a message. Stallone could have made a much more effective film about the plight of Burma had he wished to it's just that it wouldn't have fitted with the Rambo franchise. Sly is widely quoted as saying he was struggling with whether to make a documentary or a Rambo movie. Looks like the studio helped him overcome that struggle and judging by the comments on here it was financially at least the right thing to do.
10.0~Give the man his Respect!! kesurnea Sign in Permalink Coming from a guy who watched the trailer online at work every single day since it was released, there was really no way I could have been disappointed here. However, Sly took my appreciation to a whole new level! The gritty realism of war torn Burma was shocking and sobering. Sly's ability to carry the film and its drama, with just his body language and facial expressions were uncanny. He didn't need Shakespearian dialogue. When you look at his face you know what he is feeling. I will see this movie as many times as I possibly can, simply because the more it makes, the more respect he will receive, and to me thats the important thing. I am tired of hearing all this " worst actor ever" crap. Sure like many actors, he has had some bombs, but he has put himself out there and never bowed to the critics! Amazing movie......bottom line!
9.0~Its a Rambo movie.....enough said peptokio2 Sign in Permalink I went into Rambo with low expectations. I've seen enough remakes and sequels that didn't do their predecessors justice, and being a huge action fan, i was concerned. Let me just say that i left smiling. If you want a complicated plot and academy award winning acting..... go see a Morgan Freeman movie. If you wanna see the most digital blood since 300, Sly has it waiting for you. I was keeping a "Rambo kill count" just to see how it stacked up against the other ones. I gave up when it hit the triple digits. Arnolds "kill count" was only in the 90's in Commando. You know Rambo, you know what to expect, machete kills and digital decapitations.
1.0~Sure to Give You nightmares/Ultra-Violent and HOrrid ScribblerPlus Sign in Permalink This came on DirecTV and I started watching. There was almost NO plot--just violence and gore. Children were tossed into fire; people were set on fire; women were gang-raped. People were crucified to be eaten by wild boars. WHY would anyone civilized want to watch this? You can just turn on the news!! This gave me nightmares, and I swerved toward the bathroom to vomit. Sylvester Stallone--the steroidal midge--looks gross. He's only abut 5'5". It is doubtful that he will ever outgrow these violent movies--not so long as violence thirsty people pay to see them. Indeed, we live a world that is desensitized by violence. I wonder how many people who commented here will go out and do something violent because they no longer know it's wrong.
7.0~Blood, guts... and more blood. phileeguy9 Sign in Permalink When you hear of certain movie sequels that are being released, you know what you are getting into if you plan on seeing it. If you see a movie with part of the title being "Star Trek," you probably know it involves science-fiction and the starship Enterprise. This can be said about Rambo films, and this one in particular. You know you're going to see a lot of action, and this one stays true to form. It also stays true to form in that the writing and acting aren't exactly Oscar-winning efforts. I think it takes away from the movie somewhat, but the action scenes are numerous and they take your mind off of the lackluster writing and line execution at times. The action scenes themselves are quite bloody, with bullets, explosions, shrapnel and debris cutting through limbs and other body parts in a very graphic manner. The sound effects that accompanied these scenes were decent if not loud. Unfortunately the action scenes were so engrossing and time consuming that to me the movie felt like it flew by. Then again, you may enjoy movies like that. I won't spoil you with any plot details, but know that it's pretty straight-forward and isn't hard to grasp, just like our boy John Rambo. So if you plan on seeing it, don't expect a psychological thriller installment of this series, because it isn't happening. It's Rambo, you know what you're getting into, so sit back and enjoy the action. 7/10
10.0~Wow! The Rambo I Wanted To SEE! predator_silver77 Sign in Permalink Plot: John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is spending his time in a remote area in Thailand, and then is disturbed by a bunch of Missionaries trying to make a difference in Burma which is a constant war zone full of Death, Destruction, Rape and Mutilation. After Sarah (JulieBenz) one of the missionaries persuades Rambo to take the missionaries up river into Burma. Then sure as $h1t the missionaries get captured and some get killed. But it's then up to Rambo and a small group of Mercenaries to go rescue the missionaries from a large Burma army. My Spiel: If you are not a fan of the first 3 Rambo movies then you could never fully appreciate this movies from its beginning to its end. It has references to all of them, from a very touching end, that takes you down memory lane to the "First Blood". But going to see this movie I sure wasn't expecting much only knowing I was going to see it regardless of anything, even from the crazy trailer with "Let the Bodies hit he Floor by Drowning Pool" playing But what I saw was something I could only say "Awesome!" This movie has it all from Rambo working on his craft of the bow & arrow, to his vastly known skills behind other weapons. The words "quick and decise" come to mind. There was a scene I truly wanted to cheer, when Rambo jacks those Burma Men with the bow & arrow, and then the last one hits the water mine "was amazing". Also there was the scene with the leader of the mercenaries talking big $h1t on Rambo not knowing who the hell he is talking to. If you are a fan of the past 3 Rambo movies you know where I am coming from here. Many people think this movie is bloody, but this could have been 10 times worse then what they actually showed, Which is probably a good thing, Because to much of that is redundant and doesn't keep the audience involved for long. I have to say this movie is simply beautiful from the redone score to the overall layout and feel. Finally all I can say now is Rambo is back in a serious way and a truly good way to possible finish this sweet saga of John Rambo. Rambo (2008) Review: 10/10
10.0~Very best after the First Blood kidiotb Sign in Permalink First Blood is one of the best action movies of all time. If you think it was too violent and brutal, then you should think once again because the latest RAMBO would blow your mind. The direction is amazing; frankly did not expect any action in this 60+ old actor's movie. The direction is first class. Stallone has actually established the villain to be very violent, brutal commander that we actually wish every second that he should be killed as brutally as possible. The action scenes were so brutal that there were lot of "aaarghh" in the theater. The way the bullets drive through the bodies in the climax was pretty gore. In the end very well directed movie with lots of bullets flying around. I wish to narrate some scenes here but they have to be watched on screen to get the feel. Must watch for every one who are strong at heart. No prior first blood experience required!
10.0~I love this movie slatter-kj Sign in Permalink Welcome back Rambo, from the start of the film you know what you are going to get. This is a bloody and violent film, but they have done a great deal of home work, not only the happening's in Burma, but the reality of how the weapons that are used in the film can be seen for the kind of damage they would do. With the release of Rambo on DVD, there are some good documentary's, as well as deleted sense. as a huge Rambo fan i must say that This is one of the best of the Rambo movies, and is up the with First Blood. Rambo is worth a watch. I have also heard the Rambo 5 is on the way, if this is the case i hope they remember one thing, plenty of body bags.
10.0~Insane action from the worlds toughest senior citizen octanejunkie454 Sign in Permalink I enjoy a good film, be it comedy, drama, thriller etc. I appreciate fine camera work and cinematography, and i can be found talking loudly and often about the merits of Oscar winners. What we have here though is to be judged on an entirely different level. I grew up with the "one man army" type of film and still have the guilty pleasure of popping in Commando, or Out For Justice into my DVD player from time to time. It was then, with some enthusiasm that i scampered into the cinema in Times Square in New York to get a look at Stallones latest Rambo epic. Its worth mentioning i had my long suffering wife with me too! The film begins and moves along at breakneck pace, with some of the most violent and bloody sequences ever committed to film. It had me absolutely transfixed from beginning to end, and seemed to last about 10 minutes. As you can probably gather, i loved it. I loved to see Stallone on screen again, especially after the disappointing cheese fest that was Rocky Balboa. For me the action and pace were enough for me to forgive some of the wooden acting and questionable one liners. My wife on the other hand was not so complimentry. She thought the whole thing ridiculous and sadistic and complained Sly looked to old and the whole plot was just daft. The fact that Sly is 61 and can still pull it off made me enjoy it that much more. The films release has been timed just right focusing on some of the awful atrocities being committed in Burma, just as First Blood part 2 caught the mood perfectly in 1985. You are not going to want to see this if you are of a nervous disposition, vegiterian, squeamish, or looking for a film to nominate for an Oscar. But if you want an edge of the seat thrill ride into hell and back, you won't be disappointed. When i saw it in the States it had been on general release for three weeks, and every seat in the cinema was filled.....
8.0~Rambo is back to reclaim his action crown. grindhouse74 Sign in Permalink After watching this film i felt compelled to ad my own comment, i never thought i would review a Rambo film, but this was such a hugely enjoyable action adventure that i truly feel that Sylvester Stallone has made his best action film so far, sure Stallone has made some crappy movies over the years, but he has truly resurrected a true 80's action icon. Rambo is hard as nails, a true warrior. The story couldn't be more simple, a bunch of aid workers head up river (Apocolypse Now style) into the very hostile Burma, John Rambo takes them there, when he leaves he receives news that the aid workers have been captured and taken prisoner. Rambo leads a band of mercenaries to the rescue, and this is were the film goes on to overdrive, for all the violent crimes that the baddies do, Rambo is like the angel of death, and he is there to kick there asses and what an ass kicking he gives. For a mainstream movie its probably the most violent and bloody display of awesome carnage you'll see, bodies get ripped apart from gun fire, people get blown up, throats get ripped out, and Rambo makes very good use of his iconic knife. This movie is pumped up to the max, go see it now.
8.0~Stallone ends Rambo the way it should end. savioroy Sign in Permalink I went to see Rambo last night. After reading all the reviews on this site about it i was thinking it might just be a mindless kill fest and nothing much else. There was a lot of killing don't get me wrong. This film does have some of the most realistic battle violence that will ever be seen. This film also portrays the brutal reality of the civil war in Burma. It gives a frank no bullshit look at how people are persecuted, exterminated and the horrors of genocide. Stallone as an aging war weary Rambo, does a great job. He just becomes the character so well that it seemed to me that he had never stopped being John Rambo. Some spoilers ahead. The dialogue is very one line and there are a few one liners from Rambo that made the audience laugh.The action starts pretty much straight away and the excitement and anticipation of more is awesome.Overall the film is a solid action movie with as much butchery, blood and guts as a slaughter house. Stallone gives a great performance as Rambo. He looks great for his age, gotta love the growth hormones. The story isn't all that great but that can be overlooked. I believe that this film is a fitting end to the career of the greatest action hero of our time. Salute to you John Rambo
5.0~Killings as easy as breathing.... FlashCallahan Sign in Permalink John Rambo is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. When a group of Christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in Burma to help the locals, Rambo only accepts when Sarah Miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission. Rambo leaves the group in the requested location, but the village where they are working is attacked by a sadistic army. The locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted. Later a member of their church meets Rambo and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries.... Five years ago,,it was great to see Rambo back on the big screen. Willis had returned to his Die Hard roots just six months previous, and good old fashioned action was sorely missed. Now take away all the nostalgia of the eighties action movies, and the diminished expectations many of the public had with action movies, and what you get is a very average, very formulaic movie. Don't get me wrong, when I first saw this, I thought it was amazing, but when I watch it now, I couldn't care less what happens in the film, until Rambo starts his slaughter, because to he honest, that's all we have paid to see. The rest of the film is Brit actors pretending to be very tough, and Rambo giving them dirty looks. Missionaries trying to reason with Rambo, and he just swearing at them and walking off. And Rambo dreaming about the alternate ending to First Blood. Stallone is as good as ever, and the film really does come alive in the last half hour, but the first hour really drags, and in hindsight, it's not very good at all.
6.0~We need more Rambos in the world pmdawn Sign in Permalink This movie comes out at a time where there are reports of genocides happening all over the world. The opening scenes are the most violent in the whole movie, because they are REAL. You probably already know that Rambo is a killing machine. That he is a man of few words. That he lives by his own moral codes. That he wears a red bandanna. And that he's a hero. Well then, rejoice, action fans: Rambo's back and he still bears all those 'qualities'. The violence is very realistic, some times over the top, and with a lot of editing. This time Rambo goes on a mission with a team of mercenaries to save American missionaries that were captured by the bad guys. That's about it when it comes to the plot. Here, the bad guys are reaaaally bad (aka one dimensional) - their day job is ethnic cleansing. So you can't expect Rambo to fight genocide with flowers. This is not for the squeamish. What I liked about this movie, as opposed to the likes of Sin City (a masterfully done film, but with a sick kind of violence that disturbs me) is that, in showing the massacres, you actually get the point. These things are REAL, and I suspect they are even worse in real life than they are depicted in this movie. This movie even had me doubting my own morals, as I recalled the scene with Dr. Missionary telling Rambo that no killing is justified and all persons have a right to live. Rambo replies saying there some have, but some do not, and in the end I was agreeing with him. That's how powerful this movie is. So, if you're an action or Rambo fan, you'll be pleased. Don't expect something like Die Hard 4. And as weird as this sounds, I think this movie is a must-watch for today's "SAW-hungry" generation because at least there's a message behind all the glorified violence.
9.0~Very Surprising! zach-usher Sign in Permalink I actually saw this movie about a month ago... And I'm just now writing a review of it. Oh well... This is definitely the one of most raw and violent movies I think I have ever seen--much, MUCH more-so than the first three films. The footage maintains a refreshing quality of unpolished reality. Many, many of the scenes are, for lack of a better word, intense, but the reminders they give and the points they make are also very valid, not to mention CURRENT--and eye-opening. Things like that are really happening in the world-- RIGHT NOW. The acting delivered by Julie Benz is surprisingly not up-to-par (Not at all reminiscent of her continually excellent performances on "Dexter,") and some of the scenes between she and Stallone seem almost clumsy and unrehearsed. But overall the acting is solid and the film's 'almost like you're there' feel only increases the already intense-but-awesome feeling of watching it. Stallone has delivered an absolute Masterpiece.
10.0~stallone is rambo!!!!! bondguy77 Sign in Permalink stallone plays rambo again in this great film full of action and suspense. this is my favorite stallone film, even over the other three rambo films prior to this one,which were also great movies. stallone doesn't fail to entertain in this latest installment of the rambo franchise.two thumbs way up!!!!
5.0~Pure cheese! david-546 Sign in Permalink If you want lots of action and Stallone at his Rambo/Rocky we are going to beat the S*** out of the baddies best than this is the movie for you. Otherwise this movie is pure cheese. It is all over the top. Rambo takes a bunch of do good missionaries far up into Thailand where the Karen rebels are fighting the Thai government. Despite his warnings off they go. Naturally the Thai soldiers come along to clean out the village and we mean clean out. Even these soldiers give ethnic cleansing a bad name all the while laughing and guffawing their way to mass mayhem and murder. The missionaries are spared for whatever reason. Maybe whiteys make good prisoners for later exchange who knows. Anyway Rambo is now being persuaded to go back and rescue the poor begotten missionaries with a merry band of mercenaries seemingly headed by one bad-ass Brit. Tension mounts between Rambo and the mercenaries and they want him to stay and hold the boat for them while they go off to rescue the missionaries from the evil Thai soldiers. Naturally things go awry but don't worry Rambo comes to the rescue and the last part of the film is taken with more blood and guts blowing all over the place then one has probably ever seen in a movie. Too bad it all looks so gratuitous and downright silly laughable even. Anyway Rambo saves the female missionary from sure fire rape and pillage and the Karen rebels arrive in the nick of time (kind of like the old US cavalry arriving to save the white settlers from the evil Indians) and the day is saved and the body count mounts and mounts and mounts. Well you get the picture. All we can say is it's an adrenaline rush but don't expect a serious movie because it is all pure cheese! ANd Rambo growls off into the sunset or whatever it is.
10.0~Stallone goes all out for one last war raju2k84 Sign in Permalink We all know John Rambo, an ex-green beret, Vietnam war vet, standing tall against all odds, being the enemy's worst nightmare....This time, our hero has grown older, but the ravages of time seem to have made him stronger.Away from civilization, he has embraced war-zone as his home.But, Rambo proves once again that heroes exist for a reason.And at the end of it all, it doesn't hurt to go back to your roots and live in peace.This is an ultra-violent, slick, twisted tale of horrors of war, and how brutality can only be fought by more brutality.Stallone packs a real punch in his bang-on target direction, and his every kill will make u feel that the victim truly deserved it.Do not believe the critics, this is the definitive action movie of our times.If people could like idiotic cinema like Hostel, Grindhouse, I can clearly see why the critics hate Rambo.This movie has it all, Great Action, Tight Script, Awesome Stunt-Pieces, and some great action by Sly....Go for it, Rambo.....
1.0~Blacksmith in a Horseless Town Matthew_Capitano Sign in Permalink Dumbo, John J., is back, working as a blacksmith, though not so much as a tired mule is anywhere in sight. But this dreary shoot-em-up series is certainly tired while Still-Lackluster Staclown shows up looking like somebody's fat uncle. The body-count for Rambo this time is 93, six of which Rambo felt he had to kill with a nuclear explosion, complete with a mushroom cloud. The film is saturated with unrecognizable elements not found in the other Rambo movies, including terrible computer animation that was used to show enemy bodies being mutilated, and Staclown himself who appears in this flick overweight and just way too old to still be screwing around as the cheap comic book 'war machine' he's always tried to be. The only question here is why Rambo would take a stupid woman (Julie Benz) to a war zone where he knows she's going to be captured and raped 100 times.
10.0~The Best of The Series so Far ! loka7 Sign in Permalink Therefore yes, I was at the press projection, and I have only a thing to say, my friends: This Movie Will Rock the World... Stallone is sublime inside, the film is extraordinary, the personage magnificently is exploited, and the end is an absolute killings (and a complete butcher shop). I have almost envies to resume one to one the arguments of all the *beep* that descended the film without even to have seen it. Outside of a small blow of soft one for about twenty minutes in the middle, the film is as good as Rocky Balboa (already a masterpiece to my eyes). This is really the only defect: 20 Mn in the middle where the film advances little. But the first half an hour, this is masterpiece. And the final half an hour, this is total killings! Forget all that you saw, forget all that you imagined on the film: JOHN RAMBO IS BETTER THAN ALL THAT YOU SAW IN THE BANDS ANNOUNCE. And I finish on the end: leave me to say you that you will be surprised, and very moved (I had the eyes a not very humid ones, I did not cry as for Rocky Balboa, but I were very moved)."
10.0~Angry times call for angry men Zentaurion Sign in Permalink War... It's Faaaantastic!! At least it is if you're a guy with a chip on your shoulder and need something to prove. In a time of Political Correctness skewering the joy out of every thing good and wholesome, the Italian Stallion brings to the screen something that eviscerates all the clichéd standards of action movies with brutal violence that could give even incumbent housewives Vietnam Flashbacks. There is not a shred of candy-coating to tone down the brutality of the subject matter. Not to glorify the adult content, but this movie puts to shame the genre of movies such as Saw/Hostel/Hills Have Eyes. This isn't stuff that was thought up by some loser with no imagination. The brutality captured in this movie is the real violence that affects people's lives around the world. The missionaries that put their lives on the line in the name of hope are the real people who go out there to try and make a difference. And the character of John Rambo is the soul of every man who yearns to bring justice no matter what the cost. An inspiring movie for anyone with faith in the hard work that honest men do to bring peace to the few that can appreciate it in the world.
9.0~A VERY well-deserved R rating! ervty Sign in Permalink With how old Stallone is, you'd think he'd be slowing down by now. But this movie is awesome. It starts out a little slow, with Rambo just living a simple life, as all the Rambo movies do. But then someone asks for help, he helps, things get complicated, and he starts killing. But with this one, it's more of a building action than the other ones. He slowly works up to killing more people, and for about the first 120 minutes of the movie, only kills a few dozen, so it doesn't become stale and repetitive. Then near the end of the movie is a scene in a Burmese army base camp, which is the site of debauchery that would give Blood Diamond a run for its money, and throughout the story you see more and more gruesome and barbaric practices by the Burmese army that they basically get away with, then it builds to a climax that's so exciting and long in coming that I found myself smiling broadly and giggling like a schoolgirl. Sylvester is as inarticulate as ever, but he knows this, and is a man of few words in this movie. The storyline flowed and more or less made sense, without any real glaring errors or oversights. Also, the special effects are amazing! Heads implode, people step on mines and explode, limbs are realistically blown off, and gaping see-through holes are shot through people. And unlike the 80s where you could often tell what was a fake prosthetic, in this movie the special effects combine seamlessly with the movie. It's certainly not a movie to take your Mother to (unless she likes this sort of stuff), but this is a must-see for all action movie lovers. Sensible script, awesome special effects, few words from Sylvester Stallone, decent acting, and a kick-@$$ climax make this a movie well worth your money to see it in theaters or on DVD.
8.0~The Biggest, Dumbest Fun I've Ever Had Hannibal_Chigurh Sign in Permalink Back in 2006, Sylvester Stallone made Rocky Balboa, a film so good it not only washed out the bad taste left by Rocky IV and the atrocious Rocky V, it ranked with the classic first film. The praise he received for it was the best marketing Sly was gonna get for his announced Rambo sequel, which takes our shell-shocked hero into Burma. As someone who hated the beyond over-the-top Rambo sequels (Rambo vs. Vietnam, really?), I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, if he could pull Rocky out of the Stygian failure it was in, why not Ramo? Lo and behold, Sly has made one of the best theater movies ever and unquestionably the best blockbuster to come out in January. This time, Stallone gives us the barest of bones plot to set things up, which is a welcome relief to the attempted depth of the first two Rambo sequels. Sly takes a group of missionaries into Burma, then has to go back in to save them when the inevitable occurs. Rambo is joined by a group of mercenaries hired by the missionaries' church to find them. Soon, the rescue mission turns into the war we're expecting from John Rambo. Sly uses actual film instead of digitally throwing in severed body parts and blood, lending this film the most realistic violence since Saving Private Ryan (Grindhouse used regular film too, but you wouldn't call zombie killing realistic now would you?). Every bloodbath looks all the more grisly. Following the basic plot setup, we never get more than a minute or two without something exploding, which is a wise move that detracts from Stallone's visibly aged body and that blank stoic face that elicits laughter instead of intimidation. The last act of the film is so epic that it pushed 300 out of the way and cemented this film as the best theater experience I have ever had. I don't normally cheer at a film (it's not like the actors can hear you), but I was going wild for this film. Since t has no plot to speak of and most lines are laughably bad, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece of film, but it's certainly one of the most thrilling action films you will ever see.
8.0~Sylvester Stallone Reloads for the Last Time with "Rambo" 4. zardoz-13 Sign in Permalink Writer & director Sylvester Stallone raises the bar for violent, bloodthirsty combat sequences in his third sequel to "First Blood" (1982), the original epic about ex-Green Beret warrior John Rambo's exploits. Moreover, "Rambo" makes the rugged battle scenes in Ridley Scott's adrenaline-fueled "Black Hawk Down" and Steven Spielberg's bullet-riddled "Saving Private Ryan" look like pugnacious paint-ball-blasting tournaments. No, "Rambo" doesn't boast the production values or elaborate villains that he confronted in "Rambo: First Blood Part 2" of Rambo III." Indeed, there are fewer explosions, but the considerably ramped up violence and the vicious Burmese Army troops compensate for those shortcomings. The scenes of carnage in "Rambo" are so intense and gory that you'll shudder with revulsion every time a bullet pulverizes somebody, including the hideously repugnant villains. If the first two Rambo movies, "First Blood" and "Rambo: First Blood, Part 2," served as referendums on the contentious Vietnam War, with "Rambo 3" skewering the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, then it should come as no surprise that "Rambo" four exposes the genocide raging for sixty years in Burma. In fact, Stallone selected Burma, officially called the Union of Myanmar, as the setting because the conflict between the Burmese Army and the Karen ethnic minority qualifies as the world's longest civil war. Said Stallone in a recent "Movies On-Line" interview, "From the time I heard about it and began researching it, I though, 'If I could just combine the tworaising awareness of the Karen-Burmese civil war and giving the audience a good adventure storythat would be perfect.'" Art Monterastelli and Stallone co-scripted "Rambo" and it clocks in at about 80 minutes with a 12 minute end credit roll. Essentially, it's like an extended "A-Team" episode with gallons of blood and gore and terrific computer generated special effects that heighten the realism of the battle sequences. Mind you, twenty years has elapsed since hard-bodied, tight-lipped Rambo swapped lead with anybody. Nothing has changed. Although it's as predictable, straightforward, but solemn as previous Rambo actioneers, "Rambo" is also as old-fashioned as any of the 1942-1945 World War II Hollywood propaganda movies that justified U.S. intervention in a global war. Stallone appears a mite long in the tooth (he's 62-years old), but he looks like Samson in fatigues, with blood veins entwining his bulging forearms like giant pythons. Unlike his last movie "Rocky Balboa" where he proudly displayed his physique , Stallone doesn't shred his fatigues. Interestingly, he may be one of the few action heroes who refuse to rip his shirt to ribbons like the classic pulp fiction hero Doc Savage, Man of Bronze, every time that he tangled with an adversary. When we meet Rambo, he is living in northern Thailand, runs a longboat the River Salween, captures cobras for a side show, and does a little blacksmithing. Several human rights missionaries ask him to ferry them into nearby Burma so they can deliver medical supplies and services to destitute Karen villagers. Initially, the world-weary Rambo refuses, but one of the missionaries, Sarah (plain-Jane looking Julie Benz of Showtime's "Dexter"), convinces him to take them. The ride upriver evokes memories of "Apocalypse Now" with Marlon Brando. No sooner have the Christian missionaries reached a remote village and improved the quality of life than the evil soldiers arrive. They either kill or enslave everybody. These scenes are rather graphic. Afterward, Reverend Arthur March (Ken Howard of "Michael Clayton") who represents the missionaries approaches Rambo about taking a motley crew of mercenaries in to rescue Sarah and the survivors. The mercenaries have second thoughts when they learn that the Army outnumbers them ten-to-one. Rambo shames them into doing their job. Naturally, Rambo cannot pass up a good fight so he breaks out his bow & arrow. Later, he wields a .50 caliber machine gun with devastating results, mowing down well over seventy-five soldiers. Rambo's best line is: "Live for nothing, or die for something!" Richard Crenna briefly appears in a montage sequence as Colonel Trautman when Rambo ponders his fate. Talented "Exit Wounds" lenser Glen MacPherson photographed the action against authentic Thai backgrounds. Happily, "Rambo" brings our hero full circle in what Stallone has said is the final "Rambo" film.
10.0~Rambo delivered my expectations and more... ucantseeme1029 Sign in Permalink All in all this has been one of the few action movies to entertain me for a while other than Hit-man. I was kind of "meeeh" with Die Hard 4, Terminator 3, and the like, but they lacked something that I thought Rambo IV brought to the table. This is one of those films I wouldn't change any elements at all. But this only from my opinion. Just go see it and judge for yourself. I can't say that you will or won't be disappointed everyone has there own taste of whats good and whats not. All I know is what was presented to me I and what I took from it. For me it showed that no matter how much we want to live a peaceful world where we can all sit down and talk out our problems, we simply can't. Some people don't want to talk, they want to fight and control others, and thats where the film is getting at. The scary thing is that there are no movie monsters that are more scary than the brutal killers that are portrayed in this film. These people that are the reasons why our nations have soldiers in the first place. The film also points out that there comes to a point where you keep getting pushed you have to push back or things will not stop. It certainly does not say "go kill someone because you're being bullied". But in certain situations people can't sit by and let things go the way they are. As quote goes: "all it takes for evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing"...and thats where the film leaves us. Do we sit or fight back? Kill or be killed? Will I be evil/good for fighting back? Such is the conundrum that is presented and struggle that we could all someday face...
4.0~Boring piece with a quite satisfying action moments. Veppe77 Sign in Permalink Last night I saw Rambo for the second time, first time seeing it on the big screen and I waited to give my review until I've seen in a theater. There were about 120 seats taken out of about 200 and it was the opening night in the town I live in, but still I was surprised so many came to see it. The audience was 90% male and most of them seemed to be working class and kids that didn't go to high school or so I presume. Some familiar faces from the university I study in were there, but mainly cap-headed working class people. Some chuckles through out the movie ("F*ck off, alright", "F*ck the world", "You say something mate" and when Sly rips the guy's throat, cuts the head off and when School Boy shoots the head off from a boat man). A group of people clapped a bit after the showing, but overall the atmosphere in the theater was quite tame and response wasn't overly ecstatic. What I thought about the movie? Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Clearly better than Rambo II and III but that's like saying Stalin was nicer than Hitler. The movie is boring. As hell. It sure does shed some light to a serious matter, but so what. Does it automatically make the movie worth seeing and entertaining? No. Sly seems to think that the key to make a good action movie is to kill as many people as possible. I get it. The situation in Burma is horrible but you don't have to push it down to my throat. I'm not that stupid. Nevertheless, the battle in the end is quite satisfying. The pacing of the movie sucks. I don't know if pacing is the right word, but the film bounces too much from place to place. First Rambo and the mercenaries are on the boat, Lewis is whining and what not. Cut to the camp where bad men are. Cut back to the boat and still Lewis is whining about the same things as two minutes ago. Then again cut to the camp and then back to the boat. This kind of thing I see on 24. Five minutes pass and nothing really happens. The mercenaries are introduced but this could have used some tightening and rewriting. I'm not gonna say anything about the acting, because there really isn't any. People just are there and what else can you expect from a Rambo movie. The script is a complete rip-off from the previous two piles of cow crap. Just when you think Sly wouldn't dare use the "rebels save the day" thing from part III, what do you know, there come the rebels. Sly is apparently so out of ideas and can't come up with anything he hasn't already done. Why make the movie if I may ask? The film is boring until Rambo saves the day with his bow and arrow. From there on the movie picks up and is quite entertaining. It took 40 minutes to start the goddamn movie. The escape from the camp sequence is only OK, but better than anything so far in the movie. Then some running and a bomb and, because of apparently very stupid soldiers, it blows up. Then there's the final battle which somehow is the best part of the movie even though it's total mayhem. Sly just stands there and makes faces and shakes a bit. That's tough, man. So tough that it must be tougher anything Matt Damon does. The baddest of baddest people seems to be gay, right. Did I catch that right? So he is already a very bad man, but then on top of that he's gay, so that makes him even worse? Is that what Sly's trying to say? Overall: Better than II and III and Sly can direct somewhat entertaining action. Slow start bores you so much that even the moderately fine finale can't save this disaster. 4/10.
3.0~I laughed out loud several times during this movie knave-0 Sign in Permalink Of course laughing out loud would be good if this was a comedy but it isn't. If somebody made a parody of Weird Al Yankovich in the movie UHF's parody of Rambo, it would look exactly like this. The plot is basic. The acting is not great. But by George they sure do blow a heck of a lot of stuff up and they shoot about 1000 people and blow them to bits with 16 different types of weapons and you get to see all of it in graphic detail. So, I guess if that is what you are after, then this is the movie for you. If you actually like acting and plot in a movie, go see anything else. I am stunned that this movie is rated so high on this site (at 7.7 stars at the time of my writing this).
7.0~A return to the 80's war hero genre? Nothing great, but still a hard working effort from Stallone. blanbrn Sign in Permalink Well after years and out of the collective minds of film goers, Sly Stallone returns back with his classic 80's war epic drama this time by the simple title of "Rambo". Just as many became accustomed to in the 1980's with these films of a me mentality against the world in which I conquer and defeat whole armies, this 2008 edition is just about similar. Stallone is back as Vietnam war veteran John Rambo who travels up the Northern Thailand river crossing the Burma border. During classic flashbacks of montage editing the film displays his mindset as Rambo sees just about what he is to return to that is blood, bodies, and bombs, and shootings a foreshadow of things to see from the ongoing civil war of the Burmese. Yet despite the fact that this civil war has been raging for 60 years, Rambo's mission becomes even more important as this time his rescue mission involves finding and bringing back a group of church people on aid assignment. This film is vintage Stallone with heart pounding action and explosions and the tense drama of any war epic, and too it's quality does compete with the 1980 films. The effort and acting is good from Stallone who wrote and directed you can tell he worked hard at it. The theme of war, and fighting for freedom from a war hero rings true with the times of now with the ever constant threat of terrorism and international conflict. Overall nothing great, but again good work from Stallone.
9.0~One of the worst movies I have ever seen kataleen2k Sign in Permalink Starting with 100 years old Stallone missing his wheelchair going through incredibly "not cool at all" bloody effects and ending with a disappointing story not to say plain childish. I thought I will change my opinion about Stallone after seeing Rocky Balboa, but the disappointment just grew. If he needed some money, I would have been more than happy to donate some, but he really shouldn't have created this totally awful movie. I would not recommend this to anyone. I have to mention that the first movies in the Rambo series were quite good, with a more intelligent story. All in all bad movie, old Stallone, unnecessary over bloody effects (hey...the guys who came up with those...it's a movie, not a documentary or a horror). Extremely disappointed,
1.0~Sly should have gone out in style bjoern-37 Sign in Permalink ...instead he comes back to release something like this. 20 years ago John Rambo had his last appearance on the big screen - too bad Sly didn't leave it at that! While "First blood" actually had a story to tell and the second part was a nice action film (which to a lesser degree is also true for Rambo 3) this fourth film is - IMHO - nothing but a poor attempt an aging Sylvester Stallone with so much botox in his face he could as well act with a mask in front of his face made to hit pay-dirt one last time. I like bloody movies, but "John Rambo" has NOTHING to offer but 20-30 minutes of the bloodiest slaughter I've ever seen in a mainstream kind of movie. It fits that Sly doesn't even carry his artillery any more: Instead he uses a mounted cannon to dissect legions of enemies from a nice, comfy distance... To make one thing clear: I don't mind explicit violence in films and I enjoyed the earlier Rambo-films - but this one has nothing to offer but closeups of flying body parts. The rating of 7.7 for this "masterpiece" is a travesty and makes you wonder if you can still trust the rating-system... I give it a "3" and hope that others will follow...
3.0~very bad things Tinmancr Sign in Permalink This is a very poor sequel of a sequel of a sequel. The story is marginal a pretty standard pile of crap lions gate movie "intentional lower case" Pretty much a pure shock movie violence in every way mostly unnecessary rapes, mutilation, and over the top action type violence. For the high reviewers out there, I am blown away and feel you might need professional help. This movie never should have been released and especially not R it would be a hard NC17! This is the second worst Stallone movie I've seen, and I have seen most. On top of everything else it is a B movie and not even in the Rambo style. If you still want to watch this at least do so without any kids. Reviewed by Josh
8.0~Decent movie boatsfra Sign in Permalink Rambo is back, Stallone looking every bit his 61 years, but he can still deliver a knock-out punch...the violence is certainly gratuitous, and kudos to the make up artist for the absolute bloodiest shootings that I can remember...there is no "Hollywood shootings, i.e. several bullets to take someone down". So in other words...Rambo shoots, people die...I couldn't be sure if the saga has ended...who knows who will bring Rambo out of quasi-retirement...maybe the terrorists? I can think of worse movies to see...definitely not a date movie, unless you are taking your guy...a shoot 'em up for sure, with Rambo saying about 10 words throughout.
8.0~Welcome home John Rambo!! grinten38 Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone's alter ego John Rambo is back in action, presumably for the last time. This film resembles Stallone's final goodbye to Rocky Balboa, which was shot in a slow 70's style. This one is shot in a fast 80's style. However it has the brutality of today. Images we see on the Internet or on news casts every day. Stallone does not hold back on the graphic details of violence and, although Rambo does not talk much, it sends a clear message: the violence is not glorified, nor justified, it's just there, part of reality as we have created it over due course and we have to deal with it whether we like it or not. Finally John Rambo faces the fact who he really is and accepts it. The final shot is a nice homage to First Blood and it serves as a fitting end to one of Hollywoods all time action heroes. Stallone has paid respect to the character that made him an international superstar. For that he deserves all the credit. If you're a fan of Stallone or of the Rambo character, this is a must see. If you like action movies, this one is also recommended. If you don't like graphical violence, nor Stallone or Rambo for that matter, don't watch it.
1.0~Its a Movie Not a Game!! EddyC09 Sign in Permalink this movie was clearly made for the call of duty crowd and its terrible to see this rated a 7.2. Let me summarise the movie Blood,Gore,Bad acting,Boring and 50. cal. the main draw to rambo seems to be the gore and let me say there are far more gorier movies this movie sold well just because of the hype to the violence.if you want violence and blood look at horror films not rambo. I'd Rate the movie 2 out of 10 but am awarding it a 1 to try and even out the score. and for people who will say i cant handle the gore or some crap like that i'm saying the gore here is very tame
10.0~As real as it gets Fidel_Castro Sign in Permalink In terms of authenticity Stallone has exceeded everything he has done with this one. The Rocky films as excellent as they were were ace because you supported Rocky all the way, you felt good at the end despite how untrue to life it was. John Rambo or Rambo IV shows the horrors of war the way it is. It shares the same ethos as its predecessors as focusing on something that isn't in the limelight, this film highlights something that has been going on for many years. Yes it's ultraviolent and it pulls no punches, thats the purpose. Rambo is now a more synical and embittered character than the previous film. Overall probably the best action film since Terminator 2. MUST SEE!!
7.0~Rambo IV - Better Than Expected. AaronCapenBanner Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone once again plays John Rambo after 20 years, and proves he is most capable as both star and director. Story has him living in seclusion in Thailand, where he is enlisted by Christian Missionaries to help him rescue their own, who are being held captive in Burma by the ruthless overlords in that war torn country. Full of action, with some surprisingly realistic violence(when those big guns fire bullets, you can see the real impact, no sugar-coating here!) Stallone plays Rambo as a world weary soldier, who is brought back into the problems of the world, and resolves to defeat this local evil, before continuing his journey of self-discovery and fulfillment, which nicely brings the series full circle. Will there be a fifth and final adventure? Time will tell...
4.0~Manipulative oragex Sign in Permalink I'm sorry for all Rambo/Stallone fans. 4/10 may seem like injustice, but it is for a reason: this movie is totally manipulative. What this movie does is displaying shocking images with civilians being brutally murdered, then makes you feel a strong revenge emotion, then bring the 'saver' to kill the bad guys. Nothing new in a movie, only the brutal killings are atrocious just to cause a strong revenge feeling. This is all a lie, and who is perpetrating it? Stallone of course, the 'good' guy in the movie who in fact is the shady guy in real life who wrote this movie. I mean, trowing kids in fire? Repeated scenes with shooting kids and stabbing women? The killing of an entire village man by man, woman by woman, elder by elder, piece by piece, leg by leg, arm by arm, it's just an horrible manipulation which shows in fact what's inside this Stallone guy. Like everyone here I've seen countless films with action/villains/war/atrocities and so on. Simply this movie was only written to play with watchers emotions in a shady way.
7.0~A solid action flick LoneWolfAndCub Sign in Permalink I have never seen any of the previous Rambo films nor am I a huge fan of Stallone. However, after the latest Rambo is definitely one of the best recent actions movies in some time. Stallone knows what the audience wants when going into a Rambo-style action film and competently delivers on every aspect (but falling into plenty of clichés along the way). There is the disgruntled hero, called back into service against an army of one-dimensionally evil villains. There are the uber-cool mercenaries and of course, the blonde beauty who is basically the centre of the plot. Thrown into the mix as well is huge amounts of blood, entrails, exploding heads and bodies and plenty of limbs. I see many comments on here complaining about the violence and calling the film "disturbed" and "sick." Really, what does one expect from an R rated Rambo flick??? I went in expecting non-stop action, violence and a one-dimensional plot and characters and that is what I got. For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it succeeded in its goal of being an adrenaline-packed action extravaganza. One major problem I had was the fact you could not hear what Stallone was saying, he seemed to mumble his whole way through the movie. Oh well, this is recommended for someone who wants 80 minutes of mindless violence and action. 3½/5
7.0~Brutal but good zetes Sign in Permalink Holy crap! It's kind of silly that they even brought this character back after so much time. I mean, he was a relic of the Vietnam War and, while that's not forgotten, not even in the political spectrum, the political arguments those original films moronically made are pretty dead. The new Rambo doesn't even mention Vietnam. It takes place in nearby Burma, a country of great social strife and unending violence. Believe me, Rambo doesn't help matters much as far as the violence is concerned. When a group of Christian missionaries which he helped get into Burma is captured, Rambo joins a band of mercenaries to try to extract them. It's the most brutal mainstream American film ever made, no doubt. Brains splatter, heads roll and limbs fly off. The worst thing is, this kind of carnage is happening in a lot of places on Earth every day, although probably not instigated by a 62 year-old Vietnam vet. Surprisingly, the film doesn't take this lightly at all. It wants the audience to feel bad. It's hard to recommend this to anyone, because it really is disgusting. It is, however, undoubtedly gripping, as well, if you can stomach it.
9.0~Holy Freaking Jumping Violent Catfish enazwo Sign in Permalink Yeah I know this is Rambo, not Shakspeare, not anything but what it is, and it is what it is, John Rambo. An outcast, ostracized Vietnam Vet. How many of you know any real Vietnam Vets out there? I know a few, my uncle was a Green Beret who served in Nam, he came back alive, but wasn't exactly the Avon Lady, if get my drift. This movie gave me my bang for my buck. I have also been a Stallone fan, even through the lean times. He's an easy target for ridicule, but he's always delivered the goods. When I see a movie I know what I'm getting into, like when I saw "Remains of the Day", "Atonement", "Map of the World". or if it's "The Princess Bride", "Lonesome Dove" or the "LotR" trilogy, I know going in. And Stallone has hit another Home run, that's right two Home runs in a row now, "Rocky Balboa" and "Rambo". Do not go see this movie if you're a cynic, peacock, or self ordained movie snob. Do us, and yourself a favor do not see this. Okay? But if you love "On the edge of your seat action", "Hold your breath tension", "Adrenline pumping" "Old School Nineteen Eightes shoot up action", that pulls no punches; then do your self a favor and put your pedal to the medal, and get on down to the theatre at Warp Factor 9 and treat yourself to an awesome-fun, pure escapism, mindless, popcorn munching great time. Oh by the way, Stallone YOU ROCK!
8.0~Rambo: "Who needs a plot, anyway?" - Burma & The Difference Between Abomination & Justification don85 Sign in Permalink On Oscar night I went to see Rambo, John Rambo. A movie that won't win any Academy Awards but is still in the race for some other 'awards' (see below) Before I went in, I knew what to expect: 1.5 hour of counting bullets, guts, decapitated heads, chopped off limbs and gallons of blood. And that's what I got. I must admit that the violence in the beginning of the movie, when murderous rebels exterminate a complete village, isn't the sort of violence you'd love to see. Mothers, fathers, kids and dogs are wiped out in such a realistic and, hereby, horrific way that the images won't be wiped out of your memory for a long time. Sadly it's only present harsh reality. So far for the social comments on the events taking place in Burma right now. "It's time for John Rambo to finish off the bad guys and rescue some Western social helpers. They thought they were gonna make a change but ended up being captivated by the Burma-rebels. Half a dozen of army men come to the rescue and hire Rambo as their boatman to lead the way. He isn't allowed to join their mission though. Surprise, surprise. Johnny shows up anyhow and saves the day. Who needs a half 'dirty dozen' when you got John Rambo, a one-man-army? " Like I said, in the beginning of the movie the violence is tough and unpleasant because of all the innocent people being killed. However the violence won't even out in the rest of the movie, from the time JR begins to join the action the violence begins to get very enjoyable indeed. Something to think about. It's the difference between abomination and justification. John Rambo does what he does best handling snipers, throwing grenades, shooting lots of bullets and showing his immense muscles every time he can. Too bad it didn't took him longer to fight (t)his war. The picture is very well shot. At times very dark and grayish which captures the feeling of a troubled country in war. Other times it is the beauty of nature that leads to this great contradiction that, cinematographically is done very well. It's this, and the incomprehensible way the violence is brought to the screen, that makes for a well done movie. John Rambo in top form. If you're a fan of the man you'll definitely like what you see. Really. I wonder if Guinness Book of Records is gonna rate this movie as 'most violence in a movie ever, period' and win a deserved award after all..
10.0~The violence ! the beautiful violence! awesome. Filmnerd1984 Sign in Permalink i sat down in the movie theater expecting nothing more than recycled action with up to date effects. but i quickly realized i was watching the best movie since transformers. it is one of those movies that you just know that you're gonna watch it 140 times and still be entertained. i was jumping up and down in my seat , laughing and reacting. Stallone delivers the goods and then some. i haven't felt this good watching a movie since i was 10 and saw Jurassic Park. And the violence can put a million horror flicks to shame with the film's incomprehensible amount of blood, brains and flying limbs. i was so impressed that i found nothing negative about the whole movie, and it easily pushes in to my top 20 favorite movies ever. further more this is the most raw and brutal movie i have ever seen. forget saw or hostel. Rambo is the movie to watch. trust me, it is a must see masterpiece of an action movie.
10.0~Ultimate respect Mr Stallone DMacca48 Sign in Permalink Nostalgic, touching, realistic and very unafraid. This is a bold statement and a very necessary one. I can't stop watching it, those who disapprove fair enough but I grew up with sincere love for these kind of films, and until now...I thought they didn't make 'em like this anymore, and this has a gritty, fresh take on it too. It had a new take on the Rambo character himself, you can really sympathise with this jaded, sad man. A result of past sadness and horror, this man isn't cheesy (apart from where necessary) and you can feel his pain through this honest delivery. The score was moving, it played on the old films very well but only touched on them a little and offered something new as well. The emotional score really tugged the heart strings. I recommend anyone to watch this at the cinema as we owe it to the director and everyone involved in making the film. And not only was it touching but it also illustrated part of what war is like in real life, I am not a Burma expert but if that is the way some things are over there, then this film has started a small fire,and if the goings-on in that film are a reflection of reality then I hope pressure amounts. Stallone, my hat is off, bring on number 5 sir.
5.0~John Rambo kills again. SwooooP Sign in Permalink I read some rewires here, that this is a masterpiece, and that the movie is a important reminder of the conflict in Burma. What a load of stuff that comes out of the bottom of most mammals. This is a Rambo movie, made with the intension of making money. Its a greedy exploitation of whats really happens in Burma, and you have to be an American to think otherwise. Patriotism my "you know where." But its fun exploitation. If you can call anything just that. They did pretty much the same thing in Rambo 2 and 3, the only differences is that the US is not that involved with the Burma conflict, so why do something else now? Its a mindless blood-feast with the steroid eating killing machine Rambo at the center. Its action, its gory, and most of us liking this kind of stuff will love it. Sly delivers a back to the 80s action packed popcorn fun-ride. Enjoy! :)
9.0~Pure adrenaline fuelled action dicko_2006 Sign in Permalink This is easily one of the best Rambo films a great ride from start to finish. The action scenes are breathtaking. Sure the films violent but heck they didn't create the age certificate of 18 or Nc-17 for no reason. Stalones acting and directing is on top form which just proves the people who said this O.A.P can not do another Rambo are idiots. Although i can honestly say there is not a bad actor in the film apart from the English S.A.S solider he was annoying us Brits are not all like that. This is a fitting end to the Rambo saga ... But hell i want another RAMBO!!!! "Live for nothing .. Or die for something"
10.0~Best Movie In A Long Time ckeene-3 Sign in Permalink Alright last night I had some time to kill so I went to check out the new Rambo. After seeing the latest edition of Rocky I was a little concerned that it would probably be a little slow and the Stallone was getting a little old. Well all I can say is this is not the case at all. He proved he still has it and I left happier than I have in a while after seeing a movie. This is by far the best action movie I have saw in very long time. I go to the movies all the time. Sure I see some people complain it is violent and gory, but come on it is Rambo what did you expect when you sat down to watch it. If you want an action packed movie that will have you leaving the movie theather hyped up then this is the movie for you. As for the people who gave this movie bad reviews all I can say is get a life and quit finding the bad in everything.
7.0~Macho to the extreme artzau Sign in Permalink Some people don't like Rambo. They find it mindless, gore-larded violent and jingoistic. They should definitely not attend this film or even consider renting it, when it comes out (as indeed, it will) on DVD. Having said that, I can honestly say I loved it. There's not a whit of intellectualism, philosophizing or subtext messaging. Gone are the anti-Communist, MIA and freedom fighter messages of the earlier Rambo/First Blood films. This is just sheer entertainment in the violent, action genre and damn good at that. Stallone looks great and his clenched jaw, scowl and contemptuous sneer is as great as ever. Sure, he single-handedly wipes out a bunch of Burmese bad guys, but, hey, we didn't fork over for that high priced ticket for a seat to see him give an inspirational Dr. Phil feel-good talk. No, we paid to see him kick some butt and believe me, he does. Stereotyped? Violent? Yes. Anti-intellectual? No. Anyone who would see a Rambo film looking for thought provocation is likely not too bright to begin with. Save it for a Coen Brother's film. Rambo is delightful action entertainment. Live with it!
7.0~Bang, bang, stab. In a good way. oneguyrambling Sign in Permalink You might criticise Sly Stallone for many things, the steroids, the slow lisped drawl, the fact that his seemingly has ignored the possibility that his "window" of relevance closed some 20 years ago but the indisputable fact is that Sly knows that critics don't pay for tickets to his movies, males 16 to 30 something do. To that end I have paid for Rocky Balboa (pretty good), The Expendables (ditto but perhaps less so) and (a couple years ago) I lined up for Rambo 4 – fully expecting it to suck by the way. And it was pretty good too. See the fact is most males 16 to 30 something know what they like and don't care too much about quality. This explains the tens of millions annually that go to companies that manufacture cheap beer, that make greasy food like Hungry Jacks and KFC, that finance the inexplicable careers of scrubs like Linkin Park and Good Charlotte, that keep thousands lined up to watch inferior wrestling and boxing several layers below large purse or WWE stuff. We're simple beings that don't need much to consider ourselves entertained, some years ago Sly worked this simple formula out and has a 4 decade strong career because of it. At one point in Rambo 4 someone asks Sly "How did you end up here", his reply: "It's complicated". And how. This edition of "Sly kills people who speak English funny" takes place in Thailand and Burma. Rambo has given up the "life" to become a snake catcher, he is grizzled, long haired, (still buff), maintains a low profile and is at one with the locals. Until some do-gooders roll in to change things after much resistance Rambo inevitably agrees to ferry them – for no fee – upriver to Burma, where the peaceful locals are being terrorised and slaughtered by corrupt soldiers. After a bit of preaching and presumptions made by the church group, lead by a couple named Michael and Sarah, Rambo gets them all to the drop-off – not without first having to kill a few pirates along the journey – much to the chagrin and judgment of the group he just saved. Job done right? Course not about 10 minutes later the group find themselves in the middle of a massacre and they are taken prisoner by the dastardly soldiers. I must point out here that we are shown numerous times just how evil and disgusting these troops are, lest we think Rambo is gunning down random guys for no reason, they mistreat children, women, prisoners, locals and each other. In a not so subtle way Sly is saying "Look I more or less HAVE to butcher these people in various bloody and gruesome ways, look at what they keep doing!" But this time Rambo will not be alone, the church has somehow financed a bunch of mercenaries into the fray, they are the usual blend of quiet killers, bragadocious dicks and seasoned pros. Rambo keeps mum for a while – but when the time is right he clearly illustrates his alpha-dog status and shows everyone just who is leading this show. Now we are told that it is about 100 odd soldiers vs 8 guys but one of them is pushing 60, talks with a lisp and has a bow and arrow. Advantage good guys?? And it's basically bang bang stab from here for 40 minutes. Harking back to my point about the violence, and remembering the fact that Rambo 4 follows First Blood, Rambo 2 and Rambo 3, this film is perhaps more violent than any of its predecessors. Victims are decapitated, blown in half, pureed and exploded into a fine bloody mist. The entire gig is CGI assisted, so while it is indeed more realistic I can't see just how much more disgusted anyone can be than in the former films in the series. I'm not here to stick of for the violence against kids and women though, but if the reports are to believed unfortunately that might be the realest part of the film, so instead of picketing films like Rambo 4 that hardly glorify such actions, maybe looking more closely at the alleged perpetrators might be more productive? Above all we must keep in mind this is a Rambo action film, so we know a peaceful Rambo will be lured from a self imposed retirement to kill hundreds of highly trained soldiers all by himself in various violent ways. To that end Rambo (4) succeeds, the mega shootout that ends the film has an epic body count – and I'm sure if someone ever bothered to count it would easily top the 100 soldiers purported to be the total enemy force – and Rambo is suitably low key and reluctant until the switch is pulled. As an informative tale of human drama you might be better served sticking with Hotel Rwanda, but as an entertaining shoot 'em up you can't go past Sly, even nearly 30 years on from his first action flick. Final Rating – 7 / 10. Sly once again pushes all the right buttons. Don't expect to be blown away though, (that only happens to the naughty guys in the film).
9.0~The perfect Rambo movie! Goldwaterproductions Sign in Permalink This is like what would happen if you took the first 2 movies and mixed them in a blender. You get the dark and realistic tone of First Blood and you get the balls to the wall action of Rambo: First Blood Part 2. Ya Stallone is 62 years old in this movie, but who cares? He's still got the chops to be a complete monster on screen. And who could forget that amazing action scene at the end with him on the back of that jeep mowing down everyone with a .50 caliber machine gun? One of the best action scenes in a movie. And the movie ends on just the perfect note. If there is something Stallone knows how to do right is make up his previous films and end them right. Rocky 5 ended the Rocky series on a dissatisfying note and Rocky Balboa ended it the right way. Same with Rambo. Rambo 3 ended Rambo on a dissatisfying note and Rambo ended it the right way. This is why I love Stallone. He cares about his work. Overall, if you have not seen this movie, go see it. Is it the best Rambo movie? No, that's still First Blood. Is it the best action Rambo movie? Yes! If not his best action movie ever made! Final Rating: 9/10
5.0~I Killing Machine You Jane loganx-2 Sign in Permalink I will grant this two and half stars for Ultraviolence and a unique way of showing peoples limbs exploding from their bodies, but not much else. John Rambo is the mono syllabic killing machine who just can't walk away from the war torn jungle, after ...(read more)he grudgingly agrees to take some Christian missionaries up to Burma, surprise surprise the Burmese government capture them. Then it's up to Rambo and a team of mercenaries to go in and save them...which they do, the end. I would like to say there was a kink in the plan, or escalating threats, but really Rambo and company go in and get the hostages(while the guards are distracted getting drunk and rapping captive women, or in the case of the General, young boys). Then there's one more big fight and that's all she wrote and while the blood does come in buckets, and the violence pretty extreme even by modern standards, it's all packed together right at the end. While Rambo may now be an unstoppable and efficient killing machine, he's not a very entertaining one to watch. The bad guys don't really get back the upper hand, and the fight gets pretty one sided and loses it's drama and flair. I was fine with watching two hours of shoot em up action, its watching 45 minutes of Stallone give himself face time and a half hour compressed executions that get's truly tiresome.
10.0~Sylvester Stallone's best movie. Pingo-2 Sign in Permalink After watching the first trailer I got high hopes for this film. Finally, it seemed, that Sly made a *real* RAMBO-film. And he did! This is by far the best Sylvester Stallone movie I have ever seen. It is brutal, it is powerful, it had depth. And very much so. If you are not familiar with Burma and the situation there, you should spend a few minutes reading up on the subject. The fact that they try to educate you with a few seconds of real (and painful) news footage (some as recent as fall 2007) is good, but not enough. With some insight in the Burmese situation, you will enjoy this film much more. It is vital to stand alert, watch every minor detail, closely see the actions Rambo is taking here - and everybody else for that matter. When the bullets start flying (and they do fly so very often in this flick), it's tough to keep up, but necessary still. Where movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and HOSTEL tries to justify their violence with plot, RAMBO's violence IS the plot. Nowhere have we seen such an honest film with such a tough Central Question: is it ever justified to kill someone? The movie is short, it has four characters we learn the names of and only a few minor characters we care about. It is minimalistic in every sense - but it is so very well done that we are watching a pure masterpiece here. This is definitely not a film for everyone. But everyone should watch it. It is an important film, and it brings up an important subject. It is pure theater, pure excitement. When I go to a movie I want to FEEL something. And this film makes you feel so much. Pure excellence. 10/10
10.0~The best movie of 2008. Yes, better than The Dark Knight Arthur-Fawell Sign in Permalink I know what your thinking, you think that I am a total idiot. Your asking yourself how I could possibly like this better than the Dark Knight. Well I couln't tell you why, this movie is just great. Of all the movies in the series this is my favorite. It is way better than Rambo: The First Blood Part II and Rambo III, and just a little better than First Blood. While in almost every way First Blood is better, better acting, better directing, better story, etc. I think what really made me locve this one was the realism, sure the story is simple Rambo takes a group of missionaries into Burma, they get captured, so he goes in with a team of mercenaries in after them. It is very simple, and there are so many imperfections that its just great. The best scene is the final battle, it is just spectacular, in a gritty way, that involves a lot of carnaage (seriously probably 170 people are killed). Just be warned squeamish people, this movie is very graphic, not like Planet Terror or Braindead but still gory as hell. People get like ripped up by gunfire, and people explode ino nasty red stains on the ground, its just insane. All and all its my favorite Rambo film, and I don't even know why. I give it a 10 out of 10. Also I tink a rating of 7.3 is just far underrated, I realize not everyone will like it but 8.5 at least, I think.
4.0~The most violent film I've ever seen... way too over the top! Kanadiz Sign in Permalink When 'Rocky Balboa' came out 2 years ago, my first reaction was, "Oh man, that's just what we need another Rocky picture!" But it was actually the best 'Rocky' picture since the original, the best of the sequels. I had the exact opposite reaction about 'Rambo' the 4th installment in the Rambo franchise and I have to say that this is by far the most violent film I have ever seen and this goes without saying , it makes 'First Blood' look like something out of Nickelodeon. It basically starts out with real footage of attacks in Burma and then shows us the sixty year old Rambo in the heart of the jungle, fishing with a bow and arrow. Later in the film he is approached by a group of volunteers with Burnett as the group leader who wishes to bring medical attention, prayer books, and support to the Karen tribe's people in Burma. But of course Rambo is aware of the horror in Burma and tries to warn them but doesn't succeed. Obviously the group encounters some major problems in Burma and a team is sent in to rescue the group with you guessed it, Rambo as the 'boat man', since he knows the jungle like the back of his hand. It doesn't take too long for the team to realize that their boat man is actually a "machine" built for war. I saw this film on the big screen with some friends of mine and I couldn't stop laughing at the action because it was just so over the top and so cheesy, even my friends were laughing but to my surprise, they loved it. There is even a scene where Rambo literally rips out a man's throat with his bare hands and another where Rambo turns a huge machine gun on one person only and tears him to bits. Now that is as over the top as action can get. It's a pity that Stallone chose to direct the film in this direction because this film could have been really good, it had some really nice shots in the beginning when he's finishing in the heart if the jungle and there was a good scene when he kills for the first time in the film on the boat to save the group. But then it's all just down hill from there and Stallone doesn't really bring anything new to the screen about Rambo. There is even a dream sequence where Rambo is tortured by his past and is way too long for a dream sequence. I loved 'First Blood' from 1982 but that was it, it think hard core Rambo fans will love this film and probably even fans of the ridiculous 'Saw' franchise for it's enormous amount of blood and gore. But I found it to be more cheesy and extremely over the top than entertaining.
10.0~Arguably the best Rambo film to date. SentenzaAliasAngelEyes Sign in Permalink Let me just start off by saying that the critics who are so negative about this film are blatantly dishonest when it comes to "Rambo." The fourth installment in this legendary saga is arguably the best of the bunch. Sylvester Stallone tells this story in the most honest and realistic way possible. The violence is brutal yes, but necessary to show the horrors of war down to the last little detail. I absolutely love the fact that Sly shed some light on the Burma crisis. A lot of people in the world, including many American's, wanna turn a blind eye to what's going on to innocent people, mainly women and children. To me that's just not right. Sly shows us what's happening every single day outside the free world. Yes, war is bad, but in this day and age, it's obviously necessary to stop the world's evil. I love the message of this film. When the film opens with real life footage of Burma, I got a little emotional, especially to what follows next. This is the most realistic Rambo film in the SAGA from a violence stand point. Also, the character of John Rambo finally appears to be human. At times during the film, you actually think there's a chance he may get killed. There's even a point where one of the mercenaries saves his life. I absolutely loved this realistic approach Sly took here. I want to comment on Sly's direction. This is in my opinion, Sly's best direction work to date. He must've took a page out of Sam Peckinpah's book and studied it because at times, it felt like I was watching a Peckinpah film. I love the directing style/approach Sly took here . The cinematography was absolutely beautiful. Brian Tyler's score fit the film perfectly. At times the music was beautifully touching and awakened an emotional chord that was necessary. Other times, the music was extremely thrilling and heart-pounding during these intense battle sequences. I love how the iconic Jerry Goldsmith Rambo Theme was intact. It gave the film that Rambo feel. Brian Tyler succeeded wonderfully here. Last but not least, I honestly think this is the best action film to come a long in years. I commend you Sly for yet again giving us a film we can love, cherish, and talk about for years. Hopefully this film does a lot more than just entertain us, hopefully it saves many people's lives. Thank you Sly!
3.0~Why I was disappointed with this film acehit Sign in Permalink OK I see a lot of positive reviews here, and I had huge expectations for this movie before I went to see it but I have to say I wasn't pleased with the end result. I have always been a huge Rambo fan, so I was looking forward to this but I shall explain why I wasn't happy. The movie was too short, and there wasn't enough screen time for character development for neither the main characters or anyone else for that matter. I couldn't help thinking that this film lacked the magic of the previous three films. One thing I noticed half way through the movie was the absence of Rambo's trademark knife. This for me was a major disappointment, it wasn't just a knife, it was a symbol more than anything which evolved as the Rambo films progressed. I was glad to see the return of the bow and headband, but the knife should have been there. Apart from that the whole film was just mindless brutality, I really didn't have a problem with the violence, but it was the justification I had trouble coming to terms with. Rambo was immensely barbaric in this movie and most of the killing was unnecessary. The story for me wasn't strong enough to hold the film. Something else I was displeased with is that there is no reference to col. Trautman, who was integral to all the Rambo films. His death should have been mentioned somewhere in the film or some sort of reference, but there was nothing. What made the action in the previous Rambo films so unique was the clever traps set in the jungles, none of which we saw in this latest installment of the franchise, I will say it again it was just mindless explosions repeating over and over. I was glad to see the reprise of Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful music, but it was the same theme playing over and over again. We never heard the triumphant themes which we are so familiar with, and the score just didn't have enough depth. lastly I have a problem with the title, it was initially going to be called John Rambo, than they changed their minds and called it just Rambo. Why not just call it Rambo 4, since that's what it is. Sly made the same mistake with the last Rocky film and now he is done it again here I really can't see the sense in it. Overall I just see this as nothing but a pointless action film!
1.0~Dreadful haterofcrap Sign in Permalink All those "Rambo" films sucked. All were boring and plot less. Also, Sylvester Stallone can't act at all, and he always plays the same character in all his movies. Always. This film had all the flaws of the previous (and equally bad) Rambo films. I would say that it was even worse than the original Rambo flicks, that all were dreadful. This movie sucks. There is nothing good about it. Don't waste your time seeing it. It was so boring, that I walked out of the theater after the first 15 minutes.
8.0~Incredibly violent. Rambo is definitely back with a vengeance! TOMASBBloodhound Sign in Permalink This critic scoffed at earlier posts and reviews claiming that the new Rambo film made Saving Private Ryan look like a kids show. But after viewing it, I cannot name any film I've ever seen with more graphic violence. The carnage claims just about everyone, too. Good people and bad people alike are blown to bits with heavy machine guns, mortars, land mines, you name it. Even old ordinance from WWII is used at one point. When it all ends after a fairly brief running time, you feel like you've just seen Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, Apocalypto, and We Were Soldiers all at the same time. The action is plentiful and well-staged, but the sheer brutality directed at the innocent may have been just a tad too much. Sylvester Stallone, now into his sixties, is back as the title character. He now apparently makes his living as a snake catcher in Thailand. All of the violence and death he has either caused or witnessed has really jaded him, and he apparently has no plans to ever return home to America. One day a group of Christian missionaries show up and ask him to take them up river to Burma in his boat. Rambo tries to discourage their journey into such a dangerous place, but these people will obviously go in one way or another. It can be hard to talk religious fanatics out of things once they make a commitment. There is a pretty woman in the group of missionaries, and Rambo takes a liking to her. Eventually, he decides to take them up river. Maybe if only to protect this woman. Hard to say why he decides to do it. Anyway, Rambo offs an entire boat of pirates who try to take them prisoner. This action stirs the ire of the lead missionary who informs Rambo his killings will have to be reported. Also, the group will travel back by land instead of by boat. The missionaries are taken captive by the Burmese army after a short time in a village full of hapless locals who are then completely slaughtered in a particularly disturbing scene. It then is up to Rambo and a small team of mercenaries (I guess hired by the church?) to go rescue the remaining missionaries from a heavily guarded camp. The rest of the film is an incredible bloodbath. After a fairly successful rescue, the film ends somewhat abruptly with a gun battle next to a river. The finale kind of reminded me of Michael Caine in The Island machine gunning about 50 pirates on the deck of a ship. Multiply that scene by about 1000 and you pretty much have the ending of this film. Even though the violence was jarring, there was something I noticed inside the theater that also shook me. There was a Vietnamese family that showed up kind of late and sat in the same row I did. When everyone left, I noticed that two of them had to be younger than 10 years old. I cannot imagine letting children see something like this film. The cruelty and gore might be too much for someone that young. Stallone apparently juggled many different story ideas for this film. At one point he planned to have Rambo return home to Arizona and battle drug gangs sneaking across the Mexican border. Finally, he called up someone at the UN and basically asked what was the most under-reported humanitarian crisis in the world. The guy he talked to suggested the trouble in Burma. If it's half as bad as this film suggests then I pray for these people. But a humanitarian trip might not be such a good idea. 8 of 10 stars. The Hound.
10.0~Excellent movie indeed jinpilar Sign in Permalink That's an excellent movie, specially if you-r under 30. Let's keep one thing clear: The main target of this movie is young people, so, Wwo is older may not enjoy it so much. I liked a lot, and my cousin (who is 43) loved it, so after all, Sly did a great picture for all audience. A tip: Don't expect comedy, light action and softened deaths: That's a hard movie, with tuff scenes, very well filmed. Sly is at his physical peak. His action is just perfect for the character. I'll go again, and the DVD will be bought as soon as it's launched.
10.0~Rambo 0wnz n00bz fftl_punk_33 Sign in Permalink Ohh man. Stallone really popped his collar on this one. I didn't think that I would be ACTUALLY walking into the grasp of John Rambo. This movie puts right up front for the action. The weapons and effects are hit right on the head. Barrett .50 cal rifles can turn you into swiss cheese. Grenades shred you like a piece of paper. I love how the movie gets going, it starts with a genocide scene, then jumps to a news report about Burma, then to John. It's a little rough, but it's well executed. Yes, the pun was intended. I also like the fact that Stallone directed this film. He was really gutsy with the content of this movie, but it's the truth, and it's happening before our eyes. He's showing it to us through cinema. This movie sets the bar for the next action movie, and the next, and the next.
8.0~Stallone Puts a Problem Center Stage in This Powerful Film spasek Sign in Permalink Not since the original First Blood has a Rambo movie been so moving and important. The first film dealt with how veterans were treated when they returned home. The second two films were simply for fun and it often glorified violence. I was a pre-teen when those films came out, and I remember kids who thought that it would be so "cool" to be Rambo...moving around and mowing people down. Sylvester Stallone decides to take the world's longest civil war and put it center stage in this riveting film. The action is no longer glorified. Instead, it brings us the true horrors of war, and Stallone wasn't afraid to make the viewer cringe and wince with every bullet fired that met flesh or severed body parts from the victims. In many ways, "Rambo" is the most important film of the series, and it shouldn't be overlooked, nor should it be looked at as a film that glorifies violence simply because of the gore. Instead, it's very realistic. And in that way, it is a very anti-violent film. Stallone shoves the violence and atrocities in our faces and down our throats. Any true human being should walk away trembling just a bit, and imagine what it must be like for the people of Burma to live each day in fear; fear of the military showing up to completely annihilate everyone in the village; to treat them as less than human; to be forced to run across creeks and waterways as a soldier laughingly tosses mines in random places,. In many ways, this isn't fictional. It's a depiction of what civilians of Burma have had to go through every, single day. The real tragedy is that nobody gave it a thought. The world didn't care enough to get involved as mass genocide was being carried out. No, this isn't your typical "Rambo" film. Not in the least, and it should be viewed with respect, awe, and more than a little sadness. And yes, it should make you cringe from head-to-toe at the realities of war and atrocities perpetrated upon the innocent and defenseless. Hats off to Stallone for arguably giving us the most important Rambo film of the series.
10.0~Why the hell is this not in the Top 250? dolce_knights43 Sign in Permalink I was shocked when I opened the top 250 list. There I saw "Dark Knight" at number three.But what did that movie have? Lousy action scenes? Christian Bale growling? It's nothing more than a passable action movie hyped up by Heath Ledgers passing.But Rambo, IT DESERVES TO BE ON THAT SLOT!!!! Here you have a resurfaced 60-year old action hero, extreme-gore, mutilation, dismemberment, disembowelment, mass child killing, rape, firepower, explosions, and much more brutal violence that culminates into one of the most violent endings for an action movie. Rambo puts all the other top 250 movies to shame. In the movie,Rambo tries to live a solitary life(again) but the guy just cam't. violence follows him where ever he goes. But instead of backing down, Ranbo confronts it with heavy artillery- with gory results. this film pulls no punches in terms of violence and I think that led me to say that it belongs to the best of the best.Umlike "Killing Fields"or "Platoon", Stallone shocks us with images from hell and he resolves them with brutal efficiency.be reminded however that this is not "Saving private Ryan"(despite comparisons to the camera work and violence).THIS HAS MORE VIOLENCE THAN SAVING PRIVATE RYAN AND HAS MORE HEART. Overall,this is one instant classic. It's a "Rambo" movie+splatter film+shockumentary. Just don't give me part 5. He's too old for that.
10.0~the best action film of the past 10 years, Rambo is back, and better than ever daworldismine Sign in Permalink i loved 'first blood' and it's sequel 'Rambo:first blood part II', but i hated 'Rambo III', that piece of crap movie, nearly ruined Rambo, but now he's back and my expectations wasn't only exceeded, but full on blown up, this is the most violent action movie ever made period, I've never seen so much gore in well anything. Stallone also is huge in this, looks like a hulk, and the action scenes he handles with ease, and boy are there some action scenes, this movie is chock full of brutal, brutal action. but the best thing i liked about Rambo 4 is that, Rambo is more like he was in the first 2 movies, and he has got his mean edge back. this apart from rocky is probably the best movie Stallone has ever made. welcome back Rambo we have missed you
7.0~The best attempt at a responsible and legendary Rambo so far Chris_Docker Sign in Permalink We have recently had TV footage of Burmese monks being butchered. The new Rambo film, where Sylvester Stallone assumes control of a band of mercenaries to rescue a group of Christian missionaries there, has been banned in Burma and criticised by some human rights workers. An Australian democracy group accuses it of 'muddying the water' of peaceful resistance. True, Aung San Suu Kyi's, the deposed democratic opponent to the brutal military regime, has advocated peaceful resistance. But she is no Ghandi fighting a (relatively) civilised colonial power. For sixty years, all protest, peaceful and otherwise, has been ruthlessly crushed. It is not surprising that the new film has become a bootleg hit in Burma. Stallone plays the mythical hero warrior. No superpowers, just a devastatingly efficient and ruthless fighter. Says Stallone, "I called the United Nations. I asked them 'What is the most under-reported, most graphic and devastating abuse of human rights on the planet?' And they said, 'Burma." Whether it is a help or a hindrance, let the viewer (and maybe history) be the judge. Whether Stallone should have bothered making yet another Rambo movie, let the audience alone decide. I am not a big fan of this type of movie, but for me it did what it said on the tin. The Rambo character was well-crafted, a believable fighting machine, and the battles were unstintingly realistic and violent. If we have movies like this (and there will perhaps always be a demand), then is it better to glorify police vs gang brutality, vigilante-ism, controversial wars, or fights against supremely corrupt and real-life regimes? Rambo uses Burmese/Thai actors and crew, including real refugee rebels, amputees, land mine victims and former Burmese soldiers. The filming is done in and around Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, in a setting that closely mimics the area on both sides of Thai/Burmese border. Surprisingly, many of the refugees already knew of Rambo as a hero character before casting began. When half a century of peaceful protest fails (after the collapse of British colonialism at the end of WWII), people need heroes to give them hope and a reason to carry on, even if the hope never materialises. Rambo works the river, catching and selling deadly snakes to a hospital. A Christian missionary group wants to hire his boat to get into Burma, hand out medicines and deliver religious tracts. The Vietnam veteran is reluctantly convinced. When they don't return, a second pastor hires a group of mercenaries to retrieve them and again presses Rambo's boat into service. But this time Rambo insists on tagging along. The gun-toting crew are unfamiliar with the terrain and the army they are up against. Their lack of any higher purpose beyond getting paid saps their cohesion. Rambo proves his prowess not only in combat but morally and as a leader. It is not heavy intellectual stuff. I did not find it ethically abhorrent. One doesn't go to see Rambo and not expect violence. I was worried that it would maybe promote some pie-in-the-sky Christianity-saves agenda, but it was silent on the missionaries' position except in using them as a plot device. Their actions ultimately (and pointedly) resulted in great loss of life, but on the other hand those of that faith might believe it is worth it. The film is even ambivalent about the violence of its protagonists. It is a violent film, but Rambo's belief is that nothing anyone can do, peaceful or non-peaceful, will change anything. Its main contributions are threefold. It is perhaps the best film of the Rambo icon. It is reasonably good entertainment on its own level. But most of all, it can help to raise awareness of the systemic rape and torture by the Burmese army of its own people. And if the Burmese gain hope from it, it could be the icing on the cake or the safety off the gun.
10.0~oh...my...god blaube94 Sign in Permalink This movie reached and EASILY passed my expectations. At first i was worried Stallone would ruin the series by making a new Rambo but this by far is the best Rambo yet. Even though it is amazing i don't recommend letting your 9 year old see this unless you want him growing up to be some blood crazed maniac. That is mainly because this is without a doubt the second bloodiest movie i have ever seen (behind Ninja Assassin). But because of that it just makes it even more bad ass. So if you want to watch an incredible action movie masterpiece i highly recommend Rambo. (P.S) whoever thought of the final battle scene with that 50 caliber machine gun cutting people in half deserves a raise.
7.0~The final Rambo wrapped up in 91 Mins? damaslany Sign in Permalink I got to admit, when I watched the first trailer a while ago I had mixed feelings about the movie. The original "First Blood" had a great storyline and you rooted from Rambo.We move 20+ years to now and we see a John Rambo in the middle of nowhere hunting snakes? I understand they were trying to show light on a terrible situation in Burma, how ever I was a hard stretch for me to go along with it. The story line and acting are a 5 out of 10 at best. However, the graphic and just insane acting scenes make up for that. As I followed the storyline and about halfway into the movie, it just seem ed a little to easy for Rambo to take out 100's of bad buys with one large gun plowing away into the fields. I mean within 20 minutes the whole movie wrapped up and I was left with the feeling of..... "wait thats it" If you are going to wrap up a 4 movie series within 91 minutes it just didn't add up to me. I expected a little better acting and a longer story. 7 out of 10 @ best.
7.0~old hero,old habits,new style trojans7 Sign in Permalink this is one hell of a movie an action movie for the gore-porn set. this leaves you floored, what a can i say that has not already been said yes this is very very extreame.100% action from go to blood soaked end. sly has made the best rambo he could, and I'm glad he directed. people sometime forget that sly is quit a got film maker.he just doesn't make them for critiques. the hash location, heat that you could neally feel made an impression on me as much as the action. solid action from start to finish just a shame we did get a little more depth in the story department, flesh out a few characters or something. so if you want a taste or whats to come is war films this is the benchmark that has been set. be warned war is hell and bullets kill.
10.0~Return of the King: A RAMBO Review MichaelMercy Sign in Permalink I had the chance to see Rambo last night and it was a Hell of a lot of fun; "Hell" being the operative world. This movie is NOT for the faint at heart. It's a great "guy's action flick" that perfectly captures the 80's action movie feel, but be warned, it's gorier than a Freddy/Jason/Leatherface movie. What I found interesting on a psychological level was that before the movie started, a lot of people in the audience were excited about how gory it was going to be (the marketing campaign depicted people getting beheaded by Rambo's knife and liquefied by a tank-buster gatling gun) . The first few shots of the movie, however, show actual footage of the horrors going on in Burma right now. It was some seriously revolting stuff; rotting corpses, smashed in skulls, and butchered children. A lot of people turned away in disgust, myself included. I couldn't help but remember Russell Crowe in Gladiator, after dispatching a few opponents in gory fashion, screaming into the previously rabid but now silent and horrified audience, "Are you not entertained?!" Interesting statement by Stallone regarding the audience's blood-lust. I'd say he proved his point. I'm shocked that these kinds of atrocities are still going on in the world today, and I applaud Stallone for using this film as a vehicle to shed some light on the situation and try to do some good, rather than just go for another quick money grab. It's a perfect example of a movie being entertainment, but also teaching you something about how lucky you are to have everything you have and not have to live the Hell on Earth that the people of Burma have to. Rambo himself was awesome. A living legend. It's always great to see the heroes of my youth return for one last hurrah, and I personally don't care how old he is. He still had the intensity, he was in great shape and moved around like a guy half his age (the magic of editing, I know, but perception is reality in movies!) His performance was fantastic and that's all that matters. Same goes for Arnold in T3 a few years ago, same goes for Bruce Willis in last year's Die Hard movie, and the same goes for Indiana Jones in his upcoming movie this summer. The naysayers will moan and complain about these guys being "too old," but honestly, who are any of us decide if a person can no longer do something? If they still have the desire, they can still do it. End of story. When you see them on screen, you're transported back to your childhood and you can't help but cheer on these iconic figures you grew up on. There were several points in Rambo where the audience erupted into applause, which in my experience is a very rare thing. It's not too often that a movie can get you so emotionally involved that you clap or cheer, but Rambo had a lot of people doing just that. It's a lost art, mainly because the guys who knew how to do it apparently got "too old." Personally, I'm glad Stallone told the naysayers to shove it and went ahead with making Rocky Balboa and Rambo. They're two of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I wish some more of these guys would come out of retirement and remind the new generation how it's done!
8.0~Rambo....Yes lindsaycmckenna Sign in Permalink This one is an absolute surprise. First blood was by far one of the best action movies of it's time if not ever but the next two, big big yellow lemons so i went into watching this movie with very dull hopes. The R18+ title had me a little intrigued though, but my skepticism was blown out of the water. Now Im not saying that all of the actors are excellent one in particular stands out, he hired gun with the British accent grated on me a bit. But the story line is strong and the acting is adequate. Rambo is old and fat but still manages to do what he does best and thats killen stuff. Holly crap this movie has some killen and if your an action junkie this one is for you. Definitely not for your little sister and your grandmother to watch one afternoon. But it is'nt as confronting as in movies like saving private ryan. If your a fan of eighties action movies or just hardcore action with big guns and not to many recovery moments this one is for you. Live on John J
1.0~Bad Bad Bad BAD Turboz77@hotmail.com Sign in Permalink I am Christ believing man. I found this film offensive because of all the expletives. Producers in Hollywood must feel that every other word needs to start and end with the letter F , than in my mind they really don't deserve my hard earned money. There was probably 100 f words, enough to really dislike the movie, and anyone who says to themselves half way through the flick """ this sucks "" has more reason than what I stated above. The acting was flaky, Rambo was superman, and hero of course. It was just a plain no go joe movie to me. Not sorry neither, just the way I feel. If you are a christain and you thought this would be a "safe" movie to watch!! THINK AGAIN. this is a bad movie something to never let your kids see or hear.
10.0~Better than Indiana Jones regular8 Sign in Permalink This movie has grit, tension, and passion. It's much better than the roly-poly "Rocky" we were given not long ago. I love how nothing is sanitized regarding the effects of heavy gunfire on the human body. I love how the story is based around the actual situation in Burma, and it is a public service to expose that in America, to audiences that may want to refocus their aim away from Iraq for a moment and onto areas like Burma that need more attention from the West. The photography, sound, editing, and direction are all excellent. Way, way superior to the lame "Indiana Jones" and the plastic skull whatever. Thanks, Stallone, it's great. Thanks.
9.0~They don't make 'em like this anymore! dead_sky_dawning Sign in Permalink Hell yeah!! This is probably the single best action movie of the 21st century! Believe you me! A straightforward plot, some awesome music, and off we go! The absolutely killer action scenes (complete with Stallone's trademark "Man, I'm about to go berzerk!" -grin), and the sheer intensity of the whole thing, makes you want to jump off your seat, paint your face with 'em jungle/commando war paints and head off to some God-forsaken war zone to squash evil off the face of the planet. They haven't dared to make an action movie so intense, and downright...ACTION, for the past 10 years! You see...nowadays, every action flick has a minimum of 45 minutes of some "let's get every mother and grandma in the country to watch this" -moral justification (not that there's anything wrong with that, it just doesn't fit into a quality action movie. If I want to hear about such things, I'll watch the Pope's speech, not Rambo), some goofy $ 2 love drama, political correctness etc...but THIS crushes all that straight to hell, like a good action movie should. You can take the guy away from a war, but you can't take war away from the guy! The best Rambo movie of the lot, so go see it. Now! Well, go on then!
5.0~Rambo (2008) SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain Sign in Permalink I'm still annoyed at how the Rambo franchise devolved into cheesy messages, egocentric writing, and over-the-top acting. However, as an action movie, this isn't too bad. It's well shot and the quality is there. It also avoids cheesy action and has hardcore realistic violence. In fact it's so hardcore it does get a bit ridiculous. Guns ripping off limbs, heads exploding, children being thrown into fires. Stallone is obviously trying to inform us about the goings on in Burma, but rather than give us an education, he instead kills people. The films message of violence is also not particularly well handled. I get that sometimes violence IS the answer, but when they start showing everyone killing without a care in the world it descends into anarchy. The most enjoyable of the sequels, even if just to satisfy a bit of blood lust. Thank god the dialogue is kept to a minimum.
10.0~Return of the action movie as we know it mknez Sign in Permalink First of all, let me start by saying John Rambo is a masterpiece. They don't make them like this anymore. It is a return of the classic action movie of the 80's and 90's but with a touch of modern directing. Some will say it is gory, some will says it has no plot. But let's be honest, nobody wants a dramatic twist or a deeper meaning when they go to see Rambo! And even if you want to, you can still find it in traces. John Rambo is a killing machine but he is also a guy with strong moral values so if you are really looking for a message it is there to be seen. Other than that it is a full blooded action movie that will strap you to your seat for whole 95 minutes!
10.0~great remake blevy-53826 Sign in Permalink One of the best remakes of a movie...ever. The first one was a classic, the second one was iconic of the 80's and after that it rapidly went down hill.....this one however. Absolutely fantastic.
9.0~Great film for those that like ultra violence cas560 Sign in Permalink First, to all the naysayers out there that are bashing this movie, why did you go to watch it? You know it is filled with violence and gore. That IS its purpose. It is what it is. It is not some Shakespearean drama, it wont cause you to reflect on the meaning of life. It wont cause you to have deep meaningful discussions over lukewarm coffee at your film of the month club. There is NO message in the movie (other than a 50 cal machine gun can do some serious damage). Pure and simple, it is a movie for those that enjoy violence! And if you like Ichi the Killer, Hostel, Gladiator etc.. you will like this movie. If you like heads exploding and limbs being cut off by machetes, you will like this movie. Take it for what it is worth-don't try to make it something it is not. This is the first action movie I have truly enjoyed in a very long time.
6.0~"When you're pushed, killing's as easy as breathing." utgard14 Sign in Permalink Rambo leads a group of mercenaries into Burma to rescue some Christian missionaries in this fourth movie in the Rambo series, released twenty years after the last one. Sylvester Stallone not only stars but also writes and directs this one. It doesn't feel like any of the previous Rambo movies. Gone are any remnants of the '80s. That being said, at least Rambo seems more in character than he did in Rambo III. This is a grittier movie than the others, with more violent and gruesome action scenes. The climactic battle is about as over the top as it gets. If you're not a big fan of movies where there's an excessive amount of loud gunfire, this is not the movie for you. The supporting cast in this one is fine. Pretty Julie Benz is probably the only one you're likely to really care about. Sadly there's no Colonel Trautman as Richard Crenna had died by the time this was made. Not sure how he would have fit into this story anyway but perhaps the end scene could have been reworked to include him. Anyway, it's a dark and violent movie but a good one. Not on the level of First Blood or as much fun as Part II but definitely better than Part III. Whether this is the last time we see Rambo remains to be seen but, if this is the final one, it's a fitting end to Rambo's story.
8.0~Some of the most graphic death scenes in recent history. stormruston Sign in Permalink Some of the most graphic death scenes in recent history...and some of them I am guessing are pretty realistic (never actually blew a guy apart with a 50 Cal. and never want to). This is action at its best and most grittiest. Stallone was in true form for this movie: stoic, defeatist and honorable in personality, unbeatable and spontaneous in action. The story is straight forward and perfect for a action movie...put em in...get em out. We have black and white teams and the rarely added dimension of gray in a action movie: the mercenary's. I loved this movie from start to finish.
7.0~I was scared at first. FallenSoliderXX Sign in Permalink When I saw the trailer at first I was like uh oh this movie is going to be kind of cheesy. I thought First Blood was a great movie and the other Rambo were kind of lame so I went to go watch this movie and let me tell you guys this movie kicks ass. Rambo is a movie about a group of Christian aid people who want to make a difference in Burma but they end up getting kidnapped and its up to Rambo and a group of mercenaries There is so much action going on in this movie which is awesome and its a great movie from all the other kind of cheesy action flicks this one will stand out for 08 so anyone that wants to see some blood, killing, and great one liners from John Rambo then this is the movie for you 7\10
10.0~Stallone's Back Wheatdro Sign in Permalink Hey, Movie Master T.J. here and I just watched the 4th Rambo. From a fan of the series point of view, it was bloody, violent, and full of pondering moments. This film actually is somewhat of a realistic film. It take's place in Burma, which is an off the map war zone that no one really knew about until Stallone called the U.N., wanting a location for Rambo to be in. The problems of Burma actually do exist and writer, director, producer, and main star Sly Stallone brings it to the big screen. In this entry to the 25 year old series, Rambo is isolated in Thailand, giving boat rides for money to people. He does this for a Christian group, when they become captured in Burma, and he must go in. This movie offered more development for Rambo, going off of Rambo II and III, without the cheesy 80's music. The film also gives Rambo less screen time than the previous films, and focuses on a real story. It also had a great color and sound overall, placing you right in the middle of the action. What I did not like was the unsteadiness of the camera in the dialogue heavy scenes and the camera acting as a firehouse in the action scenes. Maybe Sly took too much responsibility for one film; but overall, the film isn't that bad. Fans of the series should check it out and serious film enthusiasts should give it a once over. The reaction so far from fans and critics is mixed, but overall received better than 2 or 3. Out 4 stars, I give it 4 for historical accuracy, action, complex plot, and for a great ending for a series, although there have been rumors and talks of a Rambo V. I'm T.J. Goodlet, and this has been the film corner. When the DVD comes out, I'll be sure to give you a review of that as well.
8.0~Bloody and action packed beck-gui Sign in Permalink Impressive. It's already been said, Stallone is back and up to the legend, it's unnecessary to be one of his fans to enjoy this movie, it's an hard-boiled and heavily action packed movie with great visuals, musics and sfx (except for a few surprisingly bad ones). I never enjoyed the sequels of "first blood" but this one blows away the two previous "bad movies" and keep the only thing that was good with them : wild commando action. It's not as good as "first blood" but at last the main character is the same, a tormented and anti-social survivor of the Vietnam war haunted by horrible memories and hardly containing the beast of anger within his blood. The film is really violent, it's been a long time since I've seen such a bloody mess in a movie (I guess the closest examples are the first and last scenes from "saving private Ryan"), some will enjoy ... some others won't ... I LOVED EVERY SINGLE BIT OF IT ! Of course the movie is far more violent than the fist one and it's not as unique and clever, but it's a really great adventure which uses the "rambo cliché" to it's best. When you think of "Rambo" what comes first to your mind is a big strong guy roaring on a battlefield and firing at dozens of enemies with a machine-gun ... well, that's what you'll get with this movie (an better than in any movie of the same kind) but you'll also have a cleverly built yet quite simple scenario with good characters and a fantastic John Rambo greatly interpreted by Stallone, close to the great and tormented character he was at first. A must-see for every fan and a good action movie for the others.

9.0~Finally some good old real action is back and back with a death wish kumarmalay Sign in Permalink After seeing so many bad reviews by critics I thought what the heck, why everyone is so interested about dissecting a movie which is completely unpretentious and unapologetic about what it is all about. This is Rambo at best. There is little story, almost no gimmicks and a lots of gore and violence all delivered in the old style. If you are a fan old school action movies then festival season started very early. If you are not then why you came to the theater for a Rambo movie. And did I mention the villain, this is devil reincarnation and as there is little explanation or motive given it makes the villain even more loathsome. So when our John J kicks butt we cheer. This is pure poetic action and carnage at best. Even the carnage in saving private Ryan or all the Haloween, Friday 13th movies combined together doesn't come closed to what Rambo delivers. The only complain is they should have padded up the length a bit to add some more of that violence. My vote 9/10
7.0~Very Graphic! luktan Sign in Permalink There's no doubt if you're looking for a storyline and a plot that will keep you riveted to your seat and guessing what's going to happen next, this is not the movie for you! However if you want to see loads of action, mindless violence and loads of gore- this for you!!! This is without a doubt one of the more graphic war and action movies that I've seen. It portrays what I believe a war scene would be like in real life (Not having been in one, and hope never to be!). Forget hitting a landmine and being flung through the air as often happens in many movies- this looks life like as bodies disintegrate and are dismembered by the bullets, mines, knives and all sorts of other weapons. Overall, not a bad movie- Sylvester Stallone does what he does best. He acts without too many lines being spoken....
10.0~A great Last Chapter blackmamba99971 Sign in Permalink I really liked this last chapter to a great series. John J. Rambo, a merciless special forces green beret ex soldier who seems to get caught in the middle of conflicts which has nothing to do with him. Yet his results always leaves a mission completed and a mess of bodies left behind in his wake. This was a more gory version to his earlier works but never the less small wars expect casualties, and in Rambo's case, that is not too hard to achieve. A small Christian group goes into Burma to help those who do not have medicine or spiritual help to get them through the increasing violence which builds day by day. Thus Rambo takes the group to the small village yet against his warnings. Still when they disappear by an attack by the local militia, a mercenary group is sent in to find them, along with the help of Rambo who now has a mission to save one woman. The use of weapons in this film is top rate, using a large calibre gun which can rip through metal and cutting down the local militia like they were celery sticks. The effects were good, the music excellent, and the story was a great ending to his never ending haunting of Rambo's mind. Going home to see his father for the first time since his inception to Vietnam.
2.0~Mindless gore, stupid slaughter, empty all over... Mihnea_aka_Pitbull Sign in Permalink I hope this second comment of mine won't be deleted also - I posted a few months ago, in January 25, a critical one, however very decently phrased, and some fanatic admirer of Rambo reported it to the IMDb moderators, who erased it without even checking the content. In short, this tired and limp sequel is simply a useless insult towards the old "First Blood". "Rambo 1" had been a moral and honest anti-violence manifest, while this piece of trash is a hysteric apology to violence. The script is linear, sort of like: "let's go there, massacre a few hundreds of people, then come back" - well, he comes back FOR REAL, since in the end we see him pussyfooting on a road in the States, for no reason at all. WHERE is the big epiphany that sent him back home? Maybe in that inane piece of text that he delivers in close-up, on his way to the slaughterhouse, when he says some deeply meant philosophic gems like "World is bad cause people make it bad, and it's not nice to kill, better be cool, and summer ain't the same as winter." Point ticketh, Rambo spoketh. Sly, my boy, you bungled it big time... Sorry for you. It was cool as long as it stood, but now, better go rock the swing of your grandchildren, and read them "Puss'n Boots"! Got it?
10.0~Rambo Mambo Grissom66 Sign in Permalink Twenty years after the last film in the series, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has retreated to northern Thailand, where he's running a longboat on the Salween River. On the nearby Thai-Burma (Myanmar) border, the world's longest-running civil war, the Burmese-Karen conflict, rages into its 60th year. But Rambo, who lives a solitary, simple life in the mountains and jungles fishing and catching poisonous snakes to sell, has long given up fighting, even as medics, mercenaries, rebels and peace workers pass by on their way to the war-torn region. That all changes when a group of human rights missionaries search out the "American river guide" John Rambo. When Sarah (Julie Benz) and Michael Bennett (Paul Schulze) approach him, they explain that since last year's trek to the refugee camps, the Burmese military has laid landmines along the road, making it too dangerous for overland travel. They ask Rambo to guide them up the Salween and drop them off, so they can deliver medical supplies and food to the Karen tribe. After initially refusing to cross into Burma, Rambo takes them, dropping off Sarah, Michael and the aid workers... Less than two weeks later, pastor Arthur Marsh (Ken Howard) finds Rambo and tells him the aid workers did not return and the embassies have not helped locate them. He tells Rambo he's mortgaged his home and raised money from his congregation to hire mercenaries to get the missionaries, who are being held captive by the Burmese army. Although the United States military trained him to be a lethal super soldier in Vietnam, decades later Rambo's reluctance for violence and conflict are palpable, his scars faded, yet visible. However, the lone warrior knows what he must do... Rambo 10/10
8.0~Rambo 4... A brilliant comeback for Sly. bazthegreatone Sign in Permalink After 20 years, Sylvester Stallone's iconic action hero John Rambo is back and just as violent as ever. He's tries not to be, but that is who he is, a force of nature, a killing machine and as he was called in the 80's, the ultimate one man army. He has a little help in this movie in the form of a rag tag group of mercenaries but ultimately its Rambo who is the main instigator in wiping out the brutal Burmese soldiers who are holding American missionaries hostage. Do not expect a great storyline or great acting but loads of (quite brilliantly shot) mayhem as Rambo rescues the missionaries and destroys half of Burma. This is a brilliant comeback in the series for Stallone, just like he did with Rocky 6, and it did excellent box office numbers compared to 1988's Rambo III. Rumors say Rambo 5 is in the pipework for 2009 or 2010, and if the multi-talented Stallone has his way, it will be another worthy addition to the franchise.
7.0~If this is the last of the series, it's a good end. Mr-Fusion Sign in Permalink My favorite scene in RAMBO isn't until the very end of the movie, but it's when the titular character is seen walking back to the ol' homestead in Bowie, Arizona. It's clear right from the get that Stallone is taking this character (and the series) back to its roots (no more evident than the heavy use of Goldsmith's horns from FIRST BLOOD). I'll admit bias because I'm a big fan of that score, and Stallone's use thereof puts me in the right mood not one minute after the movie begins. It's just right for thematically bringing John Rambo full-circle. When I first saw this movie almost seven years ago, I was as put off by the violence as anybody. It's off-putting to say the least. But the carnage is so visceral and the bad guys so vile, that you're just dying to see Rambo quench the bloodthirst in the worst way. And the payoff is worth it. 7/10
9.0~Frickin' Sweet!!! leereed2009 Sign in Permalink This movie has it all and more. It has the action, the awesome explosions, followed by the flinging of body parts and blood. Rambo was super cool. The acting was spectacular. This movie although great, it doesn't beat the first one because the first is not only just as great, but it is classic. Sylvester Stallone proved that you are never too old to blow up people up and kick ass. It was realistic, brutal, and I want to watch it over and over again. The acting of Julie Benz was good and very sincere. Even the annoying, minor characters had their own bit of charisma, charm, and added wonderful things to the movie. We have to to have bad guys after all. It was an action packed adventure for everyone who has ever liked action movies, Rambo, or has common sense. Thanks Stallone!!!
10.0~A symphony of violence, pure awesome. severianb Sign in Permalink The whole theater was clapping at the end. It was so much sick fun. The machine gun killing The civilian killing The knife killing. His stony expression. The Giant explosions Truly inspiring.... It brought goosebumps. We loved it. I't's not a chick flick though. I really feel that this is one of the greatest movies of all time. I've never been to very many movies that make me feel like this to the core of my being. Killing is easy as breathing indeed. The sight of Rambo, coming down hard on these bad bad bad men is truly great. And the great thing is that the movie actually sets up the bad guys so you know they are truly evil. So you want Rambo to do what he does to them. A must see.
3.0~Unintentional Comedy off the charts lance24 Sign in Permalink Posing as an action/adventure sequel in the famous "Rambo" series, "Rambo" is much more a spoof of itself than a drama. Our story starts when John Rambo is living in abject filth and poverty, earning a living by going up-river in what looks like the same boat used in "The African Queen." He earns his living by capturing snakes and selling them to a local entrepreneur who does some form of snake show. As has been the case in other sequels in this franchise, Rambo has lost all faith in life; that is, until a comely do-gooder (Julie Benz of "Dexter") convinces him to take her do-good posse to war-ravaged Burma. They get captured and mercenaries are hired to determine if they're still alive and to get them out. Rambo joins the mercenaries. No need for spoilers here--anyone who's read this far knows the ending already. Replete with dialog that could sink the Titanic, the unintentional comedy never stops. Highlight of the the spoof is when the mercenaries synchronize watches. All have standard issue military watches. Not penniless John Rambo--he's suddenly sporting a Panerai Luminor!!! I started laughing so hard in the theater that I thought I would get thrown out. I am amazed at the positive reviews this film has received on this site. You can enjoy the film only if you properly manage expectations.
7.0~Rambo (2008) *** JoeKarlosi Sign in Permalink Living a lonely and quiet existence in Thailand after twenty years, John Rambo is asked by a small group of missionaries to take them by boat to war-torn Burma. Rambo tries to tell them that they can't change anything there, but reluctantly gives into their persuasions. Once the bleeding hearts arrive in savage Burma, they are captured and it's up to Rambo and a team of mercenaries to venture in and save them. After the original FIRST BLOOD (1982), this is the next best entry in the four-film series. What first stands out after so long is that the 60-year-old Sylvester Stallone (who also directed) was successful in making this work. His John Rambo appears strong if aged, and he is still the same action hero who first appeared on screen 26 years earlier. The plot here is simple, but that's not an issue because the film delivers. It is relentlessly bloody and gory, with body parts and devastation by the truckloads. We really can sense the primitive atrocities taking place in Burma, not only against strangers but even against their own people. I do not ordinarily recommend movies relying so much on sheer blood and guts (and much of the carnage here is rendered via obvious fake-looking CGI effects, I should add), but this action packed Rambo installment succeeds at what it sets out to do. Fortunately, the over-abundance of gore is balanced by Stallone's heart-felt personage of John Rambo. The ending of the film was the perfect way to finalize this series. *** out of ****
10.0~Good movie gind2005 Sign in Permalink Normally I prefer romantic road movie, but I found with John Rambo some things interesting about live and love. The movie still very violent but that's the goal of this movie.It present the bullet impacts on the body as the reality. It present how kind of commander exist inside the camps. And it present which mind have some peace workers inside deep forest and hostile territories. John Rambo still play the hostile man against all forms of trial from USA and he may realize somethings new inside his home place and he still has some interrogation about the new style life.I said I burn to kill but think to kill and want think another trip.That's a very nice movie.
4.0~eh...... what could have been tapswedar Sign in Permalink This Rambo just flat out stunk. Stallone must had a hard time remembering his lines the whole twenty. But that was not even my problem with the movie. My problem is that stallone forgot this is a rambo. Rambos have been about mindless action and absurd sequences since the second one. He tries to make a serious attempt at revival of the franchise but it falls flat on its face. The acting was just plan horrible. Stallone was good when he had to be but the supporting cast was just plain old bad. Plus everything in this movie is just way too simple. Its basically woman is nice to rambo, woman gets captured, rambo kills everything. The gore was the absurd thing about it. It was way too realistic for this type of movie. they violence should have been more like planet terror. This movie could have been much more if he would have just wrote the story about him vs. the taliban for betraying him after the third movie. No Stallone screaming sobbing scenes gets the automatic flunking grade. I think people who loved rambo 2 would be more happy seeing something like planet terror
1.0~Did you expect something good? afterww3 Sign in Permalink Where does one start?This movie is maybe the most horrible thing I've seen this year.The people who gave it 10 stars are probably shocked to read a negative review but hey!I too was shocked by the crapiness of this movie-wannabe and what really shocks me is that people actually enjoy it.I've seen the previous Rambos,they were really good,enjoyable,had a meaning and a plot.However the recipe for this sequel is really cheap:We take Rambo,we give him guns and other ammo,and we let him kill everybody and everything.Who needs a plot anymore?Just take advantage of the audience who obviously has problems and enjoys seeing sadistic scenes of absurd violence painted in lots and lots of blood.Oh yes,the blood!With so much blood (and I mean it,it's just too much!) who's going to notice the absence of a plot?Let's just distract the attention by using gore and extreme violence (whose level is higher than the Empire State Building)and maybe the audience won't notice that this movie well...sucks.Let's just decorate the scenes with limbs,heads on poles,guts...nevermind giving it a meaning!Stallone has lost my respect,I relied on him to make good quality movies.Instead I get this cheap crap aimed at people who probably torture pets in their spear-time.Some think it's "cool",well I think it sucks.And I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who thinks this way.
8.0~Stallone Is Definitely Back Pratik112 Sign in Permalink Having watched "First Blood (Rambo Part 1)", "Rambo (Rambo Part 2)" and then "Rambo Part 3" and having enjoyed watching Stallone in action, I was very keen to watch this. John Rambo,a Vietnam war veteran, lives a simple life in Thailand and makes a living by catching and selling dangerous snakes to the charmers. One day , a group of modern day missionaries, arrive and ask him to escort them to war torn Burma (now known as Mayanmar). Initiallly he refuses but after a lot lot of persuassion he agrees. Later he is informed that the group he took over has not returned and that he has to rake a group of mercenaries to the identical spot. Starring Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz, Mathew Marsden and Graham McTavish, this is an all out action movie, which is the only "Rambo" movie that has been directed by Sly Stallone himself. Not boring at all if you like to watch action movies - this is a must for all Sly Stallone fans. Many had said that Sylvester Stallone would not be able to make come back into movies. Well! I think he has proved them totally wrong as he has had two movies, including this one released this year. The first one being "Rocky Balboa." Conclusion: A good movie to watch if you like action and lots of it as well. However if you are scared of snakes or anything like that, then may be its not such a good idea to keep your eyes open at the beginning.
1.0~Worst movie in ages brunoj-2 Sign in Permalink I won't waste too many words on this piece of cr*p. Let me start by saying i loved the original Rambo movies in their respective context and time. Not this one. You know how some movies are SO bad that they actually become good again because of their silliness? Well, this one is so bad, that it is simply BAD! If Encyclopedia Britannica was to explain the phenomenon "awful movie", they'd probably paste a still from Rambo 4 in the article. Acting in this movie by most members of cast, not excluding Stallone himself, is so awful it's insulting to watch. Blowing up half the jungle with a explosion big enough to be nuclear and still managing to outrun the explosion is just... too much, even in a Rambo movie, to bear. In fact, the high mark given to this movie by other visitors REALLY makes me wonder what kind of world we live in. Avoid at all cost, unless you LOOOVED, for instance, "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", or being skullf***ed, because that is the feeling that you'll have after watching this movie.
9.0~An Entertaining Way to Pass Time silent_phantasm Sign in Permalink Let's make this simple: Plot: The plot definitely makes sense. It's not so intricate that it requires thought, but it's also not so dry that it was entirely a Hollywood cliché. Acting: All of the characters in the movie were well acted out, they made you feel as if you were there all along watching things as they unfolded. There was only one character that ruined the movie for me, but he wasn't significant enough to merit my criticism of the film. Direction: This is where I took off a star from the movie. Stallone could have helped direct the actors and the plot to one more level. Because there were so many directions all happening simultaneously, it would have been too difficult to develop everybody to the level that the movie would have required just with the complexity of everything. Furthermore, the main audience that this movie was intended for would not want that much thought out of a Rambo film... or so that would be my assumption. Bottomline: I know I have negated my own reasoning for why this film is not fantastic, but I was not impressed. Amused, that's a different story. I would recommend this film for those who want a movie to pass time. After all, it's a Rambo film, that means lots of bangs for your buck in the theaters.
9.0~Amazing war movie!!! CRISTOBALDEMIAN Sign in Permalink This movie is unique on the point of view of hardcore scenes and cruelty...I never saw the other sequels of Rambo so I can't say if they were like this...But I enjoy this war movie...Also Sylvester Stallone does a wonderful job writing,acting and directing this movie...Man's a bloody genius...About the mass murder scenes,I never saw something like this...I don't think even the SS Armies did something like that to the Jewish population...Killing everyone and with a rare cruelty:O...I wish it had been longer, filled with a few more scenes...the way in which it ended its a bit dull,I think they could have prolonged it a bit..But its a great war movie.
1.0~Is this what it's come down to? That movie Idiocracy is coming true. pbefx1 Sign in Permalink 1. this movie is only 1 hr and 20mins long. finding nemo was longer. lol? 2. there is no plot whatsoever. 3. Proof of life - That's is a hostage / mercenary movie . Rambo 4000 was a direct ripoff of that,hostel and the unit all put together. 4. can someone fill me in on the date the US military started using small nukes in claymores? that scene was worse then when he carried 2 m60's in each hand. there was a mushroom cloud for god sakes! 5. I can't believe none of the mercenary's died. figured Stallone would take all the glory. 6. maybe i'm old or just more mature but was there a need that every 2 minutes someone either had to explode, get raped, burn alive or worse? 7. i added it up. the total time of Slys spoken words was 22 mins. guess they were worried we'd confuse the accent with rocky. 8. anyone that thinks this movie will somehow spread light on the Burma problems and help is too much like rocky and has been hit the head way to much 9. if you're under 30 and have no problem with movies where a cop shoots 18 rounds out of a six shooter you will like this film. if you like at least 50% accuracy and realism you won't. 10. Rambo originals were unrealistic yes, but they served a purpose for the cold war antics some of lived through. if you're under 24 i don't expect you to understand why this movie cant compare. 11. i wont ruin the end with Rambo and the boss but i will say, you're kidding me? I've fought tougher boss battles in Super Mario Bros. anyways, yes this movie stunk in my honest opinion. i know some of you won't agree but thats why Rambo fought in nam. so i could say my opinion. listen the movie is horribly violent and unfortunately heads exploding, zombies and robots/monster cgi is what rules the screens these days but if anyone thinks this movie is worth the credit i keep seeing, then you my friend are in the 12 to 18 age group and therefore shouldn't be watching it anyways. Last Rocky - inspiring and nicely done Last Rambo - tiring and puts Sly back in the gutter of fame
8.0~Not a bullet proof monk LazySod Sign in Permalink Twenty-six years after First Blood John Rambo still hasn't found the peace of heart he needs to be able to return home and live out his old age. Living in a small fishermen's village in Thailand he fills his days catching and selling snakes. One day a group of people comes asking his help: they want him to take them into the next country by boat. After an initial refusal the job is taken and it doesn't take long until the action starts. Story wise this Rambo is both far and not far from the other three in the series. Violence wise it's more or less the same: a lot of people dying, some rather graphically. In most other aspects it is clearly a Rambo film while at the same time being something else: Rambo isn't the same Rambo he was in the other films, but I guess that might be deliberate, he's a number of years older and probably more dark and grim behind the eyes. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The build up is good, not too long at all, just enough to get the scenery settled in. The action is very good, just close enough to normal to keep it somewhat believable (however the finale does seem a little bit over the top). All in all, good stuff. 8 out of 10 corpses shot to bits
9.0~Wow! Saving Private Ryan reborn as RAMBO! rockerace Sign in Permalink This movie is by far the best of the 3 Rambo films (I don't consider "First Blood" to be a RAMBO film)! The film is certainly not heavy on plot and there are no real twists, but, the story is simple, believable, honest and has very little "Hollywood" to it. War is hell and good people die! This movie is totally brutal and it shows you where Rambo has been living for the last 20 years and the ending gives the Rambo character satisfying closure! Sylvester Stallone finally got the Rambo character right. If you liked Saving Private Ryan then you will ABSOLUTELY love this film.
8.0~To be or not to be...... SenderBex Sign in Permalink That is the question. Whether tis nobler to endure the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune (working on a snake farm in northern Thailand). Or dust off thy bandana and kick some Burmese glutus-maximus in sore need of being kicked. Hell yeahhhh!!! Rambo is trying to forget his past. But people won't leave him alone, see? Some god-squad liberals come knocking on his workshop door. They demand to be taken into Burma by river  they want him to pilot the boat. They won't listen to reason, and no sooner are they dropped off than they get themselves kidnapped. Rambo then has to pilot a rescue party of multi-national renegades to find and extract the hostages. The mercs view him with derision  led by a mouthy ex-SAS geek who's expostulations are met with Antarctic thousand-yard stares from Sly. The band of hoodlums leave him to guard the boat while they commence the mission. These babies soon fall off the potty  but lucky for them, Rambo arrives with the toilet paper. The movie is great, I expected nothing but was hugely entertained. The early scenes of Burmese villager slaughter are unflinching and highly disturbing. Dialogue is taut-to-non-existent but still includes a couple of lines that Tarantino would sell kidneys for! Once Sly gets into his hell-to-pay retribution stride  we are treated to pure high-octane ultra violence!! No one does it like this. No stylised slow-mo death sequences  just video game justice without any Matrix or Bourne cod-philosophy codswallop. It's a shoot-em-up that don't pretend. The most memorable scene has Sly improvising with an unexploded WW2 bomb he happens to find..oh Lord  that's gonna hurt in the morning, boys. Of course, the critics hate this movie but screw them  who else but Sly leaves you with belly-laughs and a huge grin on your face when you come out from a movie these days?? Move aside Mr Woo. Get bent Mr Greengrass. It's supposed to be entertainment  and Rambo delivers - with bells on!!
9.0~Rambo: The Most Violent Conclusion Desertman84 Sign in Permalink After three years of not shooting a film,Sylvester Stallone decided to reprise two roles of the successful movie franchises that he was part of.One was Rocky wherein he acted,wrote and directed its final installment entitled,Rocky Balboa. The other of course was Rambo. In 2008,he did portray once again his other famous role as legendary Cold War/Vietnam veteran John Rambo. He also directed the film. It is the fourth and most recent installment in the Rambo franchise,twenty years since the last film Rambo III. This film is dedicated to the memory of Richard Crenna,who played Colonel Sam Trautman in the first three films. The movie simply entitled,Rambo stars Stallone together with Julie Benz,Matthew Marsden,Graham McTavish,Reynaldo Gallegos,Jake La Botz,Tim Kang and Paul Schulze. The story,written by Art Monterastelli, has John Rambo survived many harrowing ordeals in his lifetime and has since withdrawn into a simple and secluded existence in Thailand, where he spends his time capturing snakes for local entertainers, and chauffeuring locals in his old PT boat. Meanwhile, the world's longest-running civil war rages into its 60th year on the nearby Thai-Burma border. One day, human rights missionaries Sarah Miller and Michael Burnett show up asking Rambo to guide them up the Salween so they can get some much- needed food and medical supplies to the desperate Karen tribe. According to Sarah and Michael, the Burmese military has planted land mines all along the roads leading into the tribe's village, making it virtually impossible to reach the tribe via land. Two weeks after Rambo drops the group off in dangerous territory, pastor Arthur Marsh arrives with a chilling message: the aid workers never returned from their mission into the jungle, and the embassies refuse to help Marsh and his fellow missionaries find their missing friends. Now,the knowledge that innocent missionaries are being used as pawns in a brutal war leaves him with no other choice than to venture behind enemy lines on his most dangerous mission to date. Rambo ends the series with its most violent film ever.It surpasses the the standard of its goriness and violence of the first three films.But nevertheless,it never fails to provide great action sequences and entertainment.With regards to the story,it still preaches that war remains the best option when resolving conflicts. The character,Rambo allows you to cheer for the wrong things when conflict arises.In the end,the film is no longer up-to-date to what it used to live back in the from an ideological view but it still works from an entertainment standpoint.
10.0~Still the greatest soldier blackasp98 Sign in Permalink Well i have to say that this film was something else. From my memories of the first three,as they were all about rescues and honor to fellow soldiers. But this one took it to a whole new level,with missionaries who were brought in to look after the sick and wounded,because the Burmese hillsides were clustered with land mines laid by the military. After the abduction of these missionaries by the merciless military,john Rambo was hired to bring them out of captivity along with some other mer cs,who are in a league of their own to help him. The scenes were awesome using explosions of such brutality that some of the characters were dismembered which is what happens in small or large military campaigns,grossly explicit in content and without a doubt the best film sly had to offer in a long time. He looks bigger than ever before which is good to see in his role as Rambo. But what made it more appealing was his return to his homeland of Arizona where he could finally reconcile with his dad,though we don't see it,all except his ranch. Still from being a mindless killing machine who had a grudge with the world,he was still human who needed family,much like colonel Troutman was to him from fort brag. Excellent to watch,hope to see a new Stallone later on.
10.0~What a great movie! pahaake Sign in Permalink I'll start by admitting, I am a huge Sly fan - but you don't have to be to enjoy this movie. The plot is very simple, and the action is simply amazing. It's gory, it's violent, but it's also just amazing to watch. What I liked most about this movie (and the most recent Rocky title) is that Stallone writes, directs, and stars in a film that entertains. I would defy anyone who knocks his age to look and act as good as this guy when they're 60 years old. Go see it, because you're not likely to see another entry in this series. Oh, and one more thing, I don't know if the depiction of what goes on in Burma is accurate - but if true - it's absolutely horrible.
10.0~Maybe most under-rated star in Hollywood fred-g-bartlett Sign in Permalink We too often forget, this is the man who created/wrote and starred in 'Rocky', a truly groundbreaking iconic work. Like many others who have commented here, I was totally surprised at 'Rambo,' and shame on me. My prejudgment was that this was Stallone squeezing a sequel out of the franchise, but I was totally wrong. This was an outstanding movie in its own right, and not only that, shed more light on what has been going on in strong-man run amok Burma/Myanmar than the sum total of all vague 'political reforms' reporting being done by an embarrassed press, anxious to white wash the latest excesses of 'leaning forward' for 'change' in that part of the world. The Khmer ROuge don't get a pass in history just because they were mere 'Agrarian Marxists,' and neither do the strong-man socialist generals running amok in Burma. Yet, go back and look at the reporting for the last decade or more, and count the number of times the word 'socialist' has been used to describe Myanamar/Burma...as strong men generals ran amok with their version of meateaters 'leaning forward' for 'change' in their nation. As soon as polite socialists get tired of asking and start telling at the point of the gun, the apologists for socialism come in with their mops and buckets (and body bags) and claim 'not real socialists...these are right wingers, because ... they are 'bad' left wingers, and the anti-logic of good/bad, left/right makes saints out of the crips who also battle the local bloods, just like in mid-20th century Europe, when the Totalitarian Nazi Crips battled the local Totalitarian Commie Bloods for local dominance...all while the polite social democrat enablers who helped foster the local tribal free-for-some stood on the sidelines after inviting the tribal mayhem and then got brushed aside by the inevitable meateaters. Burma has been trying to make the Khmer Rouge look like cub scouts, and an uneasy liberal west has wanted no part of shining a light on what is going on there. Stallone's movie does just that...to a nation in silence, regarding it as entertainment, and passed hurriedly by with little comment... Sort of like 'The Hunger Games' with its can't mistake it anti-totalirian, anti-concentrated federal power message.
7.0~HK Neo Reviews: Rambo webmaster-3017 Sign in Permalink Tagline: Stallone goes one step closer to retirement Review by Neo: With the conclusion of Rocky series and now the Rambo series, it is almost safe to say that Stallone can finally hangs up his boots with his head up high. After almost 10 years of making pure crap movies like D-Tox, Stallone have redeemed his career and possibly his face with the aforementioned conclusion to two of his greatest hits. Like Rocky, Stallone just doesn't know when to give up and if one found Rocky physically draining for the incredibly fit looking 65 years old lad, and then Rambo is bound to surprise you. Perhaps it is the excessive gore from start to finish that seem to stun the audience, but it is really full credit to director/writer/star/producer Stallone in recreating life within a franchise that have already been in a near death coma for more than 15 years. With a brisk running time of just 80 minutes, Rambo is a hugely entertaining film that never fails to stop and when the adrenalin is running, Neo can assure you that it won't stop till its over. Having watched the original Rocky for the first time, there is no question that Stallone is born for these two roles. His stoic appearance, stone-faced and stiff English speaking are all attributes that makes him a boxer or someone in the army. Director Stallone is certainly an old school director, without devolving into the world of technological special effects, Stallone keeps his feet on the ground and the result is some real guts and gore. Just seeing people being blown up is vividly depicted and violently shot. While at times, the gore and disgustingly real death can be quite fake looking, the constant bloodthirsty killings, more than compensate any areas of noticeable flaw. The plot will certainly be diced by all critics alike, but one must be realistic when watching a Rambo movie, why will anyone care about the plot. All we want is to see some real blood and thirst and luckily Stallone delivers exactly that. Then again, there is also the now famous bow and arrow shot that made Rambo who he is today. Stallone is also not afraid of showing the atrocious waste of lives in the way war criminals in South East Asia are being executed. All in all, Rambo is simply a stomach churning flick that requires a strong stomach for someone to sit through the entire duration. As far as popcorn entertainment is concerned, Rambo easily qualifies as one. Stallone may well be beyond retirement age, but as the Rocky's most famous quote goes – "It aren't over till its over!" Perhaps, this is a step closer to retirement from one of the greatest action heroes in the 80s and 90s, and if that's the case, Stallone will be able to lift his head up high and above and bow out on his own terms. By the way, Neo strongly recommend you to eat a buffet, before watching this movie and as for the reason, you will know why after you sit through the entire duration in one piece (Neo 2008) I rate it 7.5/10 www.thehkneo.com
10.0~John Rambo Renaissance! Hell Yes! kubla_kahn99 Sign in Permalink If you're one of those people who felt disappointed by Rambo 2 and 3 then have no fears, Rambo 4 is a whole new breed of beast. And what a beast! John Rambo is on fire in this movie. Possibly the most graphic action film I have ever seen but done oh so well. Saving Private Ryan beach landing scene eat your heart out. Watch this film and in so doing encourage Stallone to keep making movies, it is so worth it. I thought it couldn't get any better after Rocky Balboa, but it did! If I could give this movie 12 stars I would. See it. What are you still doing reading this? I said go see it. Seriously, this isn't even me typing anymore, I'm already off to watch it again.
5.0~Disappointing Mark387 Sign in Permalink John Rambo got tamed. In the two-decade hiatus that separates his last outing from Rambo (formerly John Rambo, Rambo IV, Rambo IV: In The Serpent's Eye), the Vietnam vet has taken up fishing, packed on a few pounds and nailed a faux-peaceful look to his strangely unwrinkled features. But Sylvester Stallone wants us to believe that somewhere underneath his massive frame still lies a killing machine. Tough job, since he slumbers through his own movie as a supporting character, rather than the one-man army who almost single-handedly created the genre that defined the '80s. We get a script glued together from bits and pieces of Rambo: First Blood Part II (the jungle setting) and Rambo III (the rescue mission) that barely allows the ultimate soldier to wrap his meaty fists around any sort of action. After years living peacefully in Thailand, Rambo reluctantly agrees to take a group of Christian relief workers into war-torn Burma. "We can make a difference," the blonde and frail Sarah (Julie Benz) tells her sceptical guide, who replies, repeatedly: "Go home." She should have listened. As her group arrives at a Generic Third World Village, they are brutally attacked, the villagers are slaughtered and the survivors (why there are any is a mystery) taken prisoner. Rambo gets the news, sighs and goes to the rescue. Ham-fisted dialogue aside, we expect Rambo to at least deliver in the action stakes. And deliver it does, but the main man is left on the sidelines: Rambo leads a band of mercenaries to the rescue against an army of faceless bad guys. It's these taggers-along who do the lion's share of the heavy lifting - or at least heavy shooting. Meanwhile, the baddies are developed not even a little. We have no idea why these men are holding hostages in the middle of the jungle, nor are we given any clue as to how, if at all, it relates to the ongoing civil war there. But they sure are bad: soldiers shoot at prisoners as they run through a minefield; rape and decapitation are common practise. As counter-balance - and to satisfy the audience's blood lust, perhaps - Rambo goes heavy on the gore. Very heavy. When the action kicks in, torn limbs and exploding heads became part of the scenery in a never-ending climax designed for the Xbox generation (see, for example, Rambo turning a soldier into meatloaf using heavy artillery in one unusually inspired scene). The real problem with Rambo is the lack of an anchor. The late Richard Crenna was perfectly cast as the franchise's Col. Trautman (and, for that matter, in Hot Shots! Part Deux) because he knew how to steer Rambo in the right direction. The character is sorely missed here, as Sly himself acknowledges by giving Rambo a dream sequence where Trautman tells him to stop denying who he really is: a killer. The other problem is Rocky Balboa. With the triumph of his sad-and-tender winner from last year, Sly thought he could win the '80s kids all over again through sheer nostalgia. But Rambo is no Rocky. He doesn't have a soft side; he needs to mope a little but then step straight into the action, period. Pushing 62, the actor/director was in the perfect position to tell the tale of the boxer in need of one last round - a tale that mirrored his own career - but here he can simply no longer deliver the kind of stunts expected from an action movie. The charisma-deficient mercenaries (one called "School Boy"? C'mon!) who tag along are a cheap excuse to provide thrills, leaving the audience with nothing to cheer but the all-too fleeting Rambo moments: an exploding arrow here, total carnage there. The brief running time - a bit under one-and-a-half hours - makes the whole experience bearable, but overall Rambo feels like the trailer for an adventure that never really ignites.
2.0~Not good enough... p-white76 Sign in Permalink The action scenes were pretty good, and the plot line was so-so, but there are just too many bad elements to make this a good movie. 1. there is absolutely no way a claymore mine would have an explosion that large. (it looked like a small nuclear blast) 2. There's no way that any .50 cal could cut someone in half, or even decapitate a person with only 1 round, not even if you were using HE ammo. 3. Having the mercenary fire a round into the air would do nothing in a real battle. (ambiant noise, proximity to the shot etc...) 4. When Rambo cuts the guy gut open toward the end, we see a lot of blood pouring out. There is no way this could really happen, as the abdominal area of any person has very little blood circulating through it. 6. All of the blood used, didn't even look like blood, the coloring, and consistency were wrong. Given all of those facts, I would still watch the movie again, if for nothing else then just to have something to make fun of. I think that this was Stallone's last attempt as an actor, unfortunately it turned out to be a failure.
10.0~Best Action of last 10 years mking-37 Sign in Permalink I hesitated about seeing this movie as who want's to see an old steroid Rambo? I was talked into it by a friend and we went to the late show. Tell you what, this has been the best action movie I've seen in the past ten years! Lot's of graphics, violence and action. If you don't see it a second time then your crazy! You will miss things the first time and won't catch them until the second like the baby being thrown into the fire. I don't want to get into it and ruin the movies for future viewers. Nothing but bullets ripping, body's exploding and limbs flying! GO see this before it's out of the theater. It's a must buy for Blueray!
10.0~Hero reloads - the best action film ever NightmareOnElmStreetFan Sign in Permalink Rambo (2008) the fourth film in the franchise is the ultimate action film from 2008 it is a bad-ass action film since Rambo III (1988) 20 years come out. It was a huge improvement over Rambo 3. I love this film to death most of the action films are not that gory like this movie. It fast paced, it goes quickly around and Sylvester Stallone returns as John Rambo and he reloads his famous character, he portrays John Rambo well. This is my comic book hero yes John Rambo is my ultimate action hero of all time. I am glad Stallone made the fourth film and now Sly wants to make Rambo V and his 70 years old how will that work. Stallone throw that idea years ago because he was un happy. Rambo the fourth film in my opinion made a full circle and he close the character well. We don't need another sequel and Rambo V will be awful leave our character alone Stallone. Sylvester Stallone returns as John Rambo, the former Green Beret and Vietnam veteran who in present day works as a boat captain in Southeast Asia and takes a job transporting missionaries on a medical aid mission. When the missionaries are captured by Burmese Junta soldiers, Rambo joins a group of mercenaries on a rescue mission. This is Stallone's only movie he written and directed him self. The action is gory and bloody that I love it. Rambo is using a Browning M2 Aircraft machine gun. Rambo uses the M2 to obliterate the driver and than he kills all the soldiers while he is reloading the machine gun M2 - .50cal BMG and he kills all the soldiers that scene kicks ass. You have a lot of fire power in here and I love the rescue mission in here. This is a bad-ass kick-ass film! I love Rambo's Mini Machete he uses in this movie. He chops people's heads off, he sets mines against Burmese soldiers. Richard Crenna and Jerry Goldsmith did not return for the fourth film, because they both past away and are no longer with us anymore. Brian Tyler did a music score for the film and in my opinion did a good music score for the film like Jerry Goldsmith did for the first three film. In my opinion Brian Tyler's score is great for the film.
5.0~My name is John dpajur Sign in Permalink Why bother sending troops to Iraq and Afghanistan? Just send Rambo... John Rambo. One guy, a pretty old guy, some bible bashers, and a world gone crazy in Burma. Anyone know where Burma is? I bet most of you don't. But that's not the point of this film! Well, Rambo's going there to sort things out, help some friends, tag along for a ride, try out his bow & arrow. Bible bashers get into some trouble, you know the way things go with Jehova's Witnesses. They knock on too many doors, try to sell too many stories about doom and damnation and the locals get angry. Rambo shows up, oh so reluctantly, cause he's against all that bloodshed business, always has been, always will be. That about sums it up, it's been a while since I laughed so hard!
10.0~This Movie Rocks!! bsperry-1 Sign in Permalink This movie has it all! I was so driven with emotion I was literally shaking and my husband kept trying to get me to move over and release his arm from my death grip. You know those regimes are out there, but this really drives it home. The people who think they can make adifference and those who sometimes have to go in (risk their own lives)to save them; you can see different view points..different reasons..the good..the bad..the despicable. When the film was over, the four of us in attendance all sat in our chairs for a moment and just said.."Wow...was that great or what!?" We will be buying that when it comes out on CD for sure! Way to go Sly!
1.0~Absolutely atrocious, and I'm a Rambo movie fan. HORRIBLE davidsco27 Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of the earlier Rambo films, and I love Stallone. I thought Rocky Balboa was great, and really applauded Stallone for how good it was. Therefore, going into this I had similar expectations, that Stallone would do justice to the story and the character. WRONG. OMG, I paid $1 for this rental and feel I got ripped off by $1000. One of the WORST films I have EVER seen. Now, I have no problem with blood and guts and gore if it's done well and advances the story. Nope, not here. I felt like I was watching a 14 year old's (probably the only age that will like this garbage) Playstation 3 shoot 'em up game. I mean, does EVERY character have to have his body parts come apart in blood and his innards splayed all over the place??? Ridiculous, and there is NO justification for it. The CGI, while very modern, was stiff as a board. Again, like a computer game with a poor graphics card. As for storyline, Stallone could've gone in so many good directions with this. Could've did what he did so well with Balboa, but instead, he gave us a gore fest, and oh, threw in a "tie-in" scene at the end that was completely cheap, and weak. The characters were weak, the plot was weak, the storyline was non-existent. Yes, we get it, there's genocide in Burma and it's violent. Halfway into this movie I wanted to rip it out of my DVD player, but I kept hoping it would redeem itself. NOPE. And, to top it off, the movie ended at an hour and 20 minutes!!!! THANK THE FORCE I didn't pay $10 for this crap!!!!! I think I would've hopped on a plane, flew to California, searched out and destroyed Stallone. I REALLY hope this is the end of this franchise. It has been PERMANENTLY tarnished by this one. Prior to renting this, I was going to buy the DVD. Fortunately, I didn't. I'll stick with the trilogy and forget this garbage was ever made. Please, people, don't waste your time or money. And those who say people who don't like this are not Rambo fans, go read a book, geniuses. Maybe even the first one of these. You might learn something.
3.0~"He's the Boatman. He Stays in the Boat!" Rindiana Sign in Permalink With this ultra-violent fourth entry in the Rambo canon you're in for a small surprise: While this is by no means a good movie in itself, it's still slightly better than expected (and better than its two predecessors.) Of course, the pretty all-American girl is not harmed by the evil Burmese military while the villagers are slaughtered. Of course, the titular hero saves the day. Of course, it's all terribly two-faced and reactionary, building up a discrepancy between Hollywood action movie tropes and the terror on real killing fields (just as it was the case in the earlier installments, except for the first part, maybe.) But in times of bland and forgettable Hollywood action entertainment with its pseudo-clever lines and outrageous situations, this (literally) visceral down-to-earth approach earns some extra points. It really gets to you in a smutty kind of way. 3 out of 10 sonorously mumbled laconic statements
7.0~the best since the original and a grand action picture but it could have been so much more TheUnknown837-1 Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone, regardless of how many times the Golden Raspberry Awards have decided to riff on his performances, is undoubtedly the source of two of the most popular icons in film history. Rocky and Rambo. The original films for both of these icons were met with strong popularity and spawned numerous, mediocre sequels. Recently, Stallone took the liberty of bringing them back with more punch than before and by directing them himself, sort of refreshed what we loved about them to begin with. We first saw Rambo in the 1982 film First Blood, which is still the best of the series. Then we had Rambo: First Blood Part II, which was simply awful. Rambo III is considered by some to be superior, but the new Rambo is, without a doubt, the best since the original. In this film, we see Rambo with a new set of eyes. No longer is he the young, jobless drifter being picked on by stereotypical policemen, he's a run-down, tired veteran living in Vietnam where his comrades died, flat out sick of the world. He is hired by global aid workers who want to help the poor villages in the country. After they are kidnapped by rebels, Rambo and a team of American soldiers set out to recover them before its too late. What follows is a series of gunfights, deaths, and bloody fight scenes. Some unremittingly intense, but very well-done. This is a ninety-minute, shoot-'em-up kind of movie. The body count climbs into the hundreds and some people will find it repulsive for this reason. But in a way, Rambo is not a recklessly bloody film. It uses its violence one to entertain and two to symbolize the horrible things which really continue to happen in that part of the world to this very day. We see scenes or rebels torturing, burning, raping, and playing with the lives of their captives and it's sad, but it's true. I congratulate Stallone and his crew enormously for this effective allegory. And grand and bold as Rambo is, I'm sorry to say that is a missed opportunity. Because while it covers the violence and the symbolism with flying colors, what is misses out on is the character development. And what I was really wanting was a real in-depth characterization of Rambo as more than just a killing machine. There was a brief flashback sequence which related to his troublesome past, but I wanted more than that. The movie's only an hour and a half long and it seems way too short by that. There could have been more. A little more depth would have possibly given it a fourth star. And I was really hoping to see more reflection on the character of Colonel Trautman, Rambo's superior from the last three films. With Richard Crenna's passing in 2003, it was a wise move not to replace him with a new actor (that would have been horrible) but I was wanting more memories and reflection on such a great human character than just a few seconds of a quick flashback. Nevertheless, Rambo is a grand, fun action movie and like I said, the best since the original. It's just a shame that the filmmakers didn't explore the regions I wanted most and for that reason, many people are going to pan this film for its enormous content of violence and deaths. But for fans of big, rowdy shoot-'em-up movies, this will be your treasure trove.
10.0~He finally found a place to eat. greatlakeatlantic Sign in Permalink Although there could have been a bit more development to John in this installment, this is arguably his finest moment. I won't give a plot description because there have been enough of those, because more importantly this movie is about feeling, and restitution. The satisfaction of evil being extinguished has to be seen to be believed, as John's form of justice is perfect. I almost got up and started cheering as he mowed down those disgusting mustached riffraff of the Orient. It is extremely violent but never repugnant, and leaves you wanting to live with John as a roommate for the rest of your life. Perhaps my own sentimentality adds to the subjectivity of my review, but this was a perfect end to one of my favorite childhood franchises, but will never quench my thirst for John Rambo, the greatest war hero who ever lived, awarded the medal of honor twice! See this movie so a fifth can be made!
8.0~Rambo Reloaded,Reborn and Repackaged axlrhodes Sign in Permalink Rambo has caused quite a stir for its strong emphasis on violence.Yes it is violent and uncompromising but i don't think you can go to a Rambo film and expect anything other than strong intense violence.I personally enjoyed the film very much,Stallone has matured as a film maker and delivers another fine comeback with this film.Its been a while since Rambo III and when this film starts our hero is lost in the world and still struggling with his personal demons.Stallone plays the character well,giving an controlled numb performance before the rage in unleashed in the final third.I've always felt that Stallone has been a highly underrated artist and like his Rocky character is constantly written off but the last two years have been a thoroughly enjoyable trip down memory lane.I advise you to stay away from Rambo if you are sensitive to violence but really,you should know that already. 8/10
8.0~"Go home, my American people" That's all it's about to say by Rambo honorhorror Sign in Permalink This is a very fun film with a strong message concerning the fate of Americans. It is about moral ambiguity just like Gone Baby Gone but in a different tone. You can definitely argue on both sides. The world had just experienced the Korean Christian Medical Support Team hostage incident, which ended with people blaming missionaries for months. Now it's John Rambo to say something about it. "Go home."(in a firm and heavy tone)That is all to say. As a Christian myself I way firstly annoyed by the negative portray of the missionaries especially the stubborn and nearly foolish "Michael", who is the leader of the medical team. But then I start to realize that, just like what we saw in Apocalypse Now, you can't sell idealism in such an aggressive manner no matter where, because if you are wasted instantly, it is wasted for nothing yet the living people would be bound sacrifice even more to save you. Near the end of the movie, Rambo and Sara gazed at each other without a word, which implied that maybe neither of them is the right person in that imagined Burma, but only "Go home" is right. Stallone reaffirmed this message in the last shot of the movie. While on the other hand, it can be argued that the medical team, just like the Korean medical team, are just innocent and not aware of the true threatens of the environment. Or in short, they are not to be blamed. But, "I am the pastor of the Christ Church of Columbia, and I am hiring mercenaries to save my missionaries. Can you lead them the way?" Ironic, huh? I sincerely hope that, in the future I won't be stubborn and selfish enough to pursue anything while leaving the responsible persons killing to save me. My friends are all chilled by the gore and violence in the movie. While some people are blaming Stallone for slaughtering people like eating tofu, my father who had the true war experiences in Southeast Asia would give it a big nod that, it is very brutally and nostaglialy realistic. 8/10, the movie is very well paced. The noticeable flaw is that, it's only 91 minutes.
7.0~Good action film is also disturbingly violent dbborroughs Sign in Permalink Probably the only true sequel to First Blood, and another step from the wilderness for Sylvester Stallone as a filmmaker. While not as good as the last Rocky film it is a decent action film that is a bit troubling in the level of its violence. The plot has Rambo in Thailand being hired to take a bunch of missionaries up stream into war torn Burma. At first reluctant to do so, he sees the trouble ahead, he is talked into it by Sarah who convinces him thats its better to die for something, than live for nothing. When the missionaries go missing the head of the church the missionaries came from hires Rambo to take some mercenaries to where he left the first group. Not one to sit behind Rambo once more finds himself in the thick of the battle. Quite simply one of the most graphically violent war films I've ever seen. Blood and body parts fly freely. It is almost too much to take, which is sad since in five years it's violence will probably be the norm. Trust me on this, if blood and broken bodies bother you don't see this film. Its effect is very visceral, becoming a real punch in the stomach. Amazingly Stallone manages to keep the body count high and not lose its effect, something many over the top war films fail to achieve. What troubles me is the films moral center is not clear. While its clear that Stallone and Rambo do not feel violence is never good (a sentiment expressed by one of the characters) its bothersome to wonder at what point is it too much violence? I don't think the film knows and so it tries, and on some level succeeds, to hedge its bets. I think it works only because there is so much blood and carnage(as there probably would be in a battle of this sort) that you are kind of forced to ponder the implications of it all. Of course I could be reading too much into it. As an action film this is a pretty good popcorn film. It moves at a good clip, isn't too long, about 90 minutes, and isn't really that lost in Reagan era jingoistic politics (come on the second and third films are laughably bad, as are many of Stallone's films from the same time). If you like action films I say give it a shot. 6.5 to 7 out of 10.
10.0~The best comeback ever! dworldeater Sign in Permalink Sly made a strong comeback previous to this with his latest Rocky installment. However with Rambo, he blew all my expectations out of the water and is a gigantic improvement to the really lame Rambo 3. Rambo is a return to form for the character and is the most like the 1st installment (First Blood). Rambo is totally gritty, ultra violent and dark character piece for Stallone and he gives a tremendous performance, which brings to mind my all time favorite movie Unforgiven. John Rambo is living in Thailand and working as a snake handler. He returns to action when Julie Benz and her group of christians are not heard from when they went to Burma to provide aid and christian propoganda. This brings to light the reality of genocide and civil war that is still ongoing in Burma. Sly pulls no punches in his depiction of these events in this film and showcases extreme brutality by turning the bad guys to spaghetti. Rambo is easily the bloodiest and goriest non horror film out there and delivers in bloodsoaked ultra violence. This is the best installment since the 1st film and I can't wait to check out Rambo 5!
10.0~Steroid Stud qormi Sign in Permalink Okay, Stallone takes more steroids and HGH than Barry Bonds and Hulk Hogan combined. That said, the 61 - year old actor is buffer than ever. His shoulders are the size of my couch. His arms are rippling. Okay, he didn't take his shirt off this time. But Stallone was moody, wound tight, and ready to snap. Excellent plot, acting, and direction. The most horrifying combat scenes since "Private Ryan". It felt like you had to duck for cover. This was by far the best Rambo film since First Blood. A complete triumph! The damp, rainy Burmese jungle lends an atmosphere of danger and keeps your eyes glued to to the screen. The mercenaries that accompany him seem like a believable bunch of hired killers. Stallone's sudden violence and menacing presence, though, permeates the film and makes it work.
10.0~Can't think of better than this niteshmoundekar Sign in Permalink A very short review of this movie can be following Q&A How would you define a action movie? Or What is a action Movie? Ans: John Rambo Rambo is the greatest action movie ever made. It's so freaking awesome movie. From start to end you will feel the adrenaline flowing through your veins. If I compare then I feel it stands out of the all Rambo movies especially 2 and 3. The difference between this movie and other recent action movies is the success here. Ever thought what kind of wounds you will get if you are shot by AWP Magnum Rifle or what would happen if you put your feet on land mine. These details are rarely covered in action movies. You could find these only in war movies but thats different genre. Its very well balanced movie with lots of thinking done in script details. The dialogues are awesome. Each dialogue delivered by Rambo is like a arrow shot in you heart. The background score is awesome. They will get you tears in your eyes sometimes. ITs a must watch. Its a action movie with a message. Its like all action movies made in last decade are nothing comparable to it. The best part of the movie is its ending. This is the best way to end the Rambo series. Watch it out. You will also admire the ending part. Its up to you to experience it. This is the best action movie I have ever seen. Don't know about you guys. Just check it out it may well be your best. "When you're pushed killing's as easy as breathing!" - John Rambo Rating: For me its higher than 10/10. Long live Rambo...
7.0~20 Years Later and Stallone Still Has It MoffatLP Sign in Permalink 20 years after Rambo III, Stallone picks up the guns and blasts his way through everyone in his path. This time he is blasting his way through the jungle to rescue some Christians who were captured by a local infantry camp. It's easily believable that this film has one of the highest body counts of all time, and the highest of the entire Rambo series. After 20 years, people thought that there was no way Stallone still had it in him to come back as Rambo for one last time, they were wrong. Yet again Sylvester Stallone comes back as one of the best action heroes of all time. Surprisingly, the quality of Rambo was really good. Usually sequels are never very good, especially ones after 20 years of the original, but there was good effort put into the script and the action scenes are mind-blowing. Lots of people getting shot and at least 80 people are shot and killed within the course of just 5 minutes. So many bullets flying around it's hard to understand who's shooting who. Nevertheless, lots of limbs getting torn apart and lots of exploding heads. The film almost entirely takes place in the jungle, a nice setting for an action flick. The scenes at nighttime weren't very hard to follow nor were they dragged on for a large amount of time. Cinematography was pretty good, well placed cameras that show the brains of an exploding head flying all over the lens. So many people get ripped apart graphically and the cameras are so close to the action you can't miss a thing. Overall it was great as an action movie, but if it wasn't filmed the way it was it probably wouldn't be as good. 8/10.
10.0~This time return for us.. johnsw-3 Sign in Permalink Hello to all out there. I'm john 30 years old from little Greece.I have to say first my secret... First Blood II it's the first Rambo movie i ever see from the series and till day i saw it about 80 times(2,on big screen).The First Blood about 70 times(never on big screen)and Rambo III 127 times(3 of them on the big screen).So i think i'm passing into Stallone fan club. 20 years Patiently waiting,have past from the last movie and finally John Rambo makes the premiere at 24 January in Greece. 20 years of waiting for this moment... The movie begins and as the first time the theme song play i start to cry and i realize thats my atonement for all this years.Stallone is back and thats for sure with this masterpiece calls RAMBO to saw to everyone how to make a movie.We wait 20 years to see a good action movie and we seen the best!!!All the number i tell in the first lines, was just a good warm up for the last one.Finally all i can say is that there is a question: is it Stallone best movie? OR it's the best action movie? your call......
7.0~Sheer, bloody-as-hell entertainment! kallizmartin Sign in Permalink I was lucky to catch this movie, not at the premiere or something, but at the 3rd day of playing in my city. I'm saying I was lucky, because the theater was PACKED. And, boy, do I understand why! I'm not bothering with going into the story, as you already most likely know it, browsing through the profile for this movie. Me and my stepbrother were discussing Rambo after we saw it, and we can not remember the last time we experienced something like this in a movie theater. This movie is pure action. 'Nuff said. Norwegian movie critics have bashed this movie, calling it "ultra violent" and "virtually devoid of plot and characters". Yes, I agree, but that is also what makes it a totally sweet 93 minutes of sheer entertainment. Last weekend I went to see Atonement and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days in the theater. Plenty of drama, great acting and real, human emotion. I had to think and pay attention and I was rewarded, because I felt good when leaving the theater, knowing I had witnessed art. But reward comes in more than one wrapping. I was rewarded after Rambo because I got to have a blast in the theater, laughing at some of the extreme violence (it's so extreme you can do nothing but laugh. At least I did), being shook by sustained gunfire and an especially jaw-dropping explosion (clearing about a half a square mile of jungle vegetation). The list goes on. In short, I was rewarded, because I had a DAMN good time. There is nothing wrong with being entertained by morally ambiguous motion pictures like this one, as long as you acknowledge it as just THAT. This isn't The Godfather Pt. 2 or Dr. Zhivago or something in that league. This is Rambo, and if you don't know that you're about to witness some carnage, while walking to your seat, you're in for a surprise. If it wasn't for the sustained gunfire, the 50. cal-orgy, devastating sound effects, visceral, bloody, bloody action and sheer ass-kicking, this would have scored 2/10 in my book. The acting is what you'd expect (after all, Stallone is the most-nominated actor for Razzie Awards), the script is anorexic, and not in that art-haus-type way, and the running time is quite short, I'd say. But so what? You know this going in, and you're going because of the action. If you have a very weak stomach or can't stand blood, decapitations or scattered limbs, don't watch it. If you have a strong stomach, common sense telling you this isn't real, and the inclination to be entertained by an larger-than-life avalanche of violence, then watch this movie! It's one hell of an experience!! - Damien
8.0~This is actually a great flick raggadix Sign in Permalink Rambo is not only a great action movie, but it also a document over todays situation in todays Burma. The movie is not for the weak of heart. Bodyparts and blood fly across the screen in the most graphic way you could imagine. Even kids are killed, which have been a life-old taboo in Hollywood and Stallone breaks that taboo with the biggest sledgehammer ever. But even I understand that the story has been spiced with scenes that looks great on a movie and the script maybe have been stretched a bit, but this is what people in Burma lives and breath everyday. Fiction is not always far from the truth. Stallone is doing a great job in portraying a tired and lonely John Rambo that pretty much wants to be left alone. What i liked about it as well is the fact that Stallone is not trying to let Rambo act like he was a 35 year old super-athletic killing machine. He lets Rambo act his age. To sum this up, if you are only going to see 1 action movie this year you should most definitely see "Rambo" Great action with a lot of thoughts
6.0~He's back! come2whereimfrom Sign in Permalink John Rambo or Rambo 4 or Rambo IV or whatever you want to call it sees Mumbling muscle man Sly Stallone resurrecting his eighties one man army for a final mission. The story is simple a group of missionaries get kidnapped by rebels in Burma and in his own ultimately cheesy words 'its better to die for something, than live for nothing' John decides he's going to get them out. Cue eighties levels of violence as people are blown up by land mines, cut in two by chain guns and generally splattered in all directions and that before Rambo has even started. If you have seen any of the trilogy, 'Commando' or anything where the hero takes on an army and creates a blood bath then you will know what to expect. The story is scant, the acting is bearable and the action is fierce but it is fun none the less, maybe not one for the girls or anyone who is a little squeamish, but a few beers and a switched off mind and you might just enjoy it.
10.0~Excellent danextgen Sign in Permalink I just came from watching this movie.. and i must say i was left i awe! I've already seen the good reviews in here and the good score it had.. But man.. i wasn't ready for this. This is one of the Best action movies EVER! It is so well done, so intense and exciting! Stallone outdone himself on this one, he presents an older Rambo that on the outside doesn't care about anything anymore and it's very well done (i was afraid it would have some cheesy factor into it but NO). The war scenes are comparable to Saving Private Ryan in all respects. They are so greatly done that i can't say it enough. The photography and filming are also GREAT and Oscar material in my opinion, NO DOUBT. But more important than all of that, i had A GREAT time from the first second of the movie and that's what's all about, specially with a Rambo Title. This movie gives you very distinct emotions trough the whole tape. Believe me! I highly recommend this movie to anyone! Fan or Not. It's that great!
10.0~Bloody brilliant izzo1701 Sign in Permalink Stallone has done it again. This film earns every bit of it's R rating, and that's refreshing in a day where PG-13 mass appeal films flood the marketplace. There has been a void in the action genre, and this film comes right from the trenches. Yes, the violence is shocking, brutal and obscene, but guess what? That is what is currently going on in that area of the world. This film asks the question of how civilized nations can turn a blind eye to the atrocities being committed in areas like Burma. Thank you Mr. Stallone for bringing amazing violent action to the screen, with a very poignant, relative message. I look forward to more of your films.
2.0~Low budget wfpoulet Sign in Permalink I have 5 things to say: 1 hour and 15 minutes. Plus 12 minutes of credits at the end. This movie is way too short! some scenes are just fillers. Only there to increase the movie's length. The dream (made of scenes from previous movies) is one example... it's very gore. I think it even beats some gore movies from the 70's or 80's. After a few scenes, it gets boring to watch so much blood dropping, spilling, splashing or exploding around. there is no plot. I like action, but I also like a story and some suspense. Nothing like that in this movie. action scenes are so-so. They are (mostly) about using always bigger firearms. We watched it without fun, without anticipation, without pleasure. It's better than watching a boring soap or reality show, but not by much. If you like Stallone and have 75 minutes to waste, rent that movie. Otherwise, do something else!
9.0~Excellent, the best Rambo film in the series gangstahippie Sign in Permalink Rated R for strong graphic bloody violence, sexual assaults, grisly images and language. Rambo 4(or Rambo) is in my opinion, the greatest Rambo film in the series and one of the greatest action movies of all time.The film definitely exceeded my expectations.It brings back old memories of Rambo 2 and 3...but with 10x more violence and gore! The storyline is actually pretty good for an action film, better than the story lines in Rambo 2 and 3, but the action is amazing! The film is very very violent and if you have a weak stomach, you do not want to watch this film! There's blood and decapitation everywhere in this film. The acting is good from the entire cast...even Stallone in my opinion but there were times when you could hardly hear him.The plot of the film involves a bunch of missionaries wanting to go to Burma.Rambo advises them not to, but they insist and he takes them there.A man then comes to him telling him they have not returned.This is because they were captured by the Burmese soldiers.Stallone does a good job in making us really hate the Burmese soldiers.They brutally beat,torture and murder people, rape women etc.The leader is even a pedophile!So now Rambo and some mercenaries go to escape with the missionaries.The movie really makes you root for Rambo and the mercenaries while they are fighting, just like when watching the other Rambo films.If you enjoyed the other Rambo films, this is definitely a must.If you are an action film fan, this is definitely a must! There have been a lot of PG-13 sequels to R-rated franchises such as Alien,Predator(Alien vs Predator) and Die Hard(Live Free Or Die Hard which was still pretty good).Rambo is very R-rated and very pleasing for Rambo fans!
8.0~RAMBO is more than faithful to the franchise, a real eye opener Jack_Acid Sign in Permalink Despite the fact that I grew up with Sly films, I'm not a huge Rambo fan. But no one can deny the character's place as the iconic action hero. I admit that when I heard Stallone was reviving Rambo (as well as Rocky), I was more than skeptical. But both films were dutifully faithful to their respective franchises and profess now that I was wrong about Stallone - he has garnered my full respect as a quality director and film maker, at least within the confines of his own beloved franchises. In the case of Rambo, Stallone pulls no punches (no pun intended.) Here we get another glimpse of John Rambo as a lost man. We also get to see him lay down untold destruction on a group of Burmese militia, lead by a very sadistic leader. This is hardly a brainy film, but who would ever expect a Rambo film to be so? What we DO expect is something dramatic and intense action and on the surface, Rambo delivers in spades. But the film's underlying beauty is its message about the true terrors of Burma and like countries. Of course this film is fictional, but Stallone did plenty of research; even the chief villain (Maung Maung Khin) is a former freedom fighter in Burma and I'm sure added his own nightmarish accounts of the realities of the situation. And let me say this now, this film is a blood bath, but not in a Hollywood sense....in a very realistic sense. When you watch this movie, remember that is happening RIGHT NOW, somewhere in the world. These scenes are the same that can be found in Iraq too. Not a huge fan of mindless action, nor a violence-junkie, I was surprised by how visceral and powerful this film is. Not for the faint of heart, but if you're a fan of old-school, brutal action films, don't miss it. It's also a lean 91 minutes long, which is very welcome in today's Holloywood bloating of 2+ hours films.
2.0~Cant anybody see he is too old nathan-408 Sign in Permalink Hes 60 in real life and in the film it looks like he could be that age as well so why at the end of the movie does he go see his his father shouldn't his dad be dead he must be 90-100 years old and also why is everyone going on about the blood and gore so what ill just rent or buy a slasher movie if wanted that also of course this is not believable a 60 year old man against a Burmese army and HE wins he did not even die at the end of the film which made me even more depressed i just thank god that i heard an interview that this Rambo film was it for Sylvester Stallone which makes me think if Harvey Weinstein really wants another sequel then they are either going to a)recast Rambo which is stupid or b) they are going to do something stupid like make the son of Rambo or some crap like that
10.0~You have to see it to believe it , Stallone's best nicolaasl Sign in Permalink Norse Sage from Akershus, Norway had this to say, "I didn't expect it to be any more than a cheesy and somewhat gory tribute to eighties actioners by a star/director/producer/writer who was desperate to relive past glory. That latter may or may not be true, but my former assessment was plain wrong. This movie is authentic, shocking and unlike any other comparable movie. Given its genre, the movie is a masterpiece. The story is simple but solid, and works on several levels. The action scenes are unparalleled, more intense than "Black Hawk Down", "Saving Private Ryan" and "Stalingrad" put together. The level of brutality and gore will shock and fascinate, and no doubt cause some level of controversy. Stallone proves himself to be an excellent director, as well as in excellent shape for his age. I had little faith in him going in, and I stand corrected. This is a Rambo who has come to terms with who and what he is, in a movie that holds up when compared with the original "First Blood". Well done, Sly. Well done indeed". DITTO...DITTO....DITTO.
10.0~I Love You SLY Buttons-Breaker Sign in Permalink Hi everybody, I will simply say to you: Rambo is a masterpiece,kick ass movie. Sly like he's past Rocks, Take my advice and watch the movie, Just give it a try. For me I was SO excited to this movie for Three reasons: 1-To know what happen for John after all these years. 2-To see John Rambo muscles(SLY body shape) it's rock for he's age. 3-Because It's John Rambo movie. So really the movie shows that SLY is a genius, He's the director and the writer... my god he is really Rocks. Really I hope If he now in 40 of he's age. God bless you SLY. For me I will rate this movie 11/10.
8.0~Welcome back Rambo (with a vengeance)! george.schmidt Sign in Permalink RAMBO (2008) *** Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz, Paul Schulze, Ken Howard, Graham McTavish, Matthew Marsden, Jake La Botz. Stallone's iconic Vietnam vet killing machine extraordinaire John Rambo is back with a vengeance in this entertaining and at-times-over- the-top brutally violent chapter in the franchise instilling some new blood(shed) this time with our reluctant hero called into action when an American missionary troupe is savagely attacked after he escorted them into the Burma jungle resulting in their dire need of rescue. Directed, produced and co-written by Stallone (with Art Monterastelli) the film delivers the brutal, bloody goods with a decent body count and  hey- a relative political message to the true-to-life genocide in the nation at hand.
10.0~A masterpiece of action cinema Leofwine_draca Sign in Permalink As hard-hitting as a sucker punch to the jaw, Sylvester Stallone powerhouses his way back into the modern consciousness with this, the fourth in the successful Rambo series. It's been twenty long years since his hero appeared in the cheesy, tacky RAMBO III and the good news is that Stallone has learned a few things by then. With the star returning in a dual role as both actor and director, it really rests on his rather broad shoulders as to whether this is any cop. The good news is that it is: some have complained that Rambo takes a sideline in this outing, but that's not the case. John Rambo, when we meet him, is an older, wiser, more experienced warrior, but one who remains just as vicious as he was in the past. And viciousness is the key when it comes to RAMBO, because this is one of the most savage films you'll ever witness. Stallone pulls no punches when depicting the brutal military regime in Burma. Innocents are shot and killed on a routine basis; rape and torture are commonplace occurrences, and even children and babies aren't safe from the soldiers. One particular sequence sees a hideous 'game' in which they Burmese soldiers innocent villagers to run through booby-trapped paddy fields where they inevitably get blown to shreds. Of course, this violence simmers and burns as the film goes on, until the last half sees Rambo hitting back, and boy does he snap. The climax is a visceral ride of revenge and retribution, where the bloodshed really goes overboard. If you thought the opening of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was gruesome, you ain't seen nothing yet. Aided by a mercenary buddy with a super-power rifle, Stallone tears out throats, knocks off heads, and goes berserk with an anti-aircraft gun in his bid to rid the world of these evil soldiers. What happens is best left a surprise, but I'll guarantee that it doesn't disappoint. I haven't been this pumped at a film's climax since I saw HOSTEL. Of course, the directing is perfect, and Stallone's acting is the best yet, reaching new levels of subtlety. He's supported by a varied bunch of characters, including an unlikeable Christian, a token female, a stereotyped Cockney, and some fun mercenaries. The director of photography deserves mention for his excellent camera-work, recalling the glory days of the 1980s jungle-set war epics, but with a grittier, more modern edge. Of course, the action is fantastic, but what's equally amazing is that the non-action bits are just as riveting. One of those films you'll want to watch over and over, RAMBO's a masterpiece of a movie, a non-stop thrill ride that never lets up.
7.0~Better than 3 but not as good as 2 justin-fencsak Sign in Permalink When it comes to ranking the rambo movies, first blood part ii is #1, followed by the first rambo movie, and this one, which is set in modern times and shows rambo in full blown action. It's also the most violent film ever made and its worthy of an R rating. Watch this movie before seeing last blood this fall!!!
9.0~Gritty, Violent, and an Awesome Action Movie. Rambo is Back sttanktank Sign in Permalink The forth installment of the Rambo franchise goes beyond all expectations. It's one of the greatest action movies of the past couple decades and never ceases to engage the viewer in non stop enjoyment. Stallone rejuvenates the franchise perfectly, and this movie is not only a must see but a must buy. The movie takes an almost two decade old franchise and brings it to modern terms with an exploding fashion. The plot is interesting and new while the characters are well acted and realistic. Along for the ride are soon to be classic one linens and the unforgettable Rambo kill scenes. Every second John Rambo is on the screen killing someone the viewer is on edge from just how hardcore Rambo is. In the end Stallone brought Rambo and remolded him to a new generation in the best way possible.
8.0~good action-heart-beat-flick! andreluisneto Sign in Permalink At first i might just say i did enjoyed the three previous Rambo movies.The first one i think it's a very honest action film with a good script and great acting(specially from Brian Dennehy\;the second although it seemed a little cheesy in a few moments(a script with patriotic content(but with great action scenes)),Stallone tried to give a statement about Vietnam War,but not so well comprehended by some people...(in the end of the movie Rambo's speech was"misunderstood"during the Reagan era);the third chapter unfortunately didn't do well in its approach showing Rambo helping lives in Afghanistan....killing Russians in the end of Cold War....but hey,the action content in these movies are ultra-cool!!,no one can deny that! Rambo may be a controversial character...(maybe it's the reason why it's so popular) for some people but i definitely liked Stallone's approach for those movies(the guy is an actor,just that);the last chapter i think is as honest as the first chapter in terms of emotions,action scenes(bloody ones with mature content for kids),but here is the heart of Rambo film...good Sly! 7/10
6.0~About what you'd expect daveygandthekeyboard Sign in Permalink A 60 year old Stallone as an ex-soldier who can still kick ass is more believable than him as a 60 year old boxer--it's one of the things that worked about this...ahem..film. I felt the same way after watching the last Rocky movie as I did after watching this. It was good, but ultimately pointless; you know that the peace-corp types will be wrong, and violence will be the only solution, and it will result in a major bloodbath (seriously the most violent of the series). Rambo has no surprises. That said, Rambo is enormously entertaining, violent as hell, and you get what you came for. It will definitely satisfy fans of the series, though I had a weird feeling when I left the theater: did I really just pay to see Rambo? Wow...
8.0~Great ACTION Movie !!! wyattej2000 Sign in Permalink This review contains no spoilers. I enjoyed this movie, and I do not work for Lionsgate as hinted by some previous reviewers. I watched this movie in a packed house, 1st showing, and the audience applauded at the end. This new episode of Rambo needs to be looked at mostly along side II and III. "First Blood," was its own thing and could sit alone without any sequels and it would still have the same reputation it has today, a pretty good action/drama. Now, getting to the sequels. II had a high budget and lots of action, but it was bogged down in my opinion by small sets and some pretty crummy dialog. III was a bit more intricate, with bigger, more grand looking sets, decent dialog and a lot of action. At the time it seemed that the plot was a bit foreign to most because people did not care nor really have any idea of what was going on between the Russians, the Afghans,and the U.S. complicity in their war. Anyways... Getting back to the new film. In a way it reminds me of II. Set in the jungle, in Burma, this film has a lot of action, and lots of "shoot 'em up," carnage. But, the difference is the partial reality of the plot, and the fact that it appears to be on a bigger scale like III, but holding the intensity of the original First Blood. As far as the filming, overall the film looks pretty good, there are some choppy transition for a few minutes just after the first 1/3 of the film, but it does not last long. A few scenes of awkward dialog, but overall the film seems pretty well put together. And actually there are some beautiful overheads of the jungle, kind of appealing in a way. Now, for the action. The body counts are the highest ever, the gore is pretty extreme, big explosions, but the films violence is based in the idea of "combat." For me the pure combat scenes reminded me of "Saving Private Ryan," for their intensity. Yes some of the violence is a bit over the top and gratuitous but hey, it's Rambo. This is a very good action/war movie. And for its genre, it is top notch and will satisfy those who are fans of the series and fans of action films.
5.0~I'm sorry! ericstevenson Sign in Permalink I guess I'm more with the critics on this one. I didn't care much for this movie because I thought it was mostly pointless. It's just the same old stuff of Rambo arriving and killing everybody. It's not even until the last part that you even see Rambo wipe out a bunch of people. I'm annoyed by the clichés in this movie. You see someone trying to get help from Rambo and he says he can't make a big difference or something like that. There's this odd scene where we see a bunch of flashbacks that looks like trailer fodder that shouldn't be in a movie. There were rumors of a fourth Rambo movie made where he would fight Osama bin Laden. This is that fourth movie but he doesn't partake in the War on Terror. I doubt that if he did, the movie would be any better. It's mostly an excuse to constantly show death and destruction. Now the fight scenes themselves were actually pretty well done. It's just that character development is taken away in case of explosions. It's really no worse than any other big budget action flick. I've now seen every Rambo movie and it's been okay watching them. **
9.0~Must watch Petelej Sign in Permalink I just had to comment on this movie. I was practically dragged to watch this 'yet another Rambo flick' but this movie captured me from the word go. Stallone puts together a classic air around him that gives war such unexplainable allure but yet again doesn't make one feel weird and sick at the same time. Anyone who likes 24 will love this. Rambo employs the characteristic Jack Bauer 'no mercy' tack and pulls it off beautifully. This is one movie you won't tire off. But be warned it is not for everyone. If you prefer a little less blood on your screen, keep well away from Rambo IV. But if you love your adrenaline cranked, this is a must watch. Savour it, for it may be the only Rambo in that calibre.
10.0~WOW - Stallone is back with a vengeance lee-todman Sign in Permalink This is by far the best fast paced action movie I've ever seen. Absolutely brilliant, Stallone has made some really good stuff in the past but this takes the cake. Why do I like this movie so much, well lets see : It was not long and drawn out, Stallone kept it short and to the point. The action scenes are out of this world. The acting is way above acceptable. This is just a masterpiece in every sense, OK it's an action movie but delivers much,much more than expected. I loved the Rocky's and to this day I can still watch them and lets not forget all the work Stallone did behind the scenes of some great Hollywood movies back in the day. It don't know what it's going to take to top this movie, I think Stallone has just given a whole new meaning to "Action movies". Anybody out there who has an action movie in the making... stop watch this movie and get a few tips before finalizing. Stallone you are a marvel and congratulations on this masterpiece.
10.0~Classic Action remingtonlmarkham Sign in Permalink Rambo is the manliest, grungiest film you will ever witness. What makes this film so exceptional is that everything depicted in the movie is happening in the real world right at this instant. Sylvester Stallone's rationale was to stir up awareness for Burma, if this movie does not give Burma attention then nothing ever will. The cinematography is tremendously well done so that you sense that you are there the entire time, yet you can still at all times tell what your looking at, not like other action films done in the same approach. The music is powerful and doesn't sidetrack you from the film; the acting is Stallone at his best. Whether this movie gets bad reviews or not, it will become a classic no doubt about it with its everlasting qualities.
10.0~An action movie! duegowop Sign in Permalink Cut the crap! The fixation on PG13 films and their potentional to be "block-busters" has ruined the industry. The 80's had the best action/horror movies of all time. Why? Because they provided us with what we really wanted. Unapalogetic(if thats a word), politically incorrect trash. Filled with boobs, graphic violence and exploitation. They didn't make a billion dollars but they left a mark. I don't want anything to do with the XXX or Tomb Raider franchises- I want real action. And yes, I want Rambo! Make no mistake. This movie is fun. Will it sweep the Oscars? No. But it's more fun than the English Patient. And it provides us with we really want- graphic violence, horrible bad guys, and a happy ending. Exactly what we want in American cinema. See this movie and enjoy! Thank you Sly
8.0~Let the bodies hit the floor! Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink "Rambo" establishes a new world record of limbs flying around. With an average of 2.59 killings per minute, of which some are also innocent civilians such as women and children, this has got to be one of the most violent movies ever made. But its not just the quantity that's amazing but also the quality of it all. Getting an arrow through your head apparently isn't enough, you also need to feel atop of a mine, that has to explode. Obviously "Rambo" is not a recommendable movie just to everyone. It actually makes quite sense though that this fourth Rambo movie installment is so incredibly violent. You have to remember that the first Rambo movie "First Blood" from 1982 was quite renewing and violent for its time. As the Rambo series progressed with "Rambo: First Blood Part II" and "Rambo III" the movie became more and more violent and actually daring for its time. They could had decided to do "Rambo" in the same style as its predecessors, which probably would had gotten them a good movie as well but instead they decided to keep pushing the envelope and see how far they could go now in the 21th century with its gore and violence. Rambo always had been a trend setter for action movies and with the fourth movie "Rambo" it continues to do so. Hard to say what it is that makes "Rambo" such a surprisingly fine movie. Perhaps because it shows balls and this movie is basically one big testosterone driven action flick, that will keep your adrenaline pumping throughout. It foremost is a real man movie and I can't imaging too many women enjoying this movie. But its also a movie of a great quality. The cinematography by Glen MacPherson gives the movie a gritty but beautiful look. But of course its mostly the action that impresses. It's extremely violent but its also done extremely well. Bodies and limbs are flying through the air, limbs are being shot and cut off and the movie features more exploding heads than several zombie movie flicks combined. The movie obviously has some professional stunt-work and pyrotechnics/special effects. Of course when you start analyzing the movie it simply is a very poor one with a very formulaic but also almost non-existent and developed story. It's just a movie you have to experience. This of course goes for most action movies but for this one even more than others. I just have a thing for over-the-top going movies. The Rambo movies are all an example of this, as well as the Rocky series, which also stars Sylvester Stallone in the main lead. Despite the fact that he already was well over 60 years old already at the time of shooting this movie, Sylvester Stallone is still convincing enough in his role of the iconic action hero Rambo. As the tag line says; 'Heroes never die.... They just reload.' Besides playing the title role, Stallone also directed the movie, making this the first Rambo movie that he directed. I think that the movie deliberately didn't cast any other 'big' names in it, in order to put the emphasis mainly on Stallone and his character. This is the way it also should be in my opinion. When you have a movie with a character such as Rambo in it, you basically don't need any other interesting characters anymore. Yes, it would had been great if Col. Trautman also had been in the movie, who always had been sort of Rambo's conscience but he isn't missed as much as some people would had expected and feared really. Of course the reason why he doesn't appear in this movie is because the actor Richard Crenna, who played the character in all of the previous Rambo movies, passed away in 2003. Jerry Goldsmith, the composer of all of the previous Rambo movies had also passed away, in 2004. His replacement for this movie is Brian Tyler, who's expertize is the action genre. He however did not forget Goldsmith's previous scores for the Rambo movies, which means that this movie features a lot of reprising themes, besides its new original compositions. Probably the most extreme and violent action movie you'll ever see. Clearly not a movie for just everyone but I really liked and appreciated the movie for what it did to raise the bar again within the action genre, just like the previous Rambo movies had done before in the '80's and '90's. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
3.0~What happened? fog-9 Sign in Permalink This movie is incredibly strange. Even the most pointless b-grade actioner has some feeling of purpose. I read the interviews about how this was supposed to convey the horror of war, etc. I'm just not getting it. From the comments, I gather many people feel showing the nitty gritty of genocide is going too far. I would disagree. Showing it in a Rambo movie, however, is unforgivable. This franchise is not the right platform to be making "serious" commentary on social issues. Rambo 4 fails to be an entertaining spectacle or a considered exploration of an important issue. It's just a short, utterly meaningless thing. With an absolutely absurd final set piece. It's terrible how a movie about genocide can be so unintentionally funny. How come everyone's head explodes when they get shot? Why is Rambo unintelligible? Why does he speak in empty platitudes? Why is the sound so bad on this movie? Why do missionaries go to help a fully functioning village with a few backpacks of stuff in a war zone? How ridiculous can an explosion and the subsequent running away be? I love the way Rambo kills in so many colourful ways. His profession at the start of the movie is awesome. As well as his boatman role. Awesomer and awesomer. Watching this movie is a bizarre experience, you really walk away going "What did I just witness?". It's one of the most unnecessary movies I've ever seen. I did laugh quite a bit though, so 3 stars seems about right.
5.0~Full of action, lacks a better sense.. xtian_durden Sign in Permalink Hey Rambo can't you stop killing people? Well I mean you've already killed like hundreds of them. Yeah, I know it's your right to waste them, they are the villains obviously, but it is so impossible that so many guns and bigger ones have been fired at you and still a bullet never once touched you, yeah maybe only once or twice but still impossible. What are you? Some kind of an immortal creature, because I know you're not, this isn't a movie about Superman. But let's appreciate the graphics put unto this movie, it's so brutally realistic that you can't eat a popcorn while watching those scenes. This movie is action-packed, enough to fill the hunger of every psychotic, vicious and violent action fans. But it lacks a good plot line, too quick to start a war. And I don't really like the supporting characters, too common. Yeah, all the action stuff is fun and entertaining but guys you need to put a little meaning to build at least a good movie. This isn't very bad nor good, mediocre maybe. There are more movies worse than this. Don't mind searching them.
8.0~I vote a solid B. barbequelighter Sign in Permalink Please note that this comment is from someone who hasn't seen the classics (Yeah, I'm deprived, I know). The movie was generally satisfying. The plot wasn't very sophisticated, but pft... it's Rambo. Excellent action, cinematography, yadda yadda. Stallone does his job. The stoicness of the character was believable and effective in driving the story. My only major complaint is that there wasn't a high enough revenge to rape ratio. If you're going to put something as powerful as rape into a movie, then you need to step up the retribution factor. There could have definitely been more hand to hand combat, for example. Said hand to hand could have fleshed out the 93 minute runtime and added more satisfaction in the end.
3.0~Oh my... Tim851 Sign in Permalink I haven't seen Rambo 3 in a while, so I can't be entirely sure if this is the Rambo film with the least amount of Plot. Rambo takes a couple of missionaries into Burma, they get abducted, he gets 'em back. That is really all that's happening. It's not that I expected a classical drama, but this one was supposed to bring the series back to its roots. Also, aside from porn, I've possible never seen a flick with that little dialog. Which is probably a good thing, since all characters are cartoonishly stereotyped. The only thing this movie has that stands out are shockingly realistic splatter scenes. The fighting itself is bullsh*t as always, with Rambo sporting the usual superhuman abilities. But anytime some projectile hits a body, oh my... It brings a level of realism to this clownfest of movie that feels totally inappropriate. As does the spray-tan war weariness of the protagonist. Looking unhappy while killing the sh*t out of Burma and showing lots of cruelty against women and children doesn't make a drama. Neither does all the effort from the special effects department. Unless you're of minor age, than you'll probably be so geared up by all the bleeding, you'll consider this a masterpiece. Lastly, the message of the film is essentially: humanitarians are idiot dreamers. If you really want to change the world, you simply have to kill all the evil people. Questionable, to say the least.
7.0~I Can't Believe It... silentassassin_15 Sign in Permalink I went into this thinking, "oh another Rambo film hours of pointless shooting and terrible acting." I came out amazed Sly has crafted a film that should (and I can't believe I'm saying this)of given him a nomination for an Oscar(why do I feel that my soul has left me?). Anyways I truly mean it sure there's all the killing and heads flying around, but aside that you can see the plight of the Burmese people. It's so wonderfully done that you cannot do anything but enjoy it. The acting isn't the best but at least the actors are actually trying. Go see this movie if you hate action movies trust me you'll be surprised. I always said that Sly could direct an amazing movie when pigs fly, now if you'll excuse me I have to genetically combine a pig and a goose.
9.0~The best of all the Rambo movies pauldoherty972 Sign in Permalink Stallone does a great job both acting and directing. This is the best of the entire series - watch it!
10.0~brilliant!! enzoferrari218 Sign in Permalink i remember seeing a trailer once on another website and thinking oh my, what a film we are in for, so i gathered a few friends and off we went to see it, firstly i was delighted to hear he'd kept all the original music which was just brilliant, so u get that real Rambo feeling right from the start, and the film doesn't drag out too like a lot of these big budget action films u see more of these days, this guy knows who he is, hes not running round trying to find out who he is, oh no, it starts steady and builds nicely in to an unbelievable pace of action and drama, i was a massive Rambo fan anyway, but of course along like a lot of other people i didn't want to see Stallone fall flat on his face running round with an oily body and a skimpy vest on in another so called flop of a film, the guy is in his 60s now, and hes still in brilliant shape, and he realises that he just doesn't need to run round in vests any more blowing everyone up, instead, he runs around in a tatty t-shirt blowing everyone up, but this time in a more believable and satisfying fashion, after seeing what the bad guys are up to this time, i loved this film, right to the point, no UN-realistic action sequences or plots, its just breathtaking!
8.0~Best of old and new JaydoDre Sign in Permalink I don't know what critics want from this movie. When I was a young kid I used to think Rambo movies were bad movies. I had not even watched that much of them, but I knew it was about a half naked guy firing a machine gun from the hip, killing a bunch of foreign bad guys, and the thought of how unrealistic and stupid that is kept a grimace on my face. Later, while my views on Rambo's artistic value were perhaps justified, I have come to understand and appreciate the adorable style that these movies consciously went for and for which guys liked them. Apart maybe from First Blood, these were the over-the-top stupid 80's macho action flicks and everyone was in on the joke. So when you hear that Rambo is back with another movie, what are you to expect? Probably a shallow excuse of a storyline that is needed only to place an oiled up Stallone and his over-sized machine gun into some poor 3rd world country where cartoonishly evil bad guys don't need an excuse to be mauled down for the remainder of the movie. What we got however, was much more than expected. Stallone, who has shown himself as a capable movie director, was now at the rudder and he improved the old formula of Rambo by mixing modern elements of angsty realism, and you know what, the two cultures mixed together perfectly. The story still feels like a placeholder for the action - some hostage rescue - but Stallone is serious about it. The movie engages in a discussion about naivety, faith, cynicism and righteousness. Frankly, I cannot say that it succeeds at that. It is just too short to both move the action along and discuss serious philosophy. Bottom line, the only thing I still remember is the action, and it is good. In a way, it is better than the old Rambo movies. The gritty realistic brutality fits Rambo more. It's like the new movie went all the way where the last couple of movies did not. It feels crisp, dark and...Rambo.
8.0~The insane return of Rambo! fistjedi Sign in Permalink Stallone brought back Rambo in a big (and gory) way! Rambo is living in Thailand, doing cool things like catching fish with a bow and arrows, capturing cobras and working out to keep an awesome looking physique. You know, manly things that I wish I could do so that I could have muscles(well, except for the cobra catching). Rambo minds his own business until these missionaries come to him asking to borrow his crappy boat so that they can help the natives in Burma. After some hesitation of sending them into a war zone (and the entreaties of one lady missionary), Rambo consents to this mission of mercy. On the way down the river, things get hairy, Rambo does his thing and gets the missionaries to their location. Then a few days later Rambo finds out that the missionaries got captured by some really bad military forces in Burma (who also kill, rape and terrorize innocent civilians for some demented reason). So our man is commissioned to take a group of mercenaries to try to get the missionaries out of harm's way. A whole lot of killing ensures. This movie kind of is a shock to the system, even if you have been watching gory action films for years (just because of how civilians are messed over). There is so much blood and gory scenes, you kind of wonder how in the world did Rambo manage to get an R rating. Stallone explained in an interview that he was trying to draw attention to the plight of civilians in war torn regions (especially Burma) and that is why he intensified the violence. I read on IMDb that freedom fighters in Burma fighting the corrupt regime quote lines from Rambo and bootleg copies circulate widely (despite the penalty of 10 years in jail for possessing a Rambo film, or so I heard.) Rambo was kind of too short (at 80 minutes) and ended in a weird but necessary way. I thought it was a good film, talked about some social issues and Rambo is back! I hope Rambo 5 comes soon.
8.0~We wanted 'old school' and we got it! mjscarface Sign in Permalink There's not an ounce of fat on 'Rambo', even the title has been trimmed down to the bare essentials. And just like the 'old school' action films of the 80s, there's a great feeling of "get in, do the job and get out". I had a blast watching the fourth Rambo film, which delivers exactly what it promised and never drags. Stallone is in great shape as John Rambo and his 'thousand yard stare' still works beautifully. For Rambo, living in isolation is never an option and once again, his talents and knowledge or sought out. Except this time, he has to simply escort a group of missionaries into Burma rather than go on a mission, single handed. With 'Rambo', the film always knows it's limits and works brilliantly within them. The early dialogue scenes are stilted, but this is solved by giving Rambo fewer lines that ever and letting his eyes do the talking. It's a credit to the film that we know the character so well that dialogue isn't needed for us to understand. Also, with Stallone at the age he is, it makes sense to scrap the one-man army idea and provide John with support. The mercs that show up don't hog the spotlight, but once they get stuck in, it's pretty cool. The thing that impressed me most was how streamlined the film was. It's quite short but leaves the viewer wanting more, which has to be a good thing. Also, there's no dip in the action. Once it starts, it just gets better and better until the fantastic finale. Make no mistake, there's plenty of 'Rambo moments' and I counted at least three occasions where the big guy turns up in the right place at crucial moments, when no one else would, which gets the viewer punching the air in glee! You've gotta admire Stallone here, he's thrown himself headlong into this project and given 100% to both addressing and depicting the atrocities in Burma and to filling the action void that's been leaving many of us without a real hero for years.
9.0~The only "PC" here is "plenty convulsing".... BigBabe0 Sign in Permalink Maybe it's just the mood I've been in lately, being fed up with the human race or at least those to whom I have to talk, but I was absolutely ready for a movie like this. My only qualm was that it wouldn't be gory ENOUGH, too few bodies. I needn't have worried: "Rambo" hits the cinematic nail on the head and then some. And no, Sylvester Stallone does not look "over the hill." He looks about the way you'd expect a grizzled sixty-year-old killing machine to look who hasn't spent the last decade or so drinking beer on the sofa. What Rambo has been doing lately, it seems, is hiding out in Thailand catching snakes and arrowing fish for a living. Stallone, who also co-wrote and directed, sets the tone early with some choice footage of atrocities committed by the Burmese military. (The real-life Burma--excuse me, Myanmar--is a perfect example of how a dictatorship can go on for years without being bothered by America: they simply have nothing we want. Keep Aung San Suu Kyi in house arrest forever? Shoot and club and tear-gas a few Buddhist monks and nuns in the streets? Never mind, we have other things to focus on, like colonizing oil-rich Iraq.) The world-weary Rambo gets a visit from some just-annoying-enough-without-being-caricatures Christian missionaries who want him to take them into hostile territory for humanitarian purposes. At first Rambo gruffly blows them off but then changes his mind after apparently taking a liking to the blonde female member of the group. Director Stallone wisely wastes no time on Hamlet-like indecision: one moment Rambo is frowning in the rain, the next they're en route up the river. When they encounter some "pirates," what ensues is pretty well predictable, but that's part of the pleasure of this kind of flick: the anticipation and then the fulfillment of it. "Like pornography?" you may say? Uh, yeah....So? If you don't like it, don't watch it. Those of us who like it, leave us alone. After the plucky do-good-ers inevitably get captured, Rambo joins a motley crew of mercenaries to go rescue them. These "dogs of war" seem just a little too "civilized" except for one scar-faced Brit SAS guy who has some of the best lines. But I guess we need to distinguish the "good guys" from the "bad guys," the Burmese. The rescue raid on the encampment nicely inter-cuts the action with a set-piece involving some female captives forced into giving a dance performance for the troops that quickly devolves into a gang-shag. From here on just sit back and enjoy the carnage. (This is one of the few movies I've seen in a theater that made me regret I couldn't have a beer with me.) I really admire Stallone for going "balls to the walls" with the violence and the language, in a current atmosphere where on any given weekend there may be one R-rated film in my area, if that. It's as though he's saying "I've had a long career, I've made lots of money, now I'm going to do what I want; you don't like it, too bad." The sequence where Rambo cuts loose with a .50-caliber machine gun alone is worth the price of admission; anyone who's had the chance to fire one of those knows what a rush it is. Stallone even has Rambo "pull a Sonny Chiba" in one scene (if you've seen "Street Fighter," you know what I mean). "Rambo" looks great, too; Stallone has learned well what Spielberg pioneered in "Saving Private Ryan." I even forgive him the occasional "arty" touch, like having flames reflected in the villain's sunglasses. So, do I have any quibbles? Not really--I got what I paid for, and I'll probably see it again next weekend and enjoy it just as much or more. Sure, it would've been fun if Stallone had tossed in a reference to Blackwater USA, and the ending with Rambo walking back to his father's ranch in Arizona seems an anti-climax, but if this does well at the box office, why not leave open the possibility of another one? I admit that when the few remaining "leading men" in cinema who are older than I am show they can still kick some ass, I'll come to see 'm do it so long as it has an R rating---sorry, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones again (I'll be shocked if that's not rated PG-13)....For those who crave sex with their violence: sorry, it only gets hinted at, which again I'd expected.... Possible favorite moment: when the most egregiously pious of the missionaries (who earlier had chided Rambo for killing the pirates even though it kept the blonde from getting raped) reverts to visceral mode and whacks somebody to death in the heat of battle. "There are no atheists in foxholes," I've heard, but I doubt there are many volunteer martyrs either...
9.0~Rambo......unhomogenized and raw johnfmiller3 Sign in Permalink If your looking for this to take off where Rambo III left off .......think again....this is a different,older and more somber Rambo in the 00's with Saving Private Ryan/Normandy Beach scene-type violence...extreme violence! Way more serious....hardly any humor or snappy one-liners at all....if any......in fact very sad and disgustingly sadistic the bad guys are in this.....an army of Burmese revolutionaries...real bastards!! The 80's cheeseball stuff gets left at the front gate...very violent and very serious.........I'm gonna see this again in the theater. This is fantastic,violent cinema....and boy do the bad guys get it!!! Stallone should direct more in this fashion....with more realistic violence and less out-of-place humor........Rambo 2008 kicks butt!!!
7.0~the perfect goodbye for a decent franchise rockorbe2002 Sign in Permalink i have to agree. this movie did have a crapload of violence that parents SHOULD definitely consider passing up this flick for the sake of their children. for the rest of us, you'll get a big dose of shooting and blood and guts. if you treat it for what it is, it's a very good action flick. the storyline is quite weak though, since it's very predictable what's gonna happen to those missionaries. this one is not as quite as good as rambo III (my favorite in the series) but gives first blood a run for its money and clearly outperforms first blood II. highly recommended if you have blu-ray and a decent size plasma or hdtv.
10.0~Incredibly ispirational story of fighting till the end and standing up for the innocent and defenceless robertbisceglia Sign in Permalink More soldiers and really everybody needs to aspire to be like rambo. The crimes depicted in the film are heinous and evil and they are met with equal force and violence from the side of light and god. And at the end of the day light drove out darkness but with casualities sadly.
10.0~Finally, a real action film... e_newman Sign in Permalink Rambo Rocks!! This movie gets eleven stars- out of five. Not a movie your wife is going to want to sit through and watch, nor should she; nor should you want her to. This is strictly for the eleven year old in you that got a thrill out of 80's brain-matter splatter, simply because it was brain-matter splatter. If you're an 80's kid, you'll like Rambo. If you were even remotely a fan of the original movie saga, then this is equal to the original movie saga- but on steroids, and heroine, and meth, and Twinkies, and barbiturates- after a good workout. It's the best Stallone action flick since 'Cobra'. Complete with crazy steroid muscles; close-ups of his classic Italian snarly lip; gritty, crackling, muffled one-liners; the pointless bandana tied around his head; a British guy; and a high powered, high caliber stationary turret gun that is able to chop Vietcong into itty-bitty pieces, right after they rape a few women at a rape party in the jungle. I watched this movie on my knees, on our shag carpet- in front of our floor model TV last night, eating fruit roll ups with a few He-Man action figures spread out on the floor for good measure- plucking at the asbestos/plastic feet in my GI-Joe pajamas. This movie was that good. I can't even tell you what it was about- because I don't know! I just know John Rambo mowed through about 650 Vietcong rebels with one gun, and had a sniper buddy exploding people's heads through the infra-red, night vision lens of a rifle that had to be about eleven feet long. AWESOME! And he saves some people. Eleven out of five stars. Woulda' been ten out of five stars, but HERE COMES THE FLAME THROWER!!! I haven't seen one of those since Lethal Weapon 3!! Does it get any more awesome than a flame thrower!!!? I thought they disproved the existence of such a weapon!! But nope!! There's a flame thrower in this movie!!! I need another Rambo movie, STAT!!!
9.0~Bloody Action Movie slayer68 Sign in Permalink Alright let me start off as adding to other comments that it is not a good date movie as unless she is into extreme violence be prepared to leave early with her or get yelled at later. Okay this is a great action movie not much of a story line kind of like a good porno do we really care about the story line hell now get to the action. So here it is the whole plot, okay do not go to Burma, no our church group can help, no you cannot all they do is get taken after Rambo takes them to the village well close to the village, he rescues them with an elite groups of mercenaries that is your story and a hell of a lot of blood and guts many damn that was a jacked up explosions will be said as well as a few laughs along the way. Will I buy it on DVD yes but only high def as the action is sweet.
10.0~THE Action Movie for the New Millennium rcvincelli Sign in Permalink Let me get this out of the way right off the bat: Rambo is one of the very best action movies I have ever seen, and at fifty years of age, and an action movie buff, I've seen a lot of 'em over the years. Say what you well about Sylvester Stallone, but in Rambo, he has crafted a action film for the new millennium. It may very well be the most violent movie ever made...in fact, forget that...this IS the most violent movie ever made, but it's a pure adrenaline rush, and a spectacle of technical efficiency to behold. So be warned, this movie is not for the faint of heart...or for anyone easily disturbed by realistic, graphic violence. The other Rambo films, even Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, are Bambi compared to this. But the most surprising, in fact, shocking, aspect of this movie, is how truly well made it is. Stallone's work behind the camera is exemplary. The cinematography first rate...even the acting, and I mean each and every actor...from the extras, most of whom get blown to pieces, to the baddies and the mercenaries, up to and including Sly himself, as our monolithic, mono-syllabic, monochromatic hero, John Rambo, are virtually flawless. Stallone obviously knows how to get the most out of his actors. It's all very impressive. Even the script, and dialogue, aren't that bad, usually a MAJOR drawback to watching any Stallone film. But here he actually has SOMETHING to say, and he screams it out at the top of his considerable lungs. Using the real life atrocities of the Burma (now Myanmar) conflict as a backdrop for the on-screen violence, Stallone knows how to get the viewers blood boiling. And that realism has a way of buffering the on-screen carnage. To an extent. The graphic realism of the extreme violence is enhanced by the use of actual video footage of the crimes being committed against the people of Burma in the opening sequence: Brutal gang rapes, torture, be-headings...no stone is unturned here...even depicting the top baddie as a homosexual pedophile...Stallone leaves ALL the rules at the box office door. Many will undoubtedly regard this as simply gratuitous pandering to the masses, and I suppose it is, but once again, he is trying to make a point. It's just a movie, to be sure, but combining the well-documented real life trauma of the Burmese people with the graphic imagery, it's hard to write this off as pure exploitation of the medium. This isn't Rocky, or any of the other Rambo films...it's Rambo squared. Sure, it's as bold-stroked as a kindergarten finger painting, and the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined as in a corner store comic book, but it's all done so professionally it's hard not to be impressed with Stallone's achievement. On a personal level, it's also one of the very few films I've watched back-to-back, in some very elite company. The few films I've watched back-to-back include Pink Floyd: The Wall, Jacob's Ladder, The Sand Pebbles and The Professional. The use of violence is technically more accurate than most movies I have ever seen...the Claymore, what happens when a human being is shot with a 50 caliber machine gun...it's all so realistic. As for the story, I usually don't give much away, but this time I will break tradition. John Rambo has 'retired' and lives in Thailand. He makes a living captaining a boat and capturing Cobras and other snakes and selling them to a nearby village for the sake of entertaining tourists. Then one day he is approached by a group of Christian missionaries trying to help Burmese civilians in dire need medical assistance. Of course, after initially declining, he takes this group of clueless, yet well-meaning Christians up the river to Burma, and the missionaries are soon captured. Soon after the the leader of the church, based in Colorado, subsequently comes to Rambo asking for his assistance in leading a group of mercenaries up river to get his people out alive...if in fact they are still alive. After initially being shunned by the mercenaries, Rambo soon joins in...via bow-and-arrow. Leave the rest to your imagination...if you have the imagination of Saddam Hussein on acid. Some of the dialogue is actually quite amusing in it's appalling realism. For example, when the British leader of the mercenaries is about to be executed, he spews some of the more vulgar language ever exhibited in any film ever made. And yet it's totally believable. WELL DONE SLY!! Sylvester Stallone himself is a spectacle to behold. What a marvel he is...a physical specimen that should be donated to the Smithsonian for research after his death...if he ever dies. Although Sly doesn't take his shirt off in this one, he is still a man among men. But after all, he's not human. He's Rambo. I mean, he's Sly Stallone, now a gifted filmmaker, and a beast of epic proportion. Enjoy this film if you can. I certainly did.
8.0~Un-apologizing action film tomimt Sign in Permalink Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is leading a quiet life some where in Thailand. One day a group of missionaries come to him and ask, if he could ferry them to Burma in order to relive the pain of inhuman war with bibles and medicine. Rambo really doesn't want to take them there, but he does that none the less. Later Rambo is hired to get the missionaries back, as they got captured. The plot of Rambo isn't any high literature. It's just as simple and plain it sounds: a rescue mission with Rambo on the lead. Through out the film Rambo does, what he does best: kills people. And this time he does it bloodier than ever. Blood, guts and limbs fly all over the place and there's no hint of splatter comedy in that. It actually finally looks like someone is portraying the gun damage right this time. When a mortar round hits a man, he just doesn't flip around in the air, but disappears in a bloody cloud. Stallone has managed to direct very good sequel for Rambo. It's interesting and exiting. And the action is top notch. This certainly isn't an action film for everyone, but if you like a bit of old school, but with better effects, you just might enjoy this. I know I did. And it certainly is a better film than parts 2 and 3.
2.0~If it's possible to make a dumber movie... let me know, okay? Hancock_the_Superb Sign in Permalink John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is still, after all these years, an embittered man who can't forget and move on from his traumatic 'Nam experiences. Living in Thailand and working as, I dunno, a boat man or something, he reluctantly aids a group of pacifist Christian mercenaries (Julie Benz and Paul Schulze) in a trip to war-torn Myanmar to aid victims of the government repression. Low and behold, our misguided missionaries are soon captives of the vicious, evil, rapacious government troops (who love nothing more than cutting off old lady's arms and throwing babies into fire) who for some reason don't kill them. Rambo makes another trip, this time accompanied by a team of loud-mouthed but largely ineffectual and wimpy mercenaries. Long story short: bullets and arrows fly, entrails are ripped out, the screen is spattered with ridiculous CGI-augmented gore, and all is right with the world. Sly Stallone returns, older, tougher and more incomprehensible than ever, in the latest installment of the Rambo franchise. Exactly what Sly thinks he's accomplishing by rehashing the hits of his halcyon youth is beyond me - but clearly, there's something of an audience for these films, so why not? While Rocky Balboa was at least mildly diverting, re-capturing some of the spirit of the original, Rambo is a blood-soaked, utterly brainless film with nothing to offer but loads of CGI-aided ultra-violence. There really isn't much to discuss with Rambo. The first three films at least had some message or characterization, even if they were cheesy at times. But this time, clocking it at barely 90 minutes (10 of them are credits), the movie neatly dispenses with character and plot, and focuses entirely on the blood-'n'-guts factor. The violence here is ridiculously extreme - Rambo rips out people's windpipes and entrails, heads explode, bodies are lacerated by .50 machine-gun fire, Burmese are raped and mutilated, people are blowed up by mortar rounds, grenades, and claymores - and it's not even realistic or enjoyable because most of it is augmented by CGI. Stallone's direction is horridly inept, using rapid cutting that would make Michael Bay have a seizure, not to mention making the scenes in question near-impossible to follow. What about our characters? Rambo is the same epigrammatic anti-social scoundrel who kills people more or less because he's good at it. The missionaries are whiny wimps who are apparently here to show that pacifism sucks. The mercenaries are a slightly more colorful bunch, with Graham McTavish fun as their inventively profane leader, but they are effectively impotent clods who contribute nothing to Rambo's mission but a lot of profanity and whining (and more people to rescue at the climax). The Burmese, be they victims or victimizers, don't have even pathetic attempts at characterizations, although we do learn that the Evil Leader (Maung Maung Khin) is gay. It's just impossible to take any of these seriously, but it's not even entertaining on a base, "look at these people getting machine gunned" way. It's just pathetic, though a few unintentional laughs may be had along the way. Is the movie somehow important because it deals with a real-life situation - the repressive regime of Than Shwe? Hardly. It's done in such a cartoonish, tertiary way that it overlooks the point. And in any case, there's no real attempt to exploring the issue - it's just a backdrop. This movie could have been set anywhere - Darfur, Tibet, even Iraq - and been largely the same film. The Burmese army are pretty much more faceless dudes for Rambo to waste. Rambo's "violence solves everything" policy is a bit hard to swallow too, but then no one comes to these films for the politics (I hope). What more can be said about Rambo? Even Michael Bay and Uwe Boll would find it incoherent and poorly made. Even Quentin Tarantino would find it excessively, ridiculously violent. Even Keanu Reeves and Chuck Norris would laugh at Sly's excuse for a performance. Even Aung San Suu Kyi would find the portrayal of the Burmese government laughably over-the-top. Even Paul Wolfowitz would probably blanch at the thick-headed bellicosity displayed in Rambo's style of foreign policy. And even fans of 300 would find the movie cartoonish and ridiculous. Well, on that last count... maybe not. 2/10
8.0~Greater than expected Dragoneyed363 Sign in Permalink I honestly have to say that I was not expecting much from Rambo at all. It just looked like something that did not fit my tastes in a film, and I was in no hurry to watch this movie. While I will say this movie got downright disturbing and gruesome at times, that was why it was an entertaining and cool film. I have not seen the other Rambos before this one, and now I'm actually interested in seeing them, because this film was so good! The action was awesome, even though I felt like ripping my eyes out from what happened in the film at times, and the acting was top-notch. The script was interesting, and the story flowed steadily without any flaws. This was a really good movie, but I wouldn't recommend it, considering I haven't seen the ones before this film and do not know if it does them justice.
8.0~Kick ass tigerstar154 Sign in Permalink Rambo 4 Sylvester Stallone after taking a long hiatus with the Rambo series, has come back...Reloaded. The Pluses: the action scenes, Sylvester Stallone, The locations and the supporting female lady from Dexter The Minuses: The cruelty scenes and the violence may not be well for the weak hearts. Overall, Rambo 4 is a great action film if you feel like watching Stallone killing Asians. Btw, this does happen not just in Burma, but in places all over.
3.0~Ram Your Head into the Wall! anaconda-40658 Sign in Permalink Rambo (2008): Dir: Sylvester Stallone / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Julie Benz, Paul Schulze, Matthew Marsden, Ken Howard: More blam, blam, bang, bang, pow wow, ka-boom! Should this be any surprise? Should we expect something a tad more ambitious? It would certainly help. This time out a group of missionaries fail to heed John Rambo's warnings about venturing into hostile territory and as a result he must engage in combat because these morons didn't listen. Sylvester Stallone directs and rightly so for he presents back to back action of exploding bodies. He was far more successful with Rocky Balboa, which was surprisingly a terrific film. It is unfortunate that he couldn't improve on this franchise. As Rambo he appears tired of taking the back door to the pleasures in life to engage in combat. There is nothing new to the role. He beats the crap out of some bad guys and he guns down others, and we could care less. Julie Benz, Paul Schulze and Matthew Marsden play total airheads who think they know more than a guy who has spent most of his life brandishing a machine gun. Perhaps they haven't seen the previous films. Ken Howard plays a pastor seeking Rambo's help. None of this matters as it really boils down to pointless action violence. The production is effective but it had more work go into it than the screenplay, which itself should have been used as target practice. Score: 3 / 10
10.0~Powerful and worth the $$$ todd-mckenzie Sign in Permalink WOW!! I went and saw Rambo with very high expectation, and was I ever impressed!! Stallone, did a great job on Rocky and topped it with Rambo. There was a lot of violence, but it portrayed some of the real issues that some countries face today. There was some powerful scenes in the movie and for those who have watched it, you know which ones I mean. The supporting cast was chosen perfectly to a tee. If you are looking to see some action with some powerful dialect, go and have a blast. This was probably one of the few movies that I felt that I got more then my money's worth! If you are thinking about seeing it, do yourself a favor...and go...you will not regret it! Stallone is in top form! 10/10
6.0~Good Thrill Ride...But Still Just a Rambo Movie rtsmith555 Sign in Permalink If you're like me (and obviously tons of others on here) and liked all of the Rambo movies the first time you saw them and maybe not so much the second time, this one is worth seeing--once. The Bad (Not So Bad): It's definitely not an upgrade from any previous Rambo installment; it's just the next one (or possibly the last??). The dialog is very 'Stallone-esque' (lots of cheesy tag lines that sometimes hit and sometimes miss) but tolerable if you keep your expectations realistic (again, it's a Stallone movie). The character development is pretty poor with the main character jumping into a trusting relationship w/ the female lead the instant he makes eye contact without any real explanation as to why. The chemistry between these two was virtually non-existent, but this was probably due to just poor writing more so than casting issues. You could have replaced Stallone with (pick your favorite male actor) and none of the scenes between these two characters would have stood a chance. This may have also been a product of the very fast pace of the film as it really jumps right into the action, but it wasn't a very long movie so they could have done it a little more justice by making it somewhat believable. I think they did a better job with this in First Blood (OK...I didn't say a 'perfect' job). The Good: Still, even with the flaws above, I really enjoyed this flick. I'm not much of a blood and guts fan, but this team really put together a shocking and graphic representation of war with all of the 'bits and pieces.' I was smiling in amazement of how realistic everything looked and ashamed at the same time for grinning at something so violent. Forget 'Hamburger Hill' and 'Saving Private Ryan,' Rambo takes the cake for carnage. Believe me though, it's more of a testosterone-induced roller coaster ride than a politically-charged social commentary. You don't walk out of the theatre feeling depressed and self-reflective, but rather justified in even the most flawed of your masculine attributes and ready to kick some butt. Isn't that what action movies are all about?
10.0~Incredible!!! acozzens Sign in Permalink This is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. I loved all the other Rambo films and this one just topped them all. Stallone at his all time best! If you love action, Hardcore gunfighting and a hell of a lot of Explosions this is the film for you! I give Rambo a 10 out of 10 for pure action, adrenaline, and some of the best acting by a rather unknown cast! This is a must see film! If you leave the theater unsatisfied you must be dead! From start to finish this movie grips you and engulfs you in the action. Stallone is RAMBO and will always be! This is a movie you don't want to miss this film will get your heart pumping, and your blood boiling go out and watch this incredible film you will not leave the theater unsatisfied!
10.0~Blood, Guts, Gore, and More! TomDeans55 Sign in Permalink My personal favorite part(spoiler): when Rambo purees this guy from point blank with a .50 cal mounted turret. They got it right this time, by not trying too hard to give it a story, they let the action do the talking. When i say this is the bloodiest movie i've ever seen, I mean it. This violence is not stylized like kill bill or sin city, this is highly realistic violence. The basic story is similar to First Blood Part II, sending Rambo to rescue some weaklings or whatever and he kills a whole bunch of people on the way. Believe it or not there is a moral in this one. (spoiler) In the end when the leader of the missionaries bashes that Burmese Soldier's head in with a rock, it shows the total transformation from the beginning when he told Rambo that killing is never OK. It shows the loss of humanity in war. OK i actually just read that in some Stallone interview, i didn't actually get any moral from this movie except that "killing is as easy as breathing." Heck yea.
9.0~Stallone has made a film like few others can baumer Sign in Permalink First Blood and Rambo are two of the best action films ever made and even Rambo III is good. Stallone's interpretation of Rambo is that of a reluctant hero. He really never wanted to be in the situation he was thrust into, but once there, he cannot deny who that man is, and that is none other than a killing machine. In the commentary for First Blood, by Stallone himself, he admits that Rambo is a man that can't help who he is. He doesn't start wars or confrontations, but he sure as hell excels in the situation. This RAMBO is no different. Just as Rocky told Adrian in Rocky IV you can't change who you are. Rambo is no different. He wants to live peacefully, and for 20 years he might have been, but that time has passed. Burma/Myanmar is about to learn that. The first five minutes establishes the tone of the film, and within those first five minutes, you will know if this is the film for you or not. I hate to sound like everyone else, but this is the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but for the entire 90 minutes. There is enough carnage in here to make even the toughest individual cover their eyes once or twice. I remember as a kid, I thought it was tough to watch Rambo get the knife across his chest in the flashback scene in First Blood. If that was a scene in here, it would be the tame by the standards the movie sets. We instantly witness limbs and heads flying everywhere. There are humans being fed to pigs, still alive. Women are raped, kids and forced to play "mine games" and when someone gets an arm or a leg chopped off, it is as graphic as can be. I don't think Stallone was aiming for gratuitous violence here, but realism. When you see films like Blood Diamond, Hotel Rwanda and others of the same ilk, it reminds you that there are conflicts taking place in many places in the world, and if it doesn't benefit the Unite States to get involved, if there is no oil to steal or money to be made, then no one hears about it. We all know about Afghanistan and Iraq because the U.S. has interest there, but no one cares about a bunch of Burmese people being slaughtered by a government army. Stallone makes you care. The Christain missionaries that arrive at the scene provide the canvas to paint the picture with, but with or without them, it doesn't change the fact that the realistic violence perpetrated by the thugs in this movie happens. Read page 22 of any North American paper and you'll get a tiny blurb about mass graves indicating some kind of ethnic Holocaust. Rambo makes this front and center. I don't want to give you the impression that this another JFK or Platoon, because it is not. This is simply one of the best action films I have ever seen and Stallone shows once again that he is an action aficionado behind the camera. I'm not sure many others could make a film like this. The action is tense, frenetic and unapologetic. Although we haven't seen a Rambo film in 20 years, Stallone doesn't skip a beat. Besides the action, Stallone is also excellent in here as the quiet hero. While he wrestles with who he is, once he accepts that, all hell breaks loose. I have always thought Stallone was such an under rated actor, and in spite of all the myopic critics diatribes about him, he can act. Rambo might not on par with Stallone' performance in Rocky or Copland, but he hits every note he needs to here. He is a man of few words, but his actions speak louder than any David Mamet ( no disrespect to Mamet, I love his work) script could. There are some very nice touches here as some of the music is straight from Jerry Goldsmith's vault and there is a nice homage to First Blood, where it all began, when he wears the same jacket as he did when we first see him in the original. Rambo is a great action film, in fact one of the best in recent memory. This is one that all action fans should give a chance. I was entertained for every second and there is even a sad message in the film. Rambo is worth your time. Sly has done it once again. 9/10
5.0~Not good, but not all that bad BlazLampreht Sign in Permalink Well , I was really eager to watch Rambo IV, because I liked the first three. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. Not so much with the background of the movie, than with the main character. I mean, he is an old man for Christ's sake, he shouldn't be playing roles that involve fast running, jumping, etc. Sooner or later he's going to hurt his knees or something. Not to mention his long black hair that really do not fit his old face. But enough badmouthing of the star of the film. The movie was not all that bad. The special effects were something of a joy to watch. Bullets tearing the limbs of a body, blood squirting all over the place. The story was fine at most, but you cannot expect an Oscar winning story from a film such as Rambo. I just wish they would have considered cutting Stallone's hair and leaving it a little grayish. It would have been a hell of a lot more realistic.
3.0~Hardly a movie Dexter-Filmore Sign in Permalink Going to cinema I expect to see a movie. Now a movie usually has to have some key elements, a plot for example. Even a simple plot will do when the genre calls for it, but "simple" and "tinkered on because someone thought this better have something like a plot, too" still make a difference. And that's pretty much what we get here: During watching this solid shot jungle massacre nothing else happens. People get massacred. That's about it. Even the unwillingly comic Rambo 3 tried to tell about the fate of the people of Afghanistan, how the outsider Rambo walks in and sees a part of himself there, about loyalty regarding Trautman etc. Rambo has no such elements. The characters do not develop, they are just put in place because they need to serve the purpose of leading to the next scene, goes for both parties. Trying to pull the the-world-needs-to-see-this-string about the Burmese people looks a lot like Monterastelli and Stallone sat together and said "oh, about the setting, we pick some war zone country were some farmers are roughed up and killed on a regular basis by some army oppressors, any will do." If you want to see a grade A massacre with lots of blood, gore, decapitation, people blown up, seeing through gun shot wounds and whatnot this is definitely a film you wanna watch. If like the old 80s/90s mixtures of action, violence, story, border of credibility pushed repeatedly and hard-boiled anti-heroes turning semi-god, better cram out "First Blood".
8.0~Very good action movie twofold420 Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone is back as John Rambo in this bloody action-packed extravaganza. As an action movie it holds its own as the action is unrelentless and entertaining. The movie opens with some disturbing images of a genocide-torn Burma during news coverage, and those disturbing images don't stop there whatsoever. This movie almost got the dreaded NC-17 rating, but the appeals process to the MPAA gave it an R instead. It shows a more realistic war violence. The plot is almost nonexistent, but who really cares, it's an ACTION movie! All anybody should expect going into this is to see Sylvester Stallone kick some butt, and that he does. Anyway, a relief group gets captured by the evil Burmese army, and Rambo sets out to free them with a bunch of mercenaries -- a good enough excuse for the mindless, bloody action as any. Actually in all reality, I like how this movie just stuck with action instead of trying to make some point or fit the director's political agenda. If it had any message at all, I guess it would be that genocide is bad, well duh. Also, it doesn't try to be funny and fail like "Armageddon." So if you're looking for a good action flick, why not give this one a shot; you could do much, much worse.
6.0~Lots of fun kakoilija Sign in Permalink Haha laughed through the movie. It was lots of fun. I can't remember a film that was just gory, and I left the theater laughing =D So funny... Not like an excellent movie, but definitely worth going to the MOVIES! I got not much more to say... Actually I have to say more since the 10 line rule... NOTE NOT CONNECTED TO RAMBO I've been to Myanmar (x-burma), and gotta say... that it is one of the poorest places on earth. Yes they do have a military dictatorship,... I don't still think that boycotting them will do much good for the people of Myanmar... I mean most people (and our guide was very anti military). Most regular people live by doing very marvelous craft by hand... hope things get better there =/
8.0~Rambo is back! crukeg Sign in Permalink One worry i had about this movie would be that Stallone would turn it too somber and tame. How wrong i was. He gets straight to the action and never lets go. Rambo is an intense and visceral experience. Set many years after the previous instalment, Rambo is now living in a quiet village down the river from Burma. He collects snakes for a local serpent shop. His quiet life is turned upside down when a group of Christian aid workers come to him to ask to use his boat. He is initially reluctant but eventually agrees. They need to get into Burma. Burma is portrayed as a wretched, war torn place. People are viciously murdered and tortured by the military. The aid workers wish to bring food and shelter to the people, and to help them escape the savagery. The Aid workers are kidnapped and tortured by the military. And of course it is up to Rambo to save the day. It isn't perfect. Rambo has very little plot to engage in and what plot it does have is ruined by it's predictability. The action, however is extraordinary. Stallone serves up an adrenaline rush of gore guns and death. Rambo runs through the woods, plants bombs, fires guns and mercilessly kills. It is basically the same movie as 2 and 3 except it has one moral message. It is about a war soldier coming to terms with what his life's purpose is; to kick ass. Perhaps that's why i enjoyed it so much
10.0~An Excellent Bookend to the Series. Sly has Scored Yet Another Masterpiece! mcdsweet98 Sign in Permalink Forget all the negativity! If you happen to be on Yahoo! Movies, just believe what the users say and not those critics who are so negative about this film are blatantly being dishonest. Ppl were clapping at the end of the film. I won't reveal much but in short, all I can say is, this final Rambo is the best of the series, it's got perfect story, perfect casts, excellent action; very very Rambo-ish, superb ending (to those of you who seen it, you know what i am talking about), It's not all about mindless action, this movie has got every aspect that you would want in a film, heart and soul. With that I say a full 5 stars to RAMBO. To those who'd think there would be a 5th Rambo, go watch the film and judge for yourself if you would want a sequel. From my side, I think the 4th Rambo had properly wrapped the entire series.
1.0~Silence is golden. RetroRick Sign in Permalink Really can't see what's different or new about this instalment of the series. All the Rambo films involve him slowly revealing just how much of a badass superelite soldier he is, yet in this film apart from showing strong leadership skills and an aversion to any kind of poetry in death, he does very little that anyone of us who's ever played a First Person Shooter computer game would be very impressed with. Who amongst us couldn't kill loads of generic enemy soldiers with a heavy machine gun. No, the only really impressive thing about him is the endless silences every time anyone asks him a question. Just ignoring people is the very essence of power. That is unless as I suspect the whole time he is trying to think of a really clever response but can't and just decides to say nothing at all. In fact I think if you re-examine all the Rambo films that is exactly what always happens. He'd like to be able to say something clever, he tries really hard to think of something clever to say; he realizes he can't, so he shoots & kills. Not great for character development. There is none in fact, beyond one Christian espousing pacifism one moment before seeing the light and pounding out someones brains with a rock the next. Indeed watching this film is a little bit like doing the same for yourself only with a dense piece of celluloid instead.
7.0~Challenging lastostadas Sign in Permalink John Rambo is a piece of controversial art in the manner 'Apocalytica' or 'Saving private Ryan' are with brutal and shocking footage and gory scenes. For here, Sylvester Stallone reopens the debate about how far must an artist go to impact and in the same way respect his audience. But where is the limit to it? The old Rambo has died to give birth to anew hero, more sinister, merciless, coarser and bolder than ever. The John James Rambo looking for an opportunity in life among his fellow men is no more. And with him have disappeared the funny quotes, pioneering clichés and a straight play from Stallone which brought him fans from all over the world including myself. But even if the new Rambo only takes life when he kills more than 5 Burmese soldiers in a row, this film runs away from the fancy-like situations of it's prequels and shows us what war really is and how it goes in many parts of the world at this very moment. It's admirable that one of the most charismatic and famous personalities of the Hollywood industry can come up with a film that reaps apart any big business convention of how films should be, to be at least bearable for all the happy consuming blockbuster families across the globe. As orgasmic must be the blast of blood and gore for the fans of the genre the morality here is that war sucks, and that war heroes are ugly and grim men, nothing knew under the sun, but Rambo had to say it. A simple film with brilliant effects, ad hoc dialogs, and well produced in overall. Yet, the fate of Rambo remains unclear (as always). Not for the faint of heart. 7/10
10.0~Sly has done it again and proved he is the king of action tonystalloney Sign in Permalink where do i begin.... OK most of you know the story so i wont repeat it. After sending an email last week to get some tickets to a screening in London, i waited and got no reply. But finally someone i work with came up to me holding 2 tickets and asked if i wanted to go, and off i went. Sly was great, i cant believe he pulled it out of the bag again, easily my 2nd best Rambo after the 1st. Some say he took a back seat, yes & no, he done what he had to do, and it was truly powerful and amazing. The cgi used cutaway just right, the mercenaries were great, the ending, well, all i will say is Sly has aged really well. Stunts were kept realistic, and what Sly has done here for the character of Rambo is truly great, he made Rambo less of a cartoon character, & more iconic, more of a hard ass, and it threw me at first the way Rambo was kinda of like "screw everything", which made it funny, but at the same time presented a different kind of Rambo which was pleasurable. Out of Rocky & Rambo i must say i prefer Rambo, and my expectations were met, yes more hand to hand would of been nice, but the movie just flowed so beautifully & is more realistic for it, truly amazing. Sly has reinvented the action movie and Rambo has grown up and is taking no crap. The movie goers have spoken, this is what movies are about, and not forgetting the horrors that are happening in Burma, Sly has addressed and informed us without being preachy. Well done Sly.
8.0~A Classic Rambo Action, No Suprizes a fun Hour and 20 minutes of killing frankzare Sign in Permalink Don't expect a classic movie, don't expect a huge story line, it's another action pack Rambo movie. I'm a big fan of Sylvester Stallone since childhood and honestly this movie was a great trip back to the old times. The action was BLOODY.. and real!! that's how people die and get shot not like your typical Rated PG movies. not much of a story line since it's only an hour 22 minutes long. Acting was decent, the action was amazing... some people thought too bloody but come on that's what you had to expect from a Rambo Movie. People forget the scene was in nasty sweaty humid southeast Asia and it ain't suppose to be a high tech type of movie. in conclusion, definitely a fun action movie and it's good to see Sylvester Stallone back in action after a while. Keep on Rockin Brothaaa... you're never old! :)
10.0~Very good!!!Norse_Sage Arise the vote!!! robertofuiano Sign in Permalink I am sure that among the 1-year voting will decline to 7.1, when people are fixed with bias and with the passive film and very difficult to make change my mind. good action movie, much more realistic than previous years. TING SY sided with the Americans, has a great soundtrack, great art and a great realism. horrific pictures showing the assault of the Burmese army against the Karen village. Now the site spotted the same process that I saw Indiana Jones, a vote with the passage of time CAA. Only the Best for intellectuals have high marks. My vote is 10, beautiful, beautiful film. INCREASED THE VOTE, stingy! Beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it. Who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer SAMPAT GO AWAY.
10.0~Greatest movie ever made, Period nazology Sign in Permalink As a movie critic it is not possible to rate this movie with "Stars". You must rate it 5 " Galaxies" or 5 "Solar Systems". By far the best action movie ever created, combine all action movies ever and they don't come close. Sly has raised the bar again. Rambo lives! The start of this movie sets the tone when you see what's going on in Burma. Everything about this movie was portrayed perfectly. Hats off to all of the actors who contributed. From the Army to the Peace workers you really get a true feeling of what things are really like in the world. John Rambo is a sleeping giant, and though the movie is intense throughout it jumps to another level when Rambo realizes what he is and comes to accept it. From that point on, the massacre begins.
9.0~Go and see this with no expectations and be blown away deadman71 Sign in Permalink It's been a long time since I have been so surprised with a movie like I was with this. I expected it to be cheesy and full of sentiment like so many movies are now. It's not. It is brutal, violent and uncompromising but this is to show the horrors which are happening today. The direction and acting on this film are great, not going to win an Oscar but believable performances with direction which shows talent. This film is not for the squeamish but I recommend it wholeheartedly. It's good to see that First Blood (which in my opinion is a classic) has a worthy successor.
10.0~Live for Rambo or Die For Stallone xebec_roy Sign in Permalink Let's genuflect.Let's pay tribute to a man who has portrayed the best Action Hero ever.John J Rambo."Don't Argue-Destroy".Sometimes destruction has to be seen from a positive perspective.When you face intolerable cruelty,you have to mete out horror.When you are pushed "Killing is as easy as Breathing".The Gore is the movie is not glorified,it is true to the context.Stallone,at 62,exudes such extreme rage,such messianic intensity,you stare transfixed.And the brutality which Rambo perpetrates is exactly what is required for the troops of the Warlord in a Uniform,who treat human flesh and limbs as Chicken wings,Claw and Tear and Rape Women as if they are made of Rubber ,and put bullets in the head of a Child.They get paid back with interest.Shredded into bits by close range HMG,Head Chopped Off by Chopper,Throats slit open by Nails,Rambo pardons them for their sins by delivering them to the Lord:By giving they received,By dying they would wake to Eternal Life.The Rambo Saga cannot be over as yet.Rocky can bid Goodbye,but Rambo must reload again.Live for Rambo or Die for Stallone.
8.0~Awesome action, almost as good as First Blood corynye-1 Sign in Permalink As a fan of the Rambo series, especially First Blood, I thought this delivered. I liked the use of the original score and the flashbacks to previous films. The action is very fast-paced and violent which adapts well to today's mainstream action movies. Stallone's age isn't much of a deterrent to the movie's entertainment value, however a younger Stallone would've made more sense in this role. In a lot of ways, this was more believable than Rambo: First Blood Part 2 because Stallone isn't a one-man army in this one. The violence and images are also more intense and believable. However I still prefer the classic First Blood as the best in the series due to the superior character development. You really root for John Rambo when you see how the police abuse him in First Blood, while in Rambo ('08), it's assumed that you already know the story.
8.0~poorly educating, highly entertaining peter-bruck Sign in Permalink I appreciate Stallone's approach: "entertain and educate", but still I don't think he's the right one to do the latter. So, there's a civil war going on for 60 years in Burma. A civil war nobody cares about. So here is Stallones entertaining wake- up call. The education of this movie finds it's quick end in the simple establishment of the war's existence. From then on the movie's about killing 240 guys in 20 minutes. So I wouldn't stretch the educating element of the movie. But that's okay cause after all it's a Rambo- movie, not Robert freaking Redford. Also, I sincerely hope that the military regime of Burma is not as evil as Stallone pictures them. But let's talk about the entertaining part: Stallone turns out to be a great and modern action- director, totally getting the essence of today's directing. He doesn't glorify the violence, he shows how horrible it is, which is the greatest difference to part 2 and 3. He get's the action back to reality. Some call it gory or stupid, but it isn't. It simply rocks as hell, and it points out a problem of international politics without- of course- going deep.
1.0~One of the worst movies ever... mattmann36 Sign in Permalink I have always been a big fan of Rambo I, II, and III. I just watched Rambo IV tonight (26JAN2008) and it is nothing like the other movies in the series. First of all, Rambo IV was difficult to watch just because of the constant shaking of the camera and because of "fast-forwarding" during parts of the action sequences. Is this supposed to be artistic or something? It sucks. Other than technical issues, the entire movie was completely tasteless. There was scarcely any plot, far too much profanity, and the violence was unnecessarily much more graphic than in the first three movies. Sylvester Stallone did his job well - he was still the same Rambo and he had a cool knife. The other actors were awful. I worked in special operations forces for several years, and the foul language that my co-workers used was nothing compared to that of the soldiers in this film. What is the point in using so much profanity? I considered walking out so my fiancé wouldn't have to listen to it - it was that bad. In the other movies, the violence consisted mostly of fiery explosions, arrow and knife penetrations, hand-to-hand combat, and clever Vietnam- style booby traps; at least some of which was left to the imagination. In this movie they went out of their way to make each scene as exaggeratedly gory as possible through plain senseless violence in all but a few instances. This movie should disgust and offend everyone.
8.0~The legend of John Rambo lives on! brettchatz-1 Sign in Permalink The legend of John Rambo returns to the big screen in yet another scintillating action adventure. Two decades after he last appeared on screen, fighting alongside the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan to oust the oppressive Soviets, Rambo returns. This time, he's a retired man in Thailand. That is until a group of American missionaries are kidnapped in enemy territory. After some major arm-twisting one member of the group decides to enlist Rambo's help. He relents, but what follows is nothing short of jungle-warfare. Rambo explodes into action, handling weapons that tear through flesh like a hot knife through butter. This is one hot flick  the acting is paper-thin  but the action is worth its $50M budget. Rambo has raked in over $102M worldwide  a fitting tribute to an American icon and the undisputed master of the action genre.
10.0~It's Rambo! hayleyk9691 Sign in Permalink To be honest, this is the first of the series that I've seen -- and I don't have to see all three to understand the genre and violent grip the movie keeps hold on. I saw it a week or so after being released in theaters. I decided to see it since it looked good. But the first five minutes, when the villagers of Thailand are brutally murdered, from bullets to mines. After those five minuted, I thought, "Maybe this was a bad idea..." Still, Rambo still possesses the sweat and muscles to travel all over the country when he agrees to help a group of American Christain aid workers who hoped to help villagers -- but not knowing what was heading their way: the vicious Burmanese military and its satanic soldiers and general. When Rambo gets the news of their capture, he teams up with missionaries, all foul-mouthed and armed to the teeth. It sounds like an all out war in the jungle, but it's more than that. From gory, horrifying fatalities from bullets and a machete to the great explosions, Rambo is sure to make you bit your fingernails to the end.
9.0~Newfound respect for action genre njumeil Sign in Permalink "Sly is old" - most common comment on "Why wont you watch the movie?". You know what? It does not matter as this is not oiled-skin-muscle-flex at local WWF booth. The second I have finished watching trailer I knew I will love this movie. It already had this dramatic, sand-in-the-mouth, bloody-nose feeling. These was no dramatic pauses, no over-hyped narration, nothing like that. It was violent. Of course. It's an epilogue of the series that has "Blood" in it's name. Rambo comes back as a broken man with nightmares about his past. He lives in a hut and is literary waiting for his life to end. There is no joy in his face. He is beaten, washed out. He had few decades to contemplate on his life and it's meaning. And believe me or not - Sly delivers that feeling! Missionaries approach him for an aid. He tries to refuse, but in the end gets convinced by a woman (Julie Benz). This is a point where one can skip or wonder about the reasons. First of all: Rambo knows what's in Burma. He saw everything war is about. And Burma is the worst. It's genocide civil war. He knows that ideals mean nothing there and worst of all - those missionaries are probably going to die. Rambo does not want to any part in this as it would be kind of his fault too. He is only a human though, so when a woman (symbol of life cycle etc) asks him, he breaks and at least wants to have his conscience clear and agrees to help. Rambo's instincts were right - missionaries get into the hands of Burmese army. Then the mercenaries are hired for their rescue and Rambo knows he will go into this mission with them. Notice that during the movie he is referred to by his name John or as "boatman" or whatever. Stallone wants to distance his character from "super soldier" from the man Rambo was in the last two movies. This is Rambo's LAST mission. He does NOT care if he will die or not. He is no longer a hotshot. So no wonder he is not breaking teeth when he gets insulted by the leader of the mercenaries. It does not matter anymore! The rest of the movie is about violence and real(?) war. Rambo fights so ferociously as if his soul was already burning in hell for those 20 years after we last saw him in Afghanistan. As if his desperation, anger, sadness, guilt altogether explode on the screen. It's not pretty, it's not enjoyable and there is no easy way talking about it. ...but I have seen more horrific scenes already. The part in Saving Private Ryan where one soldier is pushing knife into another ones heart and asks to hush.. that one has been haunting me forever. What can be more terrifying than those dying soldiers eyes? "Rambo" is not however a movie that glorifies violence. If it would be so, then the violence would have been more cinematic and plastic and CGI and with a lot more fancy guns and explosions and ... and and. It's shown REAL. So you could NOT possibly enjoy it, because it's a movie with a message. It's about failed politics, broken ideals and life's cruelty. It's about hypocrisy and silent rage. It's also about hope. Or at least whats left of it when you have seen it all...
4.0~Madly overrated rimbaud_ Sign in Permalink After watching this movie, the first word that comes to mind is "pointless". After a brief exposition, the main 80% of Rambo IV has no plot, hardly any dialogue, no suspense, and.. well, very little of everything else, really. The only thing this movie has going for it is the "action", if by action you mean extreme acts of hate-inducing cruelty by the main antagonists (who are for the most part completely faceless), and Rambo and his allies disposing of said antagonists in very messy and graphical ways. And that's it, Rambo IV has no more content to offer. Actually, if this movie had been made with identical story but with another name and without Stallone in it, it would have ended up a typical directionless B-action flick that no one would have thought twice about. The only things keeping it from that are the Rambo and Stallone brand names and packaging. That's not to say action is bad by default. Movies like for example T2 and Aliens shine by delivering action while still building up suspense and plot - and through having antagonists that are often as interesting as the good guys. Even the start of this franchise, Rambo I, had a lot more to offer: Rambo actually has some sort of character there, beyond the Stallone tough guy gimmick. In short, there are plenty of crappy action movies out there featuring a brooding hero killing hordes of one-dimensional enemies - this is just one more.
10.0~Stallone takes Rambo all the way Home... timosphere Sign in Permalink Stallone has truly done it again. We were treated last year to a much more truthful and humanistic closing to the "Rocky" saga, and with this he has also brought Rambo full circle - literally. The movie's message is a powerful one, striking at the heart with the most aspiring of the holy emotions. The film depicts accurately the most extreme forms of human barbarity (short of cannibalism) and does not pull any punches in doing so. However, the true message of the film expands into multiple parts as the storyline progresses, including John's own realization of what life means to him - giving him "the reason" that he has been searching for in his life. This ultimately leads to the completion of his own journey. It also focuses on the striking difference between those of us in civilized culture and those who have endured or witnessed such cruelty, bringing home a truth that at the heart of man is the beast - and we must be ever vigilant in our own culture here at home as to not allow the display of this beast to ever become acceptable. Through this, the film's two strongest messages become clear - that violence is necessary to defeat violence, and that the blessings we shroud ourselves in here in this country were paid for by the blood of many - a truth that has since been almost forgotten and replaced with naive logic that is only true within the "bubble" of this nation's blessed Post-WWII life. Our complacency in our beautiful, sheltering society has resulted in the "belief" by both those on the left and right that perhaps "violence doesn't solve anything", or that "everyone can be reached through peaceful means". Stallone makes a very strong point in this area - which may be why some reviewers are approaching it from an immature perspective - categorizing it as "gory" and "lowbrow entertainment". This is naive and simplistic, and shows their impatience or inexperience with a message this important, yet so well hidden. Congratulations Sly on another commanding film. This is a definite must-see.
1.0~Foolish massacre and people trashing brittany1425 Sign in Permalink No script, no directing, no content, no message, no acting. Guts, limbs in trees, intestines made into slings, beheadings, dismemberments, demolition-heavy-machine-gun swiping over scores of bad soldiers, gore geysers as if Osama bombed a ketchup bottling plant. ...Oh, yeah. Some text too. About 15 mins. into the movie, Sly turns to the camera, and in extreme close-up mumbles something really deep - some pensées about "what is life" and "what is death", and "this world is the way it is". I'm sorry i didn't quite made it out, but all the audience was laughing much too noisily - damn rude people! :( For butchers in vacation, THIS is the movie. For those who enjoy some honest-to-God action cinema, pick better... let's see... yeah. "Cloverfield". That on IS one piece of a MOVIE!
9.0~Rambo returns for a new generation Angelus2 Sign in Permalink John Rambo resides near Burma and lives a nice and quiet life; until a group of Christian aid workers need help to cross the border to help the people of Burma. Six weeks later, Rambo is approached by the priest of the Church who believes that the workers have been captured by the Burmese army and so Rambo must do what he does best, kill. Rambo is an icon simple as that, unlike the last Rocky movie; Rambo lives up to the hype. Without boring you I will simply say that this film is a great action film and explores the Burma situation. The film does glorify violence but as an audience were meant to believe that these bad guys are the baddest of the lot; and so the violence is accepted; Stallone is still one of the best action stars of his time and probably of all time; he tears a guys throat with his bare hands and guns down men without blinking, impales them with steel arrows....This truly one of the best action movies of the last five years and by action I mean action...
10.0~A Refreshing Film charles-emery-hall81 Sign in Permalink I remember hearing about the project for this film a few years back, and I was, at first, uncertain as to whether or not Stallone could even attempt another shot at playing Rambo, since he is now 61 years old. But, I was wrong. I will spare the details of this film, that way people can figure out for themselves whether the film is any good or not. As for myself, it was a refreshing movie stemming from the original three that excited audiences throughout the 1980's. Plenty of action and violence, which is what this type of film exploits, quite well. And, similar to the other three films, the music is outstanding. It showed professional respect to the late Jerry Goldsmith. Finally, I would like to thank Sylvestor Stallone for returning one of our favorite action films from the best decade of the twentieth century. His strength, encouragement, and discipline as a movie star, writer, and director will go down in History as Entertainment being strictly Magnificent. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED MOVIE!!!
9.0~Satisfyingly gritty - John Rambo comes home. ChristerDoo Sign in Permalink Wow. For a well-paced and gripping drama with a message you can't go wrong with the latest Rambo. I don't think I have seen effects done like this in any movie before. To me this sets a new bar for visceral realism which I can only hope will be as well done in like movies to come. The story is presented in a hyper-violent manner which really serves as an ironic counterpoint to the genocide it speaks so loudly against. The moral of the plot and the solution as presented by the movie makes you wonder - although I guess it's a simple enough enactment of fighting fire with fire. This movie is finely balanced on its own moral tightrope and could come crashing down on either side depending on the viewer. I will not pass judgment on the message or the morals - you can make these decisions for yourself. Stallone is his usual taciturn, stoic self and is in remarkable shape for his years. He embodies a more mature and self-aware John Rambo well. While not for the squeamish, I whole-heartedly endorse this movie and will be watching it many more times on blu-ray.
10.0~This was easily one of the best action movies. tribal_floorfilla Sign in Permalink Being a huge Sylvester Stallone fan, I was more than happy just seeing him on screen again, and I would usually just be content watching any movie with Stallone, and that's what I went in expecting. But hell, was I wrong, this had me jumping up from my seat every 2 minutes. This had one hell of a message, and wasn't just a mindless action movie with gore. I loved each bit of the movie, and watching Stallone act so well was a total pleasure. It was also kind of shocking at how Stallone is still in physical form, considering his age. He was very flexible for his age, and that's also what helped push the movie further. Also, his ruthlessness in regards to the injustice. Overall, a brilliant 10/10 if you ask me.
9.0~Best Action Movie of 2008 pistolrivera Sign in Permalink The last time I wrote a comment about a movie was about "Rocky Balboa" and now the hard-hitting "Rambo", also starring the #1 action-hero of all-time, Sly Stallone! He has come a long way, baby---since "Lords of Flatbush"! This movie, is very graphic, so I don't recommend you take your little ones, although when I went to see it on Sunday, I saw some parents bringing their young ones---I guess, they couldn't find a baby-sitter. Rambo puts an exclamation point on the series. I loved the story, the action, the blood and guts, the cast and its finale!!!! I went to see it alone and I saw it twice in one day! And, I applauded many times when Rambo took care of the BAD GUYS! Go see it for the RAW ACTION, you will not be disappointed!!!!
4.0~Best plot of an action movie... atarimarinas Sign in Permalink I went to see Rambo last night with a friend, it was the only option i had at the movie theater since i have already seen almost all of the movies that look promising. I am actually surprised for how many people have rated this movie a 10. I just think people who love pointless action movies are the ones that loved this movie, and nobody else went to see it, by nobody else i mean people who actually look at a movie at a less superficial level. Well i can tell you that the movie is entertaining, and makes 93 minutes look like fifteen, but it is hard to take the movie seriously at any point, there is only one point of the movie i thought had to be taken seriously, but i think it was just placed there to add some plot, since the movie itself doesn't really have one. The dialogue is the worst thing ever. I like action movies a lot, but i really don't enjoy stupid ones. SO i will live my life from now forward following the tagline of the movie that could be created by a kindergarden kid: LIVE FOR NOTHING< DIE FOR SOMETHING.
10.0~The best film of 2008 so far booberry_rules Sign in Permalink Rambo, the fourth installment in the Rambo series, is awesome. It's got cussing, smoking, explosions, guns, blood, death, destruction, and everything else a good action movie should have. It's the best Rambo movie yet. It's the goriest by far, and it definitely has the best storyline. Plus, it depicts a realistic view of true total war. Rambo IV does not hold back. If you don't like to see Asians throwing children into pits of fire, then Rambo IV is not for you. Let's see, what else does this awesome movie have? Well, it's got Stallone's best acting since Rocky, and he probably doesn't even utter 500 words throughout the whole 91 minutes. Also, did I mention it has violence? In one scene, John Rambo rips out the throat of an Asian guy. Pretty sweet. So yeah, Rambo rules. This may be the best action film of the decade, and I don't say stuff like this lightly. After the rather ridiculous First Blood II and Rambo III, it's good to see that people are still capable of making classic action films.
6.0~Amazing.. In BAD Ways jaypugh Sign in Permalink I'm amazed at this movie but even more amazed by the awesome reviews of it here on IMDb. First off, let me say that I've been a Rambo fan since day one. If asked my favorite movie of all time you will likely here First Blood if not Braveheart or Gladiator but typically First Blood is my answer. Of course I thought Rambo (First Blood II) was great although not the story driven movie like the first. Part III started getting a little out of control on the "popcorn movie, check your brain at the door in order to enjoy" factor but hey, it was Rambo helping the Colonel so I can go with it. So here we are however many years later with RAMBO. I'm kind of pumped for this movie but I brace myself for something terrible. Rambo wasn't terrible but it was just short of being terrible. One of my main complaints is that the character changed so much from the earlier films. It went from "They drew first blood" to "Some people are just born to kill" or whatever it is that he says in this film. They even played clips from the other movies but they strung them together in a way to act as if his character has always been about killing with no remorse and it simply isn't so. In the past movies it has been about defending himself and not about just being a tough killer who chooses the good team to kill for. I won't go into the story much except that Rambo tries to protect a group of people who are trying to get aid to people who need it. That pretty much covers it. So we have problem number one being that they totally changed his character and what he stood for. Problem two is that Stallone now looks like a 60 year old man pumped up on steroids. I understands he looks this way becausewell..because he IS a 60 year old man pumped up on steroids. I couldn't help but watch and wonder, "If he didn't do steroids would his face still look as bad as it does?" Anyway, he doesn't look ripped like the first films. He takes the Steven Segal route by keeping a big shirt on most of the time. Likely a good choice. Next, the way this movie is shot seems straight from a B horror flick. I'm sorry but give me a break. In a B horror movie I cut it more slack but this is RAMBO! Was there a rule by the direct that every person who got hit by a bullet had to have a limb blow off? This movie makes the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan look like it was PG kids stuff. Normally I wouldn't complain but it was done so badly. The directing in this was horrible from the beginning to end. I wanted to love this movie. I really did but now I have to wonder whether I will even add it to my Rambo Collection. I guess I will by default because it is Rambo but I pray that they don't make another one unless they turn it into a comedy and Rambo fights from a wheelchair against Elvis or someone. :-) If you are a Rambo fan then check this out at a matinée or wait for DVD. I certainly wouldn't pay full price. Maybe my standards are too high and you will love it like some of these other people who loved it. I think a 6 ranking is more than generous for this movie.
10.0~WOW ! Thanx, Sly !! wmjahn Sign in Permalink Yesterday I watched JOHN RAMBO and I saw a simple (one can sum up the plot in one longer sentence!), old-fashioned, backwards oriented, partly racist, highly brutal revenge-movie with first rate production-values and ... ... I JUST LOVED IT! It was amazing! What a movie! I suddenly knew, what I had missed for at least 2 decades: exactly such a movie, an old fashioned, mindless revenge-movie of the highest order, a straight-forward, no-twist-whatsoever, no-nonsense and little-dialog action flick, where all the bad guys are killed like insects (and of course we always have a stupid guy in the cast, who calls killing bad per Se, ha ha). After the bad guys are established as pure evil, the movie doesn't even bother to translate their dialog anymore, that's how unimportant they actually are before their doomed fate arrives in the person of JOHN RAMBO, the killing-machine (who openly admits early on, that this is what he can do best - when has that been said openly in any other movie in recent years?). Amazing! This is not the most brutal movie Stallone has ever made, this is - from the point of the excessive and graphic (not psychological) violence - the most brutal movie ANYONE has ever made! I have never seen so many killings in one movie (I guess it must contain several hundred killings, maybe more than 500) and in such graphic detail. The bullets not just kill, they rip off limbs, heads, the bodies literally explode in fountains of blood and it is amazing, how much fun this is to watch! I would call this "psychologically satisfying killings". Of course Stallone (or whoever "wrote" the script) must have studied the basics of revenge movies very well and paid close attention to the DEATH WISH-series (esp. part I and II), Chato's Land, Mr. Majestyk, The Outlaw Josey Wales (only the beginning, smile), etc. JOHN RAMBO is a wonderful simplistic "what you see is what you get"-movie and one knows right from the start what's gonna happen. But that's exactly why I loved it so much! No damn shitty twists somewhere in between, no unexpected turns, just exactly what one expected. I suddenly knew why I had grown so incredibly tired of todays thrillers: everyone of them tries to invent the genre new, no one can simply celebrate the standard plot at top level, everyone tries to be "somehow new". JOHN RAMBO does not try this, not a second. And that's what makes watching it so refreshing. First you have the bad guys introduced, in typical form: they kill obvious innocents with fun. That's bad. Of course their chief wears sun-glasses, the ones you know bad guys wearing since the times of COOL HAND Luke. The bad guys smile when they kill. For them it is a game, nothing more. A little later you see them kill again. A whole village. Unarmed people, killed in dozens, young, old, women, even children. Very graphic. The viewer gets angry (here at the latest). But JOHN RAMBO presents the bill. It not a SPOILER and no secret, of course, that the bad guys all get killed. That's what revenge is all about. And the way he does it is at level with the way the bad guys killed their victims. As already pointed out, they are not just killed, but bombed, hacked, slashed to pieces. That's emotionally satisfying killing. The production values are first rate, that's what makes JOHN RAMBO differ a lot from other movies of that type: usually in these movies, to which I am referring (you know, Chuck NORRIS and similar junk), most of the F/X is poor, below-par, party unwatchable. Here this is all absolutely first rate and it does not look computer-generated (I have no idea, if it is, but I guess some parts must be). A hell of a fun to watch the bad guys' bodies being ripped apart in wonderful detail! And although the story is clear from the first few minutes (when JOHN RAMBO is asked to guide them aiders upriver), still the tension never breaks or has a let-down. As such movies typically have, this has a running time from nearly precisely 90 minutes. But it is nevertheless not easy, to keep watchers glued to the seat for 90 minutes. JOHN RAMBO manages that, despite the predictability of the storyline. I call this an ACHIEVEMENT. I have not left any movie since Gibsons' APOCALYPTO (2006) that thrilled and uplifted: the good ones win, the bad ones die. It is that simple. In APOCALYPTO only a part of the bad ones die, but in JOHN RAMBO not a single bad guy survives. It's a blood feast, a blood bath. I just wish Sly would make RAMBO no. 5. Because all the great series' have 5 parts, be it DEATH WISH, be it DIRTY HARRY, but also of course ROCKY. However, I doubt it we'll see a RAMBO 5, because how to top this? I would - for my humble part - be already happy with another equally great achievement, but as economic rules have it today, every follow up must be "more excessive" than the last part. But how to achieve THIS here ? It's better to let the RAMBO-series end at its peak (4 is definitely better than 2 and 3 and equally good as no. 1), than to risk the DIE HARD-fate: DIE HARD IV was mostly unwatchable, just terrible, silly, boring, complicated (which is already an achievement of its own type, btw). JOHN RAMBO avoids all that, it is one-dimensional, simple, basic and straight-forward. But these are its strengths, this is exactly why it succeeds on every level. A MASTERPIECE in simple but effective storytelling, definitely the best since APOCALYPTO - 10/10. Go see it ! At least if you have a healthy stomach, that is. :-))
9.0~the most....awesome....action flick.....EVER jizzypickle Sign in Permalink Im no professional movie reviewer/critic, but Rambo has to be one of the best Action flicks ever committed to film. People will complain about the acting, the story, this and that. Since when does an ACTION movie need great drama or a confusing, winding plot? What Rambo brings to the table is what the action movie genre is supposed to be about, which can be summed up in three words: FIND. KILL. REPEAT. This movie has it all; Constant action, huge explosions, awesome fire fights, gritty, insane amounts of over the top violence, and the king daddy of all bad asses: JOHN RAMBO. The violence level takes Excessive, and multiplies it by the square root of HOLY SH!T. Im not talking about sick, sadistic, torturous violence. No, I'm talking about arrows through the jaw, .50cal to the head violence. If watching this movie doesn't take you back to the mid to late 80's, the hey-day of action movies, where names like Stallone, Willis, Van Damme, and Schwarzenegger ruled the screens, check your pulse.
10.0~this is a movie about people getting served. jinx_malone Sign in Permalink if you are in the mood to enjoy a movie where you watch a lot of $#!+ get blown up, including people (who also get maimed in varied and exciting fashions) this is the film for you. if only this could have played on the deuce back in the day in NYC--it would have been a perfect grindhouse picture. as it is, it kicked some massive ass and was a LOT of fun to watch. was it 'smart'? hell no. but it was well worth the ticket price to watch sly stallone jack mothers up in some sweet ways for 90 minutes. i was reminded of some of the italo cannibal horror films of the seventies while watching--cannibal ferox and cannibal holocaust in particular--and wonder if sly took any cues from son sage (who has been responsible for bringing many of these pictures back into vogue) on how to bring the ultra-violence. a lot of fun and a great action film. 10 out of 10.
4.0~Hilarious r-rowland Sign in Permalink OK so I sat through Meet the Spartans and Rambo today and I must say that Rambo is so much funnier. I love how they used every opportunity to rip the human body in half. It was like every Chuck Norris movie in the eighties and just made it more graphic. I mean could it be easier to infiltrate a enemy camp. Why does Rambo care about these people unless he just wants to get laid from the girl? The mercenaries were the best stereo type, well I guess only one of them since he is the only one that really said anything. The action was decent, but it did not have the great one liners that have become accustomed to with Stallone Again I have not laughed that hard in a long time. Thanks it was entertaining.
10.0~Stallone does it again!! r-smilovich Sign in Permalink What can i say?? My hat goes off to you Sly!!! To make this movie just after Rocky Balboa is a incredible!! OK, now to the movie. I hate when people go looking for more than they should be. It is what it is...a Rambo movie. The directing & editing in this movie is second to none. You truly couldn't keep your eyes off the screen. I have never seen action sequences quite like this. At no point in the movie did i think that the violence was too much. If you don't like action movies or violence, why would you ever go see Rambo??? The script is what you would expect from Rambo. There were a lot of one liners and male bravado, but this is critical for the movie's success. I thought the casting overall was pretty good, and you ended up caring for the characters. I applaud Sly for bringing our attention to the misdoings in Burma. What is happening over there is purely barbaric and it's truly unbelievable. This violence around the world needs to stop. In conclusion, if this movie is your kind if thing, go see it, you won't be disappointed. If your intrigued by the whole Burma aspect, also goes see it. I believe there is a great true story to be told here, even if hundreds of people were slaughtered along the way.
8.0~For all the bad press, this was Excellent!!! desertwraith Sign in Permalink I take back every sarcastic remark I ever made while this was in production. This was so damn good!!! For one thing, Sly at 61 being built like a tank AND pulling off the physically demanding scenes - film/camera work not withstanding, it was still amazing to see - freakin' impressive! Sly, not that you'll read this, but you have my respect and admiration once again - I was let down with Rocky Balboa but this was...."over the top"!!!! One other thing for all those who hated this movie: I'm not a fan of gore or even "action movies" anymore to be honest. Gore bothers me and most action movies are brainless, nonsense thrown together to make a buck and promote some "tough pretty boy" as the newest "it" guy in Hollywood. This film drew upon real word circumstances and although ultra violent and fictional, it was done so to illustrate the extreme problems still ongoing in third world nations - Burma is one of them. Basically, the hell that descended upon the Burmese army was not gratuitous, it was more "the wrath of God".
9.0~Easily the best action movie in a LONG time! bjones7-2 Sign in Permalink Congrats Sly, you have once again reinvented and brought us a new installment of one of the best movie franchise's in history. What he did with "Rocky Balboa" last year, he does once again in "Rambo". This movie is AWESOME. The action is perfectly spaced out and well done. Stallone looks great as Rambo, and the movie plays out even better. While watching this I have never rooted for a character more in a movie than i did in this. I wanted Rambo to punish the enemy Burmese characters more than anything, they were just brutal people. It makes me feel as if we need a John Rambo in todays society haha Overall it was the most fun action movie I have seen in a while and although it is incredibly gory and intense, it made it feel more realistic, and had you rooting for John from the start. Great job stallone!--9/10
7.0~Good manitobaman81 Sign in Permalink An aging Rambo joins a group of mercenaries to venture into war-torn Burma and rescue a group of Christian aid workers who were kidnapped by the ruthless local infantry unit. I finished this film, thinking, "There are people out there suffering and I can do something to help them!" Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of friendship and violence. It's fun watching it. Its complexity begins within its characters. But, in the end, this is okay. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Against this backdrop, our heroe must fight. It's "Die Hard" for the war-movie crowd.
9.0~Pure action!! Solid Movie. chrisalsop1213 Sign in Permalink Rambo is without question a sick action movie and Stallone has proved himself again as an intense actor and as a solid director. This installment combines elements from all three previous movies but this one had a much more realistic feel. Yes some dialog is questionable and there are a few, albeit brief, scenes that don't quite work, but make no mistake, this movie takes no prisoners. Stallone slips back into the role with ease and his supporting players do an admirable job. Critics will whine as they always do about the excessive violence, gore and lack of story. (Stick to giving awful movies like The Skeleton Key thumbs up guys). The ironic thing is that Rambo actually gives a vivid and some would say accurate portrayal of war. It has a similar feel to Black Hawk Down and borrows its chaotic action. Rambo pulls no punches...It's brutality, violence and gore are rooted in reality. Gone is the "fun" action of 2 and 3. It is replaced with realism which amounts to some of the best and most intense action sequences I've ever seen. My only real gripe with the film was scenes that were sped up in post. (No big deal) Finally, the integrity of the series as a whole has been kept in tact. Everything from the music, to the action to the character to the final scene. An extremely well crafted movie. Rambo/action fans will not be disappointed...And neither will the critics who rave about The Princess Diaries
10.0~One of the best action movies of 2008 robertallenandersonjr Sign in Permalink When I had first seen Rambo I was expecting lots of action and it had a ton. So far Rambo was the best action movie of 2008. I thought that the action was very graphic and hard to watch at some parts. The thing that was very shocking to me is that some of this stuff is really happening in different countries. I strongly advise that kids should not see this movie because of the very graphic action scenes. Sylvester Stallone did a great job playing John Rambo again. When I had seen this I didn't see the first bloods or any of the old Rambo movies. So I couldn't compare the old ones to the new one. I thought that the story was great as well. The acting was also surprisingly really good. The direction it was going was very good about never giving up and fighting until you have nothing left. The movie was even better because John Rambo didn't fight everyone and go into the war zone on his own, he went with mercenaries. All the men were very tough and not afraid of death which was awesome. Some of the visual effects in it were good as well. Overall I think that this was a great movie and will go under my favorite action movies of all time. So if you want some graphic action than this is a perfect movie for you.
8.0~Great movie Mankindfails Sign in Permalink I watched this movie with very low expectations but its nothing like the previous Rambo movies that were a bit worse every time. This is a very good movie on its own and will make you forget that its a sequel to not so good movies.You don't need to have seen the movies to understand this one but if you do you'll understand the character better.I suggest reading the good books, at least the first one instead of watching the movies tho. There's nothing exceptional about the story, but actors are very good and committed, the realism of the visuals is outstanding, better than most war movies i've seen. Its cold, mature, brutal and bloody but its not a cheap action movie where they just trow stupid violence at you for the sake of it. Its what I would call solid entertainment for serious adult.With all the junk t.v. and movies we get these days I found it very refreshing. In my opinion, except for Oscar this is by far the best Stallones' movie you can find.
10.0~The one true action movie of this year webdoc37 Sign in Permalink I loved it. This movie is exactly what it should be. No complicated plot, no refined top-class acting - just a decent violent story where you have obvious bad guys and obvious good guys that take each other on in some of the most gruesome fighting scenes I have ever seen. Make no mistake about it - this movie is seriously sick when it comes to the detail of the violence going on, I think perhaps the most "realistic" movie made so far. I could only detect one scene where it is clear computer rendering is going on, the rest looks very, very real. Guts flying about, limbs, loose heads - you better have a solid stomach for this one because this is not your usual gore. This is a serious piece of work, the only thing missing is the smell. And while Rambo will forever be known as that movie where one guy with a machine gun somehow manages to destroy a whole army within 15 minutes, this one is a fair bit more doable (although still pushing it, but then hey, it is a movie after all!) and is certain to not only leave you with a feeling you've just seen an awesome action movie, but also knowing you have experienced a new step in war-movie realism.
8.0~Rambo à gogo. BA_Harrison Sign in Permalink In his fourth blood-soaked cinematic outing, ageing Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sly Stallone)now a reclusive reptile-wrangling boat-owner in Thailandreluctantly agrees to ferry a group of Christian Aid workers into neighbouring war-torn Burma. After the bible-bashing 'do-gooder's are kidnapped by a ruthless military unit, Rambo joins a team of hard-bitten mercenaries on a dangerous rescue mission. And proceeds to slice, dice, maim, mutilate and kill anyone who gets in his way! An hour-and-a-half of graphic carnage culminating in one of the most brutal and bloody battle scenes ever committed to celluloid, 'Rambo' is a bullet-ridden action-fest designed to please movie-goers who can't be bothered with unnecessary rubbish such as a complex plot or character development. Stallone's latest effort may use the troubles in Burma as its backdrop, but don't expect meaningful political commentary: once it has been established that Burma is bad news for tourists, it is relentless death and destruction for the duration and I wouldn't have it any other way!! Visually, the film is stunning, and director/star Sly does a great job with the action, using fast, frantic, hand-held camera-work, combined with blink-and-you'll-miss-'em moments of nasty gore in which heads explode, guts are spilled, and bodies are blown to smithereens (using a convincing mix of prosthetic and CGI effects). Mindless movie violence doesn't get much more gratuitous or realistic than this. It is true, as some of its critics claim, that the lack of depth in 'Rambo's narrative means that the film only appeals on a totally superficial level. But surely the fact that Sly's movie averages 2.59 killings per minute more than makes up for that.
8.0~Very graphic and disturbing. OllieSuave-007 Sign in Permalink This fourth movie featuring Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is a very graphic and disturbing sequel, where he joins a group of mercenaries in war and genocide-plagued Burma to rescue a Christian aid group kidnapped by a ruthless local infantry unit. Just about the entire movie consists of the evil Burmaese soldiers kidnapping, torturing and murdering villagers and Rambo and the mercenaries engage in endless battles with the Burmaese soldiers, with the Christian aid group workers caught in the ensuing chaos. This results in a very fast-paced plot and an enthralling story to see how Rambo and his counterparts attempt to fend off the infantry and rescue those kidnapped and tortured. Because of the explicit portrayal of innocent villagers being assaulted, there are extremely high levels of gore and grisly images, definitely not for everybody to watch. This does remind those willing to see the movie what goes on, unfortunately, in the real world in some countries that tolerate genocide and watching this film will definitely make you root for the good guys to completely vanquish the evil forces. The acting was dramatic and good for the most part, especially those of Stallone and Matthew Marsden (I like his sportsmanship role of Schoolboy who seemed to be the one who allies himself with Rambo more). Julie Benz as Sarah was OK, just a little melodramatic at times, and I've actually found Graham McTavish's Lewis role to be annoying. His excessive foul mouth and overreacting were over-the-top. Overall, it's a riveting and high-tension movie that sadly reminds you of the effects of genocide but also brings out the hero in people who want to intervene. Grade B
9.0~Latest Sequel Is Actually Quite Enjoyable gigan-92 Sign in Permalink I'm here to say the final installment in the Rambo series is truly a film to see. Despite the series' popularity, only the first film had any point beyond action junkie entertainment. This film is the first since the original to convey relevant themes, and it does so superbly. And that's a damn surprise coming from Stallone, who not only co-wrote this but directed it. However, that's not to say this film doesn't live up to its predecessors in terms of action. The action is probably the most heart pounding sh*t I've seen in a long time. Not only that, but it's grotesquely realistic, much to my amazement, disgust and appreciation. And while arguably still quite the bad-ass, Rambo is not an untouchable one man army as he was before. He actually keeps his shirt on. Now isn't that something. And also quite unlike the other sequels, the co-star protagonists are not forgettable and I actually enjoy them as characters. With the talents of Tim Kang, Matthew Marsden and Graham McTavish, and many others, it was awesome. And I sh*t you not, Julie Benz does incredibly well. The villains are sick f*cks, and say very little or little that we understand you could say. But this way the stakes feel more real, threatening and un-cheesy. And the moral ideology forces you to ask yourself a lot of hard questions. Perhaps the best one is that the ignoring of man's violent nature is quite useless. Within all of us, which may be a stretch to say, is the natural tendency to commit violence, for whether god or evil is up to you. See this movie because it is indeed great, second best of the series. And, it offers a conclusion to the series as well, and pays much deserved tribute to both John Crenna and Jerry Goldsmith. Well done, Stallone, well done.
8.0~Loved it, one of the best lads action films in a long time with a body count to rival World War II. poolandrews Sign in Permalink Rambo starts in the river village of Mae Sot in Thailand where John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) earns a meagre living as a boatman, he is approached by Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) who works for a pan Asian ministry church & is trying to lead a small team of volunteers up river North & into Burma to deliver medical aid & relief for those caught up in Burma's sixty year civil war. Reluctantly Rambo agrees, takes the team into Burma & than heads back. While in Burma helping people in a small village called Klaw Kbe Lo it is attacked by the Burmese military with many brutally killed & some taken prisoner. Word gets back to Rambo who then helps a small band of hired mercenaries to get the survivors back, lots & lots of people start to die... This American German co-production was co-written, produced & directed by Rambo himself Sylvester Stallone & one has to say I loved just about every gory minute of it. The fourth Rambo film I must confess that out of the previous three I have only seen Rambo III (1988) which I also loved & this one lives up to my high expectations. The script by Stallone & Art Monterastelli stays true to the Rambo character in these politically correct & sensitive times, I love the fact Rambo by todays standards is a dinosaur as he doesn't believe in negotiation, he doesn't believe aid workers can make a difference & he thinks to beat the bad guy's you have to blow them all to pieces! A simple yet undeniably effective philosophy. Of course the script also paints the opposite opinion with the aid workers trying to help & frowning on any sort of killing but luckily for the audience Rambo's point-of-view wins out in the end & we are treated to some spectacularly gory & action packed set-pieces which I thought were tremendously fun & entertaining. The basic plot is pretty much the same as any action film, the good guy has to stop the bad guy's give or take a few minor differences like settings & motivation. Here the bad guy's are very bad as they kill women, children & babies, they rape, torture, execute & abuse the innocent in some very graphic sequences so it's even more sweet when Rambo turns the table on them & dispenses a bit of bloody retribution. At just over 75 minutes (the closing credits last near 10 minutes) the film moves along like a rocket, there's more than enough bloody violent action to keep most action junkies more than satisfied & the story is based around something that is actually taking place right now as I write this, the civil war in Burma which gives it a certain uneasy credibility although I'm not saying for one second Rambo is realistic in any way other than where it's set. Director Stallone does a fine job here, he makes the nice looking locations work very well & he doesn't disappoint when it comes to the action. Rambo has to be one of the most violent & bloody films ever to go into mainstream theatres, people literally explode in a shower of blood & limbs, arms are chopped off with machetes, women, children & babies are graphically killed, people are hanged, someone has both his legs blown off while someone else has his legs beneath his knees eaten by ravenous pigs, there's rape, there's loads of blood as head are literally blown off, the backs of peoples heads explode everywhere, limbs are blown & cut off & the scene at the end when Rambo climbs aboard the jeep with the huge gun on the back & lets rip is just one of the single greatest scenes ever in any film. Watch as all the bad guy's explode everywhere! If that isn't enough Rambo also rips someones throat out, beheads someone with a machete & guts someone with a huge knife, all in a days work I suppose! According to the IMDb this has a kill count of 236 which averages at 2.59 killings a minute. There are also plenty of explosions & action as well. All of the action scenes are well shot occasionally with a shaky camera but it's always clear what is going on which is a factor many filmmakers seem to ignore these days. With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Rambo is well made with high production values. Rambo is apparently banned in Myanmar, formally Burma, by the military Government which says something! Actually filmed in Thailand the locations look very nice. The acting is alright, Stallone was never the greatest actor anyway but he does fine here & plays Rambo with a nice bitter cynicism, although he does look a bit old at times it never bothered me as he still looks in pretty good shape. Rambo is not a film for everyone, it's incredibly violent & some of the stuff the Burmese military get up to may distress but in reality war doesn't care about race, creed, religion, sex or age & I believe that Rambo merely tells it, OK more like graphically show's it like it is. If you like your action films violent then Rambo is the film for you, if not then it isn't. Maybe the best film I've seen in 2008 so far.
10.0~A return to form for the action film haleysuzanne Sign in Permalink I have just returned home from seeing "Rambo." I cannot remember the last time I saw a film in a theater and left feeling so exhilarated. "Rambo" was a fantastic return to form for the classic action movie, in theme, content, and philosophy. Yes, there have been action-oriented films of late, but they have dealt with superficial issues created by consumer-driven societies: drugs, bank heists, jewel thievery, the Mob- to name a few. "Rambo" returns to the era of the action film that seeks a universal and compelling motivation for its bloodbaths. In this case, genocide in Burma sets the stage. "Rambo" is unafraid to take a stance on not only genocide, but mission work- all while it blasting past it in a blur of unabashed violence. "Rambo" creates one of the best-orchestrated action sequences on film over the course of 20 minutes near its end. In terms of the quality of its blood-letting, it makes movies hailed for their gore like "Reservoir Dogs," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Pulp Fiction" pale in comparison. Heads are blown off, bullets rip through bodies, flamethrowers blast rebels, bloated corpses float in pools of stagnant water, land mines explode humans in fountains of blood, arrows sink through heads, hands rip flesh apart, fire burns flesh, and fiery explosions take care of most of what's left. Yet, with the amazing noise and struggle contained in this movie, viewers will be engaged by the struggle, the resolve, and stoic killer impulses embodied in Rambo himself. Simply put, this movie with stimulate your nerves and senses all while drawing you into its tale. An excellent film.
6.0~good movie but a little unsettling! magicman66 Sign in Permalink warning!: spoilers ahead!! I saw the graphic international trailer and got really pumped up to see this movie. After 4 months of waiting, the day arrived and i went to see it. I was aware of the topic that the film covered, but what i saw in the first half of the movie shocked me big time! people getting mutilated for no true reason, and the worst part was when they showed the death of children(very graphic I might add) and i took a look around and saw looks of shock on the audiences faces. After that, you can't wait for Rambo to exact his brand of justice on these $@%#$%@% soldiers, which he promptly does. Overall, good movie. I would have given it a higher rating if not for the subject matter.
5.0~this reminded me of RESERVOIR DOGS Negative_Reviews Sign in Permalink If it weren't for the violence, people wouldn't praise either movie. It's as SIMPLE AS THAT, don't overthink it, because you know it's true. It's like the gore in this movie was its gimmick. It's not a Rambo movie with a little gore thrown in, this is a gore movie with a tiny sprinkle of Rambo thrown in. I don't necessarily mind it, in fact that's what kept me from falling asleep watching it. It's the story that's the problem. No wonder this movie felt so short, how can you base an entire feature film around some guy saving some other guys from a village? And that's what this is, this is totally devoid of any character development, no emotional growth, no lessons learned or anything. And don't tell me this is based on real life, that's an excuse to give this movie more substance than it has. This almost feels like some extended flashback sequence shot to be used in some hypothetical, future Rambo movie, and instead of watching the condensed down 5 minute version recounting the events of Rambo rescuing some missionaries from a village, at which point they go back to telling the main story, we're seeing the full, uncut, 90 minute version of it. That would explain the lack of emotion in this movie. It's only a glorified flashback. Thoughts: **I like the most recent Rocky movie, gave it an 8/10, so I'm not biased against Stallone. **I have zero memory of the original Rambo movies, so I'm not biased against a new movie from this franchise. **I kept thinking the story would take a twist and take us in a different direction at some point. I kept thinking it couldn't possibly be this simple, there's gotta be more to this story? Nope. What happened was the equivalent of saving Zelda from Hyrule Castle in Link to the Past, and that being the end, never even going back to Dark World.. **Was it just me or was this movie unusually short? I know it's listed at about 90 minutes, but I could've sworn that Rambo had looked at his mailbox with a smile and had begun strolling down that road at around the hour and sixteen minute mark?
9.0~More horrific than any horror movie dark_stalions Sign in Permalink This is a... disturbing film. The pure senselessness of the violence and horror of the poor Burmese people living, or more commonly not, through the genocide depicted here was sickening to the bone. This was more often than not not so much Hollywood violence (big explosions, people just falling over when shot, etc), but rather a blown up (in the photographic sense) exaggerated version of the horrible reality of these situations. OK, so there were some *relatively* "fun" shots, where people's heads exploded to sniper fire, but seeing someone vaporised by a mine they have been forced to risk treading on under the threat of being shot almost made me physically retch. The film carries on in this vein for the majority of the first half. There is little finesse to the fighting involving Rambo towards the end. You get the feeling that Silvester Stallone is showing his age somewhat. There are some good sequences, though, involving bow and arrows (of course) and right at the end with a machete, but if you're going along purely to see Stallone kick the enemy where it hurts in the way he did in the previous films you may be a little disappointed. This is not to say that the film is even remotely boring. You will be on the edge of your seats for the vast majority of it, if you aren't puking your guts out in the bathroom. One gets the feeling that the film is to an extent raising awareness of the situation in Burma. Certainly not something that I have heard much about, I have read up on the situation since I returned, and all that I remember of the facts stated at the beginning of the film are true. Most recent news I found was the obituary of the assassinated rebel leader Man Sha La Phan. Take a look at the following link for more on that. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/18/burma The fact that the film is staying so close to the facts, stating them in such a straightforward and almost understated way, backed by what appears to be real footage from Burma rather than trying a sensationalist piece of propaganda brings it credibility as something more than a mindless action film. It certainly sent me away thinking. I fear, though, that to today's desensitised western audiences the conversations I overheard on the special effects and the amount of blood in the scenes may outweigh the talk about the atrocities being committed. However, if just a few more people are moved into action by this piece of cinema it may be enough to persuade governments to do something for people who need it. Odeon have apparently boycotted the film, which have definitely hurt it's take here in the UK, at least at the cinema, and it appears that the boycott has more to do with personal relations with Sony. I suspect that DVD sales may make up for this loss, though, as this is an outstanding work of cinematography, no matter the genre. For more on the Odeon snub, follow the following link: http://odeon-rambo.feed24.com/go/51787373 Overall, a fantastic film, if horribly graphic, and certainly worth a watch, despite it's short length (only about 80 mins or so). Not for the squeamish. Jasper
2.0~sad.. just F Word sad.... shalimar-4 Sign in Permalink Granted right off the bat they did include the situation in Burma... sad that it is. However that at best was a lame ass attempt to inject political commentary as well as an attempt to boot the movies ratings with current real world events. Now as for the "best of the series" I cannot disagree more. My uncle.. a former Green Beret, sniper and highly decorated officer thought the original was "adequate" portrayal of reality of post Viet Nam effects upon some of the veterans. After he did 9yrs+ voluntarily (Since he was Canadian he did not have any obligation to do so in any way shape or form. He simply thought it was the right thing to do at the time.) and after loosing his # Fiancé to a 8yr old suicide bomber in Hanoi I do believe he certainly earned the right to comment upon any VN-era film's accuracy. I as a veteran as well give full credence to his opinion on such matters though I was not a vet of VN. (I am simply too young). As for the latest film.. personally I find it an embarrassment for Stalone.. he could have done far better. Julie should truly hide in shame especially... she's a very competent actress and this frankly is way beneath her ability. Shame on you Julie for accepting this pile of crap with your name on it. Suffice to say the original had merit due to it actually having a well written story.. as well as real meaning. Everything since then in this pathetic excuse for a franchise has well been total crap. Proof you ask? Simple.. how bad does a film or series of films as in this case have to be to make the joke "Watch Rambo kill EVERYONE on the entire planet and not even reload once" almost universally a household joke. Honestly.. the SFX were over done... plot absolutely lost it only 1/4 of the way through... In the end.. it's complete drivel.. action it has... unbelievable BS levels it has... but real writing? F No... for that you'll have a better chance of finding such on Sesame Street. Ohh and thanks soooooooo much for the very very lame IMDb censor scripting prohibiting a real world description of this R rated movie. Apparently they are the new F word police even for an Adult movie... how pathetic.
10.0~Makes the two middle films look like kid's movies moviefreak2010 Sign in Permalink Saw it twice in theaters and I love it. Great action. good acting. surprised of the gore and how many soldiers Rambo kills. I was shocked at the gore. I never expected Stallone who also directed it would go far like that. But it's not like a horror movie. When the village is attacked by the Burma Soldiers, I believe that can happen in real life. How many people die in the film. 236. more than Shoot em Up. As a sequel, it so much better than First Blood Part II and Rambo III. I never cared for them but I love the first one and this the true sequel to First Blood. I knew this was going to be a good sequel because after seeing Rocky Balboa. That was a good movie and this is too. To the men, WATCH IT!
5.0~When you're pushed, try to watch something else instead. Grant_Price Sign in Permalink John J. Rambo, the latest in a long line of 1980s archetypal action luminaries resurrected from franchise death by some less-than-divine hand, returns with a vengeance in the imaginatively titled Rambo. Sylvester Stallone writes, directs and stars in the fourth and perhaps most charming of the series in which the Vietnam veteran falls in love with a female robot from the future and must win her affection by caring for her magical goat children who only speak in rhyming couplets. Not really, he kills hundreds of people whilst grunting unintelligible phrases. And that's the way we like it. Sure, there's supposedly a message regarding the unremitting atrocities in Burma but if there was, it was so subtle it escaped my detection. Except perhaps the five minute opening montage of disturbing news images showing actual deaths and torture which serves to trivialise anything Rambo does throughout the film. Really, how can anyone derive any enjoyment from the film after seeing what actually happens there? Well I can a little bit. The entertainment arrives mainly in the final half hour of Rambo where the proverbial excrement really hits the fan. Johnny Boy feels obliged to save a number of Christian aid workers led by Julie Benz and Paul Schulze (Father Food-and-Sex from the Sopranos!) after they are captured by a regiment of mustachioed Burmese soldiers. Initially he is merely employed as a boatman by a number of mercenaries paid to rescue the aid workers. However, Stallone then aims to answer the age-old question after the mercenaries are captured: Who watches the Watchmen? Answer: Rambo does, and he kills literally everyone while he does it, mainly with a .50 calibre machine gun situated conveniently on top of a hill so he doesn't ever have to run anywhere (not that he could because he looks like the human equivalent of a mountain.) Although the deaths do not look particularly good in their CGI splendour, they certainly are visceral and more than satiate the blood-lust of the baying young male audience. Plus there is a British sniper (Matthew Marsden) and he kills people too! Negative aspects encompass essentially the entirety of Rambo's running time, beginning with the aforesaid news broadcasts and ending with Johnny standing outside a ranch in Arizona, having successfully tracked down his long lost father/brother/whatever. Other excellence includes the dialogue, which ranges from awkward and embarrassing ("Live for nothing, die for something") to stupid ("Burma's a war zone") to laughter inducing ("We need pythons! Not cobras! Pythons!") The supporting cast are quite ridiculous, with each mercenary a pastiche of movie hard men and the aid workers incredibly useless except at providing a higher body count. Special attention must be paid to the "old-school SAS" mercenary played by Graham McTavish who, aside from being not very nice to poor old Rambo, highlights the fact that the SAS do not feel it beneficial to teach their soldiers to camouflage their giant white egg heads during operations in the middle of the jungle. And why would they when he's wearing white trousers anyway? To conclude, any goodwill Sly earned with Rocky Balboa has been expertly wasted in the space of a year with Rambo. To be honest though, what was he going to do with that goodwill in any case? I just think more attention could have been paid to the story as opposed to the "good supply of body bags" direction the film took (First Blood was one of the best action films of all time and only one person was killed), which would have reduced the gratuitous number of clichés promulgated by Rambo for ninety one minutes and made it actually worth watching. As John J. says, "Nothing does change" and this franchise still sucks.
10.0~Finally a real action movie necron99 Sign in Permalink I just had a chance to see this film this afternoon. I have to say, this is one of the best action movies I have seen in the last 10 years. This is a refreshing return to real action and violence that is not shy by any means. I was impressed with the action sequences and revenge factor. And the ending was great as well. The mercenaries were great, especially the guy with the huge friggin sniper rifle. I will try not to ruin the movie for anyone. Great job Sly. I give this 10/10 (for a strictly ACTION film). This will not wins Oscars but it was entertaining. This was a great movie and I hope you make more films or maybe even a sequel Sly??
8.0~It is hard to find any flaws... sven_nilsson-1 Sign in Permalink Rambo is an excellent action movie for those who just like to sit down and relax for some good entertainment. You can follow the storyline almost with your brain turned off and you will enjoy the show! There are a few minor flaws such as cheap looking blood splatter and explosion CGI effects. Also, the movie is extremely violent - among the goriest I have ever seen. If this is good or bad I cannot tell, you just have to be prepared for it when you see a movie like this. Rambo is also very well cut - it is short, intensive and never boring - not even for a second. I rate this movie 8/10 because I would never rate a no-brainer action movie higher than that, no matter how good it is :)
6.0~Last 15 minutes has Gore Merit -- otherwise.... well-duh Sign in Permalink At 80 minutes until end credits, this movie is still a bit too long. Truthfully action-wise all the two-sided violence is packed at the very end. Nothing socially redeeming and barely hits mediocre acting. Not much dialog in English and except for a hand full lines all pretty banal. Really pretty boring during first half except for some short "bad army kills villagers clips". And those no more exciting than to say the enemy is ruthless which saying "the enemy is ruthless" does almost as well. If this movie gives you a thrill before the last 20 minutes, you take too much pleasure in passively watching people gunned down without a chance -- that or watching rain forest river scenery. John Rambo, himself, lurks stone faced and non-committal until 2/3 the way through. Other than a brief use of revolver, arrows and a jog through the woods, Rambo doesn't exhibit the old super soldier skills. He sets a claymore and lurks behind a truck mounted gun for the majority of actual action. I would guess arthritis has caught up with Stallone. The last 15 minutes is a chase to the climatic all out bombs and guns "glory". Mostly fairly realistic human destruction by high caliber weapons. Far more than most movies are willing to show. But the same old exaggerations on how easily it is to cleanly decapitate with single blow. The sniper guy is the best job of acting but he only has like 8 lines. And you know this isn't a "real" action movie because they got Julie Benz and they don't flash her tits, not even a wet shirt. And while she stays in character as a extremely naive and none too smart Christian missionary -- the chances of her keeping her shirt in real life while native people are are raped and killed continuously is about nil. Only if she had been kept for ransom by rebels (not official government forces) would she have had a chance of good treatment and keeping her shirt. One really odd moment is when the chief bad guy grabs a young boy from the prisoners and takes him to bed. But after that everything proceeds like the kid volunteered for the role and is even released in the morning to trot happily away by himself. One of the mercenaries will later refer to this homosexual act after being captured by calling the evil commander "ladyboy" despite lacking a view into this incident. I guess somethings were cut out that would have explained all this and we end up with only random "gay foreigners are evil foreigners". Very biblical but unnecessary.
5.0~Meat-grinder, that's it. palaeo Sign in Permalink In the line of going-berserk-with-adrenaline action, this is another installment of nostalgic RAMBO series. Compared to the last three, there is no emotional tension, no such a Crenna as a father-figure. I am astonished that I was so really hooked up by the brutality and graphic severity of Rambo-action as not to recognize the movie was already over after about 80 min. Every piece of human flesh is totally exploited--head-explosion by a super power sniper gun, beheading with custom-made machete, jack-hammering human body with .500 machine gun, harakiri-like disembowelment, etc--and it's setting another score for a new breed of Rambo series. Too sorry for old Stallone to go naked and expose his old titties. The last scene is a direct copy of the first installment--same costume, same mood, same scenery. Possible is that Sylvester is trying to close the chapter of his own era by finalizing both Rambo and Rocky and by sealing them as legend. Is it worth? I'don't think so.
4.0~Rambo as a comic relief? mischava Sign in Permalink Story is same old, same old, and the visual effects are totally over the top. A human body contains about 4-5 liters of blood. But in this movie I see splatters of multiple liters when someone's head is shot off, and entire blood-banks are flying around when a body is hit. Makers, a head contains a BRAIN, and SOME blood, not the entire stock. And makers, people are not walking bags of blood, so don't let them explode like so. It looks ridiculous. So please leave the CGI alone when you're making a guerrilla warfare movie in the jungle, it's totally unnecessary. See the old school First blood movie, that was a masterpiece. This movie was a joke, I guess, the real one still has to come yet... So Sly, get to work, you've made some good stuff, I'll consider this one to be quite a mistake.
10.0~Welcome to the jungle CalinWins Sign in Permalink The only word that can describe this movie is ACTION. If you did not enjoy this film you are either A. A person who does not understand the definition of awesome. B. Someone trying to make the majority angry or C. Missing a brain. This is hands down THE BEST action movie since Equilibrium and will probably hold the tittle for years to come. Some things about action movies that people do not understand, IT IS ACTION, I didn't go to see Ramdo and expect someone to recite Shakespeare in a heartwarming voice to a beautiful plot line that pulled me into a sea of tears, I went to see an ACTION MOVIE to see S$^T EXPLODE and OH MY GOD I feel like I should have paid double to see this film it was that great. Great ending to a great idea STALONE IS THE MAN. Even at age 60+ he looks like a tank, he is so torn you could chizzle his abs. One more thing... complaint about one liners... and messages? One liners ruin movies, and if you didn't catch it there was a message in this film, Religion can NOT solve anything but PURE MUSCLE CAN!
5.0~Blame it on the nostalgia Maziun Sign in Permalink The Rambo series has got quite negative reputation , mainly thanks to people who never even seen any Rambo movie . Those movies are often portrayed as mindless and full of unnecessary violence. I don't agree with that , at least regarding the first two movies . "First blood " is a great action-drama with very strong anti-war and anti-violence message . "Rambo 2 " is a great action-adventure movie tribute to war veterans. "Rambo 3" was little over the top , but still decent and fun. It's not that bad as all the people say. In 2006 Stallone had returned from oblivion with really good "Rocky Balboa" . The movie was success , so he decided to bring Rambo back . I was hoping for good conclusion for one of the most memorable characters in history of cinema . Boy , I was so wrong  First of all – the story . "John Rambo " is basically a copy of "Rambo 3" (which itself was a copy of "Rambo 2 ") . You don't have to be a genius to realize that. Just replace Afghanistan with Birhma and colonel Trautman with missionaries. The rest is almost exactly THE SAME. Talk about lazy writing Also the conclusion for Rambo's journey in this movie seems to appear out of nowhere for me . It wasn't convincing. Second – the characters . The movie lacks any memorable villain or good supporting characters . Neither any of the missionaries or mercenaries is likable or interesting . So , in the end you simply don't care what happens to them. Third – awful direction . It seems like Stallone did watch "Saving private Ryan" one time too much . The movie is full of violence and near the end it's simply carnage . It's not pretty , enjoyable or heartbreaking . It looks good , but that's it. "John Rambo" lacks the heart that Spielberg's movie had. Forth – action . The movie is very boring . It's short , but it takes forever for the action to start . When it starts it's not fun , because the movie takes itself way too seriously . Maybe Stallone was trying to make this one a war drama , but without good story , interesting characters and sharp direction it was fruitless attempt. It's also annoying that Rambo is very inactive for action hero . It looks like Stallone is to old to play Rambo , which is strange , because in "The Expendables" he isn't afraid to take part in fist fights and so on. Here , he shoots few bullets and few arrows . It looks pathetic. I appreciate that Stallone wanted the world to take a look what is happening in Birhma . There is some substance in this story and I liked the references to other Stallone movies ("Cobra" , "First blood" , "Rambo 2"). It's also good that Rambo uses his brain to defeat the enemy. Overall it's still a disappointment. The high rating for "JR" is probably the effect of nostalgia. I've heard that Stallone wants to make another Rambo movie . I'm hoping that if that happens the next one will be a lot better . I give this one 5/10.
7.0~Well Crafted. athena24 Sign in Permalink Stallone has made a great job directing this movie. In my opinion this is his best effort as a director. There are no unnecessary scenes, dialogs, or exaggerated action. Even the huge body count seems to be in place. Superb cinematography. Both of the brutal action, and the marvelous landscapes. No shaky camera - which proved itself as an excellent choice. I actually forgot that a good war-action scenes could be done without the shaky camera, but Rambo proves the opposite. Stallone has aged, so did John Rambo. Nonetheless, he looks fit for the role and manages to stay believable in the action. Much more believable then in the previous two installments. Other characters are just as believable. Same plot as before, just different location. However, it seems that the budget was wisely invested in the crew, action, explosions, amazing cinematography, excellent dialogs, curt dialogs and more.
6.0~Certainly what you would expect but Rambo fails to elevate itself to any new or particularly large heights. johnnyboyz Sign in Permalink The tagline for the latest Rambo film, the first for twenty years, is 'Heroes never die.... They just reload.' Well, that's fairly untrue when it comes to all those John Wayne films from the 1960s, showing him single-handedly win either the Second World or Vietnam War for the Allies, without reloading  it was propaganda. Then came Rambo: First Blood Part II, another propaganda driven film in which the Rambo of the franchise single-handily defeats Communism in Vietnam. So, finally it feels as if the filmmakers have got it right; they have got the film right and they have got the tagline right: heroes do not die but Rambo does indeed reload; a shot in which a jeep mounted machine gun has a few dozen more bullets shoved into it is proof of this. But this fourth edition of Rambo isn't so much flawed as it is a failure to elevate itself above a certain level. Rambo has tackled the redneck cops of a small town; the Vietcong and the Soviets in Afghanistan but here, a new enemy in the shape of the Burmese army awaits him. Rambo is really a little bit of First Blood Part II mixed in with Rambo III but it works since the narrative stays simple and never tries to be anything it's clearly not destined to be, however this also works against the film. Any film that has its immediate opening as a series of news reel clips and footage of a humanitarian crisis is clearly trying to say something, trying to bring something to our attention; how many people even knew Burma existed before seeing this film? It is here that Rambo feels like a dumbed down version of Edward Zwick's powerful film from last year entitled Blood Diamond, a film that was a rescue mission; an action film and a sort of political drama revolving around a humanitarian crisis in a country of the third world  Africa or South East Asia, genocide is genocide. However, I think it would be wrong of me to compare Rambo to Blood Diamond because they seem like two completely different films, but are they really? The idea behind Rambo is simple: aid workers are taken by the Burmese militia and they have to be rescued. It seems strange how the aid workers go in alone with no guns or U.N. backing but when they go missing, the best of the best are willing to go in and get them out: at the first sign of decent, upstanding Americans in trouble, push the panic button but until then, let the Burmese militia get away with anything. Rambo's narrative is relatively simple but then again, all of the Rambo films use a relatively simple concept: 'put this killing machine amongst the evil and wrong-doers in the world at that current time'. For the best part, Rambo as a piece of entertainment works; its slick action scenes and stone faced, hard bodied hero are the two outstanding attributes of the film, with the majority of the film revolving around a sort of 'will he/won't he' approach relating to whether Rambo will help these aid workers get upstream - it seems the presence of a woman helps persuade him to go and then later on go back again to rescue them. But then again, Rambo is a clever film and that's something I did not expect. The aid workers are all white, American and seemingly innocent with Michael (Schulze) standing out; he has a grudge against any one who kills people even if it means saving his own life; but later, he will have an epiphany and his ideas will change: the message here is that war does that to you, echoing what John Rambo himself went through in Vietnam. It's interesting to read up on Burma as a nation and discover it gained independence from the British Empire in 1948 and was part of our commonwealth. So here, the Americans go in and clear up a mess that has developed since our leaving. Further examples in the film come in the form of the unexploded bomb that we dropped during World War II; in order to smite the Japanese who had invaded the country  Burma were in our Commonwealth and we had to deal with it, but not now it seems. But the trick here is that the team of mercenaries are not all American like I thought they would be, in fact there are two Englishmen involved. But any hint of maturity is slightly shredded when the character of Lewis (McTavish) is represented as a football hooligan whilst the other Englishman is a calmer, more sedate soldier whose speciality is sniping, itself a calm and sedate skill. Along with this, you have an American named Diaz (Gallegos) and yet resembles a Sikh; then there is Reese (La Botz) who looks like your more typical American soldier. But while Rambo does not have the heart and the message Blood Diamond had, it has all the necessary action and decapitation you'd expect from the genre: people have their insides and throats removed; they become instant mush from HMGs and Rambo's trusty old knife is out of the holster; pining for bad guy flesh. Whilst its fun to see nameless and faceless bad guy soldiers get their comeuppance after we witness raping of women, execution of children and a liquidation of a village, that's all Rambo has to offer; a cheer and a jeer as our testosterone kicks in at the pinnacle of the kill. Rambo isn't anything great but it quenches any action thirst we may or may not have as it rips through a simple three act structure; consisting of maiming, gore and gunfire in an hour and a half. Now that's breakneck speed for you.
10.0~No Salvation For The Unjust... Jsqrd Sign in Permalink The last time I watched a new Rambo movie I was a kid. As an adult watching this I felt I was watching a documentary more than anything. Sylvester Stallone deserves accolades, awards and honors on so many levels for this movie. This was an exceptional movie. I like the Rambo character however while I was watching it the story it's self kept me in the movie and not the hero John Rambo. I felt I was right there living and dieing in every scene. I hope this cleans up during award time because while it is billed as an action movie it has a more powerful message about the suffering of an oppressed people. Thanks Mr. Stallone for enlightening me for a brief moment.
6.0~Sly's Good Rambo Finale! gwnightscream Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone directs and stars in this 2008 action sequel that co-stars Julie Benz. War Vet, John Rambo (Stallone) is living in Thailand as a snake collector and boat man. He gets visited by a group of missionaries asking him to take them up river to Burma so they can help the people. Rambo refuses their request until their lead doctor, Sarah (Benz) convinces him. He takes them and soon they're captured by a corrupt Burmese Major and his army. Rambo and a team of mercenaries attempt to rescue them. Sly did good with this finale and I like Brian Tyler's version of the "It's a Long Road" theme originated by the late great, Jerry Goldsmith. I recommend this.
10.0~Rambo is back............................... vhs1999 Sign in Permalink Having heard all the hype over the past 2-3 years that Stallone was making another rocky and Rambo i didn't think at his age he could pull it off. After seeing rocky balboa i was actually quite impressed and now Rambo exceeded my expectations. I expected this new installment to the series to be the first hour of talking and story build up and then the last 20 minutes to be full on action but as i saw today it was the other way round. I was impressed also that there was no cgi and the explosions were all done old school and that it also looked like Stallone was doing all his own stunts which was great. Other than what i have already said Rambo was and excellent start to the year but i do hope that Stallone doesn't make another Rambo or rocky.
5.0~Rambo is Back and More Violent, But Also More Animated gavin6942 Sign in Permalink John Rambo is retired in Southeast Asia. When a church group approaches him to get a boat ride into Burma, he refuses, calling it "a war zone". But with a little persuading, he agrees. This may have been a mistake, because he spends the rest of the film trying to save the group he took into Burma, many of whom probably didn't make it very far alive. I was very excited for this film for a long time. The first three Rambo movies are all awesome. I figured this one would be, too, especially taking place in Burma, which ended up in the news about the time of the film's release. This played in the movie's favor, since they were able to add a few minutes of actual news footage to the beginning of this one. That just might be the best part of the film. I didn't like the preachiness and moral ambiguity presented. The church group spouts off how they have to save people and it seemed so forced, as if they were really trying to convince the audience and not Rambo. But it was so thick. And then the moral ambiguity: one group completely opposed to killing, while Rambo massacres people wholesale and no lesson is learned by anyone. Is killing moral? Is it moral at least sometimes? What is a justifiable level of violence? This is not tackled at all, even though we can guess that "no violence" is too little, and Rambo's extreme violence is overkill. I loved the intense gore -- arms and legs blown off and people shot at close range. It looked awesome and brought the idea of war home. However, I absolutely hate Sylvester Stallone's directing. The violence was very much computer-generated, something that we did just fine without in the first three films. Where's the squibs? Why make a cartoon? And how come every time action starts, the scene has to move in fast-forward and seem more like a bad collage than an actual fluid event? Stallone, please do not direct movies. Just act in movie where you shoot and punch people, please. If you liked the first three films, you ought to see this one, though you might be disappointed. Then again, you might not be. My Rambo-loving friends really enjoyed this movie, so you might be like them. I haven't heard anyone say they absolutely hated the film, so you're likely to at least appreciate it a little. Check it out.
2.0~What's all the praise for this film. It's as bad as its predecessor, if not worse! illbebackreviews Sign in Permalink Something that I came to realize is that the Rambo series gets worse and worse by every installment. Whilst the first is a classic, the second is decent and the third is a complete failure. Little did I know before watching this film, that Rambo (2008) would be the worst of the three. There is one factor of the film that is great but doesn't necessarily redeem the film and that is the presence of Sylvester Stallone and his fantastic performance as Rambo. The reason it doesn't redeem his character is how they played around with him. For a lot of the film, he was missing, in the background, or not doing very much. I am not referring to him having very few speaking lines which I thought was great, but he just seemed to be sitting down quietly. Rarely did he seem to get in the action and when he finally did, in a scene involving him using a bow and arrow, I came to realize that I was indeed watching a Rambo film. Stallone's performance is fantastic and he still has the physical strength to play a character like Rambo, even though it had been 20 years since the last Rambo film. Everything else about this film frustrated me. The supporting characters were irritating, the story was uninteresting, the overuse of digital blood was infuriating and the action sequences seemed rather bland even with the development of computer technology. These supporting characters had far too much screen time in the film and none were very compelling. The main reason being due to the late Richard Crenna, whose character of Trautman is completely missing from this film. Him being one of the great things about the first installment, seeing him gone was disappointing. This made every other character seem that much worse. Digital blood is always awful and it looks just as bad here as anywhere else. The overuse of digital blood becomes a frustration during an action sequence as the computer effect of blood distracts and detracts from the quality of an already low in quality film. It takes away the excitement, the passion, the realism and even the intensity seeing computer generated blood splatter around. This is overused and looks extremely terrible, especially at the film's anti-climatic end where the terrible digital blood is fully exposed. The action was uninteresting in the film whether it be the complete distraction from digital blood or whether it just not be good. Now, if this is indeed due to digital blood, then this could've easily being overcome by not having digital effects and sticking to practical effects which seem far more realistic, far more gory and more exciting. None of the action, which is really limited appealed to me in this film. The writing and directing is pretty unbearable, especially some horrible dialogue uttered from the captain of the rescue squad, who was the most irritating character of the film. Whether it be his British accent or whether it be the jerk the character was, I don't know but this character was horrible. The direction is also un-impressive due to bad pacing, poor storytelling and simply, not having enough Rambo in the film and instead replacing this with other sequences. 'Rambo (2008)' receives too much praise when it is indeed a pretty terrible action picture which is as bad if not worse than the nightmare that is 'Rambo III' Save your time and money and simply watch the original or even re-watch it. This film has almost no re-watchability in it and certainly doesn't work well as a Rambo film. Poor writing and directing, overuse of digital blood and uninteresting action sequences make this a failure of a film.
6.0~Flawed, bloody action movie. (plot details mentioned) kevin_crighton Sign in Permalink When a group of doctors on a mission to enter Burma for religious and medical reasons, they persuade a reluctant John Rambo to take them their by boat. When they are captured by Burmese troops, Rambo joins a group of mercenaries to go into Burma to rescue them... Stallone, as he did with Rocky Balboa resurrects his other famous character, but the results are not as good. The script is a bit disjointed. Co-written by Stallone, Rambo starts the movie as if he's become a bitter man angry with the world. By the end of it, we see him returning to his old family home back in the US. However we don't see enough in the movie story to suggest how or why his character changed to such an extent. There is a dream sequence where there are references to his former commanding officer Trautman (a brief glimpse of the late Richard Crenna as Trautman is seen from the original ending of First Blood), which implies going 'full circle' but it doesn't really help with this. The supporting cast don't really get that much to do. Julie Benz as Sarah, one of the missionaries is the only one to register. The other characters don't really get enough time to be developed, despite the actors giving decent performances. The 'bad guy' a Burmese soldier is also not really developed. But where Rambo delivers is in the violent action sequences. These scenes are amongst the bloodiest and most violent seen in recent mainstream action movies. Stallone knows aims this movie, not at teens that a lot of major movies aim for, but at the adults. As a result we get exploding head, throats ripped out, people blown to pieces. Stallone deserves credit for not skimping on the violence. The last half-hour of the movie is virtually on-stop violence and it is very impressive. Wisely, the addition of the mercenaries is a good touch. Stallone realizes the 'super-heroics' that a character like Rambo may get away with in the '80s won't work so well these days (giving his characters age) so having the mercenaries makes sense, but like I said they are under-written. It does mean that on occasion Rambo himself takes a back seat to the other characters during the action. Overall however I think the movie isn't too bad. As said, you come to watch a movie like Rambo for the action and it delivers. It's just a pity the writing lets it down.
7.0~don't expect more better than this at this stage ,it is OK to see not ,fantastic but not disappointing also amraampk Sign in Permalink Waiting a long time for rocky also waited for Rambo. This film wasn't that much impressive as its predecessors but not bad at all what some people may think. If you are a hardcore Rambo fan i suggest not to be very much hopeful from this movie because the best performance of an action hero has been given by Stallone in his prime years. Now he is quite old as to be Rambo, he looks older to be a solo fighter but somehow i was impressed the way he again acted and directed another Rambo franchise. The thing which is really deplorable is amount of gore kind of violence in the movie that s what i also don't like while as sly s appearance his performance as Rambo i still admire that. He is still fit and can run a long distance can fight both with weapons and hand to hand, can speak and talk in same manner as previous Rambo's used to. Now its time for him to hang his gun like he hanged his gloves off in rocky and look for other kind of characters. This is not a must see while OK and some how worthy to watch if a Rambo fan you are. 7.5/10, to me it deserves at least
3.0~Bullets have the best lines billyfish Sign in Permalink First blood, second blood, third blood. After about the 50th dose of blood and gore, the movie actually becomes funny (and therefore more enjoyable). Stallone, who actually can act, apparently chose NOT to in this tired continuance of the Rambo story. For those who want to see body parts blown off, shot off, cut off, or PULLED off with bare hands, this is definitely your movie. Otherwise, the plot is stupidly unbelievable and unbelievably stupid, the dialog idiotic (when even present), the acting weak, the characters totally unsympathetic. When Rambo gets chewed out by a goody two-shoes missionary for saving his and fellow missionaries' lives by killing some scumbag pirates, you actually WANT the missionary to get dusted. Unfortunately, he never does. I can't believe so many people actually enjoyed this stinker, and some had the nerve to compare it with Blackhawk Down. That is nothing short of blasphemy. There might have been more ammo expended in Rambo, but that's where any similarity ends. The group I was with actually spent the entire second half of the movie laughing at the comic-book violence spilling all over the screen. I have to admit it was a guilty pleasure after sitting through the excruciatingly boring first half of the movie with its silly plot line and wooden characters. Also, one wonders how Rambo was able to stay stocked up on "Just For Men" hair dye out in the middle of the jungle. One thing I'll say about this movie -- it makes the other Rambo movies look a helluva lot better in every way.
10.0~If Rambo proves anything, it's that Hollywood can still make a great movie when they want to. DamianThorn Sign in Permalink Without a doubt one of the best action films in more than a decade and a very worthy installment to the Rambo saga. Before I go any further, one might look at my previous reviews and simply presume I'm just in love with action movies, or older movies in general but for me it goes much deeper than that. Action movies headed by men like Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger and older films in general are amongst the few things giving me the hope and the drive to get out of bed in the morning. The world around me seems so weak, Hollywood portrays men today as weak, society in general as weak and the world seems lost in a sea of bullshit. I get up in the morning, I get my day done with and I come home to sink into entertainment. Not just any entertainment but movies and television that take me back to a world when Hollywood portrayed people, especially men as strong courageous individuals willing to die for what they believed in. Films like the Rambo movies give me hope, they literally help me to believe that the world is worth fighting for and that all is not lost. This version of Rambo is no different in that regard. In it, Rambo guides a group of missionaries into war torn Burma so that they can help the people living there who are terrorized on a daily basis by thugs working for a corrupt regime that has zero respect for human life. Rambo is reluctant at first, essentially warning the missionaries that you can't stop bullets with bibles. That the kind of people running Burma understand one thing and one thing only, war. Still, Rambo leads them in and drops them off as they've asked him to do. Soon the missionaries are taken hostage and held, forced to watch unarmed villagers slaughtered, children murdered and women raped and beaten. All the while Rambo, back in Thailand is unaware of what's going on. Shortly after the chaos in Burma a team of mercenaries hired to find the kidnapped missionaries come to Rambo and ask him to guide them down river to the village where the missionaries were last known to be. The mercenaries hope to rescue the church group and lead them out of Burma to safety but upon arriving at the village, they are astonished at the carnage that's that's taken place. Most of them want to quit and go back but as is typical of his character, Rambo refuses. In no short order one hell of a war breaks out between the army in Burma, Rambo and the mercenaries. Let me warn you in advance, this is without a doubt one of if not the most shockingly violent Rambo movies to date. This film might well leave you emotionally scarred for life but yet, as with the other installments in the Rambo saga it's a very poignant film. This movie goes out of its way to draw a line in the sand between the good guys and the bad guys. It goes out of its way to make you feel the pain and torment of people living under a dictatorship, under a crooked regime that would murder a child simply for refusing to pick up a gun. Further, it goes out of its way to make the statement that war can only be stopped by war. While we argue politics and political correctness in the comfort of our homes, babies are murdered for fun, women raped and brutalized by the scum that serve these sorts of Regimes and innocent unarmed men of all ages are gunned down like animals. The acting is so solid here that you can't help but believe that what your seeing is real. The special effects are fantastic, the direction script writing and cinematography are all nearly flawless. But above all, like in the previous films Rambo becomes the killing machine he was trained to be. He fights to save as many lives as he can while putting his own life on the line. I would argue that in this film, he battles harder and with a greater purpose than he has ever fought before. This is a fantastic action film that just about anyone should be able to enjoy provided you can handle the blood gore and violence, the latter of which there is plenty. One last note, if you've been following the Rambo saga then the ending here will leave you breathless. There is some debate as to whether or not this is indeed the final installment of First Blood. If it is, then it is a perfect finale to the series. One final and sad note, and I truly am heartbroken by it, is that Richard Crenna (aka Colonel Trautmen) Rambo's mentor and likely his only friend in the world is not in this movie. Crenna passed away in 2003 long before this movie was made. Not only am I sad that such a talented actor died, but it also saddens me greatly that the voice calling Rambo's name when the mercenaries come looking for him wasn't that of Colonel Trautmen. The films makers worked it in such a way that it pays a tribute of sorts to Crenna but still, it's sad that Crenna wasn't part of this movie and even sadder that he is gone from this world forever.
8.0~Awesome ranees1 Sign in Permalink After the long gap, rambo series is back. To put the rambo series in the correct spot in the action genre, you guessed it right Top spot. Sly did a good job as the director cleverly capturing the gritty realism of war in somewhat shocking way. Movie is extremely fast paced, once the action starts it only stops near credits. Story is good ( in action movie terms). Especially i liked the way he developed the villain . You really fell hatred for them. Cast fit perfectly . So want to watch an awesome action movie, Rambo should be your choice. 8 out of 10
8.0~Sly is a legend! nikicam Sign in Permalink I've just got home from the cinema and I can say that I was stunned. Rambo brought my childhood memories back to life when I was watching first three parts several times a month :). Now, after 20 years after Rambo 3 has been released I can say that Stallone did a great job both as an actor and a producer. This movie is too violent, maybe the most violent of all I've watched, although I'm not a fan of violent movies, but then again, this IS RAMBO. Nevertheless, action scenes and movie effects are stunning in this part. This is definitely the best part of Rambo series and I would recommend it to anyone who like action movies or is just a Rambo fan. Movie soundtrack is also good, just as good as it was in the first three parts. Thumbs up!
9.0~Not a must-see, but great action movie to add to list tatmeister Sign in Permalink I went in the movie theater not expecting a good movie. In fact I have never seen the first 3 Rambo's before, and thought this would be another mindless gore fest where Rambo goes on a killing spree. I haven't seen any of Sylvester Stallone's movies, and thought "Oh my god.what am I doing?" By the first 30 minutes, I was right. The actors had no expression or feeling in their dialogue and I wanted to leave to go watch "Cloverfield." But then, it got better. Rambo, an emotionless rock at some times, finally gives in. It takes a big spark to set off the flame in Rambo, but when he is at his Vietnam War's fullest, he can kill with ease. There is no character development (producer expects us to already watch the first 3 Rambos) and the plot is simple. We have a group of missionaries from America who want to ease the situation in Burma, where thousands of normal, everyday civilians are being killed. They enlist Rambo's help, who takes an emotional attachment to a blonde woman. They are captured and the action really sets off from there. The only drawback to the film is that the battle only took place in two scenes. I would have liked to seen Rambo going into a bigger camp and blowing it up. OVERALL I give this film a 9/10 for the action effects.
7.0~"You know his name, and you know what he is capable of" KineticSeoul Sign in Permalink My favorite in the series, it's basically a combination of the first and second movie with a bit realistic approach compared to the past films and that is a good thing. Rambo doesn't use his exploding arrows or bazooka which was featured in the second and third movies, but the action is way more bloody and gruesome this time around and more gripping while being less silly. It has both great and entertaining action while also keeping humanism aspects of it intact, which was in the first Rambo movie. The second and third Rambo movies were basically rescue missions, this one is basically similar, but the people that has been captured are irritating to watch. Yeah they are good people and want to help and change the lives of the people in Burma that is going through some horrendous time, because of the genocide and rape that is being committed against them. But the captured group of people seem stupid, which applies to real people that tried to do similar stuff in other dangerous areas and gets captured and ends up paying dearly for it. The group that is trying to help the poor villagers, although like I said has good intentions doesn't even try to listen to the warning that Rambo gives, who they even know as a person for knowing the rivers and area very well. And to top it off one of the so called helpers for the poor villagers throws a hissy fit when Rambo saves their lives. But the villains this time around makes up for it, this is the most evil group of villains in the Rambo series. They no only commit genocide and rape against innocent villagers, but uses them as slaves for sex and fighting for their own selfish needs. The atrocities the villains commit, even as a audience I wanted to see some vengeance. I literally couldn't help cheer for Rambo when he is fighting his enemies in this one, since I detest the villains a heck of a LOT this time around it was just so satisfying when they start getting owned. Rambo doesn't go on this mission alone this time around, in fact he goes in with a group of mercenaries that actually stand out a bit for side characters, especially the mercenary called School Boy who is the sniper of the group. I know MGS and the video game character Solid Snake is influenced by Rambo, but watching this was like watching MGS with it's stealth kills and all, which is a good thing cause there is hardly any good video game movies. And if there is a MGS movie, it can learn from this film. Overall great film with some messages to go with it, although some of the messages is similar to the first Rambo. I just wished this was longer, cause it felt pretty short and yet complete at the same time. 7.8/10
6.0~a case of "you get what you pay for" at the movies.... Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink In this case, you pay for Stallone drawing LOTS of blood, you got it. Lots of it, with many semi-creatively designed ways of their countless means to an end (blown up, shot, stabbed, ripped out by the throat, shot many times, cluster-bombed, even an arrow for good measure). If you like that in your movies, Rambo (which, I might add, means 'violence' in Japanese) is the movie of the week, or month or so. This isn't to say Sylvester Stallone doesn't make his baby into what he calls as anti-war. Perhaps by the sheer ferocious attempt at this stuff, where it's not even black and white in perspective but just black, then there's almost a fascination with that aspect of it, of things just being in a terrain that may mean to be earnest in messages (helping on another is good, not so much change, one supposes), but comes off as something else completely. The enemy has no personality aside from carnal killings and lust- more-so the killings- which is apt for the only dimension coming from a flashback-dream for Rambo with clips from the past movies. Rambo does, however with these comments about the violence, work as a narrow genre entertainment. Stallone works well at this stuff if he can fit the part. With him, as with many action stars, works when less is more. Ironically, he has a lot more to work with in terms of scope than, say, the first Rambo film (I haven't seen the other sequels yet). While Stallone stumbles from the form path of "save the people, that's your mission" trajectory of the plot with the flashback, there's almost a cartoonish quality when he stays on track. There's a lunacy to a character like Rambo, even as he acts as a superhero for anyone within fifty yards of his reach or running length. To explain the premise is beyond the point, except that this time Rambo is a rogue/renegade in the jungle who catches snakes, is recruited by a church group from Colorado to go into Burma, and then has to rescue them by any means necessary. These means are like a common 80s action film on steroids, which might be the saving grace for the actual script. Unexpectedly heart-pounding, the action goes on and on in a big section of the picture, but there is also a sort of late-night take-over of a Burmese prison camp, and a chilling scene involving some Burmese pirates along the river. The actual theatrics of Rambo seem to hit the kind of ground that made Apocalypto look as trashy as it really was. Rambo is smart as jungle-scented bricks, but at least it's got some attitude, from a dude in his 60s like Stallone no less.
5.0~How to bake a butchery cake. outpatient88 Sign in Permalink This latest tale of John Rambo is sticky sweet gore candy. It seems that Sly woke up one day and decided it was time for a carnival of violence that wold make Verhoeven stand up salute. Easily 60% of this movie an a homage to carnage, a shining temple to trauma with our man Rambo getting gnarly on waves of blood normally reserved for only the most hemorrhage happy anime. Sure sure, there is a message floundering at the bottom of this Mariana's Trench of brutality. It amounts to this; don't go to Burma. Especially if your an unarmed group of idealistic white folk from Colorado. Outside of that handy little moral, the undercurrent of this unabashed slaughter riot is how to make a film into a veritable vessel of viscera. There are zero pulled punches in this tale of a horrid civil war. Men, women and children are killed, maimed, beaten, raped, tortured and eaten. Not in a "suggestive" sense either. Rent. Enjoy. Keep all children under 23 and females out of the room.
10.0~Dumbo springsunnywinter Sign in Permalink I'm not a Rambo fan but I liked the previous three films but the forth instalment is terrible. There was no story and was the same old 80s action flick. It had brainless violence and gore although I don't have a problem with it but I do have a problem with woman & children being abused and killed. It would be OK if it was in one scene but not throughout the whole film. Every time a ship sinks the woman & children are saved first but this movie shows more body count than men. There are many things that should not be shown in the media because it's against human nature and the filmmakers should learn that. They should also learn that we are in the 21st century and the audience wants something different. Films like Die Hard 4.0 and Resident Evil: Extinction has intelligent story-lines but anyone could come up with Rambo IV. Other than that the first 15 minutes was so long that it felt like an hour and from start to finish it had an extremely sick, discussing and depressing atmosphere especially the scene with dead bodies on the mud and had flies buzzing around them. Rambo IV received a lot of negative reviews from film critics & about 30% on rotten tomatoes and there is no wonder why.
7.0~Violent and silly, Rambo is at least entertaining das417 Sign in Permalink We are accustomed to seeing action movies where the hero, though cunning and skill, defeats impossible odds to save the day. While not the first in this genre, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is an action icon of sorts due the series of movies that took him everywhere from a small town in the Pacific Northwest, Vietnam, and Afganistan. Now, with this latest (and last?) movie, we find Rambo back in the jungles except this time he will fight for "humanitarian" reasons. Rambo is living a life of isolation and self hatred in Thailand where he spends his days hunting cobras and other snakes. When he is not hunting cobras for money, he uses his old boat to move up and down the local rivers where he has become something of an expert in terms of navigation. The existence is menial and hard but it is enough to help Rambo escape the ghosts of his past. However, a group of well meaning but innocent American missionaries decide to ask Rambo for help in order to smuggle them into Myanmar (Burma's real name). Michael (Paul Schulze) is the typical well intentioned, but perhaps ignorant, American who believes that good intentions alone and medicine will solve the world's problems. His friend and teammate Sarah (Julie Benz) is perhaps even more ignorant but just as caring even though we have to question if she really knows what she is getting herself into. Of course Rambo, knowing the ways of the real world, can only think that Michael, Sarah, and the other missionaries are waisting their time but he agrees to help after a "motivational" speech by Sarah that appeals to his inner goodness. Perhaps, after all, he does still have some humanity left in him. As expected Michael, Sarah, and the rest of the team are caught up in the fighting when a local warlord attacks the village they have come to help. This begs the question as to why Michael, who supposedly had been to Myanmar five times before, would be so foolish as to allow his team to be so easily caught in a village that would obviously be a target. Despite this rather small plot hole, we witness the entire village massacred in a graphic scene that includes rape, men being shot in cold blood, and women shot down as the run. Another day in Myanmar we are expected to believe. Rambo finds all of this out through the pastor of the missionaries's church. In a rather ironic turn at least in regards to Michael's earlier pious wailing on the evil of violence, this pastor has hired a group of mercenaries to rescue the team and he is asking Rambo to transport them up river. Of course Rambo, remembering Sarah's words on helping people, decides to take them. The rest of the movie is a violent expose on how Hollywood can now realistically portray violence. There is no point in going into details since we know that Rambo will of course rescue (most) of the missionaries and lead the band of mercenaries to victory. The warlord's troops will die violent deaths and the movie will climax with something blowing up and killing more people. The good guys of course will win and then everyone will go home including Rambo himself who decides to return to the small farm or ranch that his father owns in the United States. Violent and silly, Rambo is at least good entertainment if one enjoys mindless violence and blood. If were as easy as Rambo portrays, then perhaps all the world really needs is a few guys with sensitive hearts who know how to kill the bad guys. 7/10
9.0~This movie is awesome! worldtour06 Sign in Permalink When I bought this movie on Tuesday I had never seen it before. I was a huge fan of the previous movies and was very excited about this one. This film is an action packed thrill ride from beginning to end. I had heard before from different reviews that this movie was so violent it was disturbing. NOT TRUE! If you are a true war and action movie fan you will love it. Syl is great in this movie and you will never think to yourself "man that guy is old for this". He fits perfectly. the dialog although sometimes cheesy is great. the acting is good for an action movie, and the violence is some of the greatest i have seen in recent action movies. i was losing faith in action until this movie came out. its great. watch it.
10.0~Rambo......enough said!! (no big spoilers) wakemark Sign in Permalink You know when you are watching a darn good film when you are desperate for the main character to show their skills when someone makes fun of them. In this its the rubbish mercenary who makes fun of Rambo and throughout the bad mouthing i just thought "oooooo.....that there is John Rambo...". Also later on after Rambo makes his skills known to the mercenary's, i was just waiting for a man to say "who do you think you are, Rambo!!" But anyway the movie was incredible, easily the best action picture I've seen in along time and i mean long time. It was constantly entertaining, i was so engulfed in the whole film i actually stayed while the ending credits went up just to see if he finally did meet his father. I just wanted to see what happened and dare i say incredibly well shot for the ending. Though i felt the ending crept up on me from behind, i was enjoying the film so much i didn't really want it to end, just pure escapism but quality never the less. Some say he's lost it but i think he's finally starting to find it. The characters he works with have their unique little quirks but Stallone stands out by far, yet like any other film there are a few bits where you just think...mm mm...i dunno about that bit. But honestly heres a film you can finally walk out a cinema saying "I'm not to upset i paid 6 bucks to see that, was damn worth it!!" Now adays its also rare for a young person to show a look of concern whilst watching a violent movie, the village scene and the mine rice field scenes...talk about heart pounding stuff!! But the shocker has to be when the child is thrown into the fire...i felt so in on the story, i was drawn by the scenes of pure hellish evil. Stallone is skilled at building support for a character or theme, rocky is another prime example of this, Stallone loves to get people behind the hero. He loves to get people so involved rather than just to feel as though they are watching a movie. Think back to cliffhanger...were you not just praying from him to keep his grip?? Soundtrack...pure ambiance and atmosphere, the Rambo title...the theme when he stands triumphant at the end whilst looking over the destruction...genius...Stallone actually lets the viewer feel proud of what they have seen done, makes your hairs stand on end and a slight smile on your face. Anyone who says Stallone is not an actor needs a left hook, look at Rambo and Rocky, Rambo is hardened and theoretically emotionless towards his actions where as Rocky shows his feelings, to his son, Adrian and even the boxing commission in rocky balboa. One film for those who doubt his acting ability, COPLAND, see it...you'll be amazed at how talented Stallone actually is. He's passionate in all he does, he puts a lot of time and sweat into his work, he writes and directs, he isn't afraid to take the "boo's" which might come with it. How many folk laughed when they heard about rocky 6? well I'm sure they are eating their own words now. This man has truly came into his own, he's now enjoying making films rather than concerning himself with his pocket money. Which i think shows in his work, its more enjoyable for us as an audience. Stallone is, i think, a real credit to the film industry. He has brought in countless dollars through his movies, he's created legendary characters and a hero to many. How many people idolise or love rocky, they don't love Stallone they love the character he made. This man is like a great tasting wine, he has improved through age and is finally letting us sample some of the unique and powerful flavours which lay in his vintage, yet potent mind. Hail Stallone!!!
7.0~Stallone knows how to entertain woodyns Sign in Permalink I saw Rambo today and I was really praying for it not to be like any other failed Vietnam/war sequel. Those cheap Hollywood movies that rely solely on CGI to impress. I was surprised and happy and exited and shaken and moved sweating while watching this nice entertainment movie. The story is simple and does not have much meaning but Stallone made the whole experience an exiting one. This time it is not Rambo killing the whole country which makes the story better to believe. If you want to be entertained, watch this movie. The score is great, the cinematography is nice and the effects are one of the best I have seen in any other war movie. No other Rambo compares to First Blood but I would say this one is the second best! worth watching and I will surely add it to my Rambo trilogy collection.
7.0~Human Growth Hormone UTSeminole Sign in Permalink I haven't seen the movie yet but can't wait to; I plan on going this weekend...Every other comment I've read says something about Stallone's size and how he looks good to be 62 years old. He took HGH or human growth hormone to bulk up for this movie. That's the reason he looks good at his age. That being said i like just about every Stallone movie and don't have a problem with this at all, just letting every body know that may not have known. Any word of Stallone's next "big" movie??? Anyway I'm going to see Rambo this weekend and from everything I've heard looks pretty damn good but is it really worth this high of a score??
8.0~Why this is the best Rambo timbermisc Sign in Permalink Cinematography is improved. Lots of HandyCam shots to give a nervous feel to some scenes. Shot in a journalistic style sometimes. Combat scenes have the same realism as seen in "Saving Private Ryan". Rambo is on steroids, and he is at his strongest, ever. Difficult to believe that he is 62. Rambo rarely speaks. Therefore, no trite lines spoken. I felt stronger as I left the movie house. The audience gave applause; and the male audience took the violence seriously; we were fascinated by some of the killing scenes. No sex in the movie, but some insinuation of rape. No reference to Vietnam. That war is behind us, yea! We are in Burma. Hard to believe that this will be the last Rambo, it is the best Rambo movie ever. The story is simple: a rescue mission. We can concentrate on the violence and action which there is much. You'll feel pumped and stronger when you leave the movie house.
9.0~an important big issue movie... with an action hero dropped in to make things right JiMuR Sign in Permalink this isn't just a movie, it's a wake up call. it's incredibly violent, but NEEDS TO BE, this is actually happening in places like Burma and Stallone wants us to open our eyes with the help of a movie hero, it gets people to listen. it's powerful, epic, violent and very important. Rambo has lost his faith in humanity but retains his moral compass, you have nothing but hate and scorn for the Burmese army, a genocide squad consisting of rapists, sadists and cold hearted killers, the camera doesn't shy away from the atrocities they commit, we see the rapes and the mass killings of men, women and even small children. And the last five minutes are the most awesome and satisfying action sequences in the history of action movies. some scenes are very hard to watch, some terrible things happen to innocent people for purposes of entertainment or the self righteousness that is racism, you will be tempted to look away, but you should look, let yourself become full of hate, it allows the ending to have even more impact and so much more satisfying. WATCH THIS FILM, the acting is reasonable, the pacing is perfect, the CGI is well used and the story has a point. it's so real, gritty and grungy, that seeing it is like you're actually there, I was glued to the screen and when it was over I wanted more. it's so under-rated it's criminal, the violence is not gratuitous, the action is amazing and Stallone's directing and perception of a character are still top notch after all this time, the thing about Sly is, he's not afraid. see it, I highly recommend it.
7.0~Live for Nothing or Die for Something claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink In Thailand, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is living peacefully capturing snakes and transporting people and cargo in an old boat. When a group of Christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in Burma to help the locals, the reluctant Rambo only accepts when Sarah Miller (Julie Benz) presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission. Rambo leaves the group in the requested location, but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of Major Pa Tee Tint (Maung Maung Khin), the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted. Later a member of their church meets Rambo and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries. "Rambo 4" is a great action movie, if not the best of the franchise, at least in the same level of "First Blood". The story is simple; actually there are many other movies with a group of mercenaries assigned to rescue prisoners in a jungle crowded of enemies. However, there is a non-stop action, with violent scenes, lots of gore, shootings and explosions, great special effects and an extremely dangerous hero that lives for nothing and decides to risk his life and if necessary die for something. Professional critics will certainly hate this movie, I have seen statistics in Internet about the violence in the story, but I really did like it. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): "Rambo 4"
3.0~Rambo is Stallone in a cheap wig. Vivekmaru45 Sign in Permalink This is NOT the Stallone we know. The guy looks old, feels old and IS OLD. His face has lost consistency like latex when it has been stretched to the limit too long. Also I think he's wearing a wig too. He should have spared us the exposure, but NO he had to made a fourth edition to the Rambo series. He very shrewdly tries to get our sympathy by making the lead villain a very bloodthirsty and generally unpleasant character to be around with. Then he makes his appearance and jumps into the fray guns and custom built machete (or what the hell do you call it ???) to boot. Ya Stallone gore is good but in your hands it is BAD. Overall conclusion (it doesn't need a brain surgeon to give one..) 1. Bad movie (sorry kids, its time to watch Bugs Bunny again...) 2. Bad Acting (as if Stallone ever DID know HOW to ACT) 3. Bad editing(Stallone gave the editor some rusty garden shears) 4. Bad musical score (Stallone with a synthesizer=HELL) 5. Bad casting (these people were so desperate for a handout...they...) N.B. It is advisable to phone your shrink after watching this film for symptoms of brain damage.
3.0~Nice look into Stallone's mindset. joestank15 Sign in Permalink Rambo - Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is out on his fourth outing in which he turns the bad Taiwanese people into hamburger meat because both the good and bad guys want a pretty white woman named Sarah (Julie Benz of Dexter). Directed, produced, written by, and starring Sylvester Stallone, this film is nothing less than a dedication to Sly by Sly and a big middle finger to everyone else. You could pretty much pick any "ism" involving prejudice you like and it would stick to this film. Racism and sexism are most prominent. Benz's character has nothing to do but play hostage or stand by looking worried as Sly's body count drifts into the hundreds. The people of Burma (shot in Taiwan), and Asians by extension, are evil barbarians who cause evil for the heck of it, spear people through building posts, toss children into fires, and rape and steal and torture for no reason and it goes on and on and on... As Rambo puts it: "Those men would've raped her FIFTY TIMES over and cut your f****** heads off!"wow Rambo. you are so right. Basically, it's a short sighted narrow minded world view for the stupid to congregate around. We watch Rambo grab dangerous snakes by the hand, kill people and fish alike with bows, and rip men's throats out with his bare hands and massive biceps. It's not tongue and cheek. Sly actually believes it. And it would be really funny if it weren't so often boring. Also that it comes from such a hypocritical source considering gun control and just about everything else he opens his mouth about. Violence isn't bad. It's just all the violence not done by Sylvester Stallone that's bad. Some highlights: this film contains a claymore explosion that resembles a miniature hydrogen bomb. THAT was hysterical, but somewhere, deep down, Sly believes that was true. It's such a tasteless racist piece of he-man chest beating bulls--- that I can only afford to give Rambo a D.
10.0~Kickass!! aniruddh_bansal Sign in Permalink I love mindless action movies.. so i love Rambo!! But this one was much more violent than the previous three Rambo movies. I guess thats because of the modern advancements in special effects which were obviously not possible in the earlier Rambo movies. For those who like action, and violent action at that, cannot afford to miss this! Go now and watch it! This movie is fast, bloody, explosive, gory and full of endless action sequences. People believe that as Sly is so old now there would be no point in making a Rambo movie at this point of time. But he sure has proved all of you wrong. Believe me, he still has it, even after so many years. He proved it in Rocky Balboa and he has done it again with this one. His performance was amazing. And even looks-wise, he still has those muscles. The acting by others was also very good, specially Julie Benz and the guy who played the British mercenary. His dialogs were funny. So all in all, a must watch for all Sly fans, and action fans in general.
7.0~Quality action, but nothing more thepts Sign in Permalink This is probably one of the best Rambo-movies in terms of storytelling and filming quality. I enjoyed this, no doubt, but you notice early on there is a lot of classic American action movie "formula" to it; building up the enemy as "the bad guy who deserves to die.. horribly", Christian people/Americans as the good guys, a hesitant "I don't want to fight" John Rambo, and finally, a cascade of effectful killings. Some people here claim that there is a moral here, and that John Rambo is a guy with "strong moral values", that's more or less bullshit. This is a poor insight, to put it mildly, into the Burma conflict, and Rambo himself isn't really believable as the guy who is forced to be a killing machine against his own will. But as long as you accept these simple parts, it's OK. The CGI is bad. Basically, you could spot the CGI in every shot. (simple particle effects when people "explode" - as they do a lot in this movie when bullets hit them. Also, wrong colour on the blood). The movie is also very short. The running time says 87 minutes, but that includes almost 15 minutes of credits. I think this is a good thing for the movie. All in all, I was entertained throughout, I kept watching despite only intending to watch half of it. It was very cool to see the "hard mercenaries" realize that Rambo was more than "just a boatman". I think they could've made something more out of that! Great action movie, but as a movie in general, pretty simple stuff. solid 7/10.
7.0~Met my expectations Luigi Di Pilla Sign in Permalink What I missed in this very brutal and hard Rambo movie were battle scenes with helicopters or other air planes. Therefore I have seen a show with lot of bullets that found at least their targets very exactly. Congratulations to Sylvester Stallone for his constant cool performance in this role. Then great respect for his direction and the superb images. I find the running time is just right but I have to admit that I wanted it continues. I hope there well be another sequel. I was very impressed by the bloody special effects that I have never seen before. Normally I don't like to see violent films but here I make an exception because the Rambo or Terminator series are my favorites in my generation. Final vote: 7/10. A must see for all Stallone fans.
10.0~Live for nothing or die for something prekaste Sign in Permalink One of the best action movies ever. It's anti militaristic aspect gives another level to the film, presenting the true face of war and it's consequences. Rambo definitely achieved to maintain the title of the anti-hero model of our generation. Despite the fact that the movie leaves you with the anticipation of another half an hour at least, it poses as a complete action film as ever. Along with the "First Blood", "John Rambo" is one of the most realistic and raw-content movies of the kind, giving out the disturbing reality, such as the war veterans discrimination and the genocide taking place in Berman, that hasn't taken the publicity it needs.
8.0~Graphic Non-stop Violent Kill Fest :) jimmyhenry Sign in Permalink There is no real plot, no real character development, and little dialog. The plot can be summed up as: some bad guys capture some good guys, Rambo and a team of mercenaries have to go save them, and a lot of people die along the way. But it still works! Why? Because it doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, which is a Graphic Non-stop Violent Kill Fest. The bloodthirsty will love this movie. I haven't seen a movie this violent and graphic in quite some time. The killing starts a couple minutes into the movie and doesn't stop for the next 90 minutes. This is exactly what we want in a Rambo movie and Stallone delivers big time. It really feels like, at times, we are watching real battles take place. Imagine the intensity of the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan. There are several parts of the movie that are that cool and that intense. Don't listen to the critics, who are trashing this movie. This kind of movie is never going to get good reviews from the critics. Listen to those who have seen it. If you liked previous Rambo's, you'll like this one.
3.0~Basically waste of time tomas-457-247973 Sign in Permalink Stallone is only good thing in this film - he plays good, believable role in poorly written script with lot of violence, senseless cruelty and illogical actions. It is more like a desperate attempt to get some of the old Rambo glory. A pity that it didn't worked. Quite good camera, mediocre cut, few (poor) dialogs, mostly no notable music (except slight variant of main theme). There is only one "flashback" reflecting the original saga that tells us nothing about it (for those who don't know it), the motives of main character are also hidden very well, almost not existent. I would only understand this part as a kind of conclusion to the saga, which was on similar level as for Rocky. But with less emotions and more disgust from all the unnecessary blood.
8.0~I was surprised, impressed, shocked and entertained adamcarlton Sign in Permalink From the trailers and taking into account Stallone's age, i was expecting this to be a bit of a mess. Though i was proved wrong once the action started to get going, and the film just felt really well done. I'm not without my criticism though. There's 3 things i felt stopped it from me giving a 9 or 10. Those are: Run time, Camera, and the fact that Stallone isn't really the lone hero type Rambo we knew him as once. He doesn't really take on a million enemies alone like he did in the previous films. He has aid, and just doesn't do very much. For the first half of the film he just takes some people in a boat, he does a little solo after that, taking out like 5 guys in the blink of an eye but then he is always with other people, and at the end just sits behind a mounted machine gun mowing down people while some American mercenaries pick others off with AK47's. Then it's over. When there's action and death, this movie is virtually unparalleled. The gun kills (specially the .50cal sniper and the mounted machine gun) are so brutal it really 'wow'd me and that doesn't happen often when i watch an action film. The one other thing i was a bit P'd off with was the camera at times. Was very shaky at points id rather have just been able to see what was going on from a steady-cam. If you love action movies though, you love Rambo or just want something cool to watch for an hour and 20min, don't miss this one. 8/10
1.0~this is war haroldkumarfan Sign in Permalink this is an awful awful movie. Mr Stallone please please i'm beggin you do not participate to another film. If i watch a nother film of yours i'm gonna puke all over the floor. Please consider my suggestion and take me as a brother. Mr Stallone take it easy. Don't get any hard feelings but i'm must say you are the worse actor in all damn world. The movie is full cliché. You are beaten by a nother guy and take him in the last second. What is the deal. So you are the world's savior. Really i don't need especially you Mr Stallone to save my damn world.So you better hide well with your green paints in the damn forest before I finger point you out from Hollywood.
10.0~Was Surprised....But Blew MY freakin Brians Out sidbalboa Sign in Permalink I went for this movie sensing that this movie will be STallone..Stallone and only Stallone with his rifle n going solo....but it was a pleasant surprise to see him with some others as wel.....portraying his age that he cant do it all solo nemore.....though i did miss his rifle and the serrated knife......i would have preffered ti to be a tad bit less gory.......i simply loved the ending seeing him go back to Arizona to his home to see his father i guess..........was pretty surprised to see getting a simultaneaous release here in India as we saw rocky6 like after 2 months........all i can say is though..."THANK YOU MR.STALLONE"........and since he has not yet unconfirmed reports of this being the last rambo film.....all i wanna say is BRING US MORE..........
4.0~Not a suitable sequel hvh80 Sign in Permalink Well, for an action movie I think it's a quite good and entertaining film but compared to the other three Rambo movies I think it's not a suitable sequel. Indeed, this movie was a big disappointment for me. "Why all the sudden all the blood and gore???!!!" That was my big question during watching this fourth part because it seemed to had the upper hand in the movie. It's a pity that Sylvester Stallone decided to bring it this way because this is not the case in the other three Rambo's. As far as the acting performances goes, it's quite the opposite of the original "First Blood" which was very well acted. I think this movie is overestimated!
7.0~Good for the gore factor dcobbimdb Sign in Permalink This movie got really high ratings when it first came out. IMDb had it at 8.8 and it's fallen a bit since then. So even know Sly is pushing 60+ figuring with the initial ratings and the fact that he still had some gas in the tank I gave it a shot. Overall it was pretty good 7/10. The story was less than original and quite predictable, but lets face it you don't go see Rambo for the deep storyline. The action was good and by far one of the goriest movies I'd seen in a while. I'm actually surprised it got away with an R rating considering the amount of gore shown. The first two movies had no where near the amount of gore this one did. So the gore factor IMO is what everyone was hyped up about and rightfully so. Where did it fall short? Well for one the running time was only 93 minutes, so figure 85 without the credits... But I checked back and both the first two movies were about the same, so I guess when we've reached the age where movies tend to be 2+ hours, all sudden a 90 minute movie seems short. Lack of memorable bad guys. For an action movie to be truly successful you need bad guys with some clout or flare. Either scary, mean, tough, intelligent, basically some noteworthy qualities to give there character some depth. Other then slaughtering innocent villagers they were just guys with guns. Moreover they came across more like idiots with guns who made good canon fodder. Even the main bad guy didn't have more than a lackluster sinister stare. Only other complaint was the lack of a climactic edge. Consider every movie has a climax and Rambo had a great climax & end sequence, but the climactic edge is where all hope seems lost, the good guys are about to die and you as the viewer are on the edge of your seat. Now while Rambo did attempt to have a brief period like this, I wasn't on the edge of my seat because I didn't care about the mercenaries and also just figured Rambo was going to swing into action and save the day anyway. So while the end sequence was great and gory, it kind of lacked that suspenseful moment just before, at least for me.
10.0~Sly u Ramboed the screen maroun_lebnan Sign in Permalink I've heard a lot good stuff about this movie and I thought I've to watch it to be sure. Mr. Sly you have Ramboed the screen. And they say the man is old, man you still rock and still nr1 action figure. This is a masterpiece coming from a master. Rambo4 is the movie that takes you back to old time's great action that it has fade away since this new era of digitalized action, a lot of special effects and a very complicated and many times not understandable plots. This masterpiece of Rambo has a very simple story but that's its strength. It has an old concept of row action but that's the special about it and that's what makes it great. The genius act of Sly and the whole crew and the excellent plot, takes you back to the very first Rambo movie. Many people have complained about the roughness in this movie, I tell you people: the roughness in the movie it's a kind of a description of the rage against the mercilessness in the world and in that specific place on earth, it's the Rambo's feelings against those killers who've killed and raped many children and women. This movie is definitely a 10 stars one, and I recommend everybody who wants to relive the 80.s good day's action to watch it and enjoy it.
10.0~The Best Action Movie of All Time joshwarner Sign in Permalink "RAMBO" is incredible. Easily the best action movie of all time. Stallone is also one of the best actor/writer/director's of all time too because his films are entertaining. Last December's "Rocky Balboa" is one of my favorite films. "RAMBO" is now one of my favorites too. This movie has non-stop action and will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time. People need to understand there IS violence in war. There is also a great message behind this film too. I also liked the using of the real life situation in Burma and plugging Rambo into that situation much like Rocky was plugged in to the real world of boxing in Rocky Balboa. This film also puts a great ending to the RAMBO saga. The Rambo movies are the best action films and "RAMBO" is easily the best one. I give this movie 10 stars and two thumbs way, way up. Go see this film. Then go see it again!
10.0~Rambo Rocks Stallone Rocks Even More jord07 Sign in Permalink this is one of the greatest action movies i have ever seen. credit to Stallone, he has done done a fantastic job directing and writing this movie. action movies of the 80s where second to none, Stallone brings that back to life in fantastic form. the last die hard hard and terminator were poor because they where not 18 (R) rated movies like the first ones. Stallone keeps this promise here and he does a suburb job. violent fast and just plain great. and a good old 90 minute movie. for people who respect a great action movie this is for u. it don't get any better than this. its took years for anyone to make this sort of movie like this again. rocky balboa was a great ending, and hes done ever better here. but i have a feeling the story is not over yet. Stallone is a acting and directing legend full stop.
9.0~The best Rambo yet! madrob999 Sign in Permalink Great movie. Out of the original 3, the first one was a solid film, and the most believable. The third one had the highest body count and was the most outlandish and cartoon-like, but in my opinion, the funnest and most enjoyable of the original 3. Part 2 was probably a cross between the two, not as believable as the first, but not as crazy as the 3rd. On to RAMBO (part 4). This was the best one of the series. It is also by far the bloodiest, goriest, grizzliest, and most brutal. Something about it, perhaps the way it was shot and the lighting, but it had a documentary-like feel to it, and it felt more real than any of the earlier films. I was worried about a sequel this long since the last one, but this far exceeded my expectations.
7.0~The Gore the Merrier ElijahCSkuggs Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone is as juiced up as ever in the latest and probably last RAMBO film. It's filled with bullets, explosions, bad acting and poor writing. But that doesn't matter when watching RAMBO, because what you want (bloody action) is what you get. And in some cases, you get a lot. A missionary group wants to aid Burmese people being exterminated by ruthless Thai pirates and rebels. Led by a cute blond and a whiny hippie, they contact Rambo at his isolated poisonous snake exhibit (awesome), and ask him to bring them down the river. Spouting curse words form a volcanic neck, he doesn't help them at first, but after a rather contrived "explanation" scene in the pouring rain, Rambo is enlightened, and off they go. Havoc ensues soon after, as Rambo and a gang of mercenaries go out into the jungle to find survivors. The film is really violent, with great scenes of bloody carnage. Limbs are blown off, guts are dropped, throats are torn, and Rambo's machete and crossbow are used to perfect effect. Apart from some really silly dialog, it's an above average action film that thrives when the blood spills. Probably one of the gorier action films ever made. Which is a good thing.
8.0~The epitaph of 80's action films: Stallone proves who's the real boss t_atzmueller Sign in Permalink The first Rambo film, "First Blood", is often hailed as the original slice n'dice action flick, the grandfather of the hero-guns-down-armies films; the peak of brutality of it's time. Kind of ironic, considering the Rambo doesn't actually kill anybody (save the sheriff who fell from the helicopter and who nobody liked in the first place). Still, the reputation alone got "First Blood" unto the index-lists of many countries; in German video-stores the film remains buried in the "adult"-section to this day. By the end of "First Blood" it became clear that John Rambo himself was the victim; a broken spirit that would get the red carpet into any psychiatric hospital. But the fans wanted none of that. They wanted the invincible man-o-war Rambo, the fighting machine to mow down legions of adversaries, and they would get just that in the following sequels. The early 21st century wasn't kind to our favorite action-heroes. Lundgren and Segal produced straight-to-video schlock, Van Damme began looking like a mean drunkard and even action-god Chuck Norris was kept alive only by a row of lame internet-jokes. And Arnold was governor. A new generation of action-heroes had come, Vin Diesel and Jason Stratham, stone-faced and uncharismatic to the last man, and the end of a genre seemed nigh. Come the year 2008 and Stallone, like a dying bull in a Spanish arena, rose in a final, steroid-fueled blaze of glory, giving the new generation the virtual stinky-finger and showing them who's the boss, once and for all. Almost as if make sure, that nobody would ever top him, he broke Arnies "Total Recall"-record and took his seat on top of a throne made of skulls and disemboweled body parts. The professional critics generally dismissed the fourth part of the Rambo-saga, mainly due to the high gore-content; 32 percent at a certain spoiled vegetable site speak a clear language. Denizens of the internet saw that different, hailing "Rambo" as a masterpiece; some celebrated Stallones carnage for it's own sake – gutting, throat-ripping, evisceration and generally turning the human anatomy into a bloody puddle – yet others saw a distinct message: war isn't pretty. Actually it's brutal and sickening; sure "Rambo" might animate you to play an ego-shooter on your computer but doubtful whether it would animate anybody but hardened psychopaths to join any army. Similar to the original pulp novellas, John Rambo shows what he is: a human machine conditioned only for carnage and mayhem - and at the same time gives us a glimpse of what COULD have happened to the Townsters in "First Blood", if Rambo had unleashed his real fury. Whether seen as a movie with a message or a simple, hyper-violent action-flick, "Rambo" is the ultimate epitaph for all "Rambo"- and "Rambo"-like films.
8.0~Stallone is BACK davidej Sign in Permalink After seeing last year's Rocky Balboa, and now Rambo, I can't help but conclude that Stallone has really poured his heart and soul into these two films - and it shows. Some people will never like violent action flicks, but for those who do, Rambo is first rate and stays true to itself. A man of few words, but intense personal conflict, Stallone's Rambo is an iconic presence on screen. He fears nothing and can do nearly anything. Still, the one thing he lacks, and that has driven him to an almost monastic existence, is the basic faith that the people from his own country will ever value him or accept him. He sees himself as little more than a weapon left behind, a relic from a war that had long since faded away. Like an ancient bomb, lying deep within the jungle, Stallone's Rambo is a dormant force of boundless fury, which, like his hope in humanity, is slowly fading away. But there is hope yet for Rambo - and for the tsunami of destruction that moviegoers undoubtedly wait to behold. A couple of good-natured, but bumbling missionaries enter the fold. The smoldering of Rambo begins to commence. Then - BAM - non-stop, big-block, action euphoria. A million bullets and a mountain of bad guys later, the movie gracefully draws to a close. Sure, it's violence, and it's definitely not Shakespeare. But don't dismiss this as a mindless movie. Like the original, First Blood, there's powerful meaning and metaphor for those keen enough to look. And for those who know about the problems in Southeast Asia, the movie draws admirable attention to problems that really do exist. Lots of violence, but far from pointless. 8/10, welcome back Sly
9.0~A MUST see bowenericster Sign in Permalink ...not just for the carnage and mayhem, which were brilliantly done, but for the bigger context in which this movie is set. In the same way Hotel Rwanda opened many peoples' eyes to the genocide in that country, Rambo calls to light the current and ongoing struggles by the Burmese people. Yes, the movie is gory with heads being blown off and limbs flying, and there are scenes which are appalling to watch on an emotional level; at the same time though, to downplay the violence in these scenes for the sake of the squeamish would minimize the urgency of the Burmese struggle. The movie also addresses the conflict between peace/war, naivety/reality with the contrast between the missionary workers, who believe in change and become ensnared in the conflict, and the merciless Generals who perpetuate the war by indiscriminately murdering the innocent. There was not a moment in the movie when I felt bored, and the action scenes were amazing. I had to wonder though when I left the theater, how many people are really going to 'get it' and think about it beyond the visual spectacle that it is. By far this was the best of the Rambo series, and a must see for fans and the socially conscious alike.
5.0~Has some great action, but is bogged down by too much useless story DonFishies Sign in Permalink Rambo looked like a joke from the beginning. Sure, Sylvester Stallone brought back Rocky in Rocky Balboa, and the movie turned out to be better than anyone expected, but bringing back Rambo too? That seemed like a bit of a stretch. And while the trailers only perpetuated how voraciously violent and ridiculously over the top the film would be, it continued the joke too. After a minor lesson on the civil war in Burma, The film picks up with Rambo (Stallone) in Thailand, being paid to catch deadly snakes for a crowd pleasing daredevil show. A group of Christian aid workers approach him for help into the war torn nation, and despite his warnings, he takes them. Of course, things go wrong, and the workers are kidnapped. And as the trailers have already told you, Rambo gets sent in to help (albeit as a boat man for a group of mercenaries). There really is not much else to say about the film. Despite running in at around ninety minutes, it takes more than half the film to arrive at the first sequencing involving the group of mercenaries. I realize that they wanted the film to have some sort of substance, but by making the audience wait for the balls-to-the-wall action to begin, the film kind of lost me. I know a few scenes (including a small black and white flashback to scenes from the original three films) are thrown in for nostalgic reference, but the film does not seem anywhere near as heartfelt or meaningful as Rocky Balboa. It seems more like Stallone hit gold with a sixth Rocky, and rushed head first into Rambo without totally thinking it through. But of course, having never seen a Rambo movie, I could be wrong in thinking that there was too much emphasis put on waiting for the action. The film also does not deliver any character development or even useful dialogue. Stallone spends most of the first half of the film saying "Go home" a lot, and looking downtrodden and depressed. He obviously snaps out of the funk by the time he heads into Burma himself, but that is hardly a development. None of the aid workers are really given personalities or motivations other than "wanting to help" and the mercenaries are seem like aggravated caricatures of better written groups from other films. It also does not help that none of them seem to have any useful lines, and are all frightened of Stallone, even when he is going all emo. The bad guys in Burma are not much better, and despite a plethora of dialogue, do not seem to be all too menacing. Whether that is because we know Rambo will give them their just desserts or not is rather unclear. The action, when it does eventually pick up, is fast, furious and unrelenting. There are some very violent scenes in the early moments in the film, but hardly any of them qualify as action until Rambo gets involved. I liked its relentlessness and its unforgiving sense of violence, and can greatly appreciate the fact that the film did not have any of its blood toned down to be closer to a PG-13. This is the first R-rated action film in a long time to just drown in blood, and I think it benefits the film in more than a few ways. Limbs fly, people lose their heads, people are incinerated, and that is just the start of some of the pain Rambo throws down. And what makes the action even greater is that it is not edited in that awful music video style like so many other modern action flicks. It stays on the action, maybe for a little too long. While Live Free or Die Hard was a great entry for Die Hard films, it lacked what the series was known for just so it could make a ton of money. Rambo keeps it in, and whether it makes a ton of money or not, will probably be much more appreciated by fans (or just action movie junkies in general). In fact, strip away the first fifty minutes of the film, and leave just the scenes leading up to the final battle and the final battle itself, and I think this movie could have been a solid action romp. But making us wait way too long for the great action to kick in is a bit of a disappointment. What I was also not a fan of was the general message the film had about the struggles in Burma. Early in the film, we see more than a few Burmese villagers getting killed for almost no reason. Are we supposed to be learning something from this, or seeing it as a form of entertainment? I realize that Stallone wanted to make a point with some of the sequences, and he does for the most part. But by glamourizing the violence for the entirety of the film (albeit more so in the late stages than early on), it just seems like a little too close to reality, and far too close to bad taste. I was not necessarily disgusted by it, but a little off-put by how harrowingly violent and sad it was, especially for a silly throw-away action film. It does not help that the writing does not make for giving good messages either. What was a bit of a surprise for me was the lush cinematography. The jungles are beautifully captured, and the picture perfect villages look brilliantly authentic. In certain cases, it even looks too good for the movie it is being featured in. While there are some great action sequences to be found, the film is bogged down far too much by the first half. Taking away some of it, and adding in more nostalgia, could have only made the film more worthwhile. 5.5/10.
7.0~Flawed, idiotic but also good crybabystinkypoo Sign in Permalink The story doesn't make sense; if the Christian do-gooders have been to Burma before why on this occasion do they need Rambo? And Rambo's blasting truck loads of Burmese soldiers, but these boys were kidnapped from villages and made into soldiers, so Rambo needs lessons in compassion. But this movie's a shoot 'em up so Rambo needs lots of so called baddies to blow holes in. And another stupid thing; the rebels helping Rambo at the end: cheesy. Apart from that Rambo's a decent, refreshingly hardcore, kick-arse action flick. And at times genuinely moving. Go Rambo.
10.0~Its goooood apetitefor Sign in Permalink Everything was really put up on fire here. First of all Stallone looks amazing for his years. We should take his body as an example and prove to ourselves we can do it, no matter how old we are. About the movie, a really good action-packed, realistic production that we will take you the most bloody, messy and gore effect of all the Rambo series... yet. In the beginning I was really worried how the hero's story will continue. Hopefully it was really good, Rambo is still the war-machine, but now there are some feeling getting into his iron heart,but I don't want to spoil the story for you, so just see this movie. I highly recommended to every action movie fan and also for those who haven't heard of Rambo. The DVD for me personally is a must have and I will definitely buy it. If there is something I didn't liked about the movie is that it ends. Those were the first long hours i really liked about a movie production.And i didn't regret them. I'm rating it ten, because its just one of the action movies from a long, long time. It is true that is not something about mafia, gang member or vice verca, but still this is Rambo...and its good.. very good
10.0~Powerful and harrowing movie with stunning cinematography. PWNYCNY Sign in Permalink After watching this movie, I asked myself: "How can I rag this movie?" "What is wrong with this movie?" And after due consideration, I said to myself: "Self, I have no basis for ragging this movie?" This is a powerful, compelling, riveting movie with tremendous cinematography presenting a harrowing story. This movie out-Private Ryans "Saving Private Ryan." This movie contains possibly some of the most stunning action cinematography ever filmed by a Hollywood studio. Also, this could be Sylvester Stallone's best movie. Mr. Stallone succeeds in presenting a powerful action story with lots of special effects and incredible stunts without sacrificing character development. The audience is told a lot about John Rambo and is given a glimpse of Rambo's philosophy of life. Excellent dialog, great acting and incredible cinematography equals a great movie.
10.0~Review of Rambo, *wonderful wonderful spoilers* Forlornxdrifter Sign in Permalink I don't care what critics say, this movie was GREAT! The villains were people you didn't like at all, not even a little, in fact, I WANTED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO DIE! And that is really what a great action villain should be, nothing else. And Rambo delivered by killing what seemed like a whole country full of them. From the very first shot of this movie you know it's gonna be good. The first thing you see is the villains killing innocent people and seeming to be invincible while they do it. Until Rambo meets the first group of them they inspire fear in everyone who see's them. Dialgue is nice for artsy movies, but this is a movie that knows actions speak much louder than words. Which brings us to Rambo himself who looks like he's only gotten meaner since he wiped out an entire soviet army in Rambo III. He moves very slowly for the first part of the movie, making the audience think if he has any fight left in him... until out of nowhere he kills a boat full of RIVER PIRATES! From there we get lessons on why even the best Christians need to kill every now and then, why the toughest mercenaries in the world are chew toys next to Rambo, and, of course, the greatest lesson of all, if you get in Rambo's way, your gonna get SHOT BLOWN UP DECAPITATED CRIPPLED DECINTIGRATED AND GUTTED LIKE A FISH!! Man, this movie made me feel great, I felt, uplifted. Like, your down on your luck and a sweet sweet angel with muscles like trees comes down and kills an entire army just to make you happy. THIS MOVIE GETS THE Oscar. forget no country for old men, if Rambo was in that movie he would have killed that annoying foreign guy in thirty seconds!
7.0~forget first blood, this is thousand blood! asda-man Sign in Permalink "Rambo" is an all out "man" film, it's got big guns, plenty of blood and jam-packed with action and thrills. But, why did it feel unengaged? I think the big problem is with the length of it. An hour and a half? Too short, I didn't want it to end I wanted more and more and if you think about it all there is to it is invading a camp of Thai people and then killing a bunch of them. I needed more action! This film could've been epic if it wanted to have been. Nevertheless this has got to be the highest body count since "Kill Bill" (but obviously no where near that standard). At times "Rambo" can be over-sentimental, with its music and choice of editing and it wasn't needed in my opinion. Jackie Stallone has made a film that knows it is all out action. Of course you can have the girl who needs to be saved, but we really don't need all this sentimentalised music when we see a mass genocide. However, "Rambo" does not disappoint with its action, there are limbs being sliced off, guts hanging out, heads being blown off, heads being sliced up and it is all very very exciting. The final confrontation on the massive gun is so entertaining, just because of its sheer amount of blood. On the story side it is let down, the characters are unengaged and slightly annoying, but it's still fun, it could've been more fun but it's fun enough. Jackie is great as a director, just not so good as a writer.
10.0~Most violent film ever jman-metallica Sign in Permalink I expect that critics will slate this film, as many would view it as mindless violence. However if you like pure action, this is probably the best film you will ever see. This is the most ridiculously violent action film ever, with relentless killing sprees on baddies. Sly has never been better, with his intimidating cold gazes, and still looks believably fit enough for the part. The movie does an excellent job during the first half of building up the viewer's hate for the enemies so that you couldn't be more happy to see them all die horribly in the second half. The cheesy dialogue and over-the-top levels of violence was actually hilarious but this only made me love it even more. It proves that a great film doesn't have to be about good dialogue, soul-searching or love plots. With never-ending gunfire and limbs flying everywhere who cares!
1.0~They should have named it Rambo: Starefest pieaholicx Sign in Permalink I came to this movie expecting to see action, and lots of it. I was expecting violence at least every 5 minutes. What I got was a lot of staring, and maybe a half hour total of action. Let me review the plot: People die, stare, stare, stare at snakes, stare, stare at people fighting snakes, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare at Christian group, stare, stare, stare at the darkness, stare at lights, stare at pirates, shoot pirates, stare, stare, stare, burn up boat, stare at burning boat, stare, stare at mercenaries, stare, stare, shoot some people with your bow, stare, stare, sneak around a camp without killing anybody, stare, blow up an old bomb, stare, shoot some people with a machine gun, stab a guy, stare, walk. Exaggeration? I wish.
8.0~Back to the roots of the franchise nvjs Sign in Permalink I wondered why, after directing four Rocky films and Staying Alive, did Stallone not grace any of the Rambo sequels with his directorial expertise. With each Rambo after First Blood, the series grew farther and farther away from what made the first one such a stellar success. It was plausible. Well plausible in comparison to the 2nd and 3rd ones anyway. What's brilliant about Rambo, is that it gives Stallone a vehicle while also bringing attention to the human rights violations genocide being perpetrated by the Burmese military under government orders if not wanton and blatant condonment After a little hiatus from big productions sans Rocky Balboa, Stallone still has something to prove despite his over-the-hill age clocking in at 62 years "young" to Stallone. This installment brings back the modest production and plot with a budget of about 50 million when action films today cost about 65+ million depending on release date and cast. But Stallone did away with the over-inflated, and grandiose production with a no frills follow-up. This time Rambo is back in Thailand snatching up constrictors and venomous cobras for the local tourist spot and traversing up and down the river to get said snakes. It's when a condescending missionary who's portrayed by Paul Schulze, comes to Rambo after doing some footwork to get upriver into Burma or Myanmar as it's named, that Rambo curtly refuses. Citing their naivete and the danger as well as what appears to the missionaries, as him being apathetic. Well, the missionaries don't have any other option and need Rambo's boat to get upriver and Sarah, played by Julie Benz. The fiancée of Michael, Paul Schulzes's character, tries her hand and desperation to get that ride. After three tries, Sarah succeeds and then the convoy is held up by pirates. And Rambo is forced after trying to peacefully negotiate an amiable agreement, and much to the humane Michaels's dismay, kills the pirates to save their own lives. This is what helps the audience realize that Rambo is not just a bloodthirsty killing machine and has found some solace in himself while simultaneously maintaining a misanthropic disposition. It's good storytelling that Rambo wasn't so quick to kill. Opting to settle things peacefully rather than the Rambo way. Another thing Rambo does well, is take some of the limelight off of himself and let's the mercenaries charged with rescuing the captive missionaries. Stallone didn't just bogart the camera and let all the supporting actors die just to show you Rambo is a superman. Contrary to the perception established by the 2nd and 3rd films. Another example of the modest production, is the absence of the trademarked Mi-24 Hind-Ds that were in the 2nd and 3rd or any helicopters for that fact. There isn't any tank battles or Rambo dispatching a battalion from a tree armed with just his compound bow and a quiver of arrows. Also, the baddie in this film is someone you truly hate and want to see him get his come uppance, that is what's lacking in a lot of actioneers these days. This film is indeed gory, but it serves it well since the atrocities committed by the Burmese military junta are quite graphic. To depict it lightly would be downplaying the plight suffered by the Karen. It also serves the underdogs as you see justice dealt out properly:Like a dish, best served cold. The inclusion of the mercenaries makes the story a little more grounded since they are a small elite contingent who accompanied by a one man army, could probably tackle their foes. But the casualties would be almost 100%. Hopefully, the fifth installment will capitalize on the dynamics and "realism" re-set by Rambo. I'm also glad we didn't see Rambo remove his shirt this time. Something that probably would have been done by another director and made the film just another action vehicle.
10.0~Meaningful and deeply moving masterpiece sj-brady Sign in Permalink Come to see this great movie for the action and horrifyingly realistic and most well-done war scenes ever put on film. Leave with a changed perception of the true nature of evil and what it means to take a stand for justice for those who cannot do so themselves. This movie reminds the audience that terrible regimes and unbelievable brutality are a part of everyday life for millions around the world (just google "conflict in Burma", and look at the children mutilated by third world butchers). An uncomfortable but true message seeps through the entire film that although war is horrible, it is a necessary evil that is needed at times to bring justice and some semblance of peace to "rough neighborhoods" throughout the world. Without ever explicitly saying it, unlike crappy political flicks (like "lions for lambs" that cram their political messages down your throat)the film shows that the cruelty and injustice against humanity is not something that onlookers can stand idly by and not respond. Rambo's decision to kill to save the lives of the innocent and defenseless is done without apologies and political correctness and it is a pure marvel to witness, especially in a time of vacillating politicians and political correctness run amok. Rambo's actions mirrors that of any sane viewers wishes they could do Rambo's work themselves. Why else does the audience cheer when he goes ape-hsit on the worst villains imaginable? Rambo is a cultural icon, a true hero to be celebrated in an age when anti-heroes are the norm. It is universal to identify with the character as an embodiment of independence, strength, conviction and courage. More movies like this should be made as a remembrance of the brave soldiers who have saved and liberated people around the world, and that although war is horrible, it is unfortunately required in a day of terrorism and despotic third world regimes. Anyone who sees this movie and says it is just mindless war-mongering is intellectually dishonest and needs to move to Burma and experience it for themselves. This film, honestly, reminds you that being proud to be an American is not cheesy patriotism, but supporting a higher ideal of doing something about the problems in the world. You owe it to yourself and your grandchildren to take a couple hours out of your life and experience this profound, intense piece of art and let it impact you.
6.0~Of Botox, Steroids, and Bombshells jordan2240 Sign in Permalink Ya know how when someone is wearing a bad toupee, everyone seems to know except the person wearing it? Well, Hollywood seems to turn the same blind-eye to botox. C'mon people, get yourselves some real mirrors or something. Stallone is barely recognizable from the first Rambo movie. That said, if you like gore, this is a feast for the eyes. The acting and dialog was so poor and clichéd I actually felt somewhat embarrassed for the actors, and the story is nothing at all new - stupid, misguided people try to make a difference where none can be made peacefully - but the action was awesome, and that's why I rented the movie in the first place. So, if you take it for what it's meant to be, you won't be disappointed. If you expect to see a well-crafted piece of film-making set in a war zone, try "Full Metal Jacket," "Saving Private Ryan," "City of God," or a handful of others.
10.0~500 Extras, including kids, were NOT hurt in the making of this film stevepat99 Sign in Permalink Rambo First Blood is one of my all time favorite action films. Sure, the story's 'message' was more interesting not to mention his 'domestic' war. It did also define who and what Rambo was. I had not heard much about the new Rambo and was dazzled with most aspects of the film. Stallone's direction, sound, music, filmed on LOCATION and better than average cast of mercenaries and church people. In the end success here is defined by ACTION, good against evil, saving a life, Rambo's coming to terms with himself and blood, gore, death and destruction. Stallone delivered 10+ to ALL HIS FANS old and new. I'd give a 'pass' to those who walked out because the gore was too realistic. One could argue the need for it BUT the barrage of escapist, surreal, staged violence was like a Stallonithon Operetta. Rambo fans take the violence as intended, realistically BUT NOT SERIOUSLY. I totally enjoyed the excitement of all those Rambo moments. Bravo Sylvester. Rambo is truly back. Oh, my title refers to the nonsensical 'gripes' from reviewers who dislike screen violence, escapist action, death and destruction and who seemed to believe the extras, including kids, were actually killed to make the film. G-d didn't really kill all those kids in their favorite film, the Ten Commandments did he/she?
1.0~An hour and a half that I will never get back jiraf Sign in Permalink Yeah.. whom do I talk to for the movie refund ? I left the theater feeling so ripped off. I know going in that this will probably be shoot 'em and blow 'em movie. But I had no idea it is this bad. The story is so thin, Sly and the cast failed to make any sort of emotional connection with the audience. The movie is also shot with a weird style. The scene looks grainy at times. I'm not sure if the director was trying to be artsy, or don't know what would look good in a theater. Stallone looks okay (I was expecting worse for a 61 year old man). But he keeps his shirt on most of the time, maybe to keep his gut from showing. Don't go to this movie.. you'll regret the time wasted waiting for the community theater acting to stop and the real movie to start.
5.0~Meh connorasivill Sign in Permalink If you like 'bloodbath films' this one's certainly for you. The problem with the film is that the story isn't all that special and the pacing is too fast. One minute, Rambo says no to something, the next minute (after little convincing), he's like "oh, alright then". It's things like this that bring the film down. Other than that, it's an ok film I suppose, but again, it's nothing special.
1.0~What a bad movie! we_always_see Sign in Permalink Just a waste of time. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, Bad dialogs, Bad sound ,Did I say bad acting??,Sssssllllooowwww (specially if someone is being killed with an arrow in his eye) , totally predictable Plot, plus more Bad acting. Stallone is -once again- incapable to create a good movie, so, he has to use tasteless (to say the least) things to shock the audience: killing children in every possible way (burned, chopped, blown to pieces.. you name it, he did it with children), rape young women by many soldiers... he even have to use twice the same "game" of "rat race"+"don't step on the mine" (?) This movie pollutes your mind.
7.0~One of my most anticipated films of this year....Rambo is back.... Robert_duder Sign in Permalink I'm going to open with a few comments. First...I am a HUGE Stallone fan. I've been dreaming of his comeback for years and I think his work on eighties and early nineties action flicks is completely unprecedented, he is the master. The Rambo series, the Rocky series which came to an incredible culmination and return last year (see my review) and now Rambo is back. I watched all three of the originals again (probably only my second time in total)---(See my reviews for all three) and I was ready for anything that they could throw my way. I admit my expectations were too high because this was like watching an idol return after years and years away. Rambo didn't disappoint me per se, it just wasn't mind blowing. It lacked the same story and heart that really all three of the other installments had. Instead Stallone took the helm by directing, writing and starring in this installment which I have to assume at over sixty years old will be his last one...and blew away everything in sight in HANDS DOWN...listen closely...THE MOST VIOLENT MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. Nothing even touches the blood, guts, dismemberment, shocking kills including children being shot in the chest several times (can they even show that?), NOTHING. 300 looks like a Disney film compared to this. Unfortunately the violence and dismemberment is so obtuse and blatant that it borders on corny and you're almost laughing at everything flying about. Still it kind of makes for a cool time for the red blooded male and his friends who want to thumbs up ridiculous kills like that. Basically Rambo is John Rambo losing his freakin mind. Sylvester Stallone returns after twenty years to play one of his most famous roles as John Rambo. Rambo has retreated to the small villages in Thailand and works as a snake handler among other odd jobs but right away you notice that Rambo has become completely disenchanted with the world even more than he ever was before. He makes this crystal clear when he mumbles "F--K the world" to someone. Stallone's Rambo is still brooding and quiet, perhaps more than ever before, it seems like he had three lines in the whole movie. His age shows because he definitely doesn't have as much versatility in his action scenes. He spends most of his time behind a turret gun which entails the most gruesome gun down scene in movie history. Still Stallone is Stallone and this is why we love him. Julie Benz is a missionary that Rambo takes to for some reason who convinces him to help their little group get up river into a war zone. For the most part Benz is kind of boring and doesn't really impress and I know she can do better because I was a fan back when she was on Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel. Long time TV Character actor Paul Schulze is Benz's husband and leader of the missionary group. He is terrific although he only has a small role he really does impress especially in his last scenes when he driven to do something he hates...kill. The only down side to his performance is the absolutely campy and awful wave goodbye he gives to Rambo as they lead him away...awful. Graham McTavish is the best of the three mercenaries (although I think their roles mostly ruined the Rambo story) but his performance as the tough as nails mercenary who always goes toe to toe with Rambo in a war of words is pretty good but Rambo never really get his vengeance on him considering all the nasty things he says. The other two mercenaries are barely distinguishable and don't offer anything significant to the cast. So outside of Stallone himself the cast is sub par at best and even though I never thought much of Crenna's role, he was a Rambo series staple and sadly missed. One thing has remained the same with Rambo...he's always been the lone wolf, acting alone against armies and this time he has three mercenaries with him who just get in the way. Its not Rambo if he has a team and that part of it was poorly decided on Stallone's part I think. Also there was no exact villain...it was like the entire group that were the villains but there was no one person on either side that Stallone clashed with like the other films had. I think these were vital mistakes outside of the tried and true Rambo experience twenty years ago. Still you won't steer wrong for straight on, uninhibited, action and nothing but. In this film you will see the goriest gun scenes where practically every gun blows limbs off someone or heads or just makes them explode into tiny flesh ridden pieces. You will also see hands down one of the coolest damn explosions in action movie history where Rambo ties a land mine to an old WW2 rocket of some kind (which obviously still works) and the whole kitten kaboodle explodes. So don't go into this expecting intelligence or story although there is some remnant of the original soldier vs himself still left but go into it looking for some unbelievable never before seen action and you won't mind it one bit. Welcome back Mr. Stallone, you still got guts. 7/10
10.0~Best Rambo movie yet pcowin-69003 Sign in Permalink This movie is just pure action galore, for action fans alike. While yes there isn't much to go on for drama or stuff like that it is just action through and through. Being based on a real war that is rarely talked about it is a good look at the underbelly of conflicts that aren't so well known as the war in the Middle-East, which is popularized by Hollywood to make a quick buck, but by looking into not so known wars it will give the audience a look from a movie perspective of the gritty horrors of war
10.0~The world would see justice if there were people like Rambo on this earth Tremor_The_Fiend Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of Rambo since I was about 2 years old. In fact, John J. Rambo was my childhood hero. But make no mistake, I was very, VERY skeptical about the new, fourth installment. I had to be. All the actor veterans are reviving their franchises. Okay, so Terminator 3 was very good, Rocky Balboa I liked, although after Rocky V, there was plenty of room for improvement. But Rambo.... Rambo was my childhood hero. I quoted and pretended to be Rambo since I could remember. Personally, I didn't think Sylvester Stallone would have been able to do justice to Rambo, not at his age. Oh how wrong I was. I should have known better than to doubt Stallone. Whereas the first three Rambo movies were created by Mario Kassar, who is a brilliant man, responsible for much of the Terminator franchise as well. Rambo (4) was written, and directed by the star himself, Sylvester Stallone. I knew that he wasn't an idiot. If you watch his interviews or commentaries in general, you do get a very clear sense that he's an intelligent man. But this movie surprised even me. Rambo starts out with what looks like live footage from a nation called Burma, where atrocious acts of violence from the local military are seen. I don't know if this footage was real or not, but the kind of imagery that it displayed, I could easily believe that it was. The premise, essentially, is that a group of religious volunteers goes into Burma, in an attempt to help the oppressed villagers, and as a result, get killed or captured by the Burmese military. A group of mercenaries is hired for the rescue and Rambo was supposed to take them to the location. But I'm sure you all know, Rambo wasn't going to let the mercenaries have all the action. Oh no. The rest, however, you should see for yourself. Let me just say that Rambo was BY FAR the most violent movie I have seen in a while. It was the most violent of the franchise. And, frankly, it makes action movies such as xXx look like Sesame Street, with Vin Diesel as Elmo. I watched a good share of violent movies when I was a little kid, but if I had kids of my own, Rambo (4) would be the only one of the four that I would NOT show them until they were well into their teenage years. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is a bad thing. I loved this movie, and frankly, I think more action movies should be like Rambo. If you're going to make an action movie intended for adults, you might a well show violence where it's due. However, I can see why they don't. Frankly, Rambo is not for the feint of heart. There was a scene at the beginning of the movie Domino, where they placed a shotgun against a man's shoulder and blew his arm off. If you can't handle a scene like that, then Rambo is not for you. Personally, I loved it. The Burmese military performs acts of extreme brutality where the most shocking of imagery is uncensored. I have never seen a movie where they show a child being killed. That being said, by the time Rambo gets into action, you really get to hate the Burmese military. And when Rambo started killing the bad guys, the entire theater applauded, including myself. It made it that much more satisfying. Stallone played the part well. I mean, Stallone is Stallone, but he is a good actor. Frankly, when I was watching this, and I was looking at Rambo, I saw Rambo. I did NOT see Rocky. And I did not see an Italian actor. I saw Rambo. However, there was one aspect of Stallone's writing that I think could have been improved on. The previous three Rambo films were done in two parts: Rambo gets into action and kills bad guys. A quiet scene occurs. Either Rambo is captured, escaping, hiding, etc. Then he comes back and hits the bad guys twice as hard. The fourth installment lacked that aspect. It was more of a traditional story telling, where you have rising action, crisis, climax and denouement. What this means, personally, is that the movie left me craving for more action. However, what it had that others didn't was an epilogue which concluded the Rambo franchise rather nicely. The music in Rambo was largely reused (or recreated) from First Blood, the original Rambo movie. Personally, I thought it was an excellent touch. I don't know how much of it they hired Jerry Goldsmith to do, and how much of it they simply recreated the score, but it was reminiscent of the original First Blood movie, which is always a good thing in my eyes. Masterful soundtrack. All in all, it was an amazing action movie with shocking imagery, a terrific storyline, and a great soundtrack. Rambo: First Blood, Part 2 is and will always be my favorite Rambo movie. But Rambo (4) by far had the most impact. I was skeptical about it, and I was wrong to be. If you're a long time fan of the Rambo franchise, you will be pleased with this movie. If you aren't a fan of the franchise, this movie might just make you into one.
7.0~Does exactly what it says on the tin pinho-1 Sign in Permalink Contrary to the last instalment of Rocky, this Sylvester Stallone's offering lives up to the expectations. The movie is intense, action - packed and utterly violent. Also, it does not pretend to be something else than it actually is, which is always a worthy quality. Another nice thing about Rambo is the way the main character evolved since the previous movie. At 20 years older, John Rambo is grumpier and even further disillusioned, though still eager to fight for the good cause. All that makes the story logical and water - tight, which doesn't let the audience scratch their heads with disbelief. The latest Rambo probably deserves a star or two more although I personally don't think that even a very good B - class movie should get that many. This film certainly entertains with action, possibly shocks with brutality but definitely doesn't let anyone stay neither indifferent nor bored.
9.0~Simply outstanding n1h1l1s7 Sign in Permalink OK. There were many action movies in the past years. And yes, indeed, they were crap. They relied on one crappy 10-million dollar scene, showing how bullet on slow motion hits something or how a building collapses. And that was it. You watch a movie you think it's action movie, and you have 80 minutes of crap, one minute of final battle scene and nine minutes of "dramatic" ending. But, I would say, there is god for us, action movie lovers- is it Rambo? Yes. Truly great action movie. Truly. Not a single moment of time stretching, not a single moment of bulk... Just action. Pure and clear. And the battles- oh, my! Amazing! Bloody, expressionistic, naturalistic... All you need from that kind of movie. No, there are not censored "I want to watch with my sonny who doesn't need to watch blood" battle scenes, they are as real as they can get. The blood is spilling, the skulls are shattered, the insides are out and the limbs are disconnected. And that is what matters! But, the great thing comes besides that- that the movie possesses nice storyline (as for action movie), the acting is good, not high class of course, but it fits great. The soundtrack is just in place, as well. There is no time wasting, as I mentioned- the movie starts, the movie goes and ends- and everything is where it should be. No "we have a nice 1-minute 100 million dollar last scene we made the whole movie for" attitude. Quite the contrary. As for ending I would just say one thing- amazing.
4.0~Stallone Can't Bring Rambo Home jmbwithcats Sign in Permalink I really had high hopes for Rambo, after all I loved Stallone's return to roots story of Rocky Balboa. Sadly I felt none of that here. Rambo came off to me as a character who Stallone wanted to bring home, but couldn't bring home effectively. We see Rambo having flashbacks, living out in the wilderness with no sense of closure, catharsis, or redemption for himself. So he stays out there, not trying to change the world anymore, just staying out of it's way. In the end Rambo does the right thing to save the lives of a group of voluntary idiots who shouldn't have been out there in the first place. They definitely did not appear to be volunteers for any organized group I could imagine. No one is that ill-prepared. In that regard they reminded me of the group from Cannibal Holocaust, with Rambo tossed in to tip the scales. The movie ultimately I found boring, characters unbelievable, and editing choppy and lacking fluidity or ease, and then it just sorta ends with Rambo coming home to his dad's farm.
6.0~A decent film, but still the best in the series jayson_valentine Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone's "Rambo" is a brutally realistic film on the rather untalked about topic of Burmese genocide. Thought this is my favorite film in the franchise, there are many crippling flaws to this film that may suggest that the starring actor and director may have been reaching beyond his limits. The good aspects of this film is the realistic depictions of mass genocide and third-world warfare, which is mainly due to the SFX and cinematography. The climatic finish was done really well in comparison to other recent actions flicks. It is also respectable that the film makers chose a topic that is less lampooned than others such as conflicts in the Middle East. However, the fatal flaws lay in the C-grade acting and simplistic storyline, which seemingly had very little thought into it. The film contains no subplots or unforeseen events, and hardly differentiates itself from other 'rescue mission' films. The casting is also bunk with not a single memorable performance.
3.0~Stallone top notch, no story, over-the-top violence phreakquency Sign in Permalink You can really see that this is a high budget thing. Technically well made all around. Stallone is great. Good thing that they made it now though. Any older and ... Well this time around he's great and does kick some serious ass. The story can be told in four short sentences: Stallone is hired by some air-headed but otherwise good American missionaries to bring them into Burma. They are attacked and captured. Stallone is hired again to bring in a group of mercenaries that are supposed to get the missionaries out. Stallone kicks ass. End. In order to make a moral point, the situation in Burma is greatly simplified and we can all be sorry for the hapless missionaries and village dwellers as they are harassed by de-humanised killing machines. Of course we need that to enjoy Slys crusade. Ms. Benz' performance is nowhere near credible. Her character convinces Sly to take the missionaries and then her contribution to the "story" ends. The rest of the film she gets dragged along. Paul Schulzes characters "transformation" is totally ridiculous and really should have been left out. The English mercenary is a joke. Nuff said. In conclusion I would recommend this film if you like violence and Stallone and want to be entertained. If you expect anything else, like a story, credible characters, character development or an actual moral point you'll be disappointed.
10.0~I've been to Burma...this movie is worse than portrayed ducard12 Sign in Permalink Having had the pleasure and sadness of visiting Burma in 1996 and the added honor of a personal audience with "The Lady", this film downplays the brutal regime of the military dictatorship,having seen boys carrying AK-47's,forced labor,shake downs.The US won't get involved because there is no strategic importance and China is also our largest trading partner. Until you realize this,Rambo is just another popcorn movie that one soon forgets about after the final credits. Stallone says Darfur isn't as bad as Burma.Think about that! Suu Kyi is against violence,preferring Gandhi's passive resistance. I would love to join a group of mercenaries and detonate bombs and assassinate Generals.
7.0~Not perfect tasos_a-03585 Sign in Permalink The only reason this movie doesn't deserve a 9 or 10 is those annoying christian guys, especially this bald dude should have died miserably. For real though, why do these cry all the time christians exist in a rambo movie?
9.0~Stallone is the king of war morronfrillan Sign in Permalink It's hard to have any real expectations of this movie. The last Rambo movies were bloody war pictures, and you have no incentive to expect anything else from this one. Despite the sad settings, or maybe because of them, this movie impressed me. It doesn't try to be anything other than it is, namely a brutal and vicious war picture. The killings are ferocious and Rambo is as cool as ever, but it's not too much, as one would expect. It's a humanitarian depictions of the horrors of war, and at the same time a great action flick. Not perfect, but indeed very good. An 8/10 in my book,
10.0~Again ill treatment with a Stallone movie by IMDb..! akshaysharma2007 Sign in Permalink Why IMDb is decreasing the points of Rambo...it started with 8.8,now its 7.9....I just wanna ask these IMDb employees that why u people just hate Stallone?...they want to do the same to this movie what they have done to other Stallone movies....why don't you respect this gentleman....don't you know the importance of film like Rambo.......why you only respect the actors who are only popular in US,don't you know Stallone's popularity worldwide....just compare it with your favorite actors and then you will come to know the power of Stallone..! Don't you know about the popularity of Rambo worldwide?..........I would like 2 ask to IMDb employees that anyone of them had the guts to make a movie like John Rambo,..I know they don't have n its very difficult 2 make such movies,....just see the hard work put 2 show everything realistic in this movie.......amazing....violent but realistic..!
6.0~Nice attempt at reboot SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink In war-torn despotic Burma, the military has oppressed the Karen minority. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) has found peace in a simple life in Thailand. A group of Christian missionaries led by Michael Burnett and Sarah Miller (Julie Benz) needs Rambo to take them up the river to Burma. He fights through pirates and delivers them to the villagers. Then the military massacres the villagers taking Sarah and others prisoner. The group's pastor comes to ask Rambo to help guide a group of mercenaries to rescue the missionaries. This one tries to be serious with the real world suffering of the Karen people. It is more similar in its moody tone to 'First Blood'. Rambo is struggling with his morality in an immoral world. He tries to find his faith in the face of the faithful Sarah. There is a clash between killing and pacifism. Rambo is still suffering from his past. I like the start. Inevitably large scale killing starts. There is still a lot of overly simplistic things going on. The body count is higher than ever and the kills more brutal than before. That's where the Rambo from II and III live. The rescue could have come from any number of 80s action movie except more brutal. That part doesn't have the needed realism although it's there for the blood splatter big explosion crowd. It doesn't fully achieve the serious 'First Blood' idea and not as campy as the other two either.
5.0~One nasty soup mofstad Sign in Permalink Despite all good intentions of showing the brutality of the regime in Burma (or Myanmar as the junta prefers to call it), I think Stallone made a terrible mistake in mixing this into an action movie that aims to entertain. The special effects and production are all top notch, but in the end it's all just sickening. If you want a good portrayal of the situation in Burma, read Saving Fish from Drowining by Amy Tan. If you want a movie which takes violence seriously, see Man Bites Dog by Rémy Belvaux. If you want to be entertained, see Rambo I. If you want all this mixed together in one nasty soup, I guess Rambo IV is the movie for you...
8.0~Haunting, savage, and brilliant pabstblurbbn Sign in Permalink "Rambo" is easily the best action film I've seen since "300" and definitely the best in the series next to "First Blood". Stallone seemed to be channeling legends like Sam Peckinpah and Walter Hill with his approach this time around, opting for a more realistic and gritty tone than the previous two sequels. Gone is the macho posturing of Rambo firing an M-60 in the air while yelling and the shirtless muscle flexing. This is the John Rambo of the first film only 25 years later. He's weary, tired, and beaten by the world as well as his demons. What could have been just another cartoonish and fun shoot 'em up action film, Stallone brings to another level by giving it some weight, humanity, and depth by shedding light on the horrors that the Karen rebels of Burma have faced for decades now. But at its heart, "Rambo" is still an action film, and a damn fine one at that. The violence is realistic, disturbing, yet never feels gratuitous. Its as if Stallone saw the recent crop of safe Hollywood PG-13 action films and said to the audience, "this is what violence really looks like". If you don't flinch at some of the things portrayed on screen in "Rambo", you're simply way too desensitized. The casting, cinematography, and editing are terrific. At a little over 90 minutes, its a lean film. If I had a gripe at all its that I wanted it to go on a bit longer, but I'm an unapologetic Rambo fan. As a fan of Stallone's and of hardcore action films, I can't thank Sly enough for having the cojones to bring John Rambo back to the screen. If you want high brow, art-house fare, go see "Atonement". But if you've missed these types of films and you love gritty, quality, old school action, I can't recommend "Rambo" enough.
6.0~There Most Certainly Will, Without a Doubt, Be Blood! Jonny_Numb Sign in Permalink The 1980s were a time when action stars ruled the dayfrom Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator to Sylvester Stallone's three turns as John Rambo, with Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, and Chuck Norris bringing up the rear. It was a time when action scenes and stunts of sometimes amazing scope were staged practically, and even the males in the audience could feel perfectly fine affirming their heterosexuality through the image of a shirtless, muscled character firing off hundreds of rounds of ammo in a tireless quest to preserve Democracy, Mom, and Apple Pie. But since the '80s, times have changed. Icons like Schwarzenegger have gotten political on us, while the Van Dammes and Seagals have all but fallen off the map (or are relegated to direct-to-video schlock). I haven't followed Stallone's career with much interest outside of the "Rambo" films, which made the 2008 "Rambo"coming 20 years after the last filmseem like an interesting curio at the very least. Who wouldn't want to see if the second most well-known icon of amped-up '80s action could still cut the mustard as a credible character? As directed and cowritten by Stallone (with Art Monterastelli), this third sequel is ultimately as shallow as it is thrilling and absurd, achieving a level of murderous dementia that would leave Michael Bay slack-jawed in astonishment. And in a sense, this seems like the best type of entertainment to spend an afternoon with in the dead of winter"Rambo" makes few demands of its audience, and while the screenplay is simplistic and free of depth, who walks into this kind of film with expectations of a deep, meaningful story? For what it's worth, the plot involves Rambo, looking weathered with age, working as a boatman just outside of Burma, where a fascist military regime is silencing dissent through genocide. When a group of missionaries from Colorado (led by Julie Benz (TV's "Dexter") and Paul Schulze ("Panic Room") approach him for a ride into the chaotic area, the thoroughly disillusioned Rambo refuses ("F*ck the world," is his conclusion); but he later comes around, and it doesn't take long before the missionaries reach their destination and are flung into the midst of a warzone. Later, Rambo teams up with a group of mercenaries (of whom the irony is flatly obvious) and stages a rescue mission within a the enemies' compound that is by turns frenetic and confusing (it's raining and takes place at night). And the film culminates in a jaw-dropping third act where Stallone's own unabashedly genocidal ambitions are brought to bloody life in a prolonged massacre that needs to (and should) be seen to be believed. To his credit, Stallone the director keeps things moving along quite well; the clunky, call-and-response exposition scenes are wisely dispatched to the beginning of the film so they don't get in the way later on, and the "Saving Private Ryan" style camera effects actually complement the story and setting quite well. While the sometimes-unpolished CGI can be a distraction (including bullet-hits that are way too clean and obvious), the slick editing covers up any glaring flaws and lends the film a sense of ersatz-documentary realism. As for Stallone the actor, he spends the film with his now 61-year old physique obscured by a baggy shirt and jeans, and exemplifies the kind of rage-boiling-under-stone-stoicism that made Charles Bronson's performances in the "Death Wish" series so iconic and memorable. Sure, Stallone will never be mistaken for one of cinema's great intellectuals, but his performance here fits his established Rambo persona quite well, and when he gets behind an anti-aircraft gun at the very end, mowing down a seemingly endless enemy army as limbs fly and heads explode, it is a thing of sheer beauty.
7.0~Rambo ... 'live for nothing, die for something' Belgomovie Sign in Permalink Stallone returns to the type of movie were he became famous in. This fourth installment of Rambo provides the viewer all the elements of the old Rambo-^movies. Only with much more violence (R-rated worthy) and better sfx. Although the story was kept a little bit simple, the actors did not always play as good as they should, i liked the movie. Apart of the real life images at the beginning of the movie this is brainless entertainment. You can compare it with a thrilling roller-coaster of 90 minutes ... It will never win awards, but the box office will love him. Respect for Stallone. He did not only appear as the principal character but was also the director and wrote the story. Everybody thought his career was over, but with his two last movies (Rocky and Rambo) he showed the world that Hollywood hasn't forgotten him.
1.0~Pornography of violence ruhi-yaman Sign in Permalink "War is in your blood" Rambo says early in the film, "don't fight it". Say, what? Is the scriptwriter taking the Mickey out of Sly? It is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here. Yet, Stallone utters it without a hint of irony. The same lack of humour applies to the movie. Rambo IV is an over-the-top, idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren't sickeningly violent. A redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous, it is not enough just to kill them  you have to dismember them with relish. Stallone stops at no blue-collar cliché to make his point. It is not enough for the chief villain to be feed-them-to-the-pigs, throw-babies-into-fire kind of sadist. He is also a pedophile homosexual. What is happening to IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high? I like a good action movie as much as the next man, but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't take his shirt off. For this I will give it one star...
10.0~Let the bodies hit the floor!!! shady_lanem Sign in Permalink Let the bodies hit the floor!!!! This is what Rambo did exactly in this movie. You can always change something and it's always possible. Rambo beat bad guys up really good which usually makes those other merchenary soldiers looks good as well. One of the most remarkable signature that Rambo always show in all of its movies, silent kill from behind. This movie is excellent filled with actions, explosions, gunfires, blowing up heads, and more explosions!! He's still in his usual self acting cool with few words to spare. Don't mind the soldier, you're definitely not a boring guy to me mate!! However, the movie could have been longer especially with those soldiers development since some of them doesn't like their leader. Would have been better if there's a bit of confrontation or grudges going on among themselves. But anyway, this movie is definitely worth watching and well deserved 10/10
10.0~Thanks!!! oncle_sam Sign in Permalink This comment is directed directly to Sylvester! Thanks for being noble - you probably didn't have to, they probably did tell you not to, but you did it anyway - made this masterpiece - very noble!! "Nothing does change" I certainly hope this movie proves a difference and is helping to open some eyes to realize what genocide looks like in color. Hopefully it's part of a future world where wars are fought for just one reason - the one and only possible reason - Justice for Humanity(not some made up weapons of mass destruction, influence or money). to mankind: your call!
6.0~Blood, gore, and more blood. chris-j-stanton Sign in Permalink This is one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. Decapitations. Limbs being blown off. Disembowelment. Countless deaths - probably more than one hundred. Most die from gunfire, but we also see how crossbows, knives, land mines, and bare hands can be used to kill. An unexploded WWII bomb also comes in handy. There are also some scenes of cruel and sadistic torture. This movie (not surprisingly) is light on plot. Rambo reluctantly agrees to help a group of Christian missionaries travel into Burma. Predictably, they get into trouble and Rambo comes to the rescue, together with a group of mercenaries hired by the missionaries' church. Standing in their way are over 100 Burmese soldiers who inevitably end up dead. Julie Benz's acting is terribly wooden, and Stallone's Rambo is a man of few words. But if you enjoy bloody, violent action movies, you will enjoy this movie.
6.0~where does 60 year old Rambo find black hair dye and extensions... MLDinTN Sign in Permalink in the jungle in a third world country?? That's all I wanted to know after watching this shoot-um up fest. I mean the hair was just a little too ridiculous since you know Sly Stalone is over 60. But, Stalone comes up with a really simple plot to let his Rambo character do what he does best. In the movie, Rambo is hired by some church group to drop them off in war torn Burma. Of course, the group gets captured when the evil general burns the village they were helping. The church hires some missionaries to rescue them and Rambo is the boat driver. Rambo gets involved and leads the mission into the enemy camp to rescue the survivors. There is a lot of shootings and people stepping on mines in this. And apparently all the bullets used are the kind that can tear someone in half. Real heavy duty stuff. And Rambo has his usual stare when blowing someone up. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't care about plot and just want to see some video game like action film, then you will probably think this was OK. I thought it was OK for what it was, a movie that requires no thinking.
10.0~Such a meaningful movie johnny-446 Sign in Permalink This was an awesome movie which was to be expected since Stallone always creates really meaningful movies. The dialogue and the script of the movie is just excellent, its not "just" an action movie. For many people they will get surprised to see such war is actually going on right now, and thanks to this movie many people will learn more about it. The movie is really gory and brutal, but combat is brutal in reality. In most modern action movies today you will hear audience laughing at how brutal it is, not in this movie. Because this is going on right now, there is nothing to laugh at. Although John Rambo is a fictitious character, Sylvester Stallone reminds me a lot of him since he risked his life when filming this and bringing the truth out there. Not many knows this. I will remember this movie the rest of my life.
8.0~Possibly the best Rambo yet sklose32 Sign in Permalink The Plot: Rambo drives a few Christian Samaritans into Burma with his boat. They get captured. He joins a group to rescue them. So much so good. The story is kept simple as we are used to from previous Rambo Movies. The movie is a bit different from the rest of the franchise. This movie really concentrates on the misery of the people in Burma. It goes a long way actually to show their suffering. In doing that the movie becomes very gory. I am actually pretty bloodthirsty when it comes to action movies. I really love violence. What I saw in this movie though, was actually a bit much. I did hear before that this movie was pretty violent but nothing could have prepared me for that kind of violence. Still, it does do it's job in conveying the misery of the people. The movie is also a drama. Actually the action part of the movie is mostly concentrated to a big slaughter sequence at the end. Before that there are only a few short action beats. Still, this is a really good movie. If you enjoy violence then this is the right movie for you. If only to check out how far people dare to go these days.
8.0~Enjoyable mdruwe Sign in Permalink I went to see the movie yesterday with a couple of friends. I wasn't surprised that there were no females in the audience. This is a 100% guy movie. Out of nostalgic reasons i have to give it an 8, but the plot and camera-work where not all that great. Nonetheless i still think its the best Rambo movie ever and enjoyed it very much. Compared to the old Rambo movies this one contains much more graphic violence. The arms and legs are literally flying around. But i think it is whats really going on in Birma, people are being killed for no reason every day. Stallone made the right choice to give this problem the attention it deserves! Sure, Stallone is an old man, but he can still kick ass!
10.0~They said he couldn't do it with Rocky Balboa, he did....and then did it again with Rambo! bujinbudoka Sign in Permalink I've been a fan of Stallone's for years. He plays the underdog so well, from the Rambo series to Rocky, from Lockup to Over the Top....Stallone is an awesome and versatile actor. He even did a good job with Judge Dredd in my opinion. The newest installment of Rambo finds John living in Asia as a snake hunter. Commisioned to bring Christian Missionaries to Burma, he is again enlisted to save them after their capture by the corrupt military. Showing he has truly aged, he does get help in this one from an unlikely band of mercenaries, who at first see Rambo as nothing but a regular boatman. Surprisingly, he proves them wrong and shows the world Rambo is still able to do what he does best....help others and survive as well. As he says in the trailer, "Killing is as easy as breathin'...." and watching this movie will bring a smile to your face every time, I guarantee it.
9.0~It's intense! clh-1 Sign in Permalink After a 20 year absence, Rambo returns to the screen triumphantly, but this is a film one should seriously not bring the kids to. The film is set in the current Burmese Civil War, and the atrocities that are actually happening in real life are being translated to the screen as faithfully as is humanly possible. And many reviews have made note of this, even likening the gratuitous violence to porn. This isn't entirely correct, as Stallone himself has said that it was to draw attention to the terrible plight of the people of Burma. And no matter how intense the movie gets, it's even worse in real life. The film picks up with John Rambo living in Thailand, growing old and trying to forget his past. He spends his days doing odd jobs, fishing, and catching snakes for tourist shows. His nights are haunted by nightmares of his violent past. A group of Christian Missionaries come along, asking for help to get their medical supplies into Burma, Rambo reluctantly agrees, giving them a lift in his boat up river. A group of Burmese soldiers, headed by a sadistic officer, capture and torture the missionaries. Rambo is enlisted to ferry a group of hired mercenaries up river to where the hostages are held. Feeling that he must go too, Rambo essentially takes the lead and through force of will manages to... not win per se, but bring a little shade of humanity to an otherwise inhuman situation. The film is not like the others in the series, one-liners are virtually non-existent, only a handful of nuggets are included as homage to the earlier entries. Stallone in fact keeps the talk to the minimum, preferring to turn the inner turmoil of his character into a thousand yard stare, that also conveys a feeling of conflict. Although most characters are underdeveloped, we don't need the back story of their lives. We only see them for the few hours that they exist within the film. The acting is good, with each actor bringing the necessary gravitas, and when called for, humanity to their roles. And the action and stunts are mostly done the old fashioned way, with CGI virtually unseen. Go see it, but don't bring the young, impressionable, or squeamish.
8.0~Rambo Rocks!!!!!!!!! yashrajs536 Sign in Permalink I will clear that I am a Stallone Fan. When I watched this movie I felt that same excitement as the "First Blood" given to me even it falls somewhat short from original. And When I heard that this is directed by Sylvester himself I was very excited that he is good in direction too. The movie was so awesome I can't forget it the action in this movie is good as I expected the acting directing all was good.And this movie is worth watching even for non Stallone or Rambo fans!!!! I am excited for the sequel "Rambo:Last Blood (2016)" Hail Rambo!!!!!!!
8.0~An action film that bows to no other WalterSoprano Sign in Permalink This film has one of the highest body counts in a film known to man. The action is far from senseless and actually serves a purpose. I for one hate senseless action films for there is no emotion. However this is packed full of emotion due to its revenge plot. And believe when you watch this film the horrible atrocities shown done to innocent people make you feel awful but the payback does more than make up for it in the end. Other than the action there really isn't anything new brought to the table. The plot is not very witty or strong but holds up the film and the acting is not bad nor amazing. But the action surpasses almost everything in the past and present and will most certainly be hard to beat in the future. This film is most certainly worth the watch especially if you are action hungry. Enjoy the film and thanks for reading my review.
10.0~A Breath of Fresh Air flashstar Sign in Permalink It was such a relief to finally see a movie that had clear good and bad guys. Many films today have convoluted characters who are neither good nor evil, but have a mix of qualities. What many people forget is that in this world, there are good people and there are very evil people as well. The truth is that directors who don't show this are simply unrealistic. Sometimes you just want to watch the good guy kick butt. Saving the damsel in distress as well is a nice bonus. Also, you can't forget that Rambo is an American classic. Overall, 10/10. Keep 'em coming.
5.0~Stallone goes nuts! swedzin Sign in Permalink What a hell... is going on with Sly? We need to put this guy into the asylum! Right now! So this is Sly's vision of a ideal Rambo film? Blood, gore, limbs, guts, hears, heads, testicles, brains, nipples, teeth, skin... everything all over the place! Leatherface would be proud of that collection. So Sly is highly informed that there are extremely evil and sadistic people in Burma and they are merciless, animal like, they just go like a tornado through the village and rips people like paper dolls! This story is dumb and average... a group of Christian missionaries are heading to Burma to help civilians during that hard time of war and Stallone is the one who leads them there but... you can't keep a good man down, he shows that he is nothing different than them "who are you!?" man, I barely understood him... he has that twisted, retarded face, that simply tries to perform, but can't! And only because he felt something for the leading lady in the film, he helps a group of mercenaries to find them, or what's left of them. No charismatic, cool villains here, just a pedophile swine, mustache bearing fat dude, who is just evil. No lines, nothing... just evil, twisted f..k! Just like Stallone's brain. I don't get it... so the guy is evil because he is a sadistic killing pedophile? Dude... was T1000 sadistic pedophile? No! Was Colonel Poldovsky from Rambo 2 a sadistic Russian pedophile? No! So, that's Sly's policy... just like a real righteous republican... The world around us is full of no-God-worshiping heathens and they are all pedophiles! I highly don't recommend this movie to anyone. If you thinking just now that I am a wimp or something. But, hey I enjoy good action film too, but if I want a slaughter... I'll go to the salughterhouse and watch pigs getting butchered. This is Sly early vision of Expendables... a nonsense action... well... 80s didn't have that much nonsense or that much gore... they got balance! That's what's important, balance! But, today anything goes...
3.0~Action OK storyline bad hoitatc Sign in Permalink The movie is good if all you care for are action but the storyline itself is terrible, the stupidity of people going to a war-torn country with absolutely no law what-so-ever and thinking bringing some medicine and bible goner make a differnce, those people would rather grab a knife and slice your throat open than listen to your western style mumbo jumbo. Rambo should never bother taking them in the first place and definitely never should try to rescue them. idiot should just let them die, for those who watch the movie " immortal" hope some of you remember the part how king Hyperion treat the traitor during the beginning of the movie, these dumb moronic ads worker deserve no better. I don't have anything against good people, but try to find a location that deserve to be rescue,not a place that gonna get yourself killed.
7.0~What You Expect Outta a Rambo... Is What You Get! warhead_2003 Sign in Permalink Me and my friends were in cinema deciding over either to watch the new AVP or Rambo. Most of my friends were quite against watching Rambo, thinking that it would be another 'Mindless Action Movie' an aging recreation of the 80's legendary action genre and we were also quite curious whether this movie might just turn out to be a hopeless sequel to a glorified Rambo series. So then, initially we all agreed to watch the new AVP movie, but apparently it was a 'house full'. So now feeling quite 'disappointed' we then went to watch Rambo. We went in with low expectations but after 1 hour and 30 minutes we came out with full of shock and fascination. We were all amazed and were quite quick to approve the fact that movie had to be the most realistic modern warfare action movie to date. Although the movie had a very linear and a predictable storyline, but then its after all action is what most of the people picture in their head when they think of Rambo. So to conclude, what really made Rambo a success was that it was very well directed, on a very predictable storyline. Had a good cast, just the way you would expect 'built-for-war' soldiers to be (in this case mercenaries). The extremely intense action throughout the movie. And the last but not the least, Rambo character himself, Sylvester Stallone. Credit must go to him for Acting/Directing/Writing such a great a$$-kickin' movie!!! "Live for nothing, or die for something"
8.0~Not Much Of A Talker, But He Can Kill With The Best Of 'em! ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink Take the first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan" - with soldiers limbs being shot off at the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach, add some magnificent jungle scenery and action a la "Tears Of The Sun, and put it all in " Blackhawk Down" mode with gunfire dominating the film....and you have the latest Rambo movie. Hey, I knew it was going to be a tough, adventure story but this was a shock. I've never seen so many heads blown off, limbs blasted away with blood spurting out and holes blasted in the middle of chests and stomachs in one movie in my life.....and it's only 81 minutes long! (The last dozen minutes are ending credits.) Man, this is almost non-stop action and suspense/ Yeah, a bunch of it is overdone but overall, it still was an entertaining movie. I know it sounds like some dumb Texas Chainsaw Massacre-type thing, but it wasn't despite the mayhem. There actually was a small story with a decent message about making your life stand for something. "Rambo Gets A Conscience" could be another title to this movie. However, if you are the least bit squeamish about bloody violence, you better skip this movie. If you enjoy a good action movie and don't care if it gets a little gross in spots, this is your cup of tea......in spades. If you have any hostility in you, after 80 minutes of watching this, it should be gone. After an absence of 20 years, Sylvester Stallone's "John Rambo" comes back to the screen. Rambo is the kind of guy you don't want on your college debate team but he's a number one draft choice on the field of battle. He's a man of few words and a lot of testosterone. With veins popping out of his arms like a 25-year-old bodybuilder, Stallone looks more juiced than Barry Bonds but at least it makes him look the part, even if he does have bags under his eyes. I liked Stallone's comeback in the recent "Rocky Balboa" better, but this was still an entertaining flick. The middle-aged John Rambo was more realistic than the male missionary, "Michael Burnett," who was a bit obnoxious for who he was playing. I've met a number of missionaries and none of them act or sound like this guy, but that's the film world for you. The guy with the Australian accent who was the "leaders" of the mercenary group was a bit over-the-top and cartoon-like with the profanity. With him, and the Burmese rebel leader, you had no probably identifying who the a-holes were in this movie, and who were the good guys. They weren't too subtle about that. Then again, the action scenes weren't too subtle, either - but it was entertaining, in a sick sort of way. One last thing that everyone should agree with: this was nicely filmed, with fantastic jungle scenery. Kudos for cinematographer Glen MacPherson and director Stallone for some incredible shots. I cannot imagine how good this must look on a high-definition disc.
6.0~Don't recommend a restaurant and then complain about the food. jackbenimble Sign in Permalink Not a bad movie if you're in the right mood. It belongs along with the Die Hard series and if you're a bit fed up, tired and don't want to think too much just kick back and watch someone else go around doing a lot of shooting and swearing looking fed up too it's pretty good. If you want good plot, fine acting, script, story twists and philosophical depth I wouldn't bother. Sounds obvious but it's amazing all the one star reviews that complain about the latter missing. From a Rambo film for God's sakes!!! That's a bit like going to an Indian restaurant and moaning about the spicy food. Mind you after watching about the hundredth body sawn off spewing blood from machine gun fire it got a bit silly to say the least.
10.0~John Rambo garysmusic2004 Sign in Permalink Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Governor. Chuck Norris is a campaign spokesperson and Jackie Chan is tired of making action films. Bruce Willis resurrected Die-hard, but with limited success. Poor Charles Bronson is dead. And last, but not least, Clint Eastwood is way too old. As action heroes go, Jason Borne is the new sensation, and James Bond has been redone. The Terminator has now a woman Jean-Claude VanDamme/Steven Seagal are straight to video C-listers. The only action hero movie still around with enough muscle to make a last stand at the Box Office is Sylvester Stallone. After a moderate success with Rocky Balboa, it seemed only a matter of time before JOHN RAMBO would return. Return he has. In the new Rambo movie, Sly has come with muscles blazing and toughness flying out of every poor of his existence. He's here to rescue Missionaries from a straight from the headlines story out of Burma. Human atrocities, bloody body parts, and bullets showcase this horrific action film. The violence has been raised a notch since the 80s to meet the now higher standards of our SAW/TURISTAS crowd. As a director, Stallone has grown making every shot count as tension builds up to the climatic 50 minute or so action sequence. As an action star, for 61, his Rambo is still the toughest hero out there. He makes Jason Borne, and the new younger James Bond, look like boys playing guns. His Rambo shows no hesitation, no fear, and no emotion beyond anger and resentment. He is hardened individual who is drawn back into doing what he does best which is kill. Of all the action films I have seen in 07 and 08 (this includes 300), Rambo is by far the toughest, hardest, action film. It isn't for the squeamish, it isn't pleasant, and if you are looking for a tough pretty boy, it isn't a movie for you. In toughness of characters created by such actors as John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Chuck Norris, and Sly Stalllone, John Rambo is the king of the mountain and Jason Borne would be the royal Jester.
7.0~Mutilations abound christian-356 Sign in Permalink If you are fascinated with guns, mutilations, and flying body parts, this is for you. If not, it's not. There was a lot of high packed action scenes and an overwhelming amount of gore to which there is a very high level of realism, something I have not yet experienced before. Some people may feel offended, some nausea. I was surprised that I wasn't more appalled. I went to see it with some friends. We laughed our way through it, fascinated with all of the action scenes, and to some extent shocked by the abundance in variations over the theme: body decomposition. As to the acting, it was very thin, and the dialog thinner. Specifics - In the boat scene with the mercenaries, there was a bit of tension, but the scene, although cut up, was too long. Julie Benz' performance especially in the beginning was below average, but it gave the scenes a kind of realistic effect. The big explosion effect was particularly good. And as mentioned, the body parts flying around.¨
4.0~It took twenty years... grenmonkey Sign in Permalink It took twenty years to get John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) back on the screen – Sly's still in good enough shape to play the part but do we need another Rambo -film? The 80's films were very much products of their time so how'd it set into the 21st century? John Rambo has retired from all the killing and war games. His newly found job as a snake catcher in the Thai jungles is interrupted by a group of missionary workers, led by Sarah (Julie Benz) and Michael (Paul Schulze), who want to hire him and his boat to get them and the medical supplies they carry with them to Burma, which is in the middle of a brutal civil war/genocide. After the missionaries go missing in Burma, it's up to John and a mixed bunch of international mercenaries to go deep in to the hostile grounds and find out what's happened to the aid workers – and bring the survivors home if there's any one left. The film's very brutal, there's plenty of gore to pass around and the film doesn't try to hide it in any way. The film feasts with blood, guts and severed limbs – zooming the action where ever there's the most of blood spilled. I haven't really seen the things represented here before – shooting of children, throwing babies into burning buildings and flames, a man shot with a mounted heavy machine gun in close range and blowing up to a mess... there's a lot of those kind of moments through-out the film. After a while though it starts to feel that the gore and violence is there to cover up the deficiencies of the film – which are plentiful. The script is what I had the most issues with; the story is unimaginative and very predictable and has little or if any story building moments in it. It's just plain killing and fake blood for the most of it. The only scene I really enjoyed was the one where Rambo decides to go back to his old habits and forges himself a new blade and heads to war; the scene (though a very short one) was well crafted. The (many) action sequences were well shot and edited but not very interesting or hold-your-breath -kind of ones. It's just about getting rid of the nearest enemy and heading for the next. Some may like it, I didn't. Also the absence of dialog for most of the film and the ridiculously poor quality of it was a surprise. Stallone knows how to write good stuff but here he has dropped the ball a couple of times. The ending didn't make me happy either. Stallone is a good actor. In the film he looks like hell but delivers the couple of lines he has nicely. Matthew Marsden (School Boy) does a good job too as a mercenary sniper. Rest of the guys playing mercenaries though all feel very much out of place; you wouldn't believe in a million years that they are hardcore killing machines, as suggested here – especially with all the Matrix-thing they're pulling constantly off: jumping, rolling and dodging bullets and knives another after another. But it's Julie Benz who stands out from the cast as the weakest link. Her voice is annoying here and she doesn't seem to put a lot of effort in her performance. Her character is poorly written, I'll give her that. Rambo is a quite short action marathon with a lot of violence. I didn't get what the movie was about and the film was very black and white in the way it presented the situation in Burma (or in any other Third World country in the middle of a civil war). The film's a blast from the past, might have felt a lot more home in the mid 80's or so. We'll see what Rambo V has to offer in a couple of years, hopefully a good story - something that was absent here. 2/4
9.0~Restoring the faith in the action movie Kal-13 Sign in Permalink They don't make them like this anymore. The presence of John Rambo is huge and the audience loved every minute of it. The timing of action scenes, the limited dialogue work perfectly and the audience cheered for it. Its rare now a days to see this happen. I cant get over how well crafted and detailed the action scenes were done. Can I just say wow? That's the feeling I felt leaving the theatre. Stallone brought back the original formula that made the first two Rambo movies a success. After seeing this i hope there will be another but if there isn't..its a fantastic end to the series. THANKS Stallone for restoring my faith in the action movie.
9.0~Rambo IV : John Rambo, really hits the mark mic-chai Sign in Permalink ============================= SPOILER =========================== Forget the suits, the smart one liners, the martinis and poses... Rambo is back, with his trademark stare and snarl and blazing guns, this time he has even less dialogs. Personally, this is the best Rambo flick... ever !! A no holds barred movie, blood, gore and more... it starts off with a brief of a war between the Karen rebels who are besieged by the Burmese army who burns, kidnaps, mutilates and rape their way from village to village. Rambo is hired by a group of missionaries on a mercy mission to bring them up river into the war zone, which he reluctantly does. 10 days later was hired yet again, this time to take a group of veteran mercenaries who have been hired to find and if possible rescue the first group who has gone missing. Grittier than the previous 3 chapters, Rambo 4's story is a lot more intelligent, well paced and ( i am still wrestling with this... ) believable. The blood and the gore did not feel gratuitous, it was there for a reason, the image of a kid with his head kicked in and thrown into a burning pyre is still haunting me. The cruelty of army is emphasized so many times that when Rambo finally kicks in, I wanted to cheer even though he was as brutal as they were :) Just like Rocky, there is a feeling of closure in Rambo 4 as we see Rambo acknowledging to himself that in the end, he is what he is... a killer... simple. The trailer did not do justice to the movie. 9 out of 10 for action movie goodness. Watch it with a bunch of guys and please leave your brain behind.
10.0~This movie ROCKED! RevengeOfToonces3 Sign in Permalink Went to a 6:00 showing right after work today. I got to the theater and there was maybe ten people in there (including the people I was with). This kind of irked me off a bit, as I want this movie to do extremely well. Ah, well. We'll see the final figures after the weekend is over. Here's hoping for a huge return, because Stallone deserves it. THIS is what I want in a balls-to-the-wall action movie. No jumping off the walls Matrix stuff. No "perfectly" choreographed gun battles. No "misunderstood" villain. It was a hero and his companions battling forces of pure evil in 92 minutes of raw action. You hated the bad guys and wanted the good guys to win. I felt bad for how the villagers were tortured and wanted evil to burn for it. THAT'S IT. It's absolutely everything I expected it to be. **SPOILER** My favorite scene? When the boat was stopped by that gang of baddies and Rambo cut them down in a matter of SECONDS after they made it very clear that they were taking the girl with them, whether our heroes liked it or not. Then that guy bitches to Rambo about how killing is never right. BULLCRAP! These people were about to take your girlfriend and do God knows what to her, you wimp! I was just waiting for this guy to get what was coming to him (these types always seem to get it the worst), but I got something even better - later on, in the heat of the final showdown, HE FRIGGING SMASHES A BAD GUY UPSIDE THE HEAD WITH A ROCK UNTIL HE'S DEAD! It's like, screw your hippie beliefs; they don't mean squat until it really counts and you need to make a choice between your life and the life of the guy trying to kill your ass. Right on, Sly! Screw compassion! This is RAMBO!! These people must be schooled proper. Oh, what a glorious showdown the end was. Every possible way to get taken down with a machine gun is explored in this fifteen minute symphony of raw chaos. It just felt damn good to sit back, relax and enjoy a real action movie at the movies for a change. My only complaint is that the film feels a little too short. But, hey, always leave them wanting more, right? I knew exactly what I wanted out of this movie and it totally delivered. Bravo, Sly.
9.0~Stupefying and disarming SPaS Sign in Permalink After the trailer I had the feeling this would be the best of the sequels. Now, having just seen the movie itself I can't believe this... but "Rambo 4" challenges even the original "First Blood" - which I have always considered one of my all - time favorites. What amazes me the most is the tone: how can a movie be BOTH a serious movie with a message and a solid, mindless action movie? Especially when we're talking nostalgia trip here with an over-aged hero. All other nostalgia trips seem to be dodging this and heading for fun action: Terminator 3, Die Hard 4 and Indy 4. But Stallone has a different agenda. He wants some serious substance with a fitting tone. So just like the character he portrays, Stallone grinds his teeth and takes on the challenge. Both of them also take a beating for it (critics who seem to be having issues with Stallone), but both of them will also beat the odds, and come out winners! I dare say "Rambo 4" is not just the best action movie, but the best DAMN movie I've seen in 2 years! So Mr. Stallone - thank you for going out there one more time and getting an iconic hero back home the way he deserves.
2.0~To Be Fair: Disappointing bob-rutzel-1 Sign in Permalink Rambo (Stallone) goes into the Burmese jungle to rescue human rights missionaries If you like non-stop shooting movies you are in luck. That is all there is in here. To be fair, there are flashbacks to his earlier life, which BTW, also involved more non-stop shooting. And, also to be fair, I didn't care if the missionaries were rescued from the Burmese Army. Sometimes you see stupid people do stupid things and it may have been a better movie had they not have been rescued. What? Am I giving something away? Everyone (even the Burmese Army). on the planet knows Rambo will rescue them. Let's face it, we were all hood-winked into thinking that this would be pretty good given the past Rambo movies, and to be fair, "Ok, lets' give it one more shot." But, in hindsight, that shot could have been used for something else, maybe a Rocky 12, Spiderman 7, Indy Jones 8, Fantastic Four 6 (no, don't go there), It's a very disappointing movie and it is not "pretty good." Other things come to mind. Oh, and one more thing: Rambo doesn't always use guns and knives. Sometimes he uses a bow and arrows. And, to be fair, he's pretty good with them. Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: Some, in crowd situations in the jungle. Hard to see anything. Language: I think I did hear a couple F-bombs in the beginning.
8.0~The evolution of the action Film spiff-12 Sign in Permalink Finally we realize that in acting, even in action films, less is more. No one can get attached to a stick figure character with a bombastic personality (as we all have seen in previous action films). Rambo succeeds in maintaining a delicate balance between 'Knowing' the characters and 'understanding' them as people. I think Sylvester Stallone did a great job as director. The violence is very visceral and disturbing. This movie is not everyone's thing. I have no idea how they pulled off the level of detail. The technology to produce the graphic detail is awe inspiring. The plot is fairly simple. This is the movie we've come to know as a Rambo film; taken to the next level of the art. I'm very impressed... and I'm not one to usually enjoy this sort of film but I did this one.
7.0~the jungle is his place he rages against unjustices in society as he lives live for nothing or go down with a hail of bullets 2karl- Sign in Permalink Its short at 1hr31mins ,7 out of 10 relentless action of blood and guts . 254 people die by rambo's gun and knife. tarratino would love that. John Rambo has been leading a quiet life in Thailand until he is asked to ferry a group of missionaries into war torn Burma, when they are captured, Rambo teams up with a rag tag regiment of mercenaries and heads back into the jungle on a rescue mission that will force him to return to the battlefield with explosively violent consequences , hitting new heights of carnage and raw excitement, the one man killing machine is back with a vengeance it was worth waiting to see it in the cinema after seeing Stallone in the 80's playing Rambo.
8.0~Entertaining mm-39 Sign in Permalink I went out to see Rambo with low expectations. I found the movie entertaining. Rambo the movie is realistic, harsh, fast paced and well directed. I love the 2 philosophies about die trying or live dieing,and everything goes full circle. There is a lions and lambs theme. We all needs hero's who stand up against oppersion. The movie defines these themes well. John Rambo finally goes home at the end of the movie. Rambo finally faces what must be faces and goes full circle. The viewer wonders what would have happened if the altercation in 'Fisrt Blood' with the Sheriff never appeared would the circle been completed sooner. 8 out of 10. Worth seeing before renting.
9.0~.50 Calibre Gold thekarmicnomad Sign in Permalink Sly is getting on a bit and the Rambo franchise was frankly starting to wear a bit thin half way through the first film, and seriously how many times can you see non-descript third world conscripts get shot to pieces? Well actually loads it turns out. Plot runs as follows, Sly looks moody and sweaty for a bit, some soldiers kill some people, some other people with funny accents turn up, they all go on a boat ride, then Rambo massacres the population of a small country. Why has no one thought of this before? There is a love story but it is skilfully kept in the background and acts as a momentary pause from the relentless bloodshed, a bit like driving past a monument on the way to somewhere cool; 'Houses of Parliament kids' The thing is I hate unnecessary violence in films but here it is so prolific that you are quickly desensitised and you never need to stop and think. A good hour of the film is spent demonising the Burmese army, you name it they do it: steal, kill, rape, pillage, torture, leave the toilet seat up. After an hour of this you start to over-load on their pointless cruelty and have built up a really strong dislike for them to the point you wish someone would just shoot them all with an incredibly over-sized gun. It is at this very point that Sly puts his mingingest headband on and slots a belt in the 50 cal. A must see!
7.0~Great action, but too cheesy? curtisloew Sign in Permalink The fundamental thing about all Rambo films is the amount of violence. WHilst throughout this film the violence is spectacular...the last half an hour in particular. However, it seems to me that this film failed to break any boundaries. By taking a very linear plot line Rambo IV seemed to not venture further than a typical action movie plot. However, this did not seem to hinder the 'watch-ability' of the film in anyway, meaning that the intense action scenes and awe-inspiring strength of John Rambo certainly provided a hard knuckle busting film...definitely worth a watch if you are up for some violence, but perhaps too cliché to rate too highly
10.0~An Excellent comeback redserpent7 Sign in Permalink This was the greatest action movie I've seen in years. Sadly they don't make it like this no more. Sly was great in this movie and if you haven't seen him before you would think that he's in his late 30's. The story is intense and just right, no philosophical point of views and no dragging. Its a pure action movie just like the many that were produced in the 80's with a brilliant directing from Stallone, movies don't get any better than this well except for people who enjoy romantic comedies and like to cry all the time, this is not for you guys. I could keep going on and on about this and I really enjoyed it and it made it up to my top 10 best movies list. For all people out there who have doubts about Sly and Rambo don't hesitate and if you missed it on the big screen buy the DVD don't rent coz this is a must have.
6.0~A solid action movie, but with a very simple and silly story justin_philpott Sign in Permalink If you want to be entertained by some great action sequences, gun fights and explosions, while not having to think too much, I recommend this movie. When you examine Rambo outside the action sequences there really isn't much else. The script was overly simplistic and predictable. Rambo is living in a small village along a river in Burma. He is making his living by selling snakes he captures to local entertainers. Rambo seems displeased with his meaningless life. A group of aid workers approach and convince Rambo to transport them up river to parts of Burma that has been devastated by the brutal Burmese Military. Rambo warns them repeatedly that they won't change anything. He urges them to go home. Of course, almost instantly off his boat, they are captured by the military. Rambo, now with a whole different outlook on life feels he must "live for nothing or die for something". He joins up with a group of mercenaries that have been paid to rescue the captured aid workers. They succeed in saving most of the captured. Looks like they didn't change anything, and what did we all learn? I struggle to see any true meaning or message in this movie other it striving to entertain audiences. To put it nice and simple, Rambo is solely an action movie. It definitely achieves it objective in that particular aspect, but not much else. I found all of the action sequences to be really exciting and intense; exactly what you hope for in an action movie. And boy oh boy were they bloody. 6/10 overall
10.0~A real return to form farren-minns Sign in Permalink OK, so I was raised in the 80's and so have heady memories of both Rambo - First Blood, and Rambo itself (the less said about Rambo 3 the better), and so I went in to the cinema expecting something fun but not much else. What I actually got was something very powerful and on a par with the original movie. Simply put, it was superb. For one thing, some of the scenes showing the brutality of the Burmese junta over the Karen people was so shocking and so well presented that I had tears in my eyes.. something I was not expecting. Very brutal, and very necessary to give a real background to the film and to what is actually happening right now. Of course, this is still an action film, and in that regard it does not disappoint doing all his own stunts and showing up many people half his age (me included). I don't care if Sly is over 60, and I don't care if the critics want to give him a bit of a bashing, he is great in this film. Such presence without the need to say very much. Added to all this is the wonderful music score by Brian Tyler is simply wonderful and adds to the powerful background story as well as the action scenes perfectly. In short, I LOVED this film and will be going back to see it again. Not to be missed. Farren
7.0~Rambo the_Poppuns Sign in Permalink In this installment Rambo is somewhere in the jungle minding his own business catching snakes that he sells to the locals who use it for their business. Apparently he's isolated himself completely from civilization. But sometimes life still comes to find you. So Rambo is reluctantly hired to take a band of missionaries into Burma where they intend to help the people of this war torn area. Now people, this is where it gets very graphic and that's approximately 5 minutes into the film. I think most people know that there is a high level of violence in this movie but this is 'Saving Private Ryan' type stuff only in vivid color. Lots of people get blowed up. So if that's not what you want to see, please don't go into this film and then come out of it angry and tell everyone that the movie is terrible. That's the whole point of this movie. And it's like that for the entire movie. Onto the acting. No need for acting. There's no time. It's just action plus action with action. Stallone looks good but we already knew that. There is none of that characteristic Rambo screaming or any of that. Just a man getting' it done. I believe that it's realistic in it's portrayal of what happens in a war type situation. There are people fighting all over the world and this is happening everyday. Just because it usually gets cleaned up for the evening news doesn't mean this level of bloodshed isn't happening. This movie makes you happy that you don't live in one of those places. It also makes you want to find out exactly what is going on there and why. I don't think this will be the last we see of Rambo. Mr. Stallone seems to be saying something with his films now. And I'm guessing he's going to have more to say through John Rambo.
1.0~Rambo with borrowed plastic mask from Mickey Rourke in pornographic blood bath of meaningless violence! Volken Sign in Permalink If you have any sense for self-respect... for your own sight, avoid this rubbish at any cost. Truly ridiculous story with equally idiotic lines. Everything in service of complete and meaningless pornographic violence that serves no other purpose than to attract even more violence. In this charade, Rambo strikes me as someone who borrowed the wrong plastic mask from Mickey Rourke with equal wisdom of completely emphatic and silly lines. Needles to say that this be the most violent Rambo ever. In fact, it redefines the violence as reason to employ this stupidity of the story. Everything platform oriented, everything in one single day in the latest Hollywood fashion of "nonstop" action. Zero responsibility, zero intelligence. Anyone with an Ounce of professional integrity, should be embarrassed to even be mentioned with this movie. Avoid this garbage at any cost.
8.0~Not What You Would Expect. DarkVulcan29 Sign in Permalink You think you would know what expect when you would see a Sylvester Stallone flick(Demolition Man, Judge Dredd, Driven, Tango and Cash, and lets not forget the bloody awful Assassins). You would expect silly campy dialog and crazy over the top action sequences at times that could make fall asleep. But surprisingly you didn't get that with this movie, it really tried to be realistic, and not silly or over the top. I'm amazed he was able to get back into the character of John Rambo, after 20 years away from the character, and being in his 60s. But I guess it's like riding a bicycle. John Rambo leads a gang of mercenaries to rescue a group of Christian aid workers who were taken by a ruthless local infantry unit. For viewers if you like a good action war film, then this film is for you.
8.0~A truly gritty action movie and the best of the series by a bloody mile! The_Void Sign in Permalink Generally speaking, I think belated sequels made a long while after the original are a very bad thing; but that's certainly not the case here as Stallone roars back on to the screen as the disgruntled Vietnam veteran John Rambo in pure blood-soaked style and this latest entry in the series is by far the best to date! Serious kudos has to go to Stallone for this movie - not only does he return to what is probably his second most famous role (after Rocky), he also wrote, directed and produced the film - almost making Rambo a one man show! The action in this film centres on the war in Burma and Stallone starts off by showing us how brutal the military there is. Then we shift to the star of the show - Rambo, and currently he's in Thailand helping to collect snakes for a local snake show. His life takes a turn one day when some damn foolish idealists turn up wanting a ride in his boat to Burma. After much deliberation, he decides to give them a lift there. However, pretty soon it transpires that they have been taken prisoner by the Burmese Army, and Rambo ends up giving the same lift to some mercenaries... The Burmese War makes for an interesting backdrop for the film - I certainly don't know much about it, and the Asian jungle location is just perfect for an action movie like this. Of course, Rambo doesn't have much of a point to make - you could possibly argue that it's a brutal condemnation of warfare - but clearly the only point here is for Stallone to shoot, stab and explode his way through everything with a pulse - and I certainly have no problem with that! Naturally, the action is the main focal point of the film and Stallone throws in plenty - barely a minute goes by without someone getting killed, and the body count of over 200 is mightily impressive! It could even be said that the film is mainstream exploitation - it really feels like Stallone isn't holding back at all and it's great to see a movie that doesn't pull it's punches - highlights include a mass of soldiers getting torn to pieces by a chaingun wielding Rambo and a solider having his throat ripped out by the veteran's bear hands! At sixty one years of age, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Stallone is getting too old for this sort of stuff but in fact it's the opposite - he fits the role in this film much better than he did in the previous roles. His angry look and stout posture is absolutely perfect and while this film wont go down as a masterpiece - it certainly is a lot of fun and comes highly recommended to everyone who enjoys a brutal action movie!
9.0~"Die For Something!" jerekra Sign in Permalink Heading into the theaters to see "Rambo" I really had no expectations. I liked "First Blood" and "First Blood Part 2" a lot and I thought that "Rambo 3" was OK. "Rambo" took me by surprise and once again showed how great of an actor that Stallone is. The story involves a Christian group that needs to travel to a country involved in a war in the middle east. Rambo is asked to transport them there and he agrees to even though he knows the dangers that are involved there. After taking them where they need to go Rambo soon is asked to take a military group to rescue the Christian group as they were captured. Stallone once again worked his magic even in his sixties. His latest Rocky movie was great and this film was every bit as good a "Rambo" film as "Rocky Balboa" was a Rocky film. Amazing actor. In this film he does an awesome job of portraying Rambo as a fearless guy who knows what war is all about. Rambo gets a lot of great action in this film. He does not use his trade mark knife and instead uses a machete. It does the job. Also he has his bow and arrow which is awesome. The supporting cast is OK. THe main female in this film was pretty hot but there is no romantic storyline involving Rambo. The rest of the military group that Rambo transports is pretty good at what they do. The story is pretty easy to follow and you really do not have to wait long for action to get going. Speaking of action. This film is extremely violent. Those who are easy to upset because of violence in films should not see this one. There is a lot of body parts that go flying around as well as a lot of gruesome deaths that are seen on screen. Not a family film by any means. ALso they show some disturbing photos taken from wars that are really going on in real life. So just be warned that this film has a lot of violence which you may find disturbing. The only real complaint I have about this film is at times I think they may have had a little too much violence that I guess they thought was necessary but I do not know if it really was. Overall this is probably the second best of the Rambo series. A great film that took me by surprise. There is a lot of violence that kind of goes overboard but this is a great action packed film. Stallone is the man and once again he shows he is even great when he is in acting in his sixties. I recommend it to anyone who can tolerate extreme violence on screen.
9.0~For Once, an Action Film With a Good Story!... and a lot of action! dwolkonowski001 Sign in Permalink This fourth installment of Rambo was superb in comparison with the other films. Coming into the theater, I knew that I would be expecting massive explosions, and machine guns. But the plot of the movie was very well put together... This is one of the few action movies where i grew to hate the bad guys. The bad guys in this movie are so brutal, that it makes you wish Rambo just destroy them. Also, this movie was very gory. Parts of the action sequences feels like you are watching "Saving Private Ryan". Sylvester Stallone delivers yet again. I thought that he wouldn't stand a chance in keeping up with his latest movie "Rocky Balboa", but he sure does deliver in this film! If you are a fan of action movies, then "Rambo" tops the list of action packed movies! 9/10
8.0~Excellent action movie not to be missed moviewiz-4 Sign in Permalink I haven't seen Mr. Stallone for couple of years now and he is back with lots of stamina to perform in this action packed movie. I must admit that this movie is really good for action and no long winded conversation and basically all of the plots involving rescue operation. Why not casting two to three well known actor or actress and i believe it can give this film a high boost. Maybe because of the dust and dirt and mud, all are dirty and that is why nobody want to perform in "RAMBO". Even though the story can bring us back to the 80's but the atmosphere inside has some minor flaw, such as Stallone did not smile at all. He He....
9.0~The first Movie I've payed $10 for in 6 months... twostpr41 Sign in Permalink ...and it was worth every penny! I'd seen the trailer some months ago and was sooo excited! But when I heard last week that the film was not being screened for critics (aka "we're afraid reviewers will skewer our film and stick it's proverbial head on a pike and no one will want to go see it"), I was concerned. But then my ever wise husband reminded me that Rambo is Rambo and Rambo is awesome! Screw 'em! Critics put little stock in kick-assed-ness. Sly didn't make this movie to bring home statues. He made it to bring closure to one of his most famous characters, and kick some serious bad-guy butt in the proccess! Rambo is a hardened husk of a man whom in this film, showing little more than an inkling of the emotional blubbering (although ultimately vindictive) vet of First Blood, manages to kick more ass than ever before. There is a massivenes of carnage and brain matter involved that will leave you happy as a kitten in a sun beam. He's freakin' old, and done, and tired of the world. "You can't change what is" and all that. A spirited missionary and her ilk trying to bring spiritual comfort and meds to war-torn Burma commission him to boat them to a local village. From this point on it's all laugh-out-loud, hand-clapping awesomeness. I don't want to spoil it, but then, my descriptions could not even begin to do justice to the goings ons. Just see it. If you like Sly and guns and guts and exploding heads, JUST SEE IT!
6.0~Violence Deluxe Enchorde Sign in Permalink Recap: Rambo has taken refuge from the world, bitter and disappointed, deep in the jungle in Thailand. He is sought out by a group of missionaries who want him to take them by boat into Burma to help refugees oppressed by the Burmese Military. When the group themselves become hostages he goes along for the rescue mission as well. Comments: Violence. Blood. Gore. The movie can almost be summed up in these three words. It is a little unfortunate because there was room for more. The movie is not very long as it is now, and there are some undeveloped aspects left. One is the connection between Rambo and Sarah. There is something there, but nothing comes of it. Now the story is most of an excuse to show violence, with little substance. Compared to the first movie, this is what it lacks. Because the action is something special. It is very direct and doesn't hold anything back. If you don't like blood or gore this is clearly not the movie for you. Because people dies in lots, blown to pieces. I still hold the original First Blood as the best in the series, because it actually offers a little substance too. This movie is good, it had good potential, but didn't use it to its fullest. Good entertainment for action fans though. 6/10
8.0~A great and fitting ending to the series Joxerlives Sign in Permalink First Blood was a good film made into a great film by Rambo's final speech. Rambo;First Blood pt2 wasn't that great whilst Rambo 3 was unfortunate that it came out just as the Cold War was ending. Rambo is a much more mature film as indeed was Stallone at this point and it makes it immeasurably better. The Good? The great Julie Benz playing a character a long, long way from Darla in Buffy/Angel (and still gorgeous no matter how dishevelled she gets). Reputedly her Whedonverse co-star Charisma Carpenter got her recurring role in the Expendables after being recommended by Julie in this. The developing relationship between the 2 is wonderful, she reminds Rambo of everything he's lost and wants back. Stallone is magnificent in his iconic role and the final battle is truly breathtaking. One of the inspirations for Rambo was supposed to be actor and WW2 hero Audie Murphy and Rambo's last stand here with the machine gun is very similar to how Murphy won the Congressional Medal of Honour. Also kudos to Sylvester Stallone who with this film drew more attention to the suffering of the Burmese people than Amnesty International managed in decades and received death threats as a result. Violent as this film is you have to remember that what actually happens in Burma is so much worse as graphically demonstrated by the real-life news footage we see in the opening sequence. The Bad? Rather beggars belief that a peace-loving Christian church would hire a team of mercenaries to rescue their lost missionaries. Would have liked a bit more character development for the mercs, all we have is Mr Aggressive and Schoolboy, maybe it's on the deleted scenes? The idea that a Claymore anti-personnel mine could set off a sixty year old bomb is pretty ridiculous, the Claymore spits out ball bearings like a shotgun, they certainly won't penetrate a metal casing and wouldn't trigger the detonator if they did. Loved, loved, loved the ending. We see Rambo just as we saw him in the opening sequence of First Blood, finally heading home to his father's ranch (I think Rambo's dad remarried and he's going to meet his new brothers and sisters). As the song goes the road is long. He has one last look down it, obviously considering the past and maybe carrying on. But he realises he's finally reached the end and returns to his family and his true place in the world, back where he belongs at last. It's a great ending and we should definitely end the series here.
9.0~Wow amazing top class waynehorrorshow Sign in Permalink It was a great film it was a film that you wanted ramboo to kill them all . Jammed packed action 😎🔪
9.0~Oh yes, yes, yes strange_days_uk Sign in Permalink OK, if it's a complex and original storyline you're after, we all know Rambo ain't it! But, if it's absolute gratuitous violence, as realistic as you will ever see on a screen, then boy does this film deliver!! For some, the graphic realism of bodies being vapourised by mortar fire, and arms and legs flying around, will just be too much. For me, I wanted more. I have never seen anything like this on film, it took my breath away. And as a viewer you do get involved, you build up a genuine hatred and disgust for the militia leader who has rather grotesque sexual appetites, and cruel torturous tendencies. I loved this film, for the simple visual experience.
10.0~I LOVED this movie! tmorgan_82 Sign in Permalink I knew the second I saw the previews for this movie that I was going to see it! I've always been a big Rambo fan because of things he stands for and his passion for what he believes. I was not disappointed...I was hooked from the moment it started. The action was amazing and realistic and the story was great. Say what you will about Stallone being too old, I don't care. He certainly didn't look or act it. He was in amazing shape and to me, the stunts were even better this time. I almost want to go see it again before it leaves the big-screen. It really was the perfect end to the Rambo series, just as Rocky Balboa was to that series. He finally comes full circle! I loved it! Excellent, excellent movie.
8.0~Exactly what to expect from a Rambo movie davidkcwong Sign in Permalink First off, I'm not a Stallone fan but this movie gave me what I was looking for in a Rambo movie. Was suddenly craving for an action film and watched it again today in 2018 and damn this movie gave me the chills. This movie has its flaws. Weak story, poor scripts, mediocre acting and probably too much blood and gore for many people. But having watched Rambo growing up, the only impression I got from Rambo was... as Rambo, you go in alone and you kill... ALONE! One man beats all. Rambo charges in and decimate his enemies both with stealth kills and his big as* guns. Growing up, in numerous occasions, such as playing online games, skirmishes, paint balls, etc. whenever you see someone charging in alone fearlessly, the first thing that comes to my mind is: "Are you freaking Rambo???" and that is exactly the impression this movie gave me, one man VS 100+ men and still manages to save the day. Like I said, there are many flaws in the movie and the whole movie probably doesn't make any sense. But I am glad Stallone made this movie and played Rambo. Heard he's making a Rambo 5 and I truly hope he can keep being the invincible "hero" that we grew up watching.
10.0~Thank you Sylvester Stallone!!! brewmaster70 Sign in Permalink John Rambo is the greatest man in the history of the universe! This movie was everything I had hoped it would be and more. I always considered my blood-lust to be insatiable, but found myself leaving completely satisfied. My only complaint would be that it is over and I am still not watching it. Society owes a great deal of acclaim to Sylvester Stallone for creating this epic spectacle of carnage. I go to see dramatic films to see good story telling and truly believable character acting. I go to action movies to see outlandish stunts and supreme levels of violence. Needless plot development only takes valuable time away from machine-gunning infantry and arrows through the face. Thank you Mr. Stallone for re-introducing me to the action movie genre. Well done sir.
8.0~Absolutely top-notch action cpbadgeman Sign in Permalink Twenty years have passed since Sylvester Stallone last portrayed ex-Green Beret John Rambo. In that lackluster installment (the weakest of the series IMHO), he fought the Red Army in Afghanistan. This time around it's the turn of the Burmese army (a very safe choice of opponent for our hero given the current political climate) to eat the whoop-ass and return for seconds. The plot is very basic: Rambo is living in Thailand and agrees to ferry a group of annoying American missionaries into the wilds of Burma (the film does not call it "Myanmar") so that they can minister to the Karen tribe- who are being persecuted by the Burmese military. When this task is accomplished it looks like he can get back to his current pastimes of sword-smelting, trapping cobras, and spouting bits of sophomoric philosophy (example: "You cannot change what is"). Needless to say it doesn't turn out like that- the missionaries are taken prisoner by the brutal Burmese military and Rambo ends up leading a group of mercenaries who have been hired to rescue them. What else is there to say? Well, quite a few things actually. First of all, the plentiful action scenes are amazingly well-done. Stallone directed this effort himself and has done an outstanding job of depicting the high-velocity carnage that occupies all of the film's second half. This film is worth seeing on a big screen for the battle scenes alone. Without a doubt this is the most violent of the series, at times the screen positively drips with blood. Also, even at the age of 61, Stallone can still play the title character convincingly. Put simply, he looks like he was carved out of a particularly massive block of granite. Though Rambo says little, Stallone does imbue him with a genuine humanity- in this case centering on his understanding that he is unable to see the point of life without war. The supporting cast are also agreeable, notably Julie Benz as the missionary who convinces a disinterested Rambo that her colleagues expedition has a purpose, and Matthew Marsden as a likable English sniper. To wrap up, "Rambo" never tries to be anything other than what it looks- a high-octane jungle bloodbath. If you are a fan of the previous installments, don't wait for the DVD- see this yesterday!
9.0~Shockingly Awesome *(CableGuy)* Sign in Permalink I have to say, this exceeded any expectations I had for a Rambo film. This is no sad comeback farce, this is the real deal. Sylvester Stallone plays to his strengths, using his age (and mileage) to his advantage as a haunted old bulwark. There's no oiled-up posturing or sad old man-boobs on display. The drama's quick and to the point. Rambo maybe speaks 50 words throughout. Gone is the ridiculous action hero of Rambo 2 or 3, gunning down hundreds of bad guys alone atop a hill without cover. This Rambo sticks to stealth and surprise, and he has allies that are both memorable and competent, which is nice for a change. I will also say Rambo has the most consistent and realistic gore you've ever seen. You could call it over-the-top, but really I think it's just as close to real as you'll get. Limbs get blown off, heads get sheared, children are killed on-camera. It's all in your face, not as exploitation, but simply illustrating what it really means to rain lead upon a human being. Let's not kid ourselves, this isn't the film to end war, and in the end, it's a kick-ass action movie. It does exhibit some conscience without hitting you over the head with it. Burma really is one of the prime shames of the human race, and I'm glad to see this movie bring attention to it. I feel so happy that Stallone could pull of such a great movie. He really does care about this character and this movie, and it shows. If you don't like heap big explodo, this ain't your flick. But if you like action, it's a can't-miss. Seriously!
10.0~Rambo Revealed Finally dante440 Sign in Permalink I thought first blood was a bit dark, Stallones acting was just superb in that one. The rest were just typical 80's clowns in that movie. after that, the 2nd and 3rd were just dull and mainstream. Just followed the trend of missing in action aside chuck norris with POW and stuff. There were few more others. besides conan the barbarian, commando made its mark thanks to these 1 man war movies. Really made Arnold famous for us Asians. We were war movie addicts back then. Ok about this one, I think this is what Stallone and the writer had in mind all along. This was one is the best Rambo yet with so much pure and simple gore in it. Almost like a slasher movie. So much blood, the story line revealed what Rambo is all about rather than who he is. to make it simple, Rambo is like the modern day saint. But he's got some serious weapons with him. If you're looking for build ups and endings, forget it. You watch this to let go of your anger and hatred towards some really bad personnel and unfortunately, the Asians were the culprits again. Don't miss this one, Action and Gore is written all over it. Like I said, its the best Rambo yet.
7.0~Gut ripping fun for the whole family! VideoGameHollywood Sign in Permalink I went to go see Rambo on a bunch of liquor and had a blast. This is a movie to see with the boys and intoxicated a humanly possible. I loved the original film and this one was a great sequel. All that was missing was Col. Kirby (R.I.P.). Rambo was ultra violent with great effects, even though a lot of the blood was CGI. The story wasn't amazing, especially the strike team he had with him, but that's what made it fun. If I were 12, this would be my all time favorite movie. The bad guys were REALLY BAD, and I loved seeing them disemboweled. If you love any Stallone film, then go see this and enjoy the bloodbath. Rating = B- VideoGameHollywood.com
9.0~Both unnerving and fun to watch. troyaker Sign in Permalink Let me start off by saying that this is one of the most violent films I have ever seen. What you see in the first part of the film is how absolutely horrible the bad guys (in this case the Burmese army) are. The things they do to the men, women, and children of this little village are so disgusting that it makes you nauseous. Then comes Rambo. Rambo leaves a whole lot of the army not feeling very good. And he does it in an ultra-violent way. But after seeing how atrocious these people are, you find yourself cheering when they get what is coming to them. Now as far as Stalone, he looks bad. Really bad. He needs to lay of the human growth hormone. He look disgusting!
5.0~violence for violence sake thepancakeman Sign in Permalink Yes, this movie is violent. It's Rambo, you expect that. But let's try to keep it real. I believe the body count in this movie is somewhere in the 230's, but the movie itself says there's about 100 'bad guys'. So did we kill them all twice, or what?? Yes, there are some 'good guys' and 'innocent bystanders' in that count, but a long way from 130 of them. The movie apart from body parts flying everywhere isn't too bad, but unfortunately the focus does seem to be almost exclusively on blowing people up (even when they just get shot, there seems to be a "blow up" effect. Go figure.) I agree with one other poster who said that it got to the point it was almost comical because it was so ridiculous.
8.0~Extreme juxtaposition to liberal sentiments in the media. capnpatrick Sign in Permalink This was a good movie, it had a very B-action movie feel to it, which I like(apparently people are filled with jelly). Other than the solid action and extreme almost over the top gore that I'm sure others have already commented on plenty this movie stood in extreme juxtaposition to other action movies and the liberal "anti-war" political sentiment that is commonplace in Hollywood. This movie is unique in that is shows the villain as pure evil. The antagonist hardly ever speaks and he shows no mercy or feeling, he cannot be reasoned with and he commands an army of people so corrupt with power they have become sadists. The point in Rambo is that pure evil exists in the world and the only realistic way to stop it is through contained violence (Rambo's self-announced purpose in life). Even the religious pacifist found it necessary in the end to engage in violence to stop evil men and their never ending terror. I enjoyed this movie for what it stood for, Rambo takes place in a real life place and a real life conflict (yes it's real even if the media ignores it) during which it becomes necessary to fight and die to protect the basic human freedoms of the innocent.
8.0~A movie about morality and violence imbluzclooby Sign in Permalink My favorite line is during Rambo's dream sequence as he mutters, I didn't kill for my country, I killed for myself." This was the most sincere and honest demotion of war. We are always taught by American propaganda how soldiers and being a soldier is defending and fighting for the good old USA. When in reality, when the chips are down, we ultimately defend ourselves in times of violence and conflict. Stallone's final installment of Rambo is a power house of violence and good special effects. The acting is adequate and Stallone gives one of his most brooding and truthful performances. Although he looks older and a bit more dissipated, he's still tough and strong as nails like a commando Tarzan hybrid. The setting takes place in Burma where there is actually a genocide occurring there as rebels pillage, maim, rape, dismember and destroy the weak inhabitants of the local villages along the river. Rambo decides to assist a group of Karen Christians and hired mercenaries to fight the rebels. So you know the suspense builds up quite well, but for the grace of God, Rambo comes to save the day by defying all odds of bombs, explosions and numerous hails of gunfire. He's instigating his one-man army with a little aid from the other folks. My main qualm is that the script shies away from being too wordy or leading to moral themes and allows the action to overtake the plot. But we aren't complaining, we are here to see the macho bad ass pave his way into movie iconolatry, not Apocalypse Now.
5.0~Great Work Sylvester SammerAsker Sign in Permalink you don't go into a Rambo movie expecting great acting and a believable plot . you expect an impossible mission and a bulldozer Rambo running over it and thats what we got , an action packed film , very entertaining , with a little pointer to Burma's tragedy , to be honest after i watcher rocky i didn't expect sly to do that well on Rambo . and at the little time at the movies beginning that prepared for the action i thought i was right , but damn was i wrong . when the action starts there's no stopping it. again i was suspicious of Stallone Directing ... but again great job Sylvester the plot was old time , you feel like watching a movie from the 80's but with todays gadgets , very little cheesy acting but again when i watch Rambo I'm not expecting great acting as much as a roller coaster ride from hell and that Mr.Sylvester Stallone Delivered In My Honest Opinion Sylvester Stallone should star his Directing career on Action movies and we're expecting a lot finally and again Congratulations Mr.Stallone on a great movie
9.0~So violent it's funny! Mash-the-stampede Sign in Permalink I don't really know where to begin with explaining just how awesome this movie is! I mean, I was looking forward to this film for about a year before it's release and finally I got to see it on it's opening night and......WOW!!! This film met my every expectation and more! The film's storyline isn't really anything spectacular or very original but that's not the point, after all it's an action movie right? And not one of thoughs new millennium action/adventure/thriller type films, we're talking old-school 80's style classic action movie mixed in with modern special effects of realistic ultra-violence!!! The dialogue's cheesy but the actor's take their roles so seriously (especially Stallone) that it's so easy to get caught up in it without laughing your arse off! The film starts off pretty tame but as the film progresses, the violence and brutality escalates to such a point that by the final scene, I was laughing at just how insanely violent this film is!!! It's as if every action scene has to out-do the previous and in that it really succeeds! This movie is a must see for any action-junkie and it is up there with the first Rambo film and although the film is only 80 minutes long, it feels like an epic 2 and a half hour war film! There really needs to be more movies made like this and hopefully this starts off a trend of REAL action movies again packed full of explosions instead of CGI special-effects which seems to be the norm these days. I reckon Van-Damme should make a big-screen film again, I mean if Stallone can do it at age 62....Van Damme can definitely do it at age 48! Can't wait for the DVD!!!
8.0~boe_dye sez.... good lord this is violent boe_dye Sign in Permalink Now, i am not giving it 8/10 for violence, but quite honestly this movie was really freaking violent. I mean we have bits of flesh, limbs being blown left and right, chunks of things dripping, mutilation in all it's most graphic detail... This is a really violent movie here folks... It's also a really good movie. the reason i say that is because somehow it had the ability to really draw me into this world. the acting for all intent and purposes was more minimalistic then anything else. Stallone and company didn't say much, but what was said was very prolific and to the point. More was being said with a single glance or a look, then actually with a word. What was great about this film was that it was very much a send off. In all actuality it could have been the last 30 minutes of Rambo III, so i don't think that it is fair to call it it's own movie. it's more of a prologue showing how John Rambo finally makes it full circle, and that's what was nice about it. Rambo fans will most definitely enjoy it, as will 14 year old boys of all ages... Hex even my wife liked it, but then again she's really cool too >8^P
10.0~just one of the best movie's of all time ruimichael Sign in Permalink i saw Rambo, yesterday...here in Portugal and it's awesome, Stallone is the man... it was so cool to see Rambo killing the Burnese soldiers with the heavy machine gun... i really felt happy to see him do that, after they killed the villagers he should make a new trilogy... Rambo is an icon...and will not be forgotten i've cried in the end of the movie, after the final war.... me and my buddies...will go to see this movie 3 more times because it was great.... MR. Stallone please...deliver more Rambo's like this it's the 80's style again i recommend this movie to all people who like 80's movies it's the best
6.0~Older, bloodier but not that different - 59% Benjamin_Cox Sign in Permalink Stallone's current trend for revisiting his glory years, sparked by the success of "Rocky Balboa", continues with this unashamed and extremely gory all-action war film. I made the mistake of thinking of this as a reboot but this is not the case - this is essentially a remake of "Rambo: First Blood - Part 2" in which our monotoned killing-machine hero returns to the fray once again. I suppose that there must be a market for this sort of stuff (or should that read snuff) but personally, I would have liked a little less entrails and a bit more soul to it. Stallone, who also wrote and directed this movie, returns as John Rambo, a deeply disaffected Vietnam veteran who is living under the radar in Thailand. His simple existence hunting snakes is interrupted by a group of Christian aid workers led by Michael (Paul Schulze) who are all on a mission to war-torn Burma and need Rambo's boat to get into the country. After being persuaded by fellow aid worker Sarah (Julie Benz), Rambo leads them into Burma before leaving them there where they are soon taken hostage by the militia led by Major Tint (Maung Maung Khin). Upon returning, Rambo is contacted by their pastor (Ken Howard) after they fail to return and recovering some of his humanity, Rambo joins a team of mercenaries also hired to retrieve them. I suspect that Stallone has been playing "Mortal Kombat" in the intervening years between sequels, judging by the frankly ridiculous levels of gore in this film. "Rambo" really pushes the boundaries in the violence stakes, nudging the film away from mainstream action almost towards extreme horror. You see, in full CG-enhanced Technicolour, throats being ripped out, heads being shot clean off, bodies being vaporised by land-mines and other injuries that beggar belief. Eventually, you kinda feel sullied by such needless carnage and to be honest, I had a bitter taste in my mouth by the time the film ended. But such is the raison d'etre of "Rambo" that things like plot and acting take second fiddle to the chaos - Stallone's expression, for example, never changes throughout the whole film until he gets his hands on a jeep-mounted machine gun and the realisation that he can really start dealing out death makes him yell like a Viking going into battle. It is as dumb and macho as its director but I guess that most fans will lap "Rambo" up as the best action movie of 2008. And from a technical stand-point, I can see where they're coming from - it looks the business and with genuine news footage opening the movie, it gives the movie a grim realism and makes it weirdly plausible. But I just wanted it to surprise me and "Rambo" felt like a blood-soaked train journey, unable to deviate from its course of utterly, mindless violence. Stallone's insistence that the violence is justified in order to highlight the brutality of Burma's military rulers doesn't ring true - I think Stallone was just happy to show the amount of violence that he does now. My advice is to stick with the original "First Blood" which is smarter, more realistic and doesn't feel like a brainless, trigger-happy excuse for killing hundreds (and I do mean hundreds) of anonymous extras.
10.0~Rambo: A War Film 20 Years Later Macabro Sign in Permalink No other movie in the Rambo Series displays the intensity and cruelty of war as does Stallone's new adventure. This new Rambo film is violent, crude, dark and serious. Stallone captured the essence of war in this epic film; its fatalities and all elements that surround it. Also, he got into the development of his character. Many years have passed and we see an older, angrier, bitter and disappointed Rambo who is haunted by the demons of the past and the traumas of war. In the end, leading Rambo to find closure and to heal coming back home. The action in the film is constant and Rambo's courage and heroism is present through the whole film. The scenery is amazing and the camera work is awesome in the battle scenes. There are more characters helping Rambo this time, so it gives more credibility to the story being that he is older and does not have the stamina and muscles he had more than 20 years ago. This is a must see film for all of us who grew up in the 80's and Rambo or Rocky were our childhood heroes. or just for anyone that wants to watch a great action film.
7.0~An Awesome movie!!! mjwell04 Sign in Permalink For an action flick, it's a pretty good movie! For a Rambo fan, it is just plain awesome!!! The violence is not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. Let me tell you something else, there isn't one bad guy that didn't get what was coming to him. Nuff said! Stallone has gotten a lot of experience through the years about how to create a great action sequence and you can tell by the way everything is directed. I also think this film is much more believable than the previous two. The whole thing in Rambo III with him being on a horse and being missed by a Gatling gun in a chopper just wasn't working with me. The 80's are back and better than ever. See the new Die Hard, Rocky Balboa, Rambo, and coming soon Indiana Jones!!!
10.0~More Belly-Laughs For Your Money cogleone Sign in Permalink Rambo is blinding. I went to see it for a laugh, got more than I bargained for. Forget all the negative reviews. Most of those are written by sour feminists, who'd rather promote some bra-burning agenda than see artistry unfold before their eyes. Rambo ferries some God botherers up the River to Burma, he fancies the chick. The do-gooders get kidnapped by the brutal Burmese Army. Cue a bunch of hilarious hard edged mercenaries, primed to inflict some apocalyptic violence on these aggressors. They treat 'boatman' Rambo like an imbecile, but Sly proves his worth, rescuing their arses by firing arrows into crazed militia's faces with unbelievable precision. They rescue the captives, the army send out the hounds. Rambo improvises, with an unexploded World War 2 bomb, he tricks the pooches and they drink an 80,000 mega tonne explosion which must have killed at least 500 people, what with the rippling aftershock. Rambo chops the top third of some army general's body off, jumps behind a mounted rail gun and fires about 5,000 rounds a minute into the jungle. We see Burmese limbs somersaulting through the forest, rib cages collapsing, heads splintering, boatmen banqueting on rocket launchers. Eventually Rambo takes one in the shoulder, how injured is he? Well this question is soon answered when another truckload of crazed army men arrive. Sensing danger, Rambo ignores his wound, gets second-wind, jumps behind the freshly loaded rail-gun, and lets them have it! The truck's inhabitants are lambs to the slaughter, majestically rag-dolling as Sly peppers their fidgeting bodies with titanium bullets. Eventually all the violence eases off, Rambo has one last present for the leader of the army. He plunges his knife into his gut, not content with this, Rambo drags said knife sideways and disembowels the poor bastard. I lost count of how many times I belly-laughed during this film, they don't make them like that any more! It's ultra-violence of the highest order. Thank you Sly, I left the theatre thoroughly entertained, probably not a first-date movie.
8.0~Not too bad at all DJAkin Sign in Permalink There will never be another "First Blood" but this was good. There was a ton of violence. There was some skip frame photography as a nod to the director of Alien, but that was OK. There was this really mean Burmese General that constantly smoked as he would watch his soldiers kill their own people. There are not too many places as violent as Burma. Thank goodness Rambo was there with his bow and arrow. One of the best scenes was when that guy kept taunting Rambo on the boat and calling him "boatman". I was surprised he didn't try to throw him over the edge right there and then! I give this a thumbs up. As I was in the theater, everybody kept laughing because the movie was so over the top with violence!
10.0~Rambo IV jaadugar Sign in Permalink Without a doubt, I think the critics are all just jealous, that a man of 61 can pull off after 20 years what men 1/2 the age can't. The movie is a thrill, action, nice music, and well done on whatever scale you want to think about. I think it's just incredible that they could pull it off and bring RAMBO back to life again for a final run. It's good to see them come full circle on the entire franchise. A proper ending for a legendary character....my vote is 10 of 10. The critics may feel there is no storyline, however, I believe Rambo requires no introduction, no preface or body, just a concluding fact that he will win. And thats what this Rambo truly accomplishes, is a victory for all his fans. Thanks for taking us back 20 years and showing us how real films were made with real action heroes.
8.0~Definitely Won My Vote KillingJoker Sign in Permalink After I saw the new Rambo, I was kind of hectic wrestling with my mind about the fact I have not seen any of the other movies "yet". Yes that is correct I have never seen First Blood, Rambo: First Blood Part II, & Rambo III. A huge chunk of me was mad at myself for this but then I got to thinking and I'm now half way happy that I took this movie in first because there I would be like most fans writing a review about a sequel and bringing it down simply because it was not as good as the first or second, etc. This movie has a lot of heart and it's very obvious after the first hour. It's bloody and tends to be somewhat gory too, but that's where the realism comes in which is very impressive in my book and I've seen quite a bit in my day. Some of my favorite horror films are not even close to being this bloody which says something in the matter of using detail. Story was overall good and personally Sylvester Stallone was at his best yet as far as acting. Give this movie a chance, it won't disappoint.
10.0~Excellent file for the fan of the Rambo Series rmarvin-engineer Sign in Permalink If you liked any of the other Rambo movies I'm sure you will like this one two. Not for the faint of heart or those on the far left fringes. The film earned its R rating (lots of violence). So I wouldn't take young kids. Although most Stalone movies don't have much story or plot this one actually had some things to think about if you paid attention. I really likes the lead actress's role in the movie as a missionary trying to make the world a better place, save souls, help people, and make a difference. I think she really succeeded in her goal. Although not in the way she intended. In the move we see that John Rambo is more than just a killing machine or someone not interested in being saved too. There is some redemption for us all in the end.
5.0~Ram-bore.... mcfly-31 Sign in Permalink I was never a fan of these films to begin with. But with one of the more brutal and compelling trailers behind it (the nasty Youtube one, not the TV spots), I decided to give it a whirl. Unfortunately, what turned me off on previous "Rambo" outings, was the lethargic pacing. Sure, when the explosions are in full-force and Sly is dramatically rising behind a baddie to gut him, there's life (or mass death). But as with the other incarnations, this needed a serious kick in the butt in terms of story development. First time around twenty-five years ago it was the Northwest, then 'Nam, lastly Afghanistan. Here, Stallone's hero emerges outside of Burma in exile, when bothered by a group of American aid workers. Common sense gaffes are what distracted me to begin with, how this group of people are so hell-bent on entering a territory where they are sure to be dead within 24 hours. Why not pick a more reasonably safer land with starving kids, or hurricane victims? Something. But the film needs to provide something for Rambo to fight for. So it leads to a predictable set-up with the fools administering aid for all of ten minutes before a siege of bullet-ridden carnage has them held hostage. Ol' John is then visited by the aid worker's boss to help rescue them. This results in my second complaint: a band of mercenaries is hired to help help Rambo??? This guy works alone! That's like giving Superman a buddy to tag along. And to top it off, the band of hired guns includes a hateful, whining leader you can't even stand! I don't know if Stallone wrote these guys in to take some of the physical burden off of him or what, but any way you slice it, the film is brought down because of it. Then we arrive at the action sequences, which are carried off adequately. Stallone, who's always been underrated as a director, orchestrates everything quite well. Save for some chaotic, dramamine camera wildness, it's nicely photographed. Some have complained of the violence, but I was more distracted by the use of the dreaded CGI. Limbs and torsos and heads eviscerated in large amounts with obvious inserted blood, was annoying. The big finale was something of a let-down as well, punctuated by a redundant 17-minute montage of machine-gun fire. Stallone, dusting off and trotting out his near-mute loner motif, isn't as annoying with that character as in some other films. Still in great shape, and wholly capable of jumping around in the rain. And can this guy still run! LOTS of footwork involved in this jungle effort, and his age doesn't show in the slightest. I didn't hate the film, mind you. It's brutal realism of war-torn areas and the psycho nut-bags that seem to exist only to rape and execute is graphically displayed. But following such a dynamic, triumphant, and frankly, kick-ass trailer, apparently is too much for this film to live up to. Plus a dose of needless characters and wrong-headed motives will leave this out of my DVD collection months down the line.
9.0~**When you're pushed, killing's as easy as breathing** jamison_hult4646 Sign in Permalink John Rambo returns to get his killing fix in this fourth kickass part of the RAMBO series. Rambo now lives as a"snakefarmer" in Thailand, working as a grunt and living the simple life, far away from his native Arizona. He is approached by a group of bible thumping peace activists to ask Rambo to transport them up up the river to Burma to help the locals who are being ravaged by a devastating civil war, where they are tortured, raped, and murdered with no mercy. Rambo first denies to help them, telling them to "go home" and "F**K the world!" because he believes they will not change anything. He later gives in, cruises them up the river, and drops them off. S**T really hits the fan when the Burmese military raid the local village and holds the peaceniks as captives. Rambo has no choice but to team up with a band of mercenaries, strap on a commando knife, and bail their sally asses out of trouble....and the heads do roll...literally. I have to admit, going into this movie, I was expecting a real crapfest comeback film as I felt the same before going to see ROCKY BALBOA. Once again , I stand corrected! This movie has a solid plot and some really serious action. Extreme gore and killings are not held back for anything, right from the beginning! Watching this flick had some nostalgic properties to it for myself, growing up as a child in the 80's and being a big fan of Stallone. The action sequences are brutal, realistic, and very graphic and not for the squeamish, but they are AWESOME! There's one thing that is still prevalent and still remains in this series of films: After all these years, John Rambo still has a hard on for carnage, almost to the point of unnecessary overkill, like the part when he gets a bad guy in a headlock and chokes him from behind. But thats not enough, no, he proceeds to rip out the guys trachea with his bare hand.....SWEET! All I gotta say is RENT THIS RAMBO FANS!! You will not be let down!
10.0~Get some. ianjnash Sign in Permalink I really had my doubts about this film. I went to see it as I like his final Rocky film. I was not expecting what I sat and watched. Rambo is older, wiser and just plain tired. He wants to be left alone to live his life and try and accept what he is. A killing machine, a totally over the top killing machine. The thing that I really liked about this film is the way all the clichés are real. The interfering white Christians, the really evil Burmese officer, the totally out of their depth HIRED GUNS. The violence is really in your face and there is no pandering or pulling the camera at any time. Go see this film is you are a late thirties male. Leave the girlfriend/ wife/partner at home and just enjoy this film for what it is. A total in your face kill them all get some Johnny ride. WELCOME HOME JOHN.
1.0~Rape and death cinny85 Sign in Permalink SPOILER ALERT Not sure what you can spoil about this film considering it basically is just death and rape, but there you go. A group of idiots who think a bible and dental care is going to make a difference in a "war zone" where people are raped, tortured and killed in the most horrible ways imaginable, are taken by these charming gentlemen. It is up to Rambo and a small group of soldiers to get them out of the mess they got themselves into. As a result a lot more people get hurt and killed. Of course Rambo saves the day by going in guns blazing. It's a very deep and moving story, really. It's a Rambo film and if Rambo was a word, the definition would be "blood, flying guts and death" so don't expect anything else.
8.0~Bloody good time TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink This is the first Rambo movie I watch, I intend to watch the first three, as well(I made the decision to before watching this). Almost all I know about Rambo as of writing this is what I saw in this film. The trailers promised a massive action-film(and the red band ones, a blood-soaked one, at that), and the movie most definitely delivers. It's entertaining throughout. The plot is fine, certainly not the best, but it isn't the focus of this, anyway. The pacing is spot-on, I was neither bored nor overwhelmed(which is not at all to say that the action is anything less than epic) for a second, from start to finish. The acting is reasonable, no downright embarrassing performances. Dialog varies, but the good is more great than the bad is awful. Characters aren't half bad. Cinematography and editing are pretty good, if the latter doesn't permit the viewer much of an overview of some of the battles, although that could be the intention, when in such a situation for real, one cannot be expected to fully grasp everything. The action is awesome. Explosions, gun-fights, it's there, it's wicked cool. It should be noted by anyone who even vaguely considers this that this has a *lot* of gore and blood, and it doesn't attempt to hide it from sight. Effects are solid, all the way. The guns, well-chosen and accurately depicted. This is only the second of Sly's directing efforts I've watched(first being the second Rocky film), and he certainly does commendable work, here. One thing that could be argued, and that others have brought up, is the way the violence is shown in the same manner whether it is against those we sympathize with, or those we want to watch Stallone put the hurt on, which can be criticized(as well as the inclusion of actual footage from the conflict). He can be called either brave or foolhardy for his decision to make this, both his sit in the directing chair and his position in front of the camera, starring, and I suppose there are points where his age shows, but I feel he pulled it off well, remarkably so, in both. I recommend this to any fan of action, Sylvester Stallone, and, I presume, Rambo... but do get a second opinion, someone who's actually watched the others, before you take my word on that last one. 8/10
10.0~The Warrior is back!!! gcats-1 Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone is Rambo and Rambo is Sylvester Stallone... I was on the edge of my seat, my heart was raising, palms were clammy , filled with emotion, anger, joy and satisfaction when the bad guys got obliterated by the true all time warrior of the big screen,, Rambo is back, better, meaner, angrier, powerful, explosive and larger than ever before.. When the bad guys need to be taken out there is only one solution... Rambo... Set in the jungle in Burma, Rambo emerges like a biblical figure and swoops down like the Archangel Gabriel from the heavens to vaporise all that is evil and to bring salvation to the innocent. Stallone I salute you, I bow before you. Arnold, Chuck Norris, and Bruce Willis eat you heart out... Can't wait for Rambo 5,6,7,8!!!!!!!!
10.0~Bravo TheScraggler Sign in Permalink I'm usually not inspired to sit down and write a review of a film I've seen unless it's SO bad that I just have to get some aggression out, but I just had to write something to explain how happy I am after seeing Rambo. Don't get me wrong, I'm not happy about the atrocities presented in the film or the situation in Burma which are all too real, I just haven't experienced (and I believe that's the right wording, you don't see this film, you experience it) a feeling like this at the movies in a VERY long time. When this film was over, I wanted to find Sylvester Stallone and thank him. I wanted to thank him for being at the top of his game and delivering a truly visceral experience rather than just phoning it in which is what he could've done all too easily. Simply put, this is a great action film. Maybe one of the best ever. I know that reaction could be chalked up to having just seen it but I honestly can't remember the last time I had this much adrenaline running through me after seeing a movie. When it was over (and I know that this is a very overused analogy) I felt exactly how I feel after getting off of a roller coaster. I was jittery and pumped and I wanted to experience it again instantly. Everyone else has pretty much outlined the plot (missonaries go up river to deliver medical attention, get kidnapped and Rambo has to save them) so it would seem redundant to repeat it here. Instead, I'll say that the direction, the editing and the technical expertise of this film are outstanding. This isn't a paint by numbers kind of action film, Stallone seems to have truly wanted to deliver something different to the audience and he has succeeded admirably. And, by the way, those reports by other posters of people cheering and clapping and yelling "RAMBO!" in the parking lot of the movie theater are not fabrication. The exact same thing happened when I saw it tonight. Great job, Sly. I hope it's a big, fat number one hit for you.
8.0~"Trying to save a life is not wasting yours." LeonLouisRicci Sign in Permalink We need our Superheroes to help eliminate the Scum that populates our Planet. Here we are in Burma the sight of a recent Genocide and assorted unmentionable atrocities. But that doesn't stop Stallone from not only mentioning these unthinkables but rubs our faces in it so as we can't help but notice. Delivering this Message in a Hard R-Rated Movie that has CGI and other Violence shown in Video Game Styling is one way to get this Political Statement into the skulls of otherwise oblivious Teenagers and slow-to-come-along Apathetics. It would probably be quite amazing at just how many of these Moviegoers sped to their keyboards and Googled Burma after seeing Rambo Kick Ass. For that the Film cannot be faulted. It is one of the tenants of Art to open up perceptions and shine a light in the darkness. So yes, there is blood galore, and body parts a flying, and it is all rather dumbed-down, but as long as People are talking and some of them get involved if only on an intellectual internet level, so be it. This is Entertainment, Horror Movie Entertainment. Thing is, this Horror is taken from the pages of Real Life and is not a Fantasy or a personal Story. It is a Story affecting Millions and there is hardly a whisper on the Evening News. So it is up to our Fictional Superhero to lead the charge.
10.0~Rambo Rocks!!! gstruckman4 Sign in Permalink I just got back from the theater and I can honestly say that this movie rocked!This was the most brutal film I've ever seen.This movie puts "Saving Private Ryan" and "Aliens Vs. Predator:Requiem" to shame.I hate to say this,but I had a huge smile on my face as Rambo killed/slaughtered his foes.If you see the movie you will understand why. I grew watching Rambo and Rocky and I cannot tell how glad I am that both franchises have made solid comebacks.Sly Stallone is still credible playing the role of John Rambo and I felt as if an old friend came back to visit.I hope every fan of the Rambo series goes out to see this film.
10.0~FANTASTIC. Just what I expected from this type of movie. bjagront Sign in Permalink This was a truly fantastic film. The plot was thin, the character development was so-so and THE ACTION WAS GREAT!!!! Just what I wanted. I didn't want "Gone With The Wind" type greatness out of this movie. I wanted John Rambo wreaking havoc on some well deserving bad guys. That's just what this will give you. If you're looking for a pure, entertaining, mindless action film, this one delivers. If you expect anything else, you're watching the wrong film. Stalone is getting a little "long in the tooth" for the action roles but I think he did an admirable job with this one. He was playing an old guy anyway so it's not like he was "out of his element". If you are a guy, 18 to 35, and want a great movie to watch with your pals while throwing back a couple of beers, this is your movie.
1.0~ramblow danfrattura Sign in Permalink This movie was a travesty to the movie industry. It just goes to show if you have enough money in Hollywood then you can make bad movies. The script must have been written by a five year old alcoholic on acid. A sixty year old man could not do the things sly does in this horrible movie. My boy joe klink could write a better movie then this, its a shame hes not the director of this movie then it would be winning mad Oscars. Im tired of this stupid sequel trend in holly hood because every movie that is below average but makes some money gets re-created. the first rambo was nice and i loved eating the most popcorn while watching it. this rambo made me think of that bambi deer character and puke. i don't like this movie and it should be banned from the united states.
10.0~kicked ass !!!!!!!!! coryschack Sign in Permalink this movie was all action, very real, and is a must see, if you don't see this movie you are missing out, if you didn't like it sorry for you but i guess you need to stick to the G rated movies, it left me saying WOW !!!!!!!!! I cant wait till i see this movie again, its like the best Rambo ever, and i hope that this isn't the end..... wow.......... wow........... wow.................. wow........ a must see.......... wow...............wow............... wow....... wow......... wow....and for those of you who say that this movie is boring i want to know what movie you went to see cause it wasn't this one, it made me want more and it proves that sometimes you can do it right a fourth time
10.0~Absolute movie nessundorma-1 Sign in Permalink This is THE MOVIE! If someone say to you "there is too much blood and blah blah blah..." Do not mind him at all! New Rambo is not about blood and gore, Sly tried to show us what is it to live in god forgotten contrives! The violence is pure and explicit! But this is probably how it is there! The movie is Absolutely GREAT, one of the best ACTION movies ever! And on top of this, when you will hear the main song in the beginning, there will be tears in your eyes and at the end of the movie, you will feel sorry ... because this is his last movie! :-( The only "bad" thing about this movie is ... its too short :-) but as I always say, its better short and great than LOOOONG and stupid! Hail to the KINGS
3.0~Cheesy Action Sequences, apply directly to the forehead. vfm2181 Sign in Permalink And to think I missed a third Cloverfield viewing for this. Now, I'll be honest, I've never seen a Rambo film, nor have I see a Die-hard film. I think that these films are cancerous to the film industry because they sacrifice depth for pure titillation. I've always been curious about Rambo however, because I've been told that the first film is actually very well done, and actually touches upon very heavy hitting issues while also supplying decent action. So, I figured that maybe this film could do the same. Rambo IV starts with news footage covering the genocide in Burma. It shows a lot of sequences where villages are attacked just because the people who live in it are Christians. By the time the film is over you'll probably see three villages slaughtered down to every last person. This was one of the things I liked about Rambo, it unrelentingly displayed the horrors of what was going on with Burma. Then we enter the actual part involving Rambo. These days I guess Rambo is a snake herder(THIS PROVES THAT HE IS BRAVE AND LIVES DANGEROUSLY), and when he is not doing this, he shoots fish with arrows to give them to starving poor people(TO PROVE HE IS GENEROUS). It isn't long before a group of Christian Doctors arrive at Rambo's doorstep offering him money in exchange for a boat ride into Burma. For they want to bring in medical supplies to a village(and it doesn't take much thinking to know what will happen to this village). They ask Rambo for a chance to make a difference. Rambo asks them "Are you brining any weapons with you?" "Of course not!" replies the Doctor. "Then you'll never change anything." So then Sara tries asking Rambo, the mandatory female who's kindness and beauty will not only fuel Rambo's motives for talking the group to Burma, but will also fuel his eventual decent back into Burma to save her. The first half of this film gives you the slight distinction that the film may be decent. We're introduced to a lot of Rambo's psychological problems; how he's lost faith in humanity, how he is still plagued by the demons of his past even in his sleep. Sara provides a good check to Rambo, being kind, sweet and to a point naive. Rambo knows that letting her go to Burma is a mistake, yet he can see it in her eyes that she wants to go more then anything. So Rambo takes them there, an unexpected event happens on the way. Then Doctors make it to village. Village gets genocide'd, a bunch of people are randomly killed off, and whoops you're watching a Rambo movie again. See the problem with Stallone as a writer, is that he'll often like to put events into the script yet really do nothing with them other then that. Something apparent when he has Paulie having one of his first emotional outbreaks in his latest Rocky film. Stallone will show you the horrors of the genocide in Burma, but not much else is done or said about it. He'll tell you about how screwed up Rambo is, but ultimately he'll just throw him back into the action so he can keep his mouth shut instead of complaining about the horrors he has endured. The movie suffers an identity crisis because it wants to be deep, and it wants to be a balls to the wall action film, and because of Rambo's confused screenplay, it's neither. The acting is pretty..who cares. Stallone isn't a bad actor, but he's nothing extraordinary. And I won't talk about anyone else because I've already forgotten about half the characters, so yeah. The film is gory, almost to the point of near hilarity. During the final action scene I couldn't help but find myself laughing at how cheesy the deaths were, how ridiculous the sequences were(there's an exploding missile involved). When it comes to the action, you'll really have two types of sequences. The kind where villagers are getting raped by the Burmese soldiers, or the kind where the Burmese soldiers are getting raped by Rambo. You'll have the village sequences and a few others to tide you over. The saddest thing is, that despite all the glaring flaws of what I suspect the other three films before this shared, is that they still have a fanbase who will watch it and love it forever. So if you've been a fan of Rambo films there's nothing stopping you from watching this. If you're a fan of intelligent films that challenge you to think about what's going on, then maybe you should pick a slightly more intelligent film like Queen Latifah's Mad Money. I hear she be robbin' banks.
10.0~Stallone out-Rambos Rambo! AdrianMessenger Sign in Permalink I liked "First Blood," Sylvester Stallone's first outing as disaffected Special Forces commando John Rambo. I liked the film's simplicity and rawness, and the audacity of its story about a put-upon Vietnam vet who endures one punch too many from a local redneck sheriff, and ends up single-handedly destroying the entire town! Great stuff, but I wasn't crazy about the sequels. They seemed a little slick and overproduced, almost too artfully composed and "pretty" to look at. In spite of the thousands of rounds of ammunition expended, Rambo II and III seemed as sterile, bloodless and sanitary as an in-flight movie. That all changed with "Rambo," the initial trailers for which were so astonishingly graphic, it was clear that Mr. Stallone was up to something entirely different. When I finally saw the film, I was stunned by the bravura intensity of it. This was a "Rambo" picture with cajones as massive as its 50-calibre firepower; a brutal and uncompromising vision of hell and retribution that dug deep into the mud and the blood of guerrilla warfare and flung it full into our faces. The minimalist storyline and dialogue notwithstanding, "Rambo" is one of the goriest, most viscerally violent movies this side of "The Machine Girl," and therein lies its ferocious power and genius. Stallone threw out the rulebook, took the gloves off, and made the bloodiest, most in-your-face battle movie ever captured on film. By comparison, the infamous opening sequence of "Saving Private Ryan" seems about as gruesome as a stroll through Mister Rogers' neighborhood. Sam Peckinpah would be proud, and I mean that as a compliment. In a way, "Rambo" is Stallone's "Unforgiven." As Clint Eastwood said of that film, the moral of it was the violence, the gunplay. And the same is certainly true here. The Christian missionaries in "Rambo" learn the hard way that turning the other cheek isn't alway helpful. In this instance, the only successful antidote to unspeakable evil is an agent whose terrible capacity for rage and annihilation exceeds even that of his enemies. In this respect, "Rambo" works magnificently. A number of film critics have excoriated Stallone for overstating the level of government-sanctioned brutality in Myanmar, however as a card-carrying member of Amnesty International, I've followed the atrocities in the former republic of Burma for many years, and can attest to the authenticity of the atrocities depicted in the film. Interestingly, the freedom fighters of Myanmar have enthusiastically embraced "Rambo" as a heroic validation of their struggle, and are reportedly smuggling bootlegged copies of Stallone's film into the country as a rousing morale-booster. For stateside audiences, a word of caution is in order. "Rambo" is definitely not for the kiddies, nor is it for the impressionable or the easily upset. Aside from Martin Scorcese's "Taxi Driver," Stallone's "Rambo" contains perhaps the most extreme violence ever depicted in any mainstream American film. Which doesn't make it bad, only controversial. On behalf of those of us who aren't easily offended, welcome back, Sly, you're in fine form! "Rambo" kicks boatloads of ass! We can't wait to see "Rambo V."
7.0~Not a waste at all-Entertaining as any action film could be michaelamurphy Sign in Permalink For those who have constantly complained about ol' Sly Stallone returning to write and direct another installment in his two biggest franchises, Rocky and Rambo, you can stop your complaining now. Maybe you were disappointed in December 2006 when Rocky Balboa was released and ended up being as bad as everyone expected. However, it is the not the same with Stallone's newest Rambo. Despite the negative reviews and the harsh feedback, Rambo is exactly what an action movie is. During it's 93 minute duration, an estimated 276 persons are killed in a wide variety of ways: from machete, to .50 cal, to bow and arrow, to claymore, to flamethrower, to mortar, etc. The film starts with a brief rundown of the recent violent history of Burma, projecting horribly gruesome images of burned, decapitated, and mutilated humans. Shortly after, a scene is shown in which captured natives are forced to make their way across a marsh where landmines are hidden. Two minutes later, the opening credits project the unforgettable 80s font that display the title, Rambo. We find our hero, John, living the simple life in Vietnam helping natives and doing what he can. When a group of Americans on a mission from their church request Rambo's help traveling up river to Burma, Rambo at first refuses telling the group it is a violent and dangerous war zone. The churchgoers continue to plead for Rambo's help until he finally, resentfully, gives in. During their voyage, the group runs into some violent military patrolmen. This is where we get the first glimpse of Rambo's abilities in this newest installment. When the zealots say they still want to continue north, Rambo continues the journey and lets them off at the edge of the village. When Rambo believes them to be safely doing their job, he hears news that something went wrong and the religious group has gone missing. Rambo, now, has thrown himself into a gruesome mission to find the missing and unleash graphic terror onto their captors. The next 40 minutes consist of the deaths I listed prior. First off, ignore my rating. Adding everything into the equation (acting, directing, editing, script, etc.) the film would average out to about a 7. However, I did not go into this movie awaiting a genius plot or an Oscar winning screenplay (I mean Stallone did write the movie). I went in awaiting multiple explosions and nonstop action. Believe me, my money was not wasted. Rambo is exactly what an action movie should be. This is the model action movie: average duration, R rating, graphic carnage, a veteran actor, simple plot, terrible script. The film is truly not as bad as the critics say it is. My advice, do not miss this movie rather it be in theaters or on DVD. Rambo is extremely entertaining and well worth the time. You will probably even find many humorous moments as well.
10.0~Essential action film best Rambo film in the action genre my second personal favorite ivo-cobra8 Sign in Permalink Rambo (2008) is essential best action film in the action genre my second personal favorite film in the Rambo franchise. I love this film to death! Rambo is a fighting machine and I absolutely love the gory action films. This is movie is great it is absolutely awesome I love this film to death. It is the best film, since Rambo III wasn't that successful, this movie was. It is been nearly a 10 year anniversary since this movie come out. Here is where the legend of action heroes reloaded and ended well. They would've raped her fifty times... and cut your f*****g heads off! Who are you? Who are any of you? My number one favorite action film is Rambo: First Blood Part II, this my second favorite action film from Sylvester Stallone. First Blood is number 3 favorite action film in the series. John Rambo is my comic book hero. I love the fourth installment of Rambo to death. I know there is a lot of people who hate this film and prefer Rambo III over this film and think it is not a good movie. I disagree It is not your typical action movie because it is way too gory and bloody mine it is. I love Rambo's Mini Machete he uses in this movie. This is Sylvester Stallone's only movie he wrote and directed by him self. The action is gory and bloody that I love it. The movie has ton's of action and it is realistic performed. I love the rescue mission. I love that Rambo chops a Burmese soldier's head off with his machete. Rambo put's a mine in the forest and kill's 20 Burmese soldiers. Rambo is using a Browning M2 Aircraft machine gun. Rambo uses the M2 to obliterate the driver and than he kills all the soldiers while he is reloading the machine gun M2 - .50cal BMG and than he kills the rest of the soldiers those were the kicks ass action sequences. You have a lot of fire power in here and I love the rescue mission in here. This is a bad-ass kick-ass film! Sylvester Stallone portrayed and acted well his famous character and so did Graham McTavish as Lewis a mercenary, Matthew Marsden as School Boy, Reynaldo Gallegos as Diaz and Julie Benz as Sarah I like these characters and they did their acting well done. Sylvester Stallone directed this movie and to me it is really powerful realistic well action performed. I don't agree with you haters, I think this movie is better than Commando (1985) Schwarzenegger film! Rambo puts most of action films today to shame. That's my personal opinion. Music score from Brian Tyler wasn't that terrible like everyone is saying it was arguably good to the Rambo character. Richard Crenna and Jerry Goldsmith couldn't come back because they both past away and are no longer with us anymore. R.I.P. I think Brian Tyler did a good score. P.S. I don't like the extended version because it is different from the theatrical cut and Rambo looks like an asshole in the beginning of the movie. I love theatrical cut and honestly it goes fast around it is not boring it is entertainment It is one of my personal favorite action movies. This movie is a perfect 10 for me.
10.0~Full Circle skidrowmofo Sign in Permalink On Monday Oct. 25th, 1982 I enlisted in the United States Army. The weekend before, my last movie as a civilian was First Blood. I have to say that movie was a major source of motivation. As Rambo is being chased up the mountain he says to himself "keep moving" I repeated that mantra through Boot, Airborne, and then Q-course(you could go SF of the street back then). I spent the next 25 years serving proudly with the brave men of the 5th SFG at Campbell(RIP Matty Kimmell). A few months ago I separated (honorably) and made my way to H-wood to keep an eye on my actress daughter. I refused to see any movies until Rambo came out today, first film as a civilian. It was well worth the wait. This is a great closer to an important figure in American pop culture. I found the acting and script to be first rate. The action was TOO realistic, I had tears in my eyes as the Burmy soldier bayonets the young boy and as the team comes across the overrun village with the rotting corpses, very realistic. The only issues I had were of the merc team, multi-national teams don't exist and the interesting calibers they carried, but hey the spirit remains. Ending Rambo were it was first headed to, so many years ago was poetry. Perhaps my own history shades my view of this top rate movie, but isn't that what films are for, to show you that no matter what you are things DO change.
9.0~Finally a REAL actionmovie korsow007 Sign in Permalink For the last years (read: since Rambo: First Blood II) we actionmovie lovers have had to suffer the Die Hards, the Terminators 2-3 (you CAN'T kill anyone, that's an order!!) and other movies where killing people was 'politically incorrect'. It seems our wait has finally come to an end from an unexpected source. When I first heard Sly was making a new Rambo, I was very skeptic about it. I mean, who's waiting for a grandpa running around in a bush with a knife? Well, I was very wrong about this. The latest Rambo installment is perhaps the best action movie I've ever seen. There aren't many other movies around that show the brutality of war/combat like this (the landing of Saving Private Ryan comes to mind). All in all, this movie is top notch as far as I'm concerned. Get your popcorn, put your brain on zero, and just enjoy the non-stop action :)
9.0~Solid Action Film jmi6679 Sign in Permalink I thought Stallone did a great job. His physical appearance is amazing for his age. As for the movie, it had me pretty fired up. At one point during the film my hands and arms were getting numb in anticipation of the next scene. This is a total testosterone flick and really gets the blood moving. If you are unable to view blood and destruction...I suggest you pass on the film. The only negative I had, which is why I gave it a 9, was I felt it was a little too short. It kind of left me wanting more. Not sure if that is what was intended by Stallone though. In any case, go see it, I felt overall it was worth the $8 bucks (went to an afternoon showing though). Plus if you are a Stallone fan the price and time is worth it.
9.0~tag line says all, the year's first great action movie. SpikeFortress Sign in Permalink A straight action film only Stallone could deliver. Nobody else could direct such an uncompromising pursuit of battle. The battle sequences of this movie are glorious and violent in a way that is special, a new extreme level of tension was achieved in my opinion and I don't say this in blind excitement. This movie delivers a movie-high that is not often attempted. Movies usually hold back or simply fail at achieving visceral action and instead try to balance themselves between action, plot, drama, comedy, etc, and in many cases in modern films this only lowers the quality of the experience. The downfall of Rambo you could say is its small concern for character drama, indeed the scenes looking at the female lead and the mercenary group are pretty poorly acted (though this allows the scenes to focus on Stallone's disregard for their antics, it can get annoying to sit through). The mercenary group's character were so over the top in acting however it came off like farce to me which was actually really entertaining, seeing their macho lines fall dead in the air, Stallone giving them no respect. The battles were glorious even if the film has flaws, but it focuses on the battle as it should, and achieves glorious cinematic victory. Great experience.
6.0~war really is hell disdressed12 Sign in Permalink at first,i didn't like this movie too much,but as it went along,somewhere along the line i ended up liking it.this fourth and final installment of the series shows a softer gentler side of John Rambo,who just really wants to live in peace,like always.but,he is pulled into a war which was not his.this,better than any of the other Rambo movies,demonstrates that war really is hell.the human cost is the worst.the body count in this one is higher than in the previous movies,and the violence is way more brutal and graphic.we're talking body parts flying all over the place, decapitations,disembowelment.this to me,is the saddest and most tragic chapter in the Rambo series.but the story has more depth than the last two,and the human element is very strong here.i wouldn't say this was an enjoyable movie because there is too much death and destruction for it to be enjoyed.i think this movie was made to teach us a lesson.whether it succeeds or not is another story.for me,Rambo is a 6/10
9.0~High-octane Rambo-Romp; the best movie I've seen in ages - Stallone's done it again Caught22 Sign in Permalink I can't remember the last time I emerged from a cinema with such a big grin on my face. This is a great action movie. Yes, it's very violent and graphic - not for the squeamish - but of course you have to expect that from a Rambo movie. This film has a simple plot with simple characters, which allows the story to develop quickly and lets the action begin without too much waiting around - and, boy is there action!! It's the same, tried and tested, formula that has worked in so many "hero action" movies and I think it still works now. The graphic nature of the violent scenes in some ways makes it more realistic, showing the true horror of what bullets and explosives will do to the human body but, like most films of its genre, it's also wonderfully far-fetched. Don't try to over-analyse it, just sit back and enjoy the show! I saw all the previous Rambo movies in the 80's (and enjoyed them all). You don't *have* to have seen the whole series but I think it helps to know and understand the character, John Rambo; in fact this is the film in which perhaps Rambo himself finally accepts who, or what, he is. I love what Stallone has done with this movie (I thought Rocky Balboa was a great film too!) and, despite everyone joking about Sly's age, he's still got it! My only complaint is that I was enjoying it so much it didn't seem to last long enough. I have no idea why Odeon cinemas chose not to show this film, despite having advertised it previously: I've asked them and they simply state "Commercial Reasons". Luckily for me, my local Cineworld had the good sense to show it but there are many people who will miss out on a great film.
7.0~RAMBO (Sylvester Stallone, 2008) *** Bunuel1976 Sign in Permalink The fourth Rambo movie has been a long time coming  20 years  and is the first one to be directed by Stallone himself; like ROCKY BALBOA (2006), this is a surprising return to form for Sly  and, in this case, emerges as perhaps the best in the series. Even so, the storyline is pretty thin  Rambo is hired to free a group of doctors taken prisoners in the war-torn jungles of Burma  and the film atypically short for contemporary fare (the end credits start rolling around the 80-minute mark!). However, Stallone makes up for these with a thoroughly unflinching portrayal of the cruelty and gruesomeness of war  which, instead of a modern Hollywood blockbuster, brings to mind those objectionable Italian-made jungle adventures or even the notorious "video nasties" of the 1980s! As a result, it would be interesting to see how the previous entries in the series stack up against this no-holds-barred bloodthirsty update but, alas, presently I don't have enough time on my hands to find out! What is certain, however, is that Stallone's "Planet Hollywood" pals  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis  must be gnashing their teeth in envyas Rambo unequivocally proves here that he truly is "The Last Action Hero". Incidentally, one is never really sure why the atrocities on the Burmese villagers are being perpetrated (and on whose orders) which, if one isn't bothered to come up with the expected metaphors, rather makes the relentless display of carnage throughout seem somewhat pointless and altogether less than entertaining  despite the familiar strains of Jerry Goldsmith's stirring Rambo theme! P.S. By the way, the print I watched sported the JOHN RAMBO title which, bafflingly, was shortened for the U.S.  as it would have tied in well with ROCKY BALBOA itself.
8.0~welcome back Rambo and Stallone kelbanhawy2000 Sign in Permalink Just seen this movie and like very much to comment on it. It is a great action movie which I will see more and more. I am very happy for Stallone could come back and prove his talent as a great director too. The film is very fast but i would have liked it to be longer I wanted more of Rambo killing bad people.The war shots are very well done. After Rocky Balboa Stallone returns with a better gem of action. I am waiting for more Stallone films as a star and a director too. For all action and war movie fans, go and see it.You will like it very much. I now would like to see the previous Rambo films that i saw and enjoyed long ago.Of course i will add this movie to my action collection.
1.0~Quite simply, this movie is utter trash. twopiececharlie Sign in Permalink This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I would rather watch Agent Cody Banks 2 than this piece of crap again. Stallone tries to glorify himself way too much in this role. There are a few scenes where Stallone and another character have a dialogue loaded with poor attempts at philosophy and dreadful lines repeated multiple times. The violence is entertaining but you start to realize as the "movie" goes on, its full of repetition and some stuff is just plain phony. Basically, all that characters say in this movie is corny bullshit and this movie is just plain terrible. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
2.0~stupid stupid stupid/funny gramereto Sign in Permalink This movie was unreal. It brings to mind one of the late scenes in Billy Madison, "everyone in this room is now stupider for having (seen &) heard it" The weird frame rate during the action felt like a Madonna music video. Although the bloody destruction is different. It is essentially a very socially irresponsible movie that lets every kid think "If I was in the right situation, killing is easy as breathing" and don't take my word for it. It really puts down the anti-violence guy! But the dialog was hilarious. I honestly didn't see the new Rocky, I think I will now. I am genuinely curios enough. I guess the smart people weed it out anyway. If you got thick skin go see this piece of garbage!
8.0~Welcome to the slaughter! Destroyr3 Sign in Permalink Rambo is back! I had seen all the previous movies in DVDs and I liked them. But the new film beats all the previous! Although too cruel, it was interesting and I did not felt bored at all during the film. I really enjoyed the flashback John Rambo had, which could give you an idea about John, if someone had not seen any of the previous movies. However, it was a bit tough to see all those heads, arms and legs flying during the battles, but it boosts your adrenaline for sure! When the films ends, you want to punch whoever is in front of you! All those scenes where representing the hell over Vietnam and the nearby areas (such as Burma), during the civil war. Finally, I liked very much the soundtrack, especially the epic main theme. A film that action lovers (over 17) must see!
10.0~Showing WAR the way it really is. tucker-jeff Sign in Permalink Just wanted to say a few things. Stallone did it right in every way possible. Most of the action/war movies that we see today are watered down in order to sell the most possible tickets. They totally miss the chance to portray war in the truly horrible, brutally violent and the unfortunately necessary reaction to said brutality the way that Stallone did. Any other way is a disgrace to those that have seen real war and fought for theirs and others lives. Reading the possible plots that Stallone mulled over for this fourth installment of Rambo (Hostage crisis at the U.N. or white supremacist taking his wife and child hostage) both of which would have been o.k. but the plight of the Burmese people was the perfect choice and the only one that John Rambo could have been realistically used for. I have talked with a few friends that thought the film showed to much brutality yet I explained my view that if you are going to portray the real life slaughtering of the Burmese people by a ruthless military you better be honest about it. I believe that was the reason Stallone chose this storyline, part entertainment part "hay, guess what kind of horrible things can happen if no one is there to fight back." Notice how most of the mercenaries seemed to be the usual movie cliché characters. The British SAS that never shut up and complained endlessly, the tattooed man, and the guy who sang constantly. I think that was Stallone's nod to those unrealistic characters and situations that current movies keep cranking out and I think that was the real reason that Rambo never said a word to them on the boat ride, they didn't deserve to be acknowledged. The only complaint I have about the movie is that the group of Christian missionaries could not have been that ill informed about what was going on in Burma. And after the attempt on their lives from the Burmese Pirates they still didn't get a clue to the hell they were in for. I just don't believe they could have been that dense. It does no good to help heal someone if they are just going to be murdered. Rambo had it right, if your not taking any weapons your not going to change anything. You can talk and negotiate all you want but if all the other guy wants to do is kill you then there really is no other recourse. You gotta Ramboize them.
5.0~Entertaining action picture with room for a little thinking (maybe) Pycal Sign in Permalink Stallone both starred in and directed this latest entry in the Rambo series of films. This time the film takes place in the hostile southeast Asian country of Burma (or Myanmar as it is also called). Here Rambo escorts a group of missionaries to provide aid for victims of the Burmese army's genocide. Naturally, the missionaries are captured and Rambo must return, this time with a group of mercenaries. As expected quite a few intense action scenes occur. The action is well done and features a body count rivaling the 80s flicks. The only major fault lies in the overuse of insane CGI blood effects (Though there seems to be a few squibs here and there, not to mention some good special makeup effects). Granted many of the over the top effects could not have been achieved without CGI, but I still would have preferred it had traditional means been used. I could have gone without the horribly melodramatic music during a massacre scene that takes place, yet the sound effects are all top notch and at times reach volumes akin to a metal concert. Acting is generally pretty bad and Stallone is actually one of the better performers (along with a crazy British mercenary). Stallone is still in top physical shape at 61 years old and appears nothing like a John Wayne Brannigan or McQ. Despite its faults, 'Rambo' is a very entertaining action film which at the same time makes one wonder about the horrific situation in Burma.
4.0~By the numbers pninson Sign in Permalink Stallone's return as superhero Rambo follows the tried-and-true pattern of the generic action film. Rambo is hiding out in Thailand, brooding. A group of medical missionaries, who want to take supplies to rebels in Burma, ask him to take them upriver. Of course he says no. Fortunately, there's a hot babe who goes back to talk to him, and after she bats her eyelashes at him a few times, of course he says yes. You can probably guess what happens next. The missionaries are dropped off, and before you can say KABOOM, they're in trouble, and our hero returns to the rescue. On the way there's the usual pious missionary claiming that violence is not the answer, and of course Rambo doesn't see it that way. (What would be the point of a Rambo movie where he sits around and gets in touch with his feelings?) It's all over and done with in about 90 minutes, giving action fans a quick fix of the usual. There are two distinctive things about this movie, however. One of the them is an apparently honest attempt by Stallone to dramatize the situation in Burma (Myanmar). The Burmese military are the most repulsive villains you can imagine, and from the opening frames, you'll see a lot of very unpleasant and convincing violence, as helpless men, women and children are tortured and massacred. When the battles begin, the violence becomes extremely gory, to the extent that it's almost cartoonish. It's probably an attempt to be more realistic; in action films, people usually get shot and obediently fall over. Here, their heads blow off with huge gouts of blood and body parts go flying. Fans of the earlier films will probably enjoy this one. It's an action picture after all, not HENRY IV PART I, and there's plenty of action. But there's really nothing new here; it's a cookie cutter plot, the cinematic equivalent of empty calories.
8.0~I can't believe it... Rambo actually works! grondiespam Sign in Permalink I was pleasantly surprised by Rambo. I came to the theaters just expecting nothing but the worst - A self aggrandizing clunker of an action flick from a has-been who's squeezing the last drop of marrow from another once-profitable franchise. Insead, what I got was a hammy, straight-ahead, guns 'n' guts romp that delivered the goods as advertised: Rambo giving hell to bad guys. What's entertaining about Rambo is its straight ahead 80s-style approach to the action genre. It's setup and delivery, without a drop of irony or posturing. This flick could very well have come out of 1989, except there's a few moments of deadpan gore that probably would't have made the cut 20 years ago. What's also nice is Rambo's work with the band of mercenaries that goes along on the rescue mission. It actually felt natural. When the credits rolled, the theater blew up in applause. It was good, stupid, high-five Rambo fun like we all expected - rolled into an efficiently-paced package that never dragged its feet or wore out its welcome.
9.0~This is a Great movie but overrated - Just Slightly. julie-james80 Sign in Permalink OK This is a great movie period, however it felt like Rambo III all over again only with some famous Syvelster Stallone quotes chucked in, and with a lot more gore and blood. This movie isn't really disturbing like what people make it out to be, sure little babies are killed and stamped on but its only fake in the movies, its real in real life which brings me onto something else, this Rambo movie was made for a reason, to have an impact on the way people feel about those mad heads who invaded Burma and killed millions of people, Unlike Rambo III which was just to bring back the action hero. But don't get me wrong here, i found Rambo 3 somewhat more entertaining. So may i please ask why Rambo 4 has a better rating than 2 & 3. Still, there are two reasons for this film to exist and 1 is very good. 1. To bring back Rambo 2. To have an impact In Burma
10.0~Thank you Sly. morphixxx Sign in Permalink I just want to say thank you Sly.. You are the best action hero and no one will ever be like you. Thank you for (this) Rambo... The character (again) is great.. thank you for showing us that this world is no wonderland.. there are many sick twisted people all over the world.. and I think people just ignore it and don't do a thing to change. The movie is just awesome.. the pace is great.. what an adrenalin rush. The story is totally believable.. the missionaries and the mercenaries besides giving credibility to the story they support Rambo.. this is not Rambo vs all like some say! I hope your movie (just like Rocky) to be a great blockbuster. I will buy it when it comes out in DVD. God bless you Sly.. your work will not be in vain. Ten stars -> ********** :D
10.0~Blood,Guts,Carnage, A Great Finale!!!!!! MovieBuffJake69 Sign in Permalink First off let me say this has been the MOST violent I've ever seen in my life, and I loved it!!! Rambo is back and he is trying to live a simple life in Thailand. Rambo has to take a group of Christian aid workers into Burma to bring aid to the Burmese people. Rambo finds out that the group hasn't returned back to the states, and that he has to go into Burma and rescue them. Sylvester Stallone is not only great at acting in this movie, but a fantastic director. I did not know that this was actually happening in Burma. Sly does a good job bringing these horrors to life, and showing how terrible it is over there. The effects that went into blowing people up in this move are just mind blowing. I can imagine how hard it was for Stallone to argue this down to an R rating. This movie brought the series to a fantastic finale, and the last 20 minutes of the movie you will be at the edge of your seat! I gave this movie 10/10, because of the fantastic acting and all of the action. After seeing this movie I feel sorry for the people of Burma and what they have to put up with every day.
10.0~Best Action movie arsmeh Sign in Permalink I watched the marathon today all the Ramboo series at the same time in Toronto. About seven hours plus. Ramboo final was an excellent Movie. I would say Ramboo was in this excellent shape although he is 62 but he act like he is just 40. Movie was good, best effects and the last scene was the best when he was coming back to his ranch with his same old clothes. Best Direction and also the story was excellent. In this movie Ramboo proves that he was born as a killing machine who "Live for nothing but Die for something". He was also the Director and Writer of this movie, in fact he put his 100% hard work on this movie, he kept the same attitude, mood, quite Guy but full of strength and determination as previous Ramboo series. I am pretty sure this movie will hit the box office. I will give 10/10 to this movie as an action, lesson, direction, effects. Excellent Work Sylvester Stallone this movie will rock.
6.0~And the award for movie most resembling a video game is... Mr Parker Sign in Permalink If you want to see an unbelievable amount of violence in an R-rated film, then look no further. The story is spectacularly simple and wastes no time in splashing gore everywhere. Rambo gets to team up with some mercs who enjoy murdering people as much as he does, it seems. There's little more to say than that but really, it takes a lot to shock me and this movie had me laughing out loud in complete surprise at the mayhem. Entire villages are massacred. Heads explode, limbs are hacked off, heads are lopped off, people are turned to strawberry jam, bodies soar through the air... man, even children aren't safe in this film. And yet, in the end it's just not that serious. Stallone easily mows down like 300 enemies in this. One guy gets the top half of his head blown off by a .50 caliber sniper rifle. If you've never seen anyone cut in half by machine gun fire, now's your chance. Ends like there might be another one where it all began. The cinematic equivalent of a can of Red Bull. Rating: *** out of *****.
10.0~One of the best action films so far rubenbaeza84 Sign in Permalink This is what makes a great action film. A character so complex so brutal that if you looked up war in the dictionary, his face would pop up. The violence is so gruesome that contemporary films like 300 is tamed compared to its nihilistic attitude. Rambo isn't for the squeamish and not for the faint hearted. Stallone tears down the Hollywood image of Rambo and brings him back to the standards. He is not fighting for a certain country or battling a threat to the united states. He is merely embracing the very nature that has haunted his character for so many years. War is his enemy but his only definition. During through all the brutal scenes he engages in, you feel his anger and you understand his pain. The image of the unstoppable juggernaut that could take down an army is still present in the much older and aged Stallone. You believe he could win you believe he could take out any man. It isn't Stallone thats present in the movie, its Rambo, age can't even stop a man that has become the definition of male aggression.
10.0~John Rambo Returns... AND BETTER THAN EVER! J_Manning_The_Revived Sign in Permalink First Blood was a master piece. Rambo First Blood part II wad a lot of fun. Rambo III was entertaining... But Rambo has brought us back to the masterpiece we in 1982 combined with the fun and entertainment we had in 85 and 88. Vietnam Vet John Rambo returns in this forth installment a lot more hardened and "grumpy" than we remember him. The years have hardened him, and though the scars of his past are faded they are still visible. What I liked most about this was how his character finally comes full circle with who he is. He understands that he is, and will always be a killing machine. He understands that he never killed for his country, but for himself. And in the end, as he stands over the battlefield with all the dead soldiers below him, he finally realizes that war never ends. It has been happening for years and will continue. War is nature and peace is a mistake. But the last couple of minutes of the movie were very interesting, and gets you a little on the inside (in a good way). Now, action fans WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! The action in this movie is the greatest action ever to be shot on film. And the brutality of it is overwhelming. Once Rambo gets hold of a machine gun on the back of a jeep, you KNOW the bad guys are screwed! All and all, it was the best film of the series and if you love Rambo and action, you ow it to yourself to see this movie.
8.0~Yes yes yes! atlasredux Sign in Permalink Being "lucky" on the relativity of the conflict in Burma, with the attention due to the disaster in the area, the movie gives an important glimpse into how the situation really is. And it sure does it, Rambo style. Hard, brutal, to the point, but yet with undertones and short shocking and hard-to-fathom situations. Shortly described, as with former Rambo's, the movie is short and up-your-face. This one just takes realism to a whole new level when it comes to violence. Stallone simply tells us : this is war. War is some !"#%! up !"#¤. The storyline are more believable this time around as well, despite the usual Rambo-exaggerations and stereotypical mercenaries. The movie is gruesome in terms of violence, and I am glad it was. It was needed for us to accept Rambo. It was needed to show the dark side of what Rambo is and what lengths he is willing and able to go to. Thanks Stallone, for giving us back Rambo as well. You sure had to work to beat Rocky's comeback, and my, did you do well. Thanks for all the great entertainment so far.
10.0~Thank you Stallone med77_99 Sign in Permalink Hi.. I just finished watching Rambo 4 , and i must say this was one solid action movie. I remember watching the older Rambo movies when i was a kid, and i recall nothing except that Rambo was a strong, tough character and that the movies rocked. So i was pretty excited to watch this new Rambo movie, and i was blown away, it had everything action fans wants, Guns, machine guns, bullets everywhere, gore and blood, and of course Rambo at his best, strong, tough, full of energy with no mercy.. So thank you Stallone for bringing Rambo back, i hope they make a 5th Rambo movie, i would love to see more of Rambo in action..I'm also planning to watch the older movies again.. So what are you guys waiting for, go and see it and buy the DVD when it comes out, because this was one of the best action movies in years !!
10.0~What a movie!! kip83 Sign in Permalink I was full of excitement when i first saw the 3 min preview of this movie that was released on the internet early on. So i was full of hope that the movie lived up to expectations and it didn't disappoint. Stallone has brought to the table exactly what everybody wants from this genre of movie plenty of raw, bloody action. I thought the film was brilliant, perhaps a little short, a simple story that doesn't hang about and gets straight into the action quite quickly. Well filmed the cinematography is excellent in this movie along with the sound especially the 50.cal used at the end of the movie and the violence is on a different level to what we call action movies these days and I was glad it wasn't 12 rating or pg-13 in the states like Die hard 4 :o). However there were two things i may have changed in the movie I wasn't a big fan of the Mercaneries i feel they weren't necessary if they were perhaps better actors should of been placed in the roles. Also I know Stallone is getting on a bit i felt Rambo wasn't really involved in any long action sequences it went straight from the bomb he sets to the end with him on the 50.cal very quickly perhaps a few fight sequences could have been used in between. Overall I thought the film was excellent with Stallone sorting another franchise which needed to be ended correctly but i am hearing a part v is in the pipeline and if it carries on in the same way as 4 he cant go wrong.
7.0~Rambo finishes with Honor! nmlal68 Sign in Permalink I was very careful when I started to watch this movie. Could Stallone pull the same trick as in Rocky and deliver a solid action movie without making a fool of himself and finish the Rambo saga in glory? Yes he could! First Blood is still one of the best action movies I ever saw and this last movie is a smooth finish to it all. On his last Rambo, Stallone manages to tell a simple story without wanting to be more than he can be. You never feel that you are facing the old actor who wants to be young again. This approach is very intelligent indeed and suites both the actor and the story like a glove. Of course there is exaggeration when it comes to action, but that's not new. In fact, the story is very balanced and well told. Stallone stays true to his character and his character clichés with everything developing in a nice tempo with beautiful jungle and river scenes. When it comes to the real deal, the movie delivers the most incredible, heavy, brutal and impressive combat scenes, sparing nobody from the ruthless of war. A good movie!
6.0~Nothing much to offer meet_banty-1 Sign in Permalink As usual Rambo movie. I am a big fan of Stallone but I am bit disappointed after watching this movie. World has changed, we are creating top notch movie with the help of graphics and all. But when you will watch this movie you start believing that you are still in 1980. This movie has unnecessary violence what was not needed. Good thing is, in this move that have shown the actual scenario of Barma. The country is really under trouble. First Blood is still top of the chat and Rambo4 is nowhere. Anyway, after all it's a Stallone flick so Stallone fan go for it but don't expect much. Watching this movie without expectation will be a good fun.
6.0~Brings the saga back to its roots (kind of) die_hard_ringer Sign in Permalink From the very first musical strains Rambo is hearkening back to First Blood, the original film in the series whose title character has since become a household name. This glossing-over of two forgettable sequels is a smart move, and it sets the tone for a film which, save for a greatly aged protagonist, could easily have come as the second film instead of the fourth. This film finds our hero far away from the world, catching snakes somewhere near Burma. A group of missionaries arrive, he cautions them, gives them a ride into Burma, and then flexes his muscles without surprise when he learns that they never made it back. For a brief moment towards the beginning there is the feeling that Rambo is evoking the memory of Vietnam, making reference to staying out of the world's problems and things never changing (I.E. genocide). This bringing of the saga full-circle to the conflict where it began is an intriguing idea that is quickly lost in a deluge of blood. In the first film John Rambo held himself back, reigned in his instinct to kill, never even finishing off his nemesis in the film, a small-town sheriff. Here, however, he begins by gunning down a boatload of Burmese pirates and doesn't stop until he's shot, decapitated, and disemboweled a small army. If ever there was any idea behind Rambo, thoughts to the effect of minding your own business or pacifism being as deadly as genocide, they're lost when the bloodbath begins and are never found again. A few fascinating concepts are batted around in Rambo, but are quickly discarded when they get in the way of the carnage, because it would be far too much work to decide where to stand when gunning down the bad guys is so much simpler. But for what it is, Rambo is a success. Old, grizzled, and jaded he's still got it, and watching his demonstrate that for the better part of two hours is surprisingly entertaining. The film also makes a good call in throwing in a supporting cast of mercenaries who, far from being subtle and nuanced characters, do add something of a foil for John. Every time I think about Rambo I get to thinking about how, originally, the character was meant to die at the end of First Blood, a move which would have rendered it impossible to create any sequels. Preview audiences didn't like it, and so he survived to fight several more times. While I still feel that, dead or alive, there should never have been more than one Rambo film, this is about as good and end-cap (fingers crossed) that I could hope for, and the fact that it tries to bring back memories of the first film while practically ignoring the second and third leads me to believe that perhaps I'm not the only one who thinks so.
9.0~Outstanding and realistic action film TdSmth5 Sign in Permalink The trailer leaked months ago promised an ultra violent Rambo. Fortunately, Stallone delivers. The final version was not sanitized. This movie is brutal, grisly, gory, violent. Just as war is. In a time when so many Americans are enchanted by the idea of eternal war against half of the world, this movie makes us pause. It shows the brutality of dictatorship but the solution is hardly any more ethical or clean. Stallone does a great job as the director and actor here. He looks strong and menacing, somewhat like a horror icon. Jason from Friday the 13th comes to mind as Stallone wields his machete. And indeed after years of peaceful existence, minding his own business, Rambo comes to peace with the beast inside and goes absolutely berserk behind a machine gun. I'm deducting a point for the miscast mercenaries. What a silly bunch. Of course you have the obligatory Brits/Aussies who seem to have invaded Hollywood. Also, there's less of the ingenious Rambo we saw in previous movies. You will detest the bad guy, cheer for the good guys and recoil at the sight of the carnage. Stallone has really outdone himself with this installment. In a time where the only action hero allowed by Hollywood is the 60 pound anorexic model, seeing a true guy's action movie is a welcome return to normalcy. Physical confrontation is men's business, despite the glamorization of girlie power in Alias, Sarah Connor, Resident Evil, etc. Don't miss Rambo, one of the best action movies in a long time.
9.0~Rambo is back, and he is badass! HrutkaPal Sign in Permalink I was pretty skeptic, I thought that it's not gonna be good, but it was! Stallone did a great job, I didn't really thought that it's a Rambo senior or something. Even though in some scenes it was pretty weird to see his flattened plastic surgery face, and then see his old skin on his arm and chest, but it didn't really matter. The story itself isn't a big deal, we've seen it several times already, BUT the action scenes...Holy crap guys. I haven't seen this kind of graphic, explicit shooting for a long time. There were some really unique deaths, that I haven't seen elsewhere. There were some pretty nasty scenes as well (mass-murder) It's pretty hardcore, but hey. It's a Rambo movie! There were only 2 big action sequences, but those were pretty long.Mostly the 2nd and final one. There were some flashbacks to the earlier Rambos as well. If you liked the trailer, you'll like the movie as well, cause you get, what you expect.
7.0~Entertaining action film, big improvement over the last Rambo films. TOMNEL Sign in Permalink This was a good action film...not great. Nothing really stood out to make this the perfect Rambo film, but it's a major improvement over the last 2, so in that way it's a major success. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) helps some missionaries by driving them to Burma so they can give their aid to the poor inhabitants. When the missionaries get held hostage, mercenaries are called in, and Rambo escorts them through war torn Burma to help save the Christians, and kill some people along the way. It's very simply plotted, and to go along with it's simple plot, the actual movie only runs at 80 minutes long. Stallone has a screen presence, and soaks up every scene he's in, even with his very few lines. Th action scenes look good, though some may say they're excessively violent. The movie moves at breakneck speeds, cutting off most scenes with a cut to another, or a fade off, and that can get annoying. But, overall, Stallone made a pretty good movie, not one that captured the "magic" of "First Blood", but a welcome addition to the Rambo franchise. My rating: *** out of ****. 80 mins. R for violence and language.
8.0~Art becomes reality , and some !!! antileft Sign in Permalink This is undoubtedly one of the most graphic and , unfortunately , the most realistic modern war movies , that is utterly unashamed to show the real extent of , say , an anti-personnel mine's explosion , the effect of the most destructive of sniper weapons on a person's , well , head , the effects of a sudden bombardment of a village with infantry ordnance , not to mention the fully visible penetration of a teen's body with a bayonet , that takes its cue directly from Mr. Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan , showing the bestiality and cruelty in less than 90 minutes , doing it completely candidly and following a saying by Mr. Verhoeven when making his Starship Troopers - This is what happens in the war , and this , and this !! John Rambo is not for teens, women of all ages and walks of life , lovers , good-wishers, optimists and nature-lovers !And , I cannot but ask myself ,what was going on in Mr. Stallone's mind when he was making this military chainsaw , did he absolutely give up on humanity ,as so nicely encapsulated in one of the best cinematic one-liners : Live for nothing or die for something !? I hope Rambo 5 is ahead soon !
7.0~Balboa this ain't...John Rambo brings action back with a bang. Dachunde Sign in Permalink 'Could Sly do it again?' was the question bandied around following the warm critical and commercial reaction to Rocky Balboa. The answer, sadly, is no. Where Balboa references the original almost constantly in both tone, style and meditation on character, Rambo goes for the jugular80's style. Stallone has done exactly what the kids of the 80's wantpure unadulterated action on a painful level. Violence is both condemned and glorified with absolutely no time to stop and consider motivations or reasoning, blood spurts forth, people explode, guns are fired with the ACTUAL impact shown also. All of this action takes place within the final 35 minutes and at times it feels as though that's all you're waiting for, with a few decent moments at the beginning the majority is retained for the closing act and here is where the problem is illustratedthis is not a RAMBO film, it is a film with Rambo in it. Apart from a few excellent moments of inspired carnage he plays second fiddle to mercenaries lead by the funniest British stereotype encountered since Dick Van Dyke did a little dance concerning chimneys. If you are expecting a book end to the series ala Rocky Balboa, this WILL disappoint as Sly makes zero attempt to justify actions or intentions; even the final scene, intended as some form of closure fails as it feels tacked on (and unbelievable given the character's age). BUT  And a BIG but at thatif you are an action fiend this film is pure catnip. It will no doubt be a major hit with the teens of today weaned on PG-13 Terminator and AvP filmshere is a movie that is utterly proud of what it is; an action movie that works in making you root (and at times toot) for the good guy.
7.0~"An old school warts-and-all action flick..." pootc Sign in Permalink Sylvester Stallone takes us back in time as he did with Rocky Balboa gives us exactly want  an old school warts-and-all action flick complete with explosions, blood, goreand more gore. But the film isn't simply an empty vessel; it's no masterpiece by any means but its very competent yet simple story, complete with the dilemma of faith and ethics - and it's the return of one of the most iconic characters of the eighties. Rambo is by far the most brutal and violent of the films depicting the human race at its worse and most brutal. A bold move by Writer, Director and star Stallone as this film is not for the faint-hearted, it can be tough to watch but that's what war is. It isn't glamorized like Hollywood, or the two previous sequels in the series, but taken back to First Blood, a more human story. "When pushed, killing is as easy as breathing" and with that John Rambo paints our screens red one more time handing out his own brand of justice to a brutal regime, and a very real enemy.
10.0~Richard Crenna Would Be Proud cbreen2025 Sign in Permalink Although Richard Crenna passed before this movie could be done I would have to say after watching it so many times (big fan of Rambo) he would have been proud of Stallones work with this piece. Its unfortunate we weren't able to see Sam Troutman return in this final chapter of the Rambo story nor did we get a chance to see just who R. Rambo was at the end of the movie. The story does definitely evolve showing events that do happen in other places all over the world and its unfortunate that we don't actually have a Rambo to save those who get lost in the mix of the horror over there. I wonder if Stallone left R Rambo unrevealed because its a cliff hanger that will leave us wondering forever or if it leaves something to add onto if in the future they want to add another chapter to the Rambo legacy! I do give this more a 10/10 on everything. Great job Stallone!
10.0~Rambo still kicks ass!! freddy_at_home Sign in Permalink Myself and some of my best friends drove for 1 hour last night to see the last picture from Stallone. The cinema were full of people everywhere, excited to see Rambo back in action. I just gotta say, damn what a cool movie. It just blew up everything I were hoping for, it gave me and the crowd in the cinema our money worth. When the movie started we could hear the old Rambo intro, and people started clapping, so did we! It was one wild ride this movie, people killing people like flies, and then the action hero of all heroes just comes in and destroys everything in his way. I really loved this! This is the best Rambo movie since the first one. All I can say is, if your reading this Stallone, way to go man! You've just raised from the dead and shown to the world that Rambo will live forever!! I really recommend this to all action lovers, but be warned, some of the scenes even made me almost look the other way, but it made the movie stronger! 10 out of 10 stars from me and all of my friends!
1.0~One of the dumbest action movies I've ever seen fi-dot-slc Sign in Permalink Despite the bunch of 'this is great' comments.... Cliché, stamped, dumb movie about the 'Good Guy' convinced by the 'Beautiful Blonde Girl' to get her into trouble and then 'Shooting - Everyone - To - Save - Her - With - The - Help - Of - A - Bunch - Of - Assholes - Who - Turn - To - Be - Nice - Guys'. Sorry, maybe I don't grasp it. I haven't seen R. 1-3 movies, so Im certainly missing something. But for one who haven't, this one is just crap. You want action? Watch 'Shoot'em Up', it at least is funny and has good music :). Fi.
8.0~The Best Rambo movie since the original! crazychap Sign in Permalink I was always anxious to see this movie. The first movie was great; it was about a disturbed Vietnam veteran trying to avoid trouble, but trouble always has a way of finding him. Part II and Part III became comic-book yarns with every action and war film cliché' you could imagine, chronicling Rambo's adventures to rescue POWS still held captive in postwar Vietnam and then rescuing his friend by helping the Mujaheddin in war-torn Afghanistan. Rambo IV does an excellent job in carefully avoiding the extravagances of II and III. In my opinion, it is the Best movie since Part I!!! Rambo has been at peace for many years, living in northern Thailand, making a living out of collecting cobras and building boats. His only friend, Colonel Samuel Trautman, has passed away (the movie does not mention how or when), so Rambo has been isolated from the outside world. However, trouble has finally caught up with him when a group of Christian missionaries ask him to borrow his boat and try to save lives in Burma, into a 'war-zone'. Rambo is reluctant in sending a group of unarmed missionaries into the lion's den, but vows in. Cut ahead to ten days, Rambo, waking up after experiencing flashbacks (footage of all its predecessors and dialogue of the late Colonel), receives the news that the missionaries have been captured alive in a raid that packed almost the entire village they worked in. This time, Rambo takes the initiative to rescue the group and get out. But this time, he is being aided by an number of elite mercenaries, going back to Hell once again. If Hell had a place on Earth, it is found in this country. Stallone has made an unexpected K.O last winter with Rocky Balboa, which, to me, is the true sequel to te Oscar-winning film. He delivers the same result to First Blood! The movie has a self-sufficient and complete back story to it, authentic performances from Sylvester Stallone and most of the cast, as well as a series of eye-popping (and VERY BLOODY) action scenes. The film's graphic violence make Platoon, Braveheart and Gladiator look like kiddie shows. However, like the aforementioned movies, Rambo IV gives a very realistic view of what wars are all about, something not reflected in its predecessors. Wars are not a warm, romantic business; they're extremely cruel, turning rational human beings into wild savages, creating a world where even the phrase 'human rights' does not exist and where unspeakable, unimaginable things occur on a daily basis. The movie is NOT PRO-WAR, quite the opposite, it shows us the great brutality of all armed conflicts (past and present), an aspect that has played an active role in moulding world history. The movie shows scenes of massacres, of entire villages being packed to death, of brutal interrogations, rape and other horrible things. The extreme violence in this film is brutal as well as appealing in a manner similar to Paul Verhoeven's movies. Definitely NOT for the faint-hearted; Rambo is no stranger to controversy, and here he definitely will keep people talking once again, this time with a realistic and honest approach about the dark side of humanity. This controversy will definitely bolster Rambo's popularity. Sly, you've made my day once again!!!!
5.0~Simplest story ever ??? yanisampah Sign in Permalink Having watched the other 3 Rambos really surprised me that this one had absolutely no storyline at all. No twist and turn, just Vini, Vidi, Vici (or something like that). Rambo comes, Rambo shoots, Rambo conquers. The story is so basic, completely predictable to the point that the whole movie is disappointing. Sure there's a lot of blood and violence which separates this movie a little bit from the rest but at least give the viewers some kind of story. Throughout the whole movie I kept telling myself "there's gotta be more than this ... just relax ... there's gotta be a trick. .." Nope ! Just plain A-B-C shoot, good guys win. Blah.
3.0~They're dead! I got it! h_deis Sign in Permalink If you want to see people getting killed in numerous ways, like heads blown off, ripped to pieces, fed to swines, ripped throats, legs shot off and whatever your heart might desire our your brain might come up with, this movie is for you, because this is what it is all about. Yes of course it's exciting. But it's very boring at the same time. In terms of craftsmanship Rambo is a fairly good piece of action cinema. But the rest, whatever that might be, is pretty stupid. Really, really evil Asian army kills and rapes and Johnnyboy kills them all in return. End of story. By the way, "live for nothing or die for a reason" is a really stupid cognition for somebody who just found out that he didn't do all the killing for his country but just for himself. Now go out and slay your own.
9.0~great war movie kairingler Sign in Permalink Well folks, Rambo 4 hits hard and does not let you go,, in my humble opinion this movie is by far the bloodiest, and highest body count in the last 25 years. you get to see some excellent war footage, top line equipment used in war today, like the 50 caliber machine gun. the story takes place in Thailand as Rambo and some locals get together to go up-river into war-torn Burma , the movie is based on event today in the real world,, the locals are the Karen Rebels who are fighting against the Myanmar government,, i think i got that right. anyway you get the sense that in this one , it is more of a First Blood sequel than anything else.. this one has some great battle scenes, and of course John Rambo at his very best,,
9.0~I grew a beard after watching. cweisler Sign in Permalink I first went into this movie thinking about how awful Rocky Balboa was and had my mind set on disappointment, I switched opinions as soon as the movie begins. This is definitely the best Rambo installment in my opinion. Not only did John Rambo blow my mind when he first unleashed his bow and gave many merciless whacks to the face with his machete, but he had a team of pure bad ass behind him through the last hour of the movie, my favorite of team was Lewis, portrayed by Graham McTavish, who even after having his leg blown off, has the energy to head butt someone in the face, take their gun, and proceed with more domination. This movie will have you screaming, "Holy crap!" and "Hell yea!", until the end credits roll. This is definitely the most action packed movie I've seen in years, and if you haven't seen any of the Rambo movies, it won't matter. Being sheerly a raw chunk of manly action and blood, previous story of the old Rambo is basically unnecessary. Bottom line on this movie is: If you go see it, prepare for your ass to get rocked and your dick to get bigger. It was the definition of kick ass manly cinema in the new millennium. I loved it.
5.0~A HUGE Disappointment!!! atm504 Sign in Permalink Wow! Congratulations users for boosting Rambo to the Top 250. This film is so great I will tell you what. Stallone is so old in this film he spends a majority of his bloodbath standing at a Jeep mounted gun. There is tons of swearing and no redeeming intellectual dialogue to save the script. The film is so mish mash it never takes a breath to let you see what is going on. The trilogy didn't really have that great of track record so not much is being ruined by this installment but again, a truly horrendous film that is overrated. Why did they take such a serious approach to a laughable character. If I remember correctly he revisited Vietnam to payback the Vietnamese for the Vietnam war. I loved the violence but would have liked it to be a little more inventive. Once you have seen the trailer you have seen the whole film. The only redeeming quality is the sniper scenes. Troutman would have boosted this a few stars especially if he was Rambo's father.
8.0~Expected Sequel In Great Franchise jmarinko-1 Sign in Permalink As tag line says "Heroes never die...they just reload", and this is trye! He is back! Greatest action hero of eighties-John J. Rambo. The story follows (well known) John Rambo, who is now older and lives in Thailand and captures snakes and transports people and cargo in an old boat. When a group of Christian missionaries asks to be transported to the war zone in Burma to help the locals, the reluctant Rambo only accepts when Sarah Miller presents her point of view about their humanitarian mission. Rambo leaves the group in the requested location, but the village where they are working is attacked by the sadistic army of Major Pa Tee Tint, the locals are slaughtered and the missionaries are abducted. Later a member of their church meets Rambo and asks him to transport a group of mercenaries hired to rescue the missionaries. As you see script has a simple plot and is written in 80's style, but it is more violent than almost any 80's action film. There is blood everywhere! Stallone's acting is of course bad, but when he takes machine gun in his hands, the fun begins. Sure this motion picture ain't all time classic, but it delivers what all of us expect from this kind of movie-great fun and a lot of explosions and blood. Just seat back and enjoy.
9.0~Awesome Ioannis111 Sign in Permalink Awesome movie. 1. Photography is excellent, dark atmosphere. The beauty of nature is breathtakingly depicted, as well as the miserable living conditions of the Burma people. 2. Great acting by Stallone, with no exaggerations. 3. Action is unparalleled. You will not want to move your eyes away from the screen from beginning to end. 4. Realism. What there is is what you get. 5. Sensitivity to a global issue: ethnic cleansing (reminiscent of the suffering of the Armenian people). 6. One of the best directions I have seen. Stallone has really surpassed himself with this movie. Outstanding. 7. The score is lovely and brings to the mind powerful memories from the previous Rambo films. 8. There is violence all over the place and continuously, but this is due to the intended realism and is quite justified by the story. Less violence would simply insult the viewer's intelligence.
10.0~Pulsating olearyb1 Sign in Permalink This is how an action movie should be made. Brief set-up, then a non-stop adrenaline rush leading up to a fantastic climax. Only complaint is that it was too short, which in itself is a good complaint for a movie. Stallone is excellent and his age is never a distraction. I remember watching Bond films in the 80's with Roger Moore and Sean Connery in their fifties. They looked ridiculous. Yet Sly is over 60 and never looks out of place. Does the movie make a meaningful point about the futility of war? Is it an accurate depiction of the situation in Burma? I couldn't care less; its fantastic entertainment and thats all i want from a Rambo movie, or any action movie for that matter.
6.0~For Rambo fans for sure Ozzy2000 Sign in Permalink There is no doubt about the absolute idiocy of many film critics who on one hand applaud simple one dimensional non-original, plagiarized, repetitive, bloody, gory zombie , slasher films and ridiculously non factual so called anti-war films then condemn this Rambo series. Let's face it good old Sly was one of those great action heroes who you didn't need to understand when watching this genre. Its pure war game escapism. Furthermore, it is historically correct that the Burmese, Cambodians, the Vietnamese and Indo Chinese do have a propensity to commit horrific and cruel atrocities against their own people in particular the mass torturing and murders of civilians by the Pol Pot regime. There is no doubt that Military incursions by the USA into Vietnam and the Middle East have involved several incidents of atrocities and these have been well exposed. However only a complete idiot would brand the USA as worse perpetrators of military atrocities than the Indo Chinese, Japanese, Nazis, Yugoslavia, the Middle Eastern Muslims and many African regimes. These countries commit atrocities on a scale that is a mind-boggling tragedy and NONE yes none of these countries make documentaries or films about their dark histories to this day. Having said that Rambo does exploit the atrocities of certain Indo Chinese countries to establish a worthy opponent for Rambo and in this case, it is the Burmese who are actually murdering, torturing and raping civilians on a daily basis as we speak. Stallone recently pointed out that todays film heroes a little flabby weaklings and that is true for Russell Crowe, Orlando Bloom and Hugh Jack man. So he went out and remade Rocky and this Rambo. He does look cosmetically tough and stocky but provides his fans of this genre a feast of killing in this story about the rescue of Christian missionaries from the viscous Burmese military. It is a short film with a ridiculous story but at the same time was entertaining with its exploration of body mutilation.
1.0~The Weinsteins' strike again.. JoeB131 Sign in Permalink This was a truly awful movie. It shows why Actors shouldn't be allowed to produce or direct. The previous Rambo movies had a message, that we had badly used the men we sent to Vietnam (something I think we all agree on now), but what is the point of this one? That Burma/Myanmar have evil rulers? Yeah, I guess we can agree on that. The plot- or should I say the excuse to hang the action scenes on- is that Rambo is hired to take missionaries into Burma. After saying it is an incredibly stupid idea, he is talked into it by the hot blond babe, who has a totally unconvincing argument. After an encounter with river pirates, Rambo leaves the missionaries at a village where the bad guys blow them up and capture the survivors. Rambo then takes a bunch of cartoonish mercenaries up the river, where more actions scenes ensue. I guess they like the CGI entrails they are able to add into the film, like that makes the action scenes cooler. I'll say it again - CGI IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR STORY AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! The villains, the Burmese Army, are portrayed as rapists and murderers. They imply that the Army leader is gay, since he takes a young man into his hut and the boy leaves crying the next morning. Yeah, that'll appeal to the homophobic demographics that watches these movies. More action scenes, more CGI entrails popping out... Ho hum, boring. Rambo decides to go back to Arizona after the film ends. We never really know why. Avoid this movie like the plague.
8.0~Action and Adventure to the Max galahad58 Sign in Permalink Rambo, John J. A name synonymous with action and adventure. Military violence turned up a decibel over normal with a hero larger than life. That is John Rambo. After closing the book on Rocky, with Rocky Balboa, Stallone decides to come full circle and end the story of John Rambo. He does it in style. While Rambo is not the Academy movie that Rocky was, it is still a good Rambo film. The action is well choreographed and the story well done. Is is Shakespeare? No, it is Rambo. Expect the limb explosions, the gutting of the enemy, blood and gore--this is an action film that deals with the unspeakable horrors that people allow to happen all across the world. It is Rambo saving the day--going against a tyrant who butchers people--and helping the helpless. Rambo is the super blockbuster, popcorn crunching, mindless fun movie we used to love for a Saturday matinée. OHH RAAHHH!!! Loved it. It is not as good as First Blood or Rambo: First Blood Part II--but it is a good action film.
4.0~too predictable rossie-mihova Sign in Permalink I saw this movie yesterday and seeing the high IMDb rating I had high hopes. The dialogue was flat and predictable. There were very few things I found positive about this movie. First: The war scenes were very realistic (sometimes brutal). I remember when I was little, I had no difficulty watching scenes with violence and blood. I must admit, however, that I had to close my eyes a couple of times. It was too much for me to bear. Second: I wanted to see what Sylvester Stallone can do. Bruce Willis was amazing in Die Hard 4 and I kind of expected that Rambo would revive some old memories and it did. In just a few words, you won't be surprised, you won't be intrigued but for the old time's sake, you can go and see the movie.
