2.0~Incredibly flat presentation sanmentolabs Sign in Permalink The first thing I heard about this film was some moronic SJW uproar about "lack of diversity" aka too many white people in the film and not enough women or people of color. The leftist lunacy never ends. This made me want to support the film even more, so I rushed out and watched it. Sadly, I found the film incredibly flat, devoid of much power amid all the amazing scenes, cinematography and effects. It seemed to lack...direction, or perhaps it was bad editing, but unlike other recent war flicks like Hacksaw Ridge (which was great save the meaningless love angle) Dunkirk was just not very compelling. It was like watching a series of scenes which looked great but had no cohesion as a complete film. Also, the soundtrack was freaking horrible. More annoying than suspense building, the repetition of the "music" did nothing but make those scenes less dramatic.
1.0~The Most Emperor's New Clothes movie of all time JordanRyanBarry Sign in Permalink In 13 years of membership at IMDb.com, I have yet to write a review of a film, but this is the one that has compelled me to do it. (A sentiment I've seen more than once in other reviews of this film on this site.) Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing takes place. No events transpire. There is a paucity of things that unfold. The only way I could write a review of this movie would be to use every synonym that exists for "nothing" and "happens." The movie is 106 minutes long, and Nothing. Happens. The glowing professional reviews of this film are pure rubbish. Nobody wants to confront the reality that acclaimed director Christopher Nolan has created one of the single most worthless movies of all time, so instead they praise his colossal failure of a movie by calling it "unconventional, "minimalist, "immersive," and any other number of adjectives from the self-congratulatory esoteric lexicon of the self-styled "cinephile." All that being said, I would actually go ahead and recommend you watch this movie once. A 106-minute movie in which literally nothing happens is something we've not ever seen, and are sure never to see again.
3.0~What did they spend the money on? clausd32 Sign in Permalink You take 5 planes, 5-8 ships, an empty beach and some men and then you call it Dunkirk. How can this movie cost so much? There is no action and nothing historical about this movie. You just wait and wait for anything to happen but no. There is nothing of the horror the soldiers had to go through and at no fighting at all. I was so disappointed and bored during this movie.
9.0~A bold attempt on conventional storytelling.. Defines its own genre energyzeezo Sign in Permalink Is it possible for a movie with no clear plot line or any character development to keep its viewer fully occupied and focused? Nolan made it happen with this magnificent display of cinematic mastery. The movie presents itself as a simple series of events seen through the eyes of various unnamed characters, you will not require any information or background story about them, the powerful illustration of the events that they are going through is a sufficient introduction to these tormented soldiers. Nolan emphasized those very trivial details of a story that are often ignored due to them being overshadowed by the main storyline, but in this movie, they are the storyline, they connect beautifully through the eyes of those unknown characters, as every event might seem insignificant when you compare it to the war itself, but in the eyes of those soldiers those horrific moments will leave an eternal scar on them. These moments or mini-scenes are shared by all the characters in the movie as you will experience every one of those breathtaking moments multiple times from multiple perspectives, each perspective is a totally different experience filled with its highs, lows and twists. The scenes are presented in an unusual way, the timeline is a barrage of events with different time stamps, some preceded other scenes while some were happening at the exact same time as many of the following senes but from a different angle, Nolan showed us that tilting the camera in another direction can show us a totally different story than what's happening on the other side of the camera. This masterpiece of a movie just raised the bar for all filmmakers, how Nolan captured a simple escape scene in the most breathtaking and thought-provoking way is a cinematic triumph that will be praised for generations to come.
2.0~wonderfully produced nonsense gwat-91721 Sign in Permalink My informal summary was: "a load of crap". I could appreciate the wonderfully filmed set pieces, but the overall work was a mess. First off the tripartite switching between Air:1 hour, Sea:1 day, Land:1 week, just didn't work. All 3 sections lost any sense of continuity, and you were left with a jumble of brief scenarios. For me this was particularly the case with the "Air" segments which just became boring interludes. The other really bad decision, for me, was the choice of the incidents shown. They were just populist trivia that didn't give any sense of the actual battle. For instance, the "small ship" is obviously based on a well known case. But the circumstances were completely changed and sensationalised do it gave no insight into the actual events - and where did the manslaughter of the young kid come from??? This segment is actually an insult to the RN who organised and in most cases manned this aspect of the evacuation. In contrast to the Air section, which was drawn out, the Land section was just a kaleidoscope of jumbled incidents that gave no sense of the passing of time (the evacuation took a week). There was supposed to be a minimal story line, but even so the uniform switching French guy and the prolonged hiding in an abandoned ship were pretty dumb, and where did the idea of "3 hour tides" come from. It was all pretty ridiculous, and furthermore the series of silly events, meant that there was no serious attempt to tie the "immersive effects" to any basis in the reality of Dunkirk itself.
2.0~Total utter disapontintmen of å movie andulf-1 Sign in Permalink Soundtrack . . . NOISE att rising accellerating volume. Å train noise appearing att every "exiting" moment. Letting you know: Exitement coming... But nothing exiting present in the movie. Unexiting. Bland. Characters uninvolving. The 4 of us ranging from 16-65 hade the same experience. There are att least 100 war movies bettet than this one. And the I don't think we have overrated the "noisetrack" or the "movie". Don't waste your time or money in this one.
1.0~Really mad and disappointed talib3113 Sign in Permalink I love war-based movies and never have i have been more disappointed than this. I was genuinely excited to see this movie so i bought tickets the second it was on screen. I never leave movie reviews but it angered me ao much that i spent my money and time on this movie. It's more then 2 hours of nothing, there's no plot, no character development, barely a word was even spoken!!! Seriously what was even the point?? After the first hour went by i looked around me and half of the people in the room left. If you're looking into watching it, take my advice and skip this one.
4.0~Dunkirk (2017) hamadbuss Sign in Permalink Hey everyone, I was in the movie, and I was really bored as hell. I do not know why, like the movie isn't really good... I think you should think before watching this movie. I am not telling you not to watch it but I am warning you that you have to see the trailer before watching it. It might not be your type of thing. So good luck, and tell me if you loved the movie or not. Thank You.
7.0~A little overrated seniorbayir Sign in Permalink This is Nolan's first movie on an historical event. It's OK, but overrated by Nolan lovers I guess. There are a couple of serious flaws in the course of events, I was like watching a bunch of men, but in reality, there were 350K men trapped on that beach. We see no German side. Effects and acting seem quite good. There are thrilling scenes of course, but nothing to exaggerate.
1.0~Soap Opera Feel Filmography and a poor production! tgaluska Sign in Permalink What are movie critics looking at? Must be different than we seen. I hate movies with that soap opera feel in filmography and this movie has it. We purchased it on Xfinity Pay per View and a big disappoint. Christoper Nolan is by no means one of the Great Directors. Movies about such a historical event, need a great story teller/ This movie falls way short of anything near a classic. Save your time and skip this one. We both love War and Action movies, love the classics and the New! This one is a real stinker!
5.0~Oh dear...Rather disappointed.. it's a bit of a mess. John von K Sign in Permalink This could have been a Disney live action film of the 60's it's that inoffensive. No blood or maiming, no cigarettes and no moustaches!! Narrative and editing a right old mess and to be quite honest I didn't give a damn about any of the characters really. Even the much touted air combat sequences are not too gripping. Deflection shooting is skated over to avoid silly us getting confused. Elgar's Nimrod is slower than Bernsteins version...so slow that is simply turgid and almost unrecognisable. 5/10
10.0~I had high expectation and the movie delivered. marymeehollywood Sign in Permalink From the beginning til the end I held my breath (not really but you get it...). I find it completely incredible how Nolan has able to get me to feel like that without blood, without gory scene, without even putting a face on the enemy. We already know wars are bloody and terrible, so it's nice to concentrate on something else. Saw it at a special screening in Imax and going back tonight for the 70mm screening and I can't wait.
3.0~A waste of time jljdaigle Sign in Permalink A shallow cut-and-paste movie with barely a discernible plot; which kept jumping all over the place. Mark Rylance would have been a better anchor, if his character had been beefed up. Lacked a significant female role.
2.0~very disappointed in such a wasted great idea kareem-26014 Sign in Permalink I am one of Nolan and Hans zimmer's biggest fans. I just loved inception, the dark knight trilogy and basically all of his movies and I am really disappointed in this movie. The acting/directing/soundtrack (except supermarine and the mole tracks) are really boring. OK this has some nice shots using the IMAX camera, but me as a viewer rate a movie based on my entertainment and I was not entertained in this movie at all. Very boring story-line, very little dialogue which made it just worse and unbearable. Please don't do this again Mr. Nolan and return to being a master of move making.
10.0~Fantastic movie!!! Writing, directing, cinematography all top notch! richardbaldi45039 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan puts together another epic movie! This time, it's his first foray into historical fiction, featuring the Allies precarious situation at Dunkirk. Some people have commented that the "characters have no depth", that is partly true, for good reason. There are no main actors in this film. While we do have big names like Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy...none of them have a significant role in this movie, which is the point I think Nolan was going for. Usually a movie features a protagonist, and an antagonist. But the way a friend of mine pointed out, the War itself, is the main character. The actors we see, just are small pieces to the larger story. There is no useless dialogue in this movie either...the action starts within a minute or so of the start. And really doesn't let up! When the Stuka dive bombers are coming down, you feel like you were actually there. You feel every gunshot...the whole movie was a visceral experience unlike any war movie I'd seen before. I strongly recommend this film!
7.0~Something Different From Nolan: A New Kind Of War Film zkonedog Sign in Permalink Until this point, film director and all-around mastermind Christopher Nolan has made epic character films. Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar...that were all epic in terms of character arc or story. Heck, Nolan even created the grittiest, true-to-real life Batman the world has seen to this point. With "Dunkirk", however, Nolan really goes back to his film roots: that of a cinematographer. He's no stranger to widely professing that the love of film, camera, and shot construction are what appeal to him most about film-making. While he usually has at least a hand in his films' screenplays, it is generally assumed that brother Jonathan (now of "Westworld" fame) does most of the heavy lifting in that department. Flying solo (w/o Jonathan) on "Dunkirk", it is clear that Christopher means for this new film to almost completely be told in a visual fashion. Whether that style appeals to you will determine your overall enjoyment of the experience. For a basic plot summary, "Dunkirk" tells the story of the famous 1940 WW2 scenario in which thousands of Allied soldiers are trapped on the beach at Dunkirk waiting for evacuation. The film tells this story of survival via three different lenses and time frames: -The Mole (land): Two young soldiers, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) & Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), meet up on the Dunkirk beach and make an unspoken pact to find a way to escape onto one of the rescue boats. In their efforts, they run up against a number of obstacles, along the way picking up another friend, Alex (Harry Styles), in which to abscond with. Paralleling the escape attempts of the young soldiers are a number of conversations between military officers Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy), effectively framing how mammoth of an evacuation effort will be needed to not still be trapped like sitting ducks when the enemy arrives. -The Sea: Boats from the British mainland (just 30 miles or so from Dunkirk) are being commandeered to help with the rescue effort, but Mr. Dawson (Mary Rylance) sets out with no military presence on his boat. Joining him are son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and the son's friend George (Barry Keoghan). Along the way, the yacht picks up a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy), who's express consent is to never return to Dunkirk again. -The Air: Patrolling the skies above the entire operation are Spitfighter pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) & Collins (Jack Lowden), who must manage their fuel reserves, navigation techniques, and firepower to provide as much help as possible to ground/sea troops. In stark contrast to Nolan's previous efforts, "Dunkirk" is not a character piece, nor is it reliant whatsoever on narrative twists or epiphanies. Instead, "Dunkirk" is almost purely visual. Long stretches go by with almost no dialogue at all, and no backstory is given on any characters besides what is being viewed on-screen in the moment. "Dunkirk" is also a very interesting sort of war movie in that it has almost no distinguishable "message" to it. It takes the event of the Dunkirk evacuation (one which must resonate deeply with Nolan, an Englishman himself) and portrays it via a visual medium. This is the furthest thing from a propaganda war picture. and also contains none of the overt violence of, say, "Saving Private Ryan". One almost has to re-train oneself to watch/appreciate a war movie like this one, since most of war cinema is more blustery and chest-pounding. For me, then, the 7-star rating comes because I so enjoy character-driven films (or ones that feature intriguing narratives) that this one set me aback a bit. I wasn't expecting this approach. Perhaps it will grow on me as I learn to appreciate the subtleties to Nolan's craft, but for now I'll peg it at a "solid 7". That being said, there is no doubt that "Dunkirk" is an excellent film for what Christopher Nolan set out to accomplish with it. It features perhaps the best cinematography one will ever see on the big screen, and it is never "boring", in the sense that something interest is always happening on-screen (even despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of dialogue or character-building). While "Dunkirk" certainly will fall short when compared to Nolan's other more epic, sprawling masterpieces, it never was meant to be looked at in that way in the first place. This is Nolan taking a bit of a step back (at least in terms of writing) to expertly direct/craft a passion project. Viewed from that perspective, there is still much to enjoy and appreciate. I would highly recommend (almost command!) one to see this film in the IMAX format, as the video and sound are such important components of the overall experience.
1.0~Painful bundasmedve Sign in Permalink Terrible movie. Most painful way to see a pilot not shoot when the target is in sight, and shoot as soon as it leaves the sight and just miss with every bullet. To be honest Tom Hardy shot down more people without fuel then with fuel.
3.0~Not what I expected sara-bisulli Sign in Permalink I can't understand how it can get 8.4 rating. Technically great, I mean, high level images and direction. But: first of all, why would Nolan add the past and future in all of his movies? I didn't find any empathy, emotions, with respect to other war movies. The final reminds me of the usual war movies made in US. And two actors as Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, almost not showing at all. I acknowledge Inception and Interstellar are great movies, although not 'my type', but this is not a great movie as they said.
9.0~Heart pounding, heart breaking war thriller julia-00157 Sign in Permalink Can I start off with a question? Why do we go see movies? To escape, to learn something, or to feel something. Dunkirk perfectly captures all three and, like the movie, this review will come to you in three parts. One, to escape. Watching this movie was a truly immersive experience. When the planes darted around I felt dizzy. When the soldiers gasped for air as their boat went under I could feel their anxiety and tried to reach out myself, and swim for the surface. When a bomb blew up I felt I was in danger. The suspense built throughout this movie reached levels only a true master can dream of. I don't know what made me feel this way, and maybe I'm not supposed to know. Maybe the intent wasn't for the audience to go searching for the origin, but something about this movie made me care deeply about every single character. Maybe because most of the men were just baby- faced little boys, whether they were top billing or an extra with less than a second of screen time, I wanted to rescue them. Which precisely encapsulates the history of the mission. Dunkirk was a rescue mission. They tried to save every young man stuck on that beach that day. And I could feel that. I felt in with the characters, like I knew them and was in the same boat. I wanted to survive just as much as them, but we wanted to survive together. Two, to learn something. Dunkirk is obviously based on the evacuation of Dunkirk in World War Two. We talked briefly abut this in history class but not to any large extent. As a result, I was walking into the theater knowing little about what happened except the basics. Now, Nolan's characters are all fictional, but they are drawn from the real people that made the story. The movie is fast paces and taking place along a short stretch of time. The characters are always on edge and doing something, so there is little room for exposition about their own lives. However, there is some scattered throughout, perfectly placed so that you can have that, without ever feeling forced. Three, to feel something. As I stated earlier, this movie forges a deep understanding and protective relationship with every single character. I feel like they are my babies and I want to make sure they are okay. The ending, which I won't spoil, is perfection itself. Capturing what must have been felt after Dunkirk was evacuated: relief, exhaustion, and victory. Throughout the movie there is a constant, underlying ticking noise. A clock, which they are up against. The rounds of a revolver, pointed at their heads. A fighter plane getting ready to fire, swirling above them, squealing. Obviously, this is One Direction's Harry Styles's acting debut. And yes, he can act. He's got a lot to learn, sure. But he's got raw talent you can see in this movie and I expect we will see many times in the near future. All across the board, performances are spectacular. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and this chain would be unbreakable. Each actor providing a step up for their partner in a scene as they build each other up. A little note I have is that most of the soldiers looked very similar. Dark hair, big eyes, and a stiff face. I assume this was a very conscious choice for the director to make. Dunkirk has three simultaneous and interspersed story lines. This works well for making sure you don't lose interest, but it depends deeply on your ability to recognize the actors. This goes back to all the soldiers looking the same. There was a part that I found to be an unnecessary tear-jerking attempt, but that's not to say it at all spoiled my enjoyment of the movie. I'm not going to go into Nolan because we all know he's proved himself as someone who can do this. However, I will say, though I am not a huge fan and haven't seen everything he's made, this is unlike anything I've seen his name attached to. It all felt so real, a stark contrast to the inception approach that nothing is. And last but not least, it's just really pretty. The wides and close ups and deep emotion each shot brings, whether you're conscious of it or not. You will find your heart beating and breaking from the opening credits to the end.
7.0~Tries too hard to be Relevant yothisisyo Sign in Permalink Dunkirk has very weakly written script , it relies a lot on Visual effects and sounds especially . Story tries to hard to make sense , frankly speaking there is no story . It is like a documentary of enacting escape from Dunkirk , that's all . I think people are over rating it because of Nolan . I would have preferred any Jonathan Nolan script over this Christopher Nolan written Dunkirk . I would rate this movie 6/10 . That's my personal opinion .
3.0~Underwhelming and myopic rcgiroday Sign in Permalink The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the most important moments in history, and a pivotal part of WWII. This movie had the opportunity to express the greatness and the gravity of this event, and it failed. The flyover shots of a few dozen soldiers on the beaches, when there should be ten of thousands, failed to express the enormity of the situation. Similarly the dozen or so civilian boats, when there should have been thousands, underwhelmed their contributions. The attempt to humanize the story by showing a few individual vignettes, in one case a single incident shown from multiple perspectives, also failed. No one character was engaging enough to impress the tension or magnitude of the situation. In essence this movie made a momentous and terrifying event a little boring. In doing so, it does a disservice to those that have experienced combat.
3.0~Perhaps the "ART" of war should be left to Sun Tzu jmarinko925 Sign in Permalink Talk about putting the bore in war! I saw Dunkirk's extended preview trailer in the Imax Hubble theatre and was excited by the tension presented by the fighter pilot scene as well as the scenes cutting in between. That was as good as this film got . A half hour to forty five minutes in I felt myself wanting it to be over and fast. Sweeping shots of the ocean and a high-powered tension building score were not enough to salvage this incredibly dull movie. The film is loaded with no name characters. It has plenty of stars just the characters you will identify as the guy who was burying the guy A multitude of character's scattered in different situations that you can not identify and by the time that you realize who is who you will not care as you will be begging for it to be over. From a cinematic standpoint Dunkirk may get high marks but it is not entertaining at all. An incredibly dull of a summer movie. So boring it was funny my friends and I laughed in the parking lot afterwards about how sufferable a sit thru this was and how badly we'd been had going to see it.
3.0~Disappointment hartmanal Sign in Permalink I am sorry to say I was disappointed in this movie. After all the hype and trailers for this movie I found it boring. I was expecting a war epic with much more action and more of a story line concerning the rescue of the all the men trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. The attempt of the producers to have the audience bond with the characters, I feel failed. The only persons that I did felt connected to were the captain of the small pleasure craft and his son. These two coming from England to the beach of Dunkirk I enjoyed. There should have been more emphasis on the real story here, that being the hundreds of ships, small and large, that were the real heroes of this historic event.
1.0~DUNKIRK DUNKR*P carolej-99510 Sign in Permalink With Wilbur and Orville doing the flight scenes, Noah the shipping and Marcel Marseau the dialog, I was really disappointed with the film that I was looking forward to for ages. Did the critics actually see the film or just read the pre-release promo? I waited for the film to start which it never did. I'm no intellectual and took the film at face value. Really really disappointed.
3.0~Another overrated movie rolf-berge5 Sign in Permalink I do not understand why this movie gets such good reviews when it does not reflect how it really was. Where are the 400,000 people? Where are all the planes, the boats? The big ships that are hit by torpedoes or bombs roll over to the left side right away and sink, quite strange. Then you have a spitfire that runs out of fuel at a fairly low altitude, yet it's flying around forever and shooting other aircraft down before it lowers the undercarriage and lands well on the beach. They have also added a noisy background sound that becomes quite annoying in the long run. A disappointing movie that's not worth watching at the cinema.
4.0~Wanted More nmns22 Sign in Permalink I enjoy war stories but I wouldn't recommend Dunkirk to anyone. If you're familiar with the situation the British faced this story doesn't convey anything that isn't common knowledge. If you are unfamiliar with the story and you stayed for the whole story, you still aren't familiar with Dunkirk and its history. The film needs the beginning to show the Germans and how they got the Brits into the situation. There needed to be more "stories within the story;" however, if you enjoy gunfire and bombs for 90 minutes without a clue where it's coming from or why, this movie is for you.
6.0~Visually stunning but... silarpac Sign in Permalink One must give credit to the director for style points. It is very well done cinematically. But the minimal dialogue does not allow the audience to get to know the characters well enough to care about them. Nolan uses the well worn multiple plot lines device but in this case it doesn't work. Hitchcock is Nolan's role model but Hitch would never have used this device in one of his thrillers. Hitchcock always had straightforward plots with compelling main characters. But here, the characters are almost unimportant. Nolan is more interested in the danger that they are facing. But that doesn't work dramatically if the audience doesn't identify with the character. Nolan seems to be uninterested in the battle as a great historical event. Little effort is spent on giving the audience the necessary background to understand the battle's significance. The director wants to treat the battle as a series of human survival dramas. That is only partially successful. The episode of the soldiers getting into the beached ship was just too obviously a suspense inducing gimmick. Why would anyone that was not completely stupid think that would be a safe refuge? The enemy is almost faceless. This is another device meant to create a feeling of dread. All of these devices work in some movies but here it doesn't come together. For the British this battle was very emotional because they believed at the time that they were facing a German invasion of Britain. That was why it was so important to save the British Army. It wasn't just national honor. Nolan doesn't seem to care about any of this. I think that Nolan should stay away from historical subjects. It just isn't his forte.
10.0~Makes you feel like you were there derspecht Sign in Permalink Many are complaining about the lack of depth and that there are not characters. But that's exactly the point. I am from Europe and I had my Godfathers fight in this holarious unhuman war. So I know story 2nd hand. But yet I could never totally understand how it must have felt like in this war. Now I can. This movie made me understand the hopelessness, the fear, the horror, the feeling you want to get you. The whole movie was so intense. You just wanna get out of the situation!!! But the movie won't let you. The music, the sound effects... God the sound effects. I get goose bumps remembering the sound. This movie achieved something most war movies never did. It makes you feel how they felt. It puts you right on spot. It's very long time ago a movie caused so many feelings. And last but not least: This is movie is the perfect reminder, that war is cruel and it doesn't have heroes. That's something Americans should consider again with their Patriotism...
7.0~Left wanting. zenithon Sign in Permalink I came out of Dunkirk thinking it was OK. I was just pretty happy it was over really. I sure would have liked a whole lot more character development. A big dash of story line would have been helpful. Dialog might have been nice. I remember thinking about ten minutes in, oh no, Nolan has gone off the deep end here with some kind of overly artistic self gratifying film. I kept hoping for about the next ten minutes that it would stop, that it was just his opening to a meaningful story about the brave successful rescue of an army that would live to later see victory. It didn't stop though. It went on and on and on and on. I suggest Schindler's List, Das Boot, Letters from Iwo Jima, A Bridge Over River Kwai, The Great Escape, Patton, Sophie's Choice, or a whole bunch of other films that just escape me right now, if you wan't to see great films, with characters and story line that draw you in, and help you loose yourself in a meaningful story about a particular experience of one of the endless number of difficult experiences which that terrible war produced. This film is distracting, at times confusing, underdeveloped, and a rather poor story teller. It's not all bad and certainly did have its moments, but ultimately did not deliver nearly what so many other films about WWII have so eloquently accomplished.
1.0~The film company must have spent the $150M on setting up false ratings alexandertelfer Sign in Permalink The subject matter provided so much potential, so much opportunity - but instead it is unbelievably bad in almost every possible respect. It may have been closer to a Battle of Britain film than about Dunkirk. For a film about Dunkirk I would watch the old one from the 1950's which is a little slow at the beginning as they develop the characters - but in the end the film so so much better having characters in it. I guess the budget must have run out though - they didn't have enough money to buy any German uniforms. You don't see any German troops fighting. Even when they are in the boat all you see is bullet holes appearing but you don't see the Germans. Then at the very end of the film you see the pilot being taken prisoner by two Germans who are blurred out! Why was that?
4.0~Worst WWII movie i have yet seen. bucklerjoseph-41331 Sign in Permalink It was difficult to give this film such a high rating but it did have certain good qualities. The acting was good and the uniforms looked real. having said these good things, let me get to the list of bad: DO NOT see this movie if you are a fan of history. The historical inaccuracies will drive you insane. Dunkirk was one of the turning points of the war. It was because the Brits were able to save their army that Germany did not invade. Germany instead decided to turn on Russia and this eventually led to their demise. This great WWII battle was completely underrepresented in this film. There were less than ten total planes in the movie, 20 or less ships, and MAYBE 500 actors. This was not enough. I went in expecting the same level of action as the movie Pearl Harbor, but what i saw was... something less. DO NOT see this movie if you like a story line or plot. There was no plot to this movie at all, and the events in the movie are not even represented in a linear time line. DO NOT see this movie if you like to identify with characters. You will not care much about the characters because there is very little dialogue and no way for you to learn about them. DO NOT see this movie if you are expecting action. There were only a couple "dog fights" which consisted of one plane flying behind another with zero intensity. DO NOT see this movie if you have been in the military. Obviously Nolan had nobody on set that knew anything about the military because from the opening sequence there were problems. For example, the movie opens with a few Brits lollygagging in an area with Germans close enough to shoot at them. It is here we see that apparently none of the Brits had their weapons loaded. Also it should be noted that at no point is there any fighting of any kind in the city of Dunkirk. They never show the men holding the line for this evacuation. There were no German artillery barrages. Also it needs to be said, planes would not have dropped bombs on men in the sand when there were ships and docks right there. They would have strafed them in the sand. Overall i cannot say how completely disappointed i was with this film. I do not think i will ever see another war film from Nolan.
1.0~If you want to damage your hearing go to this movie LordZaul Sign in Permalink We went to a Imax screening of this movie, it was so loud that it has damaged my hearing as well as that of my partners. If you go to this movie bring ear plugs. The story line was boring and the characters are very shallow. The music sounded like a steam engine running throughout the movie.
10.0~Nolan recreates the terror of Dunkirk which is cruel , ticking clock, relentless but real. Its a Horror movie , the horror of war. rhut_tiger Sign in Permalink A portrayal of a hopeless situation which turns out to be such an visceral experience that starts from the first frame till the end credits. Its a war movie unlike any other war movie by many terms. Sure there is despair , anger , pain , fear and most importantly terror filled in the entire movie. But the movie never ever lets you sit and catch your breath and relax till the next heart pounding scene comes as the entire movie is a non stop thrill ride, nor it fills you up with hope of a victory but it states that sometimes avoiding annihilation is a triumph. This is movie is somehow not about war its about the terror of war, the horrific outcome and the unforgiving-unjust nature of the war. Christopher Nolan in his 10th film achieves a sense of fear among viewers that lasts even after the movie has ended. There are no consoling conversations between soldiers nor any personal choices or family details , but what there is , is the only instinct that anyone on earth is born with, Survival. Movie doesn't waste time in developing characters and motivational dialogues as no one in that situation will actually do that. Sure the lack of deep characters can be a sore thumb for many but that's the point of the movie , its about the situation and the event not about characters. You still root for these guys and feel sad when they die in horror, without knowing their names, and that's the beauty of the cinema that Nolan has created. Then there is the genius of the storytelling via distinctive vantage points. All in different timelines and without spoiling it i would tell you to read the minimal text very carefully when these are introduced for the first time very early in the film. That just adds layers to the story telling which will definitely be appreciated more on a second viewing. I rather not tell you about the cast than just that its filled with award winners and future award winners. Without having much to do verbally they have conveyed many things through their actions and large portion of the credit goes to the direction. Christopher Nolan has brought freshness to an era and genre of film making that has been a choice of directors since almost last 80 years. A war movie without many war scenes, one which during the entire length of the movie has not shown the opposition once , as in you definitely see enemy bullets flying , bombs jumping , aircrafts piercing air but not a single German face up until the last minute of the movie, still you are in dead fear of the situation and terrorized by the opposition like the Britishers and french are as if you were there. This is mostly achieved by the beautiful practical visuals effects from Hoyte Van Hoytema and an superbly original and chilling score by Hans Zimmer. When you go in a war movie you feel what can a world war II movie bring to the table that's fresh, still while exiting you are left with an experience none like any other in this category. Its a must watch for any war movie fans or any movie fans , don't expect a one to one gun-fight here rather than its a survival movie in which the hell is cut loose and you have no where to go other than to be with them , feel with them, fear with them.... 9.5 /10 AMAZing
7.0~Beautiful Aesthetically Yet Lacks Emotion vnb010 Sign in Permalink This film was meant for 70mm IMAX cameras. This film gives a glimpse into the Battle of Dunkirk from land, sea, and air. Each of these settings has its own story to tell on how these men survived the horrors of being surrounded by the German during World War II. Film technical wise, it was amazing. The colors and lack of CGI, but rather physical explosions and cardboard cutouts to enhance the amount of men were nostalgic to the art of filmmaking. Plus, giving an excerpt into the stories of these men from various angles created an in-depth look at WWII...

4.0~A real letdown shadowfax73 Sign in Permalink The trailer made me really excited about the movie so I was gutted to find that the trailer gave the impression of a far different film to what actually hit the theaters. Nolan has been lauded by millions yet the only two films of his that live up to their billing in my opinion are Batman Begins and Inception. The Dark Knight left me cold, Interstellar was a real yawn but Dunkirk assumes the mantle of biggest letdown. Nearly every other director knows that you need to feel invested in the characters to be able to empathize with them and so get invested in their story. If I had wanted to watch a documentary on Dunkirk I would have watched the relevant episodes of The World At War. The film keeps you at arms length and never lets you get close to any character and so it doesn't matter to me if they live or die. I would say that Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh's characters were the only ones that I felt for. With Tom Hardy it was the last few minutes of the movie and for Branagh it was his humanity and the horror of what may befall the troops he was desperate to save. I have seen Branagh in two WWII films now, this one and Conspiracy. Dunkirk never gets started but Conspiracy is one of the most gripping and chilling movies I've ever seen; Branagh is so impressive as Reinhard Heydrich. Nolan is overrated in my opinion. He has good ideas but his execution of them mostly leaves me cold.
9.0~Efficiently emphasizes the horror but also beauty of war in its simplicity and elegance. Fabianlindblad Sign in Permalink Tick-tack. Simplicity is key. Lives on its production. Beautiful colour and cinematography. The story isn't groundbreaking. Shows the reality and true nature of the soldiers, captures the feeling of being in the center of combat. Flawless acting and great directing. In some way perfect. The absence of spectacular story isn't that important in comparison to the other elegantly performed elements in this movie. Never boring and very captivating. The soundtrack is almost hypnotic. Tick-tack. 9/10
3.0~Disappointed! toubabdoc Sign in Permalink The evacuation of Dunkirk was a miracle. I had wondered what this film would have to say about it that hasn't been shown before. The beach scenes are portrayed as lines of soldiers standing quietly. There are no non-coms screaming orders or keeping order. Everyone is acting like they are waiting for afternoon tea. Air battles: repetitive. The same yellow-nosed Bf-109 gets shot down several times. (Yawn!) And the timing of the air scenes is simply unbelievable. In an effort to create suspense a Heinkel 111 takes nearly five minutes to get close enough to be shot down by a Spit. This is despite closing speeds in excess of 500 mph. Just not believable. Other efforts to create suspense are simply contrivances. The crowning disappointment is the main kick: the miracle of Dunkirk was the response of hundreds upon hundreds of small boat owners, ship owners, ferry crews....ordinary Britons who risked their lives to get anything that floats across the channel to rescue the troops. This is given short shrift, not only in following only one boat, but in so few boats actually being in the film. I don't understand the hype this film has been given. Wait for it to come out on DVD, then don't bother to see it.
5.0~Not a Nolan's genre. sumedhaathreya Sign in Permalink Since, it is a war concept movie most of the people may like this movie.But Nolan have not tried to satisfy his fans.Cinematography,Music,Acting-these are aspects of the movie that i appreciate.Bombing & Blasting in IMAX is unbearable & especially that ticking sound never ends until Nolan name appears in the credits.We did not expect this from Nolan.Overall it is one time watchable in normal theaters not in IMAX. It is a disaster for some of his fans i would say.Real concepts does not suit for Nolan's direction. At first when people come out from the theatre they will be in excited mode since it is Nolan's direction.I also went through the same feeling but if you think & review the whole movie once from the beginning then the genuine review comes.
10.0~Stunning masterclass in filmmaking. shawthingproductions Sign in Permalink I've been looking forward to this film for what seems like an eternity and usually - when that's the case - I tend to end up nit-picking and getting frustrated with the finished product. A film that promises more than it can deliver. Thankfully, this is not the case with "Dunkirk" and Christopher Nolan reminds us, again, why he is one of the most important film directors of the now. From the opening scenes, this film is tense. The story follows three situations: a young soldier trying to get away from Dunkirk, the fighter planes sent to try and keep the troops on the beach safe and one of the "civilian" ships that crossed the channel to try and bring the troops back. Each little story being tense in their own right and telling their own story. Not a single frame wasted in this beautifully shot film. Dialogue is minimum but Hans Zimmer score stops there from being completely silent. A score which doesn't really let up for the 1:46 minute running time. A running time, again, which is nigh on perfect. Too long and you'll be bored. There is no padding here. The story tells what needs to be told. Even Harry Styles didn't do the bad job people thought of him. Sure, he's not going to be an award winning actor any time soon but - for what he had to do in this film - he played the part well; as did the rest of the cast. Mark Rylance as the father setting sail from England to help those he can, with his son. Tom Hardy the fighter pilot... Hardy doing a great performance considering, for pretty much the whole film, we only see his eyes through his goggles. The emotion and intensity burning through just his eyes is immense. That being said, there are a lot of names in this film (Hardy, Rylance, Brannagh....) but no actor is bigger than the film. They all play their part and none of them distract from the story. I was excited to watch this film. I'm more excited to see it again.
5.0~Chaotic & Non-Sensical; like watching a bunch of GoPro YouTube videos jhechotek Sign in Permalink I know this film is getting rave reviews by almost everyone, but in all honesty...I thought it stunk. From the very first moments, I felt like I was watching a bunch of GoPro videos on YouTube that were stitched together. The screenshots are very chaotic & non-sensical. To make my point, there are multiple scenes where it's nighttime and it's dark and flames all around, then the very next scene it's broad daylight with sunshine & blue sky. The director cuts repeatedly from ships being torpedoed, Spitfire aerial dogfights, men standing on a long causeway. This film has minimal dialogue in fact there's very little acting at all...it's all explosions, sinking ships & dogfights. In the end, the one absolutely amazing moment was Kenneth Branagh viewing the wide panoramic vista of English civilian boats sailing in to rescue the trapped army. Before going to the theater, I spent time reading Encyclopedia Britannica as well as Wikipedia too as I wanted to know the real "factual" history. Thankfully, this tale is extremely close to the truth with only one exception and that'd be the huge numbers of soldiers that were captured by Nazi Germans as POWs.
1.0~Definitely not the film of the year johnloweth-87210 Sign in Permalink Disappointed - script and acting were poor - also considering that 800 vessels and 16 RAF squadrons were involved in rescuing the troops, the depiction of just a handful of boats and planes didn't portray the enormity of what happened - the constant switching between air, land and sea did not help at all. The portrayal of soldiers using devious & callous means to get a 'lift home' was not typical of the hundreds of brave men who waded into water for many hours to be ferried by small boats to the larger destroyers. And why show one rescued soldier accidentally killing a 16yr old boy - this was not what Dunkirk was all about. The film was boring and left me annoyed that reality was ruined by half baked fiction
10.0~Best war movie I have watched. A masterpiece from Nolan ceuotce Sign in Permalink This is another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Brilliant acting by Tom, Mark, Fionn and Harry. Amazing war scenes. When i saw the movie, I could actually feel the atmosphere of the world war. The film is directed and presented perfectly by the perfectionist Christopher Nolan. I will watch this movie again and again. That's how much I liked it. This movie is definitely in my top 5 favourite movies.
1.0~Dunkirk ? tc_nafsasp Sign in Permalink No, just no. Appalling. Now I've got to come up with 5 lines of text! The John Mills version is far more watchable. My father was at Dunkirk, he'd have been horrified at this film. What a waste of time and money, and it's not even historically on the nose. Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a better film.
10.0~A classical and finest masterpiece completely memorable patalingjugaeron Sign in Permalink This is no doubt the finest masterpiece that has been created since Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and the best movie that Christopher Nolan had ever created. As he had done a good direction on his previous acclaimed works such as the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Interstellar; Christopher Nolan has finally made a finest craft that will remembered as a finest classic in the years to come. As memorable as it is, Hans Zimmer's musical score is completely bombastic and full of suspense that connects to the story. Even the performances of the cast are great, plus the non-linear narrative is also excellent reminding on how this technique that was used on Pulp Fiction can make this movie awesome. The story above all that talks on survival, tension, and the spirit of humanity gradually makes this movie completely spectacular and amazing! Definitely calling as an Academy Award winning film for Best Picture!
6.0~Could have been better !!! rakeshkumarbn Sign in Permalink Treat to the eyes but could have told the story in a better way. It's better than interstellar but definitely not Nolan's best movie. Expected a good fight between German's and British but dint find one. Nolan has depicted all soldiers as heroes here including civilians too. Air fight sequences are the best ... and awesome background score. I wouldn't watch this movie twice.
1.0~The most overrated war film gfawkes-20798 Sign in Permalink Their cloths hair looks unbelievably clean and neat. Where can I find realism? Lots of meaningless handheld scenes, long sequences... Pieces of the director peaked at the dark knight and keeps going down. Now he's got trapped in 'now making only for the masterpiece' Well... I doubt from when he is a great director first place. With that mediocre SF which lack of any scientific background.
2.0~When will it end? vincefu-25919 Sign in Permalink After watching this film on a recommendation from a friend, I kept asking myself the question "when will it end"? It dragged on forever and was incredibly dull. Sure, it did a good job conveying the despair and atmosphere but it was just a mess...pass unless you really like war movies.
9.0~Incredible movie razvan-66077 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's incredible how much passion was put into it - perfect acting, amazing soundtrack, immersive story and dramatic moments that are recreated through a top notch cinematography. It's a movie that will be remembered for many years and another masterpiece from Cristopher Nolan. And maybe it's just me, but I got that feeling of Inception all over again.
4.0~I wish they evacuated me from the cinema vincent-malisse Sign in Permalink With high expectations (it is a Christopher Nolan movie after all) we entered the cinema. With even higher disappointment, we left it. Dunkirk was two hours of the same over and over and over again building scene after scene with tense music only to leave the scene again without any climax. It was a confusing mix of scenes that failed to show the overall picture. If you like war movies, there are far better movies out there. The movie started out right and you're thrown right in the middle of the action and sitting on the edge of your seat you expect the movie to dive right into a great story, but then it stops, the climax halted, the story does not really develop and you're left with a feeling of missing something. The entire size of the evacuation (which should have been enormous) is completely missing. The dread of leaving in time because the Germans are breathing down their necks is absent and the scenes often jump to different time frames of the evacuation process. In fact the only Germans you see in person in the entire movie appear in the very end. The acting was OK and so were the different characters put in place: you have your heroes, each in their different way and you have your cowards, also each in their own different way. The cinematography was pretty well setup. Despite a huge potential in possibilities, Dunkirk did not convince me and I feel left stranded on the very beach they tried to escape from.
8.0~An enormous spectacle that highlights the desperation of the real-life event GoldenBlunderbuss Sign in Permalink Three intertwined stories (on land, at sea and in the air) over different time frames are stitched together to form a single overarching tale of instinctive survival. Christopher Nolan indulges his inner Michael Bay for Dunkirk ... well, maybe a bit more restrained than that I guess, but ships sink, airplanes crash and there's more than a few explosions. It's more of an action film than most of his previous work, but his still manages to linger on the personal elements of what would have gone on during Operation Dynamo as comrades, family and friends (on both sides of the Channel) fight for the survival of not just the men on the beach, but of Western Europe. There's no real lead actor to pinpoint, instead the film jumps back and forth between three stories set over the same fortnight. The action on the beach (on which most the film focuses) takes place over two weeks, the parts on one particular boat (captained by Mark Rylance) is set over two days, and the scenes from Tom Hardy's spitfire cockpit are over the course of a couple of hours. In typical Nolan style, they're stitched together masterfully and it's never confusing to have to jump from one time frame to another - think Memento but without the headache afterwards! Nolan earned his first Best Director Oscar nomination but as much as it pains to say it, I never thought we would see him finally lift a gold statuette. From its eight nominations, it managed only three in the technical categories and Hans Zimmer's amazing score couldn't compete against Alexandre Desplat's music for The Shape of Water. Even the inclusion of Harry Styles in a prominent speaking role couldn't hamper the drama or detract from the very serious (and very real) scenario the film drew its inspiration. The only real gripe is that there's a noticeable lack of French characters (and therefore actors) on a French beach, especially when you consider how many French troops must have died fighting off the fast-advancing Nazi army in order to give the British Navy and Air Force enough time to evacuate all 340,000 people. Best Quote: "Men my age dictate this war. Why should we be allowed to send our children to fight it?"
6.0~Certainly the worst movie of Nolan!! nilapup321 Sign in Permalink First of all I admit that I am probably the biggest fan of Nolan and a true admirer of him.His past few films are like Bible to me. However being a true movie buff, I must say that this is not the best of Nolan. Neither this is will come in the top 5 war movie movie list. Nolan's specialty is building characters, great dialogues,thrills, engaging climax etc. I am sorry to say that all these are missing here. You do not feel for any of the characters in the movie. My verdict is this that this is the worst movie from Christopher Nolan( I am really sorry to say this!!))
4.0~A compete failure nabilft-56291 Sign in Permalink I was expecting a great war movie, but it happened to be a very disappointing and boring experience. A lot of repetitive scenes, a lack of depth, and a poor script. I would describe it as a documentary rather than a movie... Piece pf advice : for those who are expecting a war movie, don't get yourself fooled don't waste your money for such pity.
4.0~NOTHING CAN RESCUE THIS TURKEY ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM Sign in Permalink Dunkirk by writer/director Chris Nolan is the story of how the British at the beginning of World War II were able to snatch a small victory from the jaws of an enormous defeat. The Germans had deployed their new military tactic, the Blitzkrieg, to run over the low countries, then conquer France in less than three weeks. In doing so, it defeated the combined French and British armies. The remnants of those armies found themselves on the beaches of Dunkirk, with the Germans on one side and the English Channel on the other. While England was less than fifty miles away, there were almost 400,000 troops on the beaches of Dunkirk and evacuating them would not be easy. Hitler was convinced by Air Marshall Goering that the task of eliminating the troops on the beach was best left to the Luftwaffe and that the ground attack should be halted. After weeks of non-stop attacks, they could use the rest. At that time, the British had the largest fleet in Europe, but getting the troops off the Dunkirk beaches was a tactical nightmare. Large ships became easy targets for German bombers, especially the terror-evoking dive bomber, the Stuka. I saw Dunkirk at the Aero theatre in Santa Monica where the attraction was not only the large screen 70 mm presentation of the movie, but an after-movie talk with the writer-director, himself. Dunkirk concentrates on three characters: a young British soldier's attempts to avoid getting killed (designated in the movie with the title, (The Land), a British pilot's crossing the English Channel in a spitfire (the British fighter plane) to shoot down German planes harassing the rescue attempt (The Air) and a 50-ish Englishman, played by Mark Rylance, who crosses the channel in his own small boat, the Moonstone, to pitch in (yeah, The Sea). The movie is all about the special effects and the visuals. There is no attempt to give any of the characters, even the main ones, any kind of back story. Yes, we sympathize with them, but they are fighting Nazis so it isn't that hard to guess where your sympathies will land. Perhaps no incident portrays the lack of any serious storytelling in the movie better than what happens to a teenage boy who makes the trip from England to Dunkirk on The Moonstone to lend a hand. Along the way, the Moonstone picks up a British sailor whose boat was sunk. He acts very strange and insists that the small boat turn around and go back to England since there was nothing that it could do at Dunkirk. Rylance ignores him and later tells his son that the man is obviously 'shell-shocked.' When this sailor tries to physically force Rylance to turn around the boat, he pushes the teenage boy down stairs and the boy hits his head which starts to bleed profusely. As they are caring for this young boy who appears to be in extremis, the boy says that all he ever really wanted is for his name to be in the local newspaper for doing something good. Need I tell you what happens when the boy dies and the Moonstone makes it back to England with a score of rescued soldiers? And that is how the entire movie moves along, one plodding moment to another. Yes, some of the visuals are very good and so is the sound. You may have noticed that I have not mentioned most of the actors. In fact, in 45 minutes of talking about the making of the movie, neither did Nolan. The actors are irrelevant to his way of making movies. He did go on and on about how he wanted to make a movie to a certain beat or rhythm that would go like a bolero with all crescendos. Yeah, right. The hook for this movie is that it is 'unlike any other war movie.' Not really. The idea of isolating a few stories in a battlefield of dramas is as old as All's Quiet on the Western Front. Technically, it cannot hold a candle to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. And as for portraying the reality of warfare, Kubrick's The Paths of Glory is far superior. So, why all the buzz about Dunkirk? It is fairly short for a 'war epic' coming in at 1hr, 46m. And it does have the kind of appeal that video games have. In fact, there were many moments that made me think that Nolan was more inspired by Call of Duty than Battleground. If that is your kind of thing - and Dunkirk's box office of over $500 million is proof that there are a lot of people (my guess, mostly teenage males) who love this kind of mindless visual house of thrills - then go see it. Believe me, it's a hell of a ride, if not much of a movie.
8.0~Familiar Tricks, Unlike Any War Film svorva Sign in Permalink The only explanation of the events surrounding Dunkirk are few lines of text and Nazi propaganda. Maps of France, covered in red demarcating German territory, which falls on a squad of British solider scavenging in an abandoned city. It declares: Surrender + Survive. Within seconds of an enemy encounter, only one soldier will survive. This sequence is the closest we will get to combat depicted in more exhilarating war movies. Not in this scene nor any other do we see a single Nazi solider. War is a favorite subject, why is obvious. Any emotion can be provoked, any existential question explored, against a backdrop of war. As a result, a diverse pantheon of great war films have emerged. Dunkirk, by critical demand, is set to join these hallowed ranks. Call these proclaimers Nolan fanboys, but already comparison are being made to the likes of standards Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Platoon. But this is a disservice to all parties. Of the three aforementioned film, all belong to the same genre, but when each are distilled to their most base essence, I would only describe 1 ½ as being "about" war. Almost unimaginable, there is a grander scale where war is just a subtheme e.g. an exploration of human madness. Nolan strives for the exact opposite in Dunkirk. Dunkirk seeks to narrow the scope, it is not about war, or WW2, or even really an event in WW2. Thus the opening scene, were context is rendered to a few measly lines. Don't panic, or at least not yet. Dunkirk is a story of many struggles for survival, and Nolan is going to root through his usual bag of tricks to extract this perspective from history's grandest retreat. Nolan is back to his trademark storytelling technique in Dunkirk. There are three major plot lines cut together in nonlinear fashion. Two soldiers attempt to escape the beach, a trio of civilians cross the channel on a one boat rescue mission, and a pilot defends all against German aircraft. Individually, each account is almost overly simplistic, but they are edited so that a sleepy film-goer might find the narrative incompressible. The temporal dicing can lead to monumental changes in shot composition from cut to cut, including night to day, clear skies to grey, and from calm to raging seas. When plot lines do briefly converge, their might be a 40 minute gap between one perspective and its reflection. Audiences looking for plot to serve as a guide will be lost. Then, when they make the logical next step a look for a central character, they will grow more bewildered. Dunkirk relies on an ensemble cast, I would be impressed by anyone perceptive enough to walk out of the theater remembering any two characters' names. No time to really explore individual performances, but the cast is astounding. Quality notwithstanding, no single part is hefty enough to serve as a focal point. Without defining plot or characters, people looking to evaluate Dunkirk on their customary schema are going to be unfulfilled. Where the heart of most films lie, Nolan has created a void. Dunkirk is a masterpiece because beyond this absence there is only intentioned craft. Dialogue is a rare interruption in Dunkirk. There is virtually no exposition. Still, gleaning motivation is never a problem. The solider pair making up 1/3 of Dunkirk observe their situation, and, without speaking, mutually understand the best path to survival. The closest we get to a comical moment is when the duo simply look to each other, no choice to what their next act must be. The audience understands these characters by the same method they understand each other. Only later we learn speech that could have espoused the situation was impossible. The score speaks clearer than any dialogue. What Zimmerman lacks in subtly here is compensated by his brutal effectiveness. Symphonic blaring with an omnipresent ticking, the crux is dissonance rather than resolution. Audiences will pray for silence and its arrival is rapturous. But the eyes will be as overwhelmed as the ears. Dunkirk is constantly upsetting with vastnesses of oceans, beach, and sky as counterpoints against confined quarters, dense with humanity and rising water. There is no rest, or even catharsis. None of the hallmark exhilaration associated with the genre. Death comes via suicide, stairs, water, and oil. Extinction by strafing is almost pleasant because it is familiar within the context of war. Dunkirk should not happen under the laws of moviedom, it is a fortunate example of when a powerful director can tell a story of personal importance with personal style. The most common criticism will be from those who entirely missed the point, complaints about story and character despite the deliberate steps to make clear these ideals were never the goal. Saving Private Ryan fails if you walk out of the theater without remembering the name of Hank's character. Make a rule of thumb from this, but not a universal standard. For some, the blunderous beautify of war exemplified in films like The Big Red 1. These are their war films. That's fine, but you must also appreciate Dunkirk which requires a bit of investment and does not hold your hand. I can only hope this is not too much of a burden.
3.0~A disappointing series of events PuckerFactor Sign in Permalink Where did the budget go? We saw a few hundred men and a dozen boats and a couple of aircraft. Where was the story of the battalions fighting the rear-guard in the towns so those hundreds of thousands on the beaches could line-up to be rescued? Survivors of two battalions fighting the rear-guard that had to surrender to the SS, were then murdered by the SS...where was that story? There were some heroic moments in the events leading up to evacuation of Dunkirk. All we got was a few aerial dogfights and half-arsed attempts to leave a dock. Far too much time spent on a few young guys trying anything to get off a beach. Don't get me started on the annoying soundtrack.
3.0~Forgettable, Dull and Absolutely Overrated claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink "Dunkirk" is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three. Title (Brazil): "Dunkirk"
3.0~Interstellar 2: WWII Edition carlosvijande Sign in Permalink Congratulations to the director for managing to make a movie that is physically painful. Maybe that is by design. A festival of cinematic nonsense, with an over the top and unnecessary loud scoring, lousy editing and a confusing timeline, all make for a masterpiece that I do not seem to "get". If you thought Interstellar was slow, boring and unnecessary, Mr. Nolan has somehow managed to set the bar a step higher.
2.0~Simply disappointing SteverB Sign in Permalink I'm not going to belabor this because there seem to be many reviewers here that have already done my work for me. All I saw and heard in this film was an overly loud disjointed mess. I know of the non-linear story structure and have no problem with that in other films, but this film gave me nothing to actually hook onto to keep my interest. The beach, the planes, the sea. Lather, rinse, repeat. By the one hour mark, I stopped caring and came here to see what others thought and if maybe it was just me. Apparently, no. VERY disappointing film from Nolan. Watch it if you must, maybe you'll see something I couldn't.
3.0~Why does this movie have such a high score? reza-khamooshi Sign in Permalink It is such a simple movie with IMHO very bad sound tracks
7.0~Lack of Connection itscree Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is beautifully shot, its score is wonderful and it's sound puts you right in the action. The story has some okay moments but overall I didn't feel even remotely connected with any of the characters which is a shame. Perhaps the lack of dialog is meant to symbolize the stress of the situation but if that is the point the actors all failed. Anything could have happened to any character and I would have had zero reaction.
1.0~Need CGI & better music(or less) runcap Sign in Permalink Music tempo was overpowering,the exhausted cowardly Brit trying to take a dump on the beach in the beginning of the movie with ear piercing somber music while his pants are down around his ankles was an ominous sign of things to come. The siege of Dunkirk (historically crammed with 300,000-400,000 vacating France with at least 10,000 on the sand at one time) seemed empty for lack of CGI & modern day reservist extras, Nolan went cheap & only hired 500 weekend warriors plus a dozen vehicles from a local car club. The civilian boat flotilla numbered a half dozen borrowed from the London Maritime Museum , CGI was needed badly...I cant believe I wrote that! Also scenes kept repeating themselves,like the movie was stuck in a loop ( going cheap again using one day aerial footage) Two Spitfires against two Messerschmitt Bf 109's escorting a bomber trying to make a bomb run on a tugboat,trawler or small freighters must have been reused 3-4 times. A lone war museum Heinkel He 111 lining up like a pregnant fat duck seems rather suicidal even with Mr. Bean manning the ack- ack or is WW2 now in the mythology/fantasy realm & Nolan must not be critiqued while misusing the last flyable HE111...probably as not to tear off the wings doing fancy maneuvers & upping the price tag of this Turkey to $200 Million . Plus that annoying music to camouflage the reuse of the footage was pure trickery & was getting blatant in the middle,even the lone CGI of the Stuka dive bombing the pier was reused many times with the music blasting in the foreground ...the same with the overturning Grey tugboat & swimming extras. Nolan's soldiers seemed hauntingly bored & extremely selfish (Putting to much of today's persona in a movie is not a good thing) The somber cowardly Lion characterizations made the British retreating army an army of fools with the French soldiers looking on with grim contempt as the Brits throw them under the bus ( E.U blow-back propaganda even infects Dunkirk) The antiquated "Hold the Line!" isn't what one hears from today's metrosexual British males & it reflects badly in how one perceives history in today's age.The Brits at Dunkirk were climbing over each other backs to get out ...that is how I perceive Nolan's Crayola Kindergarten scribbles to be & not Churchill's heroic histrionics with his empire on the line. Now since WW2 is now a distant memory with half of millennial iPhone humping narcissistic dolts rather clueless about anything concerning reality of historical placement, the story/movie did an awful job of explaining Dunkirk in the grand scheme of things . How many movie goers later Googled Wikipedia 'WW2' for an explanation of the Battle of France? ... not many if I know my fellow citizens. Nolan could have exchanged the Spitfires & Messerschmitts with the Millennial Falcon & X-Wing fighters I doubt any of today's citizens would have noticed nor cared. The Germans (Nazis) were shadow figures & the explanation of why Hitler paused in pushing the Brits into the sea was brushed off like so much sand... Adolf was a cunning diplomatic in the first year of the war & Churchill didn't bite the Carrot while Adolf halted the tanks letting the Brits vacate without being massacred mercilessly while awaiting England come to terms(But that is politically incorrect to question motives or think outside what is acceptable .. now back to Star Wars sequel #9) In conclusion the movie left me empty just like the sands of Dunkirk & any residue interest in 'WW2' was latter replaced by me digging through the closet looking for a dusty VHS copy of "The Bridge to Far" & reminiscing /realizing how far Hollywood has sunk & now sucks.
1.0~No plot, lack of dialogue and character depth jackcooper-70002 Sign in Permalink From the start there is a lack of dialogue, you are thrown into action though which draws you in, however this soon fades and the action slows down and you are left wondering when the story itself is actually going to begin. Some say it's a beautiful film visually however as someone who knows a lot about WW2 and the scale of evacuation of Dunkirk it doesn't do it justice. Over 900 boats were used and both sides lost around 150 planes which is not portrayed well enough with a handful of ships and only 3 German and 3 English planes. I understand the director wanted to not use Cgi however without this I feel that the script, plot and character depth needs to be more engaging to keep the viewer interested. The subject matter of the film was the evacuation of Dunkirk, I would actually struggle to explain the plot/ storyline to somebody because it doesn't really have one. Overall I can see the director has tried to make a war film different from the rest, however for me this didn't work at all. Without an interesting plot, character depth or dialogue all you are left with are nice images which does not do enough for the viewer to really get a sense of emotion, and feel what the soldiers felt at the time.
4.0~Really? stcaudle-184-246708 Sign in Permalink I have to say I don't write very many reviews but this was so boring I felt the need. Critics who believe this is a great or even a good film must be under the influence of some mind altering chemicals that I obviously didn't have access to. The film drags along. I kept waiting for the great film I read about but it never happened. Everyone in the theater said the same thing. Don't waste your money or time. If you think you have to see this wait until you can rent it. You'll still get ripped off but at least you won't suffer the pain I had to.
3.0~I don't get the accolades. clancyohara Sign in Permalink Seems like this would have made a nice hour long PBS special but as a movie it was dull. The comparisons to Kubrick are blasphemous. This could have been a Transformers movie, another masturbatory exercise in special effects. We live in such an era of low expectations. No story here at all, just an excuse for reenactment of a noble part of a war. That's it. Nothing to see here. I was so disappointed.
3.0~I am Embarrassed for Nolan! tonyhaines-spp Sign in Permalink We saw Dunkirk on opening night, I was excited, I'm a huge WW2 buff. The incredible human drama at Dunkirk has mostly been overlooked by Hollywood. So July 20 has been on my calendar for a while. Boy did I fall for the hype! I must say something positive first... great war footage! I loved the spitfires! Knowing that Nolan shot this move with only a few post effects is impressive. The scenes inside the ships were fantastic. Now, onto the sad truth as I see it. I wish the producers would have spent some of the $150 million on a script. I didn't know you could shoot a historical period movie with a steep budget and not have one. It's as if this was just a big historical re-enactment of the Dunkirk rescue and the film crew said, hey, we should grab a couple of decent actors and throw some cheesy lines at them, we'll make a movie! There was an old-timer from the business that once told me, "if you've got a great story you can shoot your movie thru banjo strings on black & white film". I got the impression that Nolan was hell-bent on shooting realistic war footage and he fell in love with those shots and scenes, forgetting that the audience would appreciate a plot. There are so many interesting plot twists from the actual event. We never really saw anything from London, France or Germany where most of the strategy was planned. Nolan focused on the beachhead and the channel. The realism was quite good, but too long and confusing. The sound track had many problems too. The mix was hot, if you wanted to listen the sparse dialogue, good luck. For some reason the director chose to loop this maddening drone sequence throughout the movie. It was so obvious it had to be intentional. I was hoping the version we saw was just an advance copy with a rough mix, nope. One last thing, I'm not sure the average movie goer will appreciate the way Nolan repeated scenes. Apparently the footage was so good from 4 different angles we should show all of them, back to back. I get it, great film makers take chances. There have been many examples, especially in the indie- film world of masterpieces that tried risky new techniques, sadly, Dunkirk isn't one of them. To wrap this up... I'm glad I saw Dunkirk. I think most WW2 buffs will see it no matter what anybody says.
7.0~Do not buy the hype manuel-neves Sign in Permalink It is a bad sign if a movie tries to inject suspense with an overwhelming soundtrack. It means a weak script or weak acting performances. A lot of money was clearly spent here but the end result (the emotion level you receive) is only a bit more than average. While the structure of the script / editing is sort of original, the story itself and the characters are so so. It all feels a bit flat and cannot compare to war movie masterpieces such as Saving Private Ryan or Come and See which have seriously dramatic scenes, acting and emotions.
9.0~The event that shaped our world... awaisee50 Sign in Permalink Few directors have such a reputation that the release of their new film is an event and Christopher Nolan is one of those and Dunkirk is certainly an event. Based on what had the making of a military disaster the Allies are cornered on a beach in Dunkirk with the Germans drawing in and massive Allied casualties followed by the invasion of Britain almost inevitable. Initially focusing on one soldier, Fionn Whitehead, who joins the thousands of British troops trapped on the beach waiting to be evacuated the film opens out into three distinct areas, The Mule, essentially a pier where the massed troops wait to board naval ships overseen by Kenneth Branagh's naval commander , The Sea, which focuses on a small leisure boat captained by Mark Rylance and his two sons who cross the channel in their bid to help with the evacuation and The Air where spitfire pilot Tom Hardy and two other pilots attempt to shoot down various German Luftwaffe planes intent on bombing the rescue ships at sea as well as the troops on the shore line. Each story ties in with the other and Nolan's script cleverly shows the same moment from the three view points usually with a dilemma within each. It's a credit to the cast that despite the paucity of dialogue all are uniformly good. Fionn Whitehead is a unifying thread throughout the film as he lurches from one life threatening crisis to the next. Rylance & Brannagh are stoic & brave each aware of the desperate situation they are in and poor old Tom Hardy, much like Bane in 'The Dark Knight Returns', spends the film with his face covered by a pilots mask with only his eyes to convey the ever worsening situation he's facing. Even little pop moppet Harry Styles acquits himself well. Nolan handles all this brilliantly but what really takes this into another league is Hans Zimmer's music. Relentless, it compliments the action ratcheting up the tension to a nerve shredding crescendo. This is so brilliantly done that certainly the film feels like one long frighteningly real action scene albeit a true one. Nolan, together with Zimmer and his Editor Lee Smith, have put together one of the best Summer blockbusters this year made all the more extraordinary by having almost no dialogue but letting the pictures paint the scene. Shot in Imax 70mm its certainly worth seeing it this way as its immersive nature takes you headlong into the action which will have your heart beating as loud as anything in the film with its all too real explosions and its terrifying fighter plane engines screaming as they hone in on the exposed troops. If there's any justice at next years Oscars then Nolan, Zimmer and Lee should, at the very least, be nominated. This is an extraordinary film of a moment that was far from the military's finest hour and though the soldiers are the first to admit that, 'All we did was survive', it's a tremendously patriotic film about the courage, not just of the soldiers, but of the civilians who selflessly took their own boats across the channel to rescue thousands and thousands of troops. This is a testament to the courage of the few for the many and is sure to feature in many top ten end of year lists and rightly so.
8.0~"There's no hiding from this, son. We have a job to do." mkm-31183 Sign in Permalink Set in 1940, the story revives around a port called Dunkirk where approximately 400,000 soldiers of allied forces got stuck with no available escapes through the mainland and stay in the hope of a miracle of their survival by a probable evacuation. Director depicted the story from three different perspectives with three different time horizons that intersect each other eventually! Dunkirk merely a character driven film with their heroic tales as it never explains the background of any of its characters that much on how, why and from where they got stuck in a French port and their purposes rather portrays the fact of the survival of those 400,000 soldiers from their counterpart by the only means of evacuation. Nolan's Dunkirk remains as a visual treat with the best cinematographic experience and splendid sound design till date! It feels like you are in the actual situation! The movie hardly has any dialogues and might be the only of its genre where the background score never stops breathing and keeps the audience gripped in it spontaneously! It acts like the heart which keeps it alive. It's not an ordinary film that you watched and understood on a first go with the perplexed time horizons involved but the storytelling is pretty straightforward this time unlike Nolan's other films like Memento, Inception or Interstellar lately. Forget everything and stop expecting any of that sorts, if you have already watched Schindler's list, The pianist, Downfall, Saving Private Ryan or even recent release Hacksaw Ridge. Dunkirk hardly belongs to that genre. It's not a typical war film rather a survival film with almost no bloodshed!!! Director Christopher Nolan crafted the thought of making Dunkirk almost 25 years back. It's his most ambitious project till date and an apparent research paper with pure depiction of a wartime situation without revealing the plot!
10.0~Virtual reality sans the bane of headsets harshakick Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan. A captivating storyteller. Dunkirk, his brainchild, is the exaltation of directorial passion. Dunkirk is a poem. It has no heroics, no drama, no emotional flashbacks, even, no words for the most part, yet, immensely succeeds in conveying the entirety of it's message towards the end, to the already visually spellbound audience. When you watch Dunkirk, you are not a third person. You are the wounded soldier, you are the killing one too. You are the rescuer, you are the pilot in the spitfire. You are at war within yourself, torn between the happenings that occurred during the World War's infamous evacuation. Adding to the visual treat it is, the sound shall have no less of a mention either. There has not been a better score for a war movie to date. The simple sound has regained the throne it's once lost to the digital/techno music. The mood, context and above everything, what comes next has been so craftily elevated with the score, thanks to Mr. Zimmer. Right from the opening shot, you are there. You hear the battle as a soldier does. You endure the explosions just as they do. No movie-goer is eligible to critique this work of mastered art. One can however, only enjoy the experience.
10.0~A suspenseful movie with a lot of intensity. yaserali-27606 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has crafted a masterpiece with a lot of intensity and suspense with three stories that depict the real life events of the Dunkirk evacuation. With a beautiful and spectacular music score from Hans Zimmer makes the movie even Enjoyable to watch and with Nolan's direction makes the movie intense and eccentric. The actors are brilliant especially Harry Styles who was incredible in the film, Fionn Whitehead, Tom Hardy and all the other actors who made the movie feel intense as possible. I do think that Christopher Nolan may get the Oscar nominee for Best Achievement in Directing as I think that he was the one that made this film intense and suspenseful as possible and that I do think that he deserves and If he does win then everything will start to make sense right. Watch this movie NOW!!! only in the Morning not in the afternoon there will be a lot of people waiting to see the movie in the afternoon.
4.0~Dunkirk Disappoints vigihawk Sign in Permalink Too much confusion due to swift cuts between drowning, crashing, and being blown up. No narrative line just two, three, (or are there five?) smaller tales. If you are expecting any historical value, forget it. Dunkirk may catch the mood of the evacuation with its confusion and frantic pace, but there are no explanations of the action. Oh, Branagh— being stoic and heroic—does try a few words about what's going on. Have to give the actors credit for spending a lot of time being very wet. Aerial sequences are good, but I'm soft about Spitfires. Problem is, airplanes keep appearing when you thought they had crashed a couple of scenes before. Have not yet checked on actual air combat at Dieppe, but willing to bet it was not as much as in the flik. Also featured are two very stupid pilots—you're supposed to open your canopy before crashing or ditching—and a Spitfire with engine-out glide characteristics better than a high performance sailplane. An expensive waste of effort.
2.0~Underwhelming and a total miss nponline-979-699546 Sign in Permalink I have no idea why, at the time of writing this, it has a score of 8,3? It is a really slow movie with no engaging factors at all. I have more fun watching the grass grow. They could have told the story of Dunkirk with passion and portray the horror of the event, but it was so uncommited and mellow that it did not do justice to it. Its like watching moving postcards trying to convey some sense of what was going on. This was this years biggest failure. I am amazed how they could fail to make a good movie about Dunkirk!
1.0~The worst movie of 2017 donnyrosso-156-515253 Sign in Permalink I went to the cinema with good expectations. A great war movie.. Well.. It's wasn't great, and it wasn't a war movie.. 400.000 men it said on the poster, if I would count there were at most a 1000. Surrounded by Germans it said, maybe it was at the time I went to the toilet but no Germans seen here.. After 1 hour I really wanted to get out of the cinema, but I was not alone so eventually I stayed for the whole (too long) 1:45.. Don't go and pay money for this, if you really want to see it despite the awfulness this movie is, watch it on Netflix and buy a lot of beer to drink the story through..
9.0~Exhausting Molongirl Sign in Permalink I found myself with fists clutched holding my breath and by the end of the film totally exhausted, that's what a great job Nolan has done of immersing the viewer in the experience of Dunkirk. Partly this has been achieved by the music which was so stress inducing, having an almost "nails scraped down a board" effect. I was telling some elderly residents of a care centre today about the movie and one Scottish lady told us her father had died at Dunkirk and one of his friends carried his body all the way back home to Scotland. That spirit of courage is captured so well in this telling of the tale. The captain of the small boat who wouldn't turn back, the Spitfire pilot who kept on fighting knowing he was running out of fuel and the soldiers who queued, just waiting and waiting. The opposite side is also presented and I'm sure we all fear we may be the one willing to push someone out of the boat to save our own skins. I enjoyed the way Nolan looks at so many different aspects of this incredible story. My one wish is that the film would have cut away to the wonderful sight of people streaming in to churches across the nation in response to King George's request for a national day of prayer. Google "National time of prayer at the time of Dunkirk 1940" and have a read about this aspect that is missing from the movie. But well done everyone involved in this excellent movie.
10.0~Great Survival Story! jamesbigham Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a amazing movie, with great acting, an amazing score, and astonishing sound effects! Fionn Whitehead delivers a amazing although almost wordless performance. That an actor could portray so much emotion without speaking is simply dumbfounding. This movie has a way of drawing you in, and you lose yourself in the story! I couldn't believe that it was only 106 minutes.
7.0~Good but not lived up to expectations. tabraiz-abbas Sign in Permalink The camera work in the film was very good. But I expected a lot from Christopher Nolan. The X factor of Nolan's movies was missing. Usually there is plenty of suspense in his movies but not in Dunkirk. The acting in this movie from everyone was commendable. Movie was good but did not live up to expectations.
6.0~Dunkirk will age really badly. shvmsharma Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan out of depth and in uncharted waters. It's a movie that wants very hard to be great. Where characters talk in monosyllables and look meaningfully at each other or in the distance expecting the viewer to be with them in their moment. Going by the majority of the reviews, this British war survival story has been bought by a lot. I was sitting in the theater waiting for that moment of redemption in the movie that never really came. Critics, it seems have seen the movie and adapted their tastes to like it and find deeper meaning (as critics often do) in perhaps the most straightforward story line made interesting only because of the non-linear editing tropes which Nolan otherwise uses well in his other movies to some purpose. Here it becomes too much of a gimmick and some extremely non moving and non interesting events are made to seem more than what they are. What remains of Dunkirk is an aural and visual spectacle that falls squarely flat by the time the last of the British is rescued. The movie has multiple endings and at such a short run time, the ending can't come fast enough. Nolan has admittedly taken off from multiple movies before he made Dunkirk and his effort is different in the way it has such less impact even after bombarding the viewer with bullets, bombs and an overpowering Hans Zimmer soundtrack. Hoyte Van Hoytema is a brilliant cinematographer. The Spitfire is a brilliant machine (as mentioned by Nolan in many interviews and expressed by one of the characters in the movie.) The aerial photography is like no other you may have seen. But all of this amounts to nothing. The spitfire maybe a brilliant machine and Hoytema may have taken brilliant shots but the story line flounders away in the air somewhere. Tom Hardy can't see the plane clearly and after the 10th shot of the same plane meandering here and there you realize the war can be really tedious and boring without that pounding Hans Zimmer soundtrack at the background. Thanks Christopher Nolan for putting me right in the middle of the war with such lovely heart pounding score, because frankly the screenplay isn't your best bet here and you know it. I'll go on here and speculate now because I'm a fan of the man and want to. The man who doesn't seem to falter even when he makes a movie like The Dark Knight Rises as he infuses a lot of commentary and brilliance in the weakest of plots. Christopher Nolan has a very visible Stanley Kubrick hangover. He has a picture of Kubrick's chair in his office, he swears by Kubrick's brilliance and if you try and see there are quite a few similarities in the filmography of the British compatriots (Dunkirk being his Paths of Glory). Wanting to be the greatest and most complete filmmaker is the noblest of ambitions but wanting to be like someone else may not be. Before Dunkirk, he was a man who would blow your minds off with a plot twister like Memento or The Prestige, a mind bender like Inception or Following or his villains would have the most memorable roles like The Joker. Dunkirk is Nolan's 'war movie'. Every great director generally ends up making one and wants to make the greatest one. (No one comes close to the Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now yet, IMO) Dunkirk makes me believe in Christopher Nolan the human director. This guy wanted to make his war movie and when I see it, this was a movie the world would be better off without. In these times of war and international strife, the movie shows you some of the horrors of the war while squarely glamorizing many aspects of it ("The Spitfire with the Rolls Royce engine is the greatest machine ever built." Says the old guy to his Son in the movie.) I have read many Nolan interviews to find out what this important artist who wields great artistic influence the World over, thinks about what's happening in the World. His world views are unfortunately not much available in the interviews and going by Dunkirk, a patriotism filled British epic lauded by all the British and the colonial powers the world over, it's quite unfortunate that this is the movie we have to live with as the Best reviewed movie of the year. One watch is enough to tell you the movie is average at best and I can't make myself believe it's greater than it really is when it's squarely a technical achievement. Christopher Nolan is at the zenith right now as Dunkirk becomes his best reviewed film and may of course get an Oscar or two thanks to the technical brilliance. It remains his most manipulative and weakest story. A very flimsy plot made watchable thanks to the score and the camera. Dunkirk would age really badly and few years from now, may not even be considered in his best movies.
10.0~A masterpiece madinehfeysali Sign in Permalink Best war movie of all time a masterpiece by Mr Nolan. The movie that you never seen like it before.... Amazing You can see new standards of filming, using cameras, using IMAX technology and exciting. I wanna see it too many times more. Unfortunately movie released limited in Iran and we hardly can see it but if you rate a movie 10/10 you should try. DUNKIRK
1.0~One of the worst war movies in recent years. marc-1025 Sign in Permalink It's amazing how people can watch the same film and see something completely different. I honestly thought it was the worst film I've seen in recent years. Almost criminal. I was left cold because of the lack of emotion, basic character development, backstory, sense of urgency, sense of threat or any story, original or historical. Also outraged because of it's misrepresentation of the events. It was almost like they decided to take away all of the actual amazing historical story and make an abstract minimalist art film about an inconvenient single journey boat trip. I can just see them in the board room when the plot was pitched. Exec: "but isn't it meant to be a film based on actual extraordinary events in a real war? Nolan: "Yes sort of." Exec: "but there are just three planes and 3 boats? And people standing in queues for 2 hours? No action at all? No enemy?" Nolan "there are a couple of enemy planes sir, and we'll repeat the same dogfight 3 times. Oh and a boy falls down some steps and bangs his head." I agree with veteran signaller Alfred Baldwin, who was at Dunkirk in 1940, - "You had the impression of people standing waiting for a bus." It's actually upsetting me just thinking about it again. I thought it was a disgrace. I have over 300 war films in my collection. I won't let Dunkirk anywhere near it.
1.0~I've Enjoyed Infomercials More csphilson Sign in Permalink I only lasted 35 minutes into this DVD. This includes lengthy previews. I looked up reviews as I watched and they echoed what I was seeing in this poorly told historical drama. No characters, limited dialogue ( like soldiers don't talk or wave at passing ships!). I've fought this battle in video games that had more heart. Sad.
10.0~A visual,immersive and emotional experience not to be missed shayor Sign in Permalink Don't listen to the people who are kinda overwhelmed by the huge wave of positive response and feel the need to nitpick this movie.This movie is like Radiohead's Kid A,where we finally see Nolan come into his own.A war movie with a concept that is mostly original which is absolutely rare in this modern day and age of movies.Every one is saying how this movie lacks emotion,when i was in the theater, a lot of people were in tears including me.Even if you do not like this movie,this is a visual experience like no other.But i agree,if you do a little bit of research about the battle and the importance of it beforehand,this movie will make you think about it for days and days.This movie puts you in the soldier's places,immerses you and horrifies you.This movie also shows you what sacrifice the soldiers made for you and me.This movie also reflects life itself kinda.This is a must see,no questions asked.
2.0~Disappointed skywalkr_00 Sign in Permalink This film is about how the British troops cowardly and shamefully fled the battlefield. This film is about how they threw their French allies when the Germans split them into two parts in France. There is nothing more disgraceful than running away from the battlefield! A movie about cowards, a movie about cowardice! However, like the whole history of Britain ..﻿. I wanted to like this movie because of NOLAN ,but i really can't.Hacksaw Ridge is the better war movie.
6.0~Overrated, but solid. lewisworrall-29167 Sign in Permalink A solid watchable film that doesn't really try to rewrite history. However it's emotionally vacuous and overrated.
5.0~Go and see it, than think about who writes reviews! vassago-original Sign in Permalink First of all, there is no fierce battle in this movie, there are some attacks at crowd of useless soldiers playing sitting ducks on the beach. Scenery is flawless, camera is great, last pilot is bad-ass, everything else is pretentious piece of rubbish. Who writes this amazing reviews or movies like this is beyond me, an I am huge fan of Nolan's movies. Music and atmosphere are all you are used to in his work, but there is no action, and many will fall asleep during this flick. Hugely overrated movie! 6 at it's best, and that is just because of camera work and pilot. I have literally never watched war movie this boring and god help us if we have 400 000 soldiers useless as these were.
6.0~World War II for millennials MacacoBanditi Sign in Permalink It has finally happened. A WWII movie for kids with the attention span of a lightning bolt, who couldn't care less for historical accuracy nor want to get emotionally involved in anything. A series of dizzying and nauseating POV shots strung together coupled with loud, bombastic music. No plot, no characters, no arc, no sense of purpose whatsoever. Not much in the way of dialogue, and most of it mumbled and inaudible due to the loud music. War as a video game experience? Here it is. Besides slightly nihilistic Nolan's take on the Dunkirk disaster stroke me as contradictory. 400,000 soldiers were stranded in Europe's longest sand beach, along with 500 tanks and thousands of vehicles and heavy weaponry. They were eventually evacuated by 933 ships, including 39 destroyers, suffering 68,000 casualties. The RAF flew almost 3,000 sorties and lost a whopping 106 planes. The Luftwaffe dropped 45,000 bombs on the city and harbour. I see two mutually exclusive ways of portraying this gargantuan military undertaking: full-on IMAX to capture the big picture or small-scale POV story to capture the human drama. For the former you would use long shots of panoramic vistas and intensive CGI to recreate the colossal numbers I just cited above. For the latter you would go gritty, hand-held camera, following a couple of soldiers through the whole ordeal. Nolan tried to have his cake and eat it too and did both - and failed at both. Refusing to use CGI, he hired 1,000 extras, managed to get hold of 3 Spitfires, an old Heinkel bomber, a couple of Me109s and Stukas and one destroyer. The massive flotilla of smaller vessels is depicted by something around 20-30 yachts and cruise ships. So much for the gargantuan aspect of the operation. As for the POV action, we follow a pilot, an amateur crew in a leisure craft and a couple of soldiers stranded at the beach. None has any back story and in fact, I can't even remember their names. So there's little if any character development and you fail to connect with them in any meaningful way that would involve emotionally investing in their plight. The factual mistakes in this movie are so many and so great that I won't even bother listing them here. Besides, Nolan has clearly jumped into the post-truth bandwagon so this is inconsequential. As many reviewers have pointed out "this is not a documentary" - Trump himself would endorse such a poignant rebuttal. Unfortunately once an actor or director has ventured into the world of superhero franchises, all possibility of objective and fair evaluation of their performance is lost. Forever. Fanatical praise and absolute contempt for constructive criticism will abound. Which is another hallmark of millennial thinking.
7.0~Dunkirk Gets Lost on the Beaches bkrauser-81-311064 Sign in Permalink There's no denying director Christopher Nolan has pretty much been crowned the torch-bearer for smart, contemporary, mainstream entertainment ever since The Dark Knight (2008). The fact that he backs up his visionary works with intelligently written screenplays and analog bonafides - such as real special-effects and shooting on film, only further engenders him to the minds of film aficionados. There's no denying he's one of us - a filmic omnivore and true believer in the power of the form who not only adores the trappings of his craft but is willing to subject his carefully crafted stories to obsession, scrutiny, and obsessive scrutiny a la constant fan theories. Thus saying Nolan's newest movie Dunkirk isn't all that and a bag of potato chips, actually hurts to say. Whatever misgivings anyone has had about Nolan - his characters lack emotion, his stories too heady, his pacing, so syncopated as to be robotic, have all come home to roost in this one. What's more, you can add loud, fractured, disorienting and at only 102 minutes, overlong to the list of complaints. Of course that may be part of the point. The evacuation of Dunkirk was, no doubt a fractured, loud and disorienting event for the over 450,000 soldiers who experienced it. The movie, re-cobbles the harrowing World War II military disaster from perspectives of land, sea and air; attempting to give the audience a fuller picture. The film opens with a nameless British soldier lining up on the beaches hoping for deliverance (Whitehead). We then jump to RAF pilots (Hardy and Lowden) providing what little air cover they can before tossing our hat in with Mark Rylance and his conscripted fishing trawler. In between these interweaving stories, we're reminded of the stakes by Commander Bolton (Branagh) who's exposition feels more like a godsend than a clunky add on. Yet even then Dunkirk can't help but feel like an ordeal. The non-linear storytelling (not just told from varying perspectives but also out of sequence) does little to immerse the audience into the film's claustrophobic settings. It doesn't draw attention or make comment like Rashomon (1950). It doesn't create the illusion of omniscience like in The Thin Red Line (1998). And it certainly doesn't get into the head space of the characters like in Slaughterhouse-Five (1972). It winds up forcing the viewer to continually update their context, using brainpower to figure out the time of day instead of caring about whether Tom Hardy is going to win his dogfight. Dunkirk does has a well received cousin in the form of A Bridge Too Far (1977), which similarly used fluid story dynamics and a large ensemble cast. In that regard Dunkirk improves on that formula by using mostly no-name and workmanlike character actors to do most of the heavy lifting. Yet A Bridge Too Far actually reached its climax. It did so through anticipation and dramatic irony. Dunkirk on the other hand starts at level eleven and stays there. This is turning into a much more negative review than is warranted. Dunkirk is still, for all its faults, a worthwhile movie. There are some masterful shots in this film, the immediacy of the situation is always clear and present and the utility of the IMAX format is on full display. If you don't believe me you can take the word of Christopher Nolan himself. Also while the score by Hans Zimmer is likely to be polarizing to some, I for one found it aptly encompassed what the movie was trying to achieve (even if it is too much of a good thing). Additionally the muted work of Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Cillian Murphy and the rest of the petrified soldiers is just excellent. With precious little dialogue and even less to differentiate themselves, these soldiers brilliantly capture the primal desperation and numbing exhaustion of the situation. Let it be said that out of all the sleek, heretofore unnecessary movie magic that Nolan employs, what saves this picture are the anonymous faces of horror who live or die based almost entirely on circumstance.
10.0~Dunkirk: Met a Genuine Dunkirk Veteran at my Screening! brankovranjkovic Sign in Permalink Before we talk about the film let me tell you about the cinema visit. At my screening were a group of elderly men from the Royal British Legion, who were setting up a table in the cinema foyer. Displayed were a framed set of medals, a small black n white photo of a young soldier and sat to one side a very old man in a smart grey suit... You're already ahead of me, the photo and the old man were the same person. I must have seemed curious enough to prompt a 'carer' to speak to me "Do you want to meet a genuine Dunkirk veteran?" Though not sure what to say I agreed, assuming that a hand-shake would suffice. But NO! The old boy was still bright as a button, his hand-shake was frail, his hand thin, bony, and gnarly. The veteran was about to see the film but I was still able to ask a few questions. "How old were you in the photo?". The answer was 20. "How old are you now?" The answer was 99. "Was the evacuation with small boats and dinghies exaggerated?" The reply "No, I was actually evacuated in a rowing boat". The veteran received a very well deserved standing ovation when the film ended. >> I just wanted to share that with you. Now back to the film review! This is an epic WW2 suspense thriller written and directed by Christopher Nolan. This is based on a pivotal wartime historical event, a survival story about the evacuation of 400,000 soldiers who were essentially 'sitting ducks' on the Dunkirk beaches. This film is all about the experience from three different perspectives, not the characters or their egos. If you want to see a film concerning character development then re-watch your 'Saving Private Ryan' DVD. What was particularly clever were the three interwoven plots very clearly depicting the situation through three parallel timelines. 1-The story in the Air (duration= 1 hour) Tom Hardy is featured as a Spitfire pilot. 2-The story in the Water (duration= 1 day) Mark Rylance is featured as a civilian boat captain. 3-The story on Land (duration= 1 week) Kenneth Branagh is a British Office co-ordinating the evacuation efforts and troops on the beach. The vast crowds of soldiers could have been any young men. It could have been me and you, and makes you wonder what you would have done. How you may have felt and reacted? Though there must have been some GCI, it was very difficult to identify! There was hardly any dialogue, but I'm convinced that this is how frightened individuals in hopeless situations would behave. This is a visually stunning, immersive, very large scale epic which left me emotionally exhausted. This film must be seen on the largest pin sharp screen available. I saw it on a standard screen at my local Cineworld and immediately re-booked to see again in 70mm IMAX. Very highly recommended.
7.0~Great spectacle- underwritten story gary-444 Sign in Permalink I am an enthusiastic amateur historian with a particular interest in World War Two. When I heard this film was being made I was both excited, and apprehensive. I was thrilled that one of the great military evacuations of history was coming to the screen, but worried about how the sheer scope of covering an exodus of around a third of a million troops, with the successful ending known, would be tackled. Early reviews praised the spectacle, but criticised the narrative. It is a very good looking film with plenty of panoramic sweeps giving it an epic feel. Director Christopher Nolan has produced a film with an authentic, defiant, heroic , tinge. Understandably, Nolan eschews trying to tell the whole story. There is no Goering, Rundstedt, Hitler, Churchill or Gort. Instead the story is told in three micro stories on the sea, land and air. This has advantages, and disadvantages. There is an intensity and visceral energy to the aerial dogfights, the plight of foot soldiers desperately trying to leave the beaches, only to find themselves torpedoed, and back on the beaches again, and hose manning the flotillas of small boats. However, those stories are vignettes, and not enough time is given to develop an emotional connection with the protagonists. The absence of input from the respective national and military leaders also fails to join the dots of individual heroism and tragedy. Thus the early praise and criticism is both justified. This is a fine looking film, spectacular, and compelling in its presentation. But the narrative, and characterisation, is weak, making it fall short as one of the great war films.
2.0~Total manure. walant Sign in Permalink "Dunkirk" was the worst film I have ever seen. The plot was incredibly ignorant , the aspects which helped that film were music and shots, but they were far from perfection. It was just so, so. It was really boring film; I will never watch it again. I think it was the worst use of my credits, in my life.
3.0~What a waste of film stock kimthurston2004-839-560726 Sign in Permalink For those of you who watched the movie but knew nothing about what took place at Dunkirk, you still don't. According to this movie this magnificent heroic event only consisted of a couple dozen boats, a couple of airplanes and a few hundred men. I think this was an insult to the thousands of civilian heroes manning the largest ever civilian flotilla rescue in history by ignoring that little item. I don't know what they were running from because the only Germans (other than a few planes) that we saw were a few at the end that seemed to come out of nowhere, kind of like the bullets being shot at everyone. There was so much drama and action and heroism that could have been shown, it could have made a dozen movies. This is obviously what happens when a young person decides to do a film of an historical event by leaving out the historical patriotism and heroics that made the event what it was at the time. If you are in a certain age range you don't have the ability to feel or be sympathetic to the patriotism and sacrifice that went with the people that lived through world war II. The current war battles that younger people would be exposed to are nothing compared to what soldiers AND civilians lived through during that time. The "young" director/writer is unable to relate to that so decides to forget about it to shoot something he can relate to, survival. I hoped for a whole lot more from this film but was left terribly disappointed at the obvious lack of historical fact and drama that actually took place at Dunkirk in favor of the "single man" viewpoint that a "young" director could comprehend.
8.0~A Tense Film That Is Hardly the Average Summer Blockbuster trublu215 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk marks Christopher Nolan's return to cinema and it is as bombastic as one would hope. Featuring a fractured sense of story telling, a shockingly great performance from Harry Styles and some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever witnessed, Dunkirk is without a doubt one of the most solid summer blockbusters in recent memory. Despite all that is perfect with the film, it does suffer from some glaring storytelling issues that, while many may enjoy, I found to be unnecessarily tedious. While many of you will probably hate on me for saying this, I simply have to say it: Christopher Nolan is overrated. There is no other way about it. The man has given us classics but flawed classics, at best. However, Dunkirk is a perfect response to my feelings towards Nolan. The film is extremely fast paced which is something that plagued Nolan since Batman Begins. Here, he is restrained and it pays off quite beautifully especially when you factor in the brilliance that is Hoyte Van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography. The film is big and Hoytema's determination is shown through every frame. He is dedicated to capturing beauty and here is no different. Hoytema serves as a very suitable replacement for Wally Pfister. The film, while being 106 minutes long and probably Nolan's most accessible feature to date, also is very scarce when it comes to dialog and general character development. There are very few characters here that will have you standing and cheering for. I mean, you're going to cheer at moments in the film. It is geared to do just that. But it won't have you gravitating towards Styles, Rylance, Hardy or Murphy. Quite frankly, they all have (with the exception of Styles) minimal screen time. Those looking for a Tom Hardy war movie better think again. This isn't about one soldier, it is about all of the soldiers. No one is more important than the other. Overall, Dunkirk is an exceptional addition to Nolan's impressive filmography. Crafting a unique war film that doesn't rely on overtly patriotic moments to move it forward is hard yet Nolan makes it seem effortless. The film relies on the courage and sheer will power of the human soul and that is something only the rarest of war films can do. Despite some wonky story telling, Dunkirk is nonetheless exhilarating and should absolutely be seen on the big screen.
9.0~Solid war film kimura-toyo Sign in Permalink This was not my favorite Christopher Nolan film (that honor goes to Interstellar), but it was a solid movie nonetheless. The movie has a very tense and raw feel to it that made my adrenaline rush throughout. The dialogue is far and few between and there are 3 plots that are intertwined – the land, the sea, and the air. The most entertaining to me was the air. At the end of the movie, I felt the underlying theme that Nolan was portraying was that of "sacrifice," and how heroism (and cowardice) can come out even in the best of us in times of struggle and hopelessness. Hans Zimmer produced a wonderful score we have become accustomed to. He utilized the "shepherd's tone" perfectly to build up the gravity of each scene when appropriate. Christopher Nolan once again shows his versatility and ambition in taking on a challenging genre and does an excellent job of formulating a cinematic experience to his own style and pace.
7.0~An unforgettable experience. pegulacole Sign in Permalink This is not a film. This is not a story. This is an experience. See this film at your loudest, largest theater. Nolan's next masterpiece immerses you into an intense war-zone experience with incredible visuals and directing. Unlike most conventional films, Dunkirk does not focus on the characters and their backstory, it has no time for that. War has no time for that. Instead it focuses on one thing and one thing only; escape. Every moment of this experience has you on the edge of your seat, cringing, biting your nails, all because of the intensity of the score alone. I enjoyed every single second of Dunkirk because it forced me to. There was no part I found boring. I truly felt that I was trying to escape from Dunkirk myself. I can't say that about any other film I've seen.
2.0~Very poorly directed wr-72265 Sign in Permalink 1. The moron who put in "music" noise blasting out the voices of the actors should be fired. 2. There was NO information about the date, the way that the British got into such a mess, why the Germans stopped to regroup, who was left manning the rear guard, why the British Navy and the RAF were such incompetents, the total number of soldiers lost and saved. In short, a very poorly story put together except for a few realistic scenes of men being lost to enemy attacks on their boats and ships.
6.0~A Technically Interesting Failure JackCerf Sign in Permalink Saw it this weekend and thought it clever and well done but ultimately uninvolving despite the high level of tension it keeps up. I think it was overpraised by critics who admire Nolan as a technician, and I'd give it no more than a 6/10. It was interesting to see how Nolan converged the three time lines on a single point, but the dynamic in each timeline was very different. The one hour RAF timeline with Tom Hardy was pure action. Hardy's character makes two moral decisions, one quite unexpected, but you have to pay close attention to see them. Since I get chills whenever I see footage of a Spitfire, which Mark Rylance's character rightly calls the most beautiful airplane ever built, I was fully involved, but this action sequence didn't have the weight to carry one third of the movie. See Messerschmitt, dodge Messerschmitt, shoot Messerschmitt, da capo al fine. The most conventional segment, with the most character realization, was the one day timeline with Mark Rylance as a civilian pleasure boat owner displaying middle class stiff upper lip. His reasons aren't fully disclosed until the end, and there's a coda that, in the light of hindsight, gives you the difference between what happened and how it was reported and passed into memory. More I can't disclose without a spoiler. The one week timeline involving the troops on the beach is a failure. There simply wasn't enough social interaction among the men for the audience to relate to them as individuals or to their experience. Inarticulate fear will only take you so far, and that's all Nolan had to offer with the squaddies. It would have been more effective if "Tommy," whose name we never hear, were part of a small unit instead of a lone straggler-fugitive trying to attach himself to others. Then there might have been some grumbling, some mordant humor, some defeatism, or some other character developing conversation among people who already knew and trusted one another. Not here. Kenneth Branagh's character was a very heavy-handed Basil Exposition and nothing more. Nolan uses him to give a data dump and then ignores him till the next data dump is needed to orient the audience. Apparently Nolan finds the prospect of drowning while trapped under water to be particularly horrifying. He returns to that situation several times, in different settings and from different viewpoints. This contrasts with the complete absence of realistic wounds from the bombing; in that respect, the picture is as sanitized as a 1950s war movie. There are a few good throwaway lines. One that sticks in the mind is that as Tommy makes his way through a French barricade towards the beach, one of the French soldiers mordantly wishes him bon voyage.
7.0~A disappointing example of bad pacing darioilg Sign in Permalink I would never had thought that Christopher Nolan, the man that created some of my most beloved films as a young cinema goer, would film such an unusually bad paced film and I'm starting to think that all the fuzz about it comes from the natural instinct of patriotism it evokes rather than actual technical prowess. Sure, the film is beautifully shot, but it's a shallow beauty. There are so many films that show the horror of war and coming to face one's own mortality to the point of giving anything to "go back home": "Saving Private Ryan" and "Full Metal Jacket" come to mind. Both films are wisely divided into tense and relaxing scenes, so that the tension is shared by the public when it comes on screen. In "Dunkirk", the whole movie is a tension scene, which completely cancels any reason to feel tension after the first few dangerous situations our heroes find themselves in. And let's talk about these "heroes". It rarely happened to me to find a movie so crowded with useless talent: none of the characters mean anything to the overall story, they are sketches of the valiant, the mean, the wise, etc. and we have no time whatsoever to indulge in more intimate moments with them. This was definitely a conscious decision by Nolan, so that he could convey the feeling of telling the story of all 400.000 men and not only Harry Styles's, but if I don't feel anything for the few we actually get to know, then all 400.000 are misrepresented. Not to mention the only relevant death (which I won't spoil): it clearly just happens for some emotive involvement between such arid scenes, but it looks so artificial, so useless and stupid that it really makes you chuckle. One of the worst aspects of the film is the music, by Hans Zimmer. I would say by previous Hans Zimmer tunes, considering how any part of this score could have come from "The Dark Knight" or "Inception" and no-one would've noticed. Apart from its repetitiveness from other films, it's repetitive in itself: just like the endless action and danger, Zimmer's music is always tense, always on a high-alert tone, resulting in pure nothingness. Last, the week/day/hour narrative device. Nolan clearly needed something original to tell such an ultimately dull story so he and his team conceived this utterly useless idea. Throughout the film there is not a single time I thought "Wow, now I see why he organized the story this way!" and that is because it serves no purpose other than to give the feeling of an edgy, nolanesque feature. For reference, consider "Memento", Nolan's debut; there the complex narrative pattern makes complete sense and is functional -nay, essential- to the end result of the story. In "Dunkirk" this temporal distortion is completely useless: the film could've followed a more regular pattern without suffering anything on the narrative side. I consider this the worst film Nolan has ever made, and I feel very disappointed knowing his potential.
3.0~really crap thewonderofglass Sign in Permalink If you take a novel tear out all the pages cast them to the wind , then read them in the order you pick them up, its like this film, its bright daylight halfway across the channel, pitch dark in Dunkirk, a spitfire that runs out of fuel takes approx. 22 hours to glide onto the beach. the same plane saw the fishing boats leave Dunkirk but landed after they arrived in Dorset ' with no fuel ' . there are so many impossible story lines its a joke. ' I should point out my uncle was at Dunkirk, I have heard the truth!!!
3.0~Unbelievable disappointing and overrated! ramin-rahimnia Sign in Permalink It was the most overrated movie I have ever seen. It was a waste of time, and I am so disappointed in Nolan.
3.0~Not for me philchallis-28808 Sign in Permalink All these Nolanistas who rave about this film have no idea. There is no way in which this film brought the horrors of Dunkirk to the viewer - neither visual, sound nor emotions seemed to reflect reality. This is not artistic nor historically accurate - why does this film exist
2.0~I - or rather everybody - needs Nolan's marketing team! feritciva Sign in Permalink C. Nolan is really interesting person. He is a living proof that in today's movie industry all you need is an excellent marketing team who is highly capable of making hypes around extremely boring & mediocre films. If you also have a good visual director, then you're a hit. Dark Knight trilogy had only Joker as worth remembering (in 3 films). Interstellar was one of the worst sci-fi movies ever made - seriously people, there was no imagination, no creativity, no depth in it. And Dunkirk - as I expected - is a loooong & seriously boring war movie with endless poses, endless scenes, really boring characters etc.etc... And there's one very interesting common point in all above movies; seriously annoying music & sound use. Is it on purpose? Most certainly. Is it a kind of mind control that make people think "oh my god, if Nolan did it, then it is a masterpiece?". Maybe. Sigh.. In today's world all of us - whether we do our own business or work for some companies - need such a capable & skilled marketing team. Image is everything. Creativity? Authenticity? Depth? Bah! Nobody asks for these, it seems!
10.0~Christopher Nolan reaches yet another new high with this brilliant movie, markgorman Sign in Permalink In a movie that entirely engulfs you it's rather unusual that the acting performances are almost unimportant. Yes, Mark Rylance, as ever, puts no foot wrong but this is not a movie about acting. This is a movie about visceral experience. This is a movie about paying double the price to experience it in an iMax. Pay it man. Christopher Nolan does not do anything less than 8.0 IMDb movies. His class is overwhelming. Interstellar blew me away with its imagination but this is a step up even again. And one of the reasons for that is his relationship with Hams Zimmer. This movie's extraordaryness starts with the music which feeds off the utterly spectacular sound design by ( Help me I can't find it on IMDb) xxx. You are overwhelmed by the sound from frame 1. Remember Saving Private Ryan? Remember how you winced in your cinema seat. That was the sound. Now square that. Hell, no. Cube it. Now, think how Saving Private Ryan Looked. Think about how you squirmed in your seat. Cube that too. Now, think how after the first 20 minutes (if we are all honest her) it got a bit dull. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH CHRISTOPHER NOLAN. Christopher Nolan is the gift that just keeps giving. This movie gives and gives and then gives a little more. Costume, photography, sound, SFX (not much in CGI if anything) are all awesome. This is an actual masterpiece. I think it will min multiple Oscars, including best movie and director, with the rare distinction of no acting medals. (I hereby predict 10 Oscars.) It's a straight 10/10.
4.0~Is the IMDb rating ''8.2'' manipulated? s-buckard Sign in Permalink First of all this is one of the most disappointing movies of 2017, I really do not understand why this movie has an IMDb rating of 8.1, also because almost all comments are rating below 3. Second of all the story of this movie and the way they shown it is truly terrible. Back to the IMDb rating 8.1, is this movie really comparable with movies like: Hacksaw Ridge, 12 years a slave, Into the Wild, Shutter Island, No Country for Old men??? Just NO WAY.
10.0~This movie is about SURVIVAL. Stop analyzing it. JUST ENJOY A MASTERPIECE. ardelean-60763 Sign in Permalink I rarely write reviews about movies. I love movies, I just don't have the time. I think I am pretty entitled to discuss movies as I've seen more than one thousand movies. From Schwarzenegger flicks to Tarantino to Gone with the Wind to obscure Korean, Japanese or European movies. I just love movies. Enough intro. The reason I decide to write is because a lot of people comment on this movie's lack of character development or historical inaccuracies. Although, from an historical point of view, I think this is one of the more accurate ones. Anyway, I just feel that sometimes people are just complete haters, are bored or are so disgusted with themselves that they need to throw stones to anything that doesn't resonate with their particular tastes. Dunkirk is a masterpiece. It's not meant to develop stories or show guts on a beach or make us feel better with a heroic happy ending. It's a movie about survival. Just that. No one will tell the story of their life when they run for their life, unless you're in a Spielberg movies. Everyone wants to live for another day. Cornered animals are either fighting or trying to escape. At Dunkirk the soldier had no one to fight. The Germans attacked from the sky. Yes, there was no guts flying around, it's PG13, but to be honest, if you enjoy seeing guts on screen, you're probably sick. I cannot call it art. Let's say some directors like this realism, which I don't mind, but I don't miss either. Finally, there's no heroic happy ending. Dunkirk was in 1940, the beginning of the war. No one knew what they were dealing with and the film shows that. This became my favorite movie after I saw it in IMAX 70MM. It's an amazing piece of cinema. It kept me engaged, kept everyone around me on the edge of their seat, almost cheering during certain scenes or crying during others. The music just blends with the images. It's just glorious. Why it's my favorite movie? After more than one thousand movies, this movie stayed with me and I wanted to see it again, one week after. That never happened before. It's a beautiful movie and if people would stop trying to have this negative vibe, would see the beauty of it.
10.0~Dunkirk is a emphatic war film with great visuals. joshuac-11001 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a captivating and completely immersive from start to end. Out of any of the movies that I have seen this year this movie really peaked my interest because of the unique choices made by the production team (eg; hiring actors that are essentially no names). This film has a great visual style that is intense yet methodical which is complemented very well by the masterful directing by Christopher Nolan. In conclusion Dunkirk is an experience like no other movie that has come out this year so far. Highly recommend it to any type of audience.
10.0~An Absolute Masterpiece tanmaybhore Sign in Permalink Masterpiece! Brilliant Screenplay. An intense story line which keeps you on the tip of your toes. Amazing use of music and sound effects. Hans Zimmer is surely winning the Oscar this year. The most realistic depiction of war. This one will send chills down your spine. A must watch!!
1.0~Saving Private Ryan it's not! tkelly1414 Sign in Permalink It's amazing how hype, a vastly overrated reputation, and a jackhammer sound score can mesmerize some naive souls into believing this wretched exercise is some kind of masterpiece of avant-garde filmmaking. If Saving Private Ryan rates A+, Dunkirk rates a D–. The stage is set with a clumsy repetition of introductory titles (rather than briefly showing the lead-up to Dunkirk) before jumping into one of the main "character's" retreat to the beaches. I say "character" because, like the others, this guy is a cipher — there is ZERO characterization in this film. All are about wooden as the masts on the private yachts — might as well be animatron mannequins populating a haphazard stitching of action sequences devoid of any narrative structure (avant-garde or otherwise). Any halfwit with a budget and some CGI can stage engrossing battle scenes these days, but Nolan's random montage generates no real suspense — this is masked over with a relentless, buzzsaw sound score designed to get your blood up and compensate for the film's glaring faults — it doesn't, unless you're a Brave New World drone conditioned by the Feelies. Implausible motivation: the shell-shocked soldier rescued by the private yacht revolts against going to Dunkirk, actually killing one of the young crewmembers and then we cut to yet another redundant Spitfire/Heinkel/Messerschmitt engagement. Back on the yacht, what has happened? Has the mutinous soldier commandered the yacht? Are the captain and his son outraged by the murder? NO! There's nothing here — no requisite emotion, no resolution to this "drama," nothing but close-ups of deadpan faces, another problem with this turkey — like the old 70mm epics (How the West Was Won), IMAX is not the medium for close-ups, yet Nolan gives an over abundance of 100-meter ECUs! And what little dialogue exists in the film is lame, mumbled and almost unintelligible. Perhaps worst of all is how he bungled the dramatic rescue by a flotilla of private boaters — the core of this story. We could have had Churchill's appeal, the humble yeomen assembling on the docks with a mixture of trepidation and courage — instead, the boats suddenly appear all at once, deus ex machina, at the beaches, with no depiction of the rescue at all. I suffered through Dark Knight Rises and the 3-hour torture fest Interstellar (the most "intelligent sci-fi film since 2001: Space Odyssey" NOT!), and I will never endure another Nolan mish-mash again! They say he began making films at age 7 — he is still a callow, indulgent juvenile with a camera, big bucks and dismal mastery of cinematic art. I pity the poor souls who misconstrue his efforts as some kind daring Orson Wells/Maya Derren innovation, but there's no accounting for masochism.
10.0~Amazing, worth watching alexandruabagiu Sign in Permalink Extremely good movie. Watched it last night and it was better than I expected. Full of great scenes and amazing screenplay.This was by far the best movie i've seen in the past decade. Moreover, it's probably in my top 3 great history movies. I would recommend you all watching this movie, a piece of art.
1.0~I wonder what movie people saw... roykruger-137-664136 Sign in Permalink ...when rating this a 10 but it cant be THIS movie. Visually its a good movie, though all, of the few existing, planes do not catch up in fire and just have fly-show white smoke turned on when hit...and overall the flight scenes are not really dramatic. And this brings me to the ...how shall i call it...."music"? the entire film is woven in a disturbing audio background which could be from a alien - sci fi film announcing the creature coming out of the dark...which would take a couple of seconds but in this movie its running from start to end. The whole "soundtrack" of this movie surely will not be sold as a CD like other many movie-soundtrack did because its NOT music and the mood it catches doesn't fit to 80% of the film, not even when they switch from one scene to another the "music" keeps its disturbing perpetual loop... Some scenes are quite good and dramatic and no music would have fit better than this. Then the historical catch up fails big time. As far as i know Dunkirk was a massacre for THOUSANDS of trapped soldiers and the movie fails to deliver this by just having a bunch of soldiers hanging around the beach. I could go deeper and point out how bad the acting was in many cases and other stuff but i only came here to down rate this piece of boredom because it is far far away from being a "masterpiece" or a ten, not even a eight or seven. Maybe a five but seriously, i rather observe plants growing in the open than watching this kind of "production" in a 3d cinema...
7.0~Maybe 7,5/10 but not more kdimitrisfe Sign in Permalink I love Christofer Nolan. Great director. Great movies. No doubt about that. But unfortunately I think the movie was boring. It had awesome fight scenes, with different camera angles, music, costumes but it did not keep you at the edge of your seat like his other movies. Almost no dialogue. You can say that it is realistic, because it is a war scene but the viewer needs to know something about the characters in order to identify with them. I felt like I was watching on youtube different war scenes in a 2 hours movie. It did not create the suspense I was hoping.
1.0~One of the worst films I've seen mcintosh_natalie Sign in Permalink Clunky dialogue. A waste of talented A list actors. Unremitting musical score. Was this made for 12-year-old Americans? Please do not waste your money going to see this drivel. The cast must have winced at some of the local rep lines they had to deal with. A classic example of hype over substance. My uncle was one of the last off the beach at Dunkirk and would be turning in his grave if he saw this squalid attempt. Rylance in particular has to question his choice of role. Nolan obviously paid top dollar to secure him, Hardy and the wooden Branagh. Total, fatuous bilge.
1.0~See Mrs. Miniver instead. cook-gareth Sign in Permalink Sadly, a very disappointing film that I was eagerly looking forward to seeing, particularly as my father went across on one of the "little ships". There is very little character development allowed by the truncated script. It doesn't really matter because most of the dialogue is incomprehensible anyway thanks mainly to the incessant, overblown Hans Zimmer score. And I usually enjoy his work. Too many glaring goofs to mention. Sadly, all around very disappointing.
6.0~Good, but not great B RUBBLE Sign in Permalink Perhaps the greatest human evacuation of all time when considering the amount of soldiers and sailors saved and the adverse conditions, this movie handles the story fairly well. It is a good movie, but not great. It is interesting and shows what conditions were like for some of the combatants/evacuees. This rescue saved so many soldiers who were able to return to battle later in the war it is remarkable, because the Nazis had superior equipment and manpower at the time. It did not show enough of the rear guard protecting the evacuation by stalling the Nazi drive long enough for the flotilla of boats to save so many people.
4.0~The Most Hyped And Disappointing Film Of Recent Times? woodaqualung Sign in Permalink I came to this expecting to see a masterpiece,as trumpeted by various critical writings and Kermode on the B.B.C..It's not.It started off well but once the central character,at least from the point of view of the British Army, reaches the beach it goes down hill.There is zero character development which results in myself,for one, having no particular investment in any of the characters.The Army personnel featured are universally a bunch of wasters,which is not the case for the majority who maintained their discipline and espirit de corps(read any of the numerous written works on the subject(or download them to your tablet if holding a real book is too tiring).The R.A.F. sequences are a bit better until the end where the Tom Hardy denoument is laughably bad.You might accept this junk in a comic book(sorry,graphic novel) adaptation but not when you're depicting what a real life piece of equipment can do.Can't say more without a spoiler,but anyone over 40 who knows anything about real aircraft will get my meaning. Finally,I would have preferred C.G.I. for the Royal Navy sequences but what we get is a couple of modern R.N. ships bedecked with painted plywood disguises for the superstructure-really laughably bad,although the small boat sequence with Mark Rylance did have some dramatic affect.I could have done without the rather pointless Cillian Murphy character . In short the film is a computer game with some real people shoehorned in for the Playstation generation..Don't get sucked into spending a fortune to see it.Wait until the DVD comes out,watch it and then give it to the local charity shop.Watch the 1958 telling of the story with John Mills and Richard Attenborough in which you do have empathy for the lads in the platoon and for Bernard Lee,Attenborough and their crew,unless of course black and white films hurt your delicate little eyes..For a more detailed account of the rescue there is an excellent 3 part mini series Docudrama which is really worth seeing.
9.0~Don't miss this one Laakbaar Sign in Permalink So far, over 80% of the people who have rated this movie have given it and 8, 9 or 10. Deservedly so. This is an excellent movie that successfully shows first hand and close up what Dunkirk must have been like for those on the ground, in the air and on the sea. I don't want to gush too much about it, but the realism and cinematographic artistry are superb. This is a story of survival, after all, but it is a story that is so well told that it feels like time travel. I've seen so many movies about the 2nd WW during my life that I tend to avoid them now. But this one is different. It worked for me from beginning to end. I'm glad I saw this movie in an IMAX theatre with a great sound system because it really enhanced the experience. The sounds were visceral, more so than in any movie I've ever been in. So this is what it feels like to have a bullet crack near your head. Or to be strafed. Or to be be in an aeriel dogfight. Or to drown. (Some of the negative reviewers found this too loud, too realistic perhaps. So be warned.) Nolan has somehow captured the strange mix of selflessness and selfishness, cowardice and heroism, depersonalisation and intensive personal narrative that the military and war can bring out. Some reviewers have commented that there wasn't enough character development, but to me that lack of personalisation reflects what being in the military and a huge operation like this feels like. I felt the desperation and hopelessness. The sense of being trapped. The terror of being shot at. I was moved by the ending. Some reviewers are saying the film lacked emotion, but I didn't feel that. My friend says he wasn't moved at all though. Did these negative critics want more emotion from the soldiers? Screaming? Weeping? I don't think that would have been realistic. This movie wasn't too bloody at all, although I don't think I've ever felt more strongly the waste of war. It's too easy in these war movies to demonise the enemy and emphasise the bloodiness -- but Nolan did none of that. He didn't show the enemy or the carnage at all really. What he did show was the desperation and fear. This movie had a few minor issues, but I'll see it a second time before reporting on them in more detail. Right now, I'll just mention a few:  Nolan didn't use CGI. I was surprised that there weren't more on the beach. Is this really what hundreds of thousands of men look like? I'm not sure this movie depicts accurately what it was like for so many to be trapped on that beach. Is this what 700 civilian boats look like? Why were there only a handful of aircraft in the air? Maybe CGI would have worked better here.  I sometimes had a hard time telling who was who.  I would have liked to have walked away from this moving knowing why Dunkirk occurred.  What happened to the 100,000 or so who were taken prisoner? This movie puts action fans in the same theatre as old fogeys. That alone is a major accomplishment. You have to hand it to Nolan. He almost casually and unnecessarily turned from his usual fare to focus on an historical war drama. The result is a compelling, excellent movie. Imagine if all these superhero directors did this. It is interesting that the world continues to make and watch movies about this war, even though the greatest generation has all but died out. This is a war we will never forget, even as those who lived it are no longer around to describe it to us. From now on, every generation will tell this story in its own way.
2.0~A Hollow Film sneakyshooter Sign in Permalink After hearing all the raving reviews about Dunkirk, I was really looking forward to watching it. I was expecting a Saving Private Ryan type action/drama movie that would keep me on the edge of my seat. What I got instead was a yawn filled headache of an experience. Not much happens in the film for how long it is. There are essentially no action scenes, which is fine, but the dialogue and "story telling" of this movie are beyond boring. You literally see no Nazis during the running time. It creates a feeling of no threat or danger. Also, the soundtrack WILL give you a headache. Whoever approved of it needs to get thier ears checked. You will finish this film and feel empty. As if you wasted your time. Why? Because its a hollow movie. All style. No substance. And the style is not even impressive. All 3 plots give a feeling of too much going on and not enough going on at the same time. It feels like nothing gets accomplished and no character has an arc. Avoid this overrrated waste of time at all costs.
3.0~A total disappointment. psarathy-ramesh Sign in Permalink Struggled for about an hour or so into the movie and then gave up. A big and total disappointment.
6.0~What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for. texshelters Sign in Permalink Dunkirk-A Review. Dunkirk is wonderful to look at, however, it is at once too much and too little. There are too many cuts and too many subplots that it is easy to lose interest in what is happening. The cuts come quickly, which works with the air and action scenes, but holding longer on some shots would have allowed us to more deeply feel the gravity of the events. Inevitably, I found myself comparing Dunkirk to other WWII films. It holds up well, with two notable exceptions. First, the intensity and close contact action is not as impactful as the opening to "Saving Private Ryan." However, the tension throughout the entirety of "Dunkirk" surpasses "Ryan," which moves aimlessly at times. I also think of the remarkable "Das Boot", a film that made many sympathize, me included, with Nazis in a submarine. The tension in that German classic is at a level that "Dunkirk" doesn't match, and "Das Boot" never relents until the ending. Moreover, in "Das Boot", we get to know the captain well, how he cares about each man in his command and we see his fear. That makes the film more interesting for us. There is one setting in Das Boot, a submarine, and that's all. The film's limited scope increases the tension and our attachment to each character. What was also lacking in the film was a sense of the war in general. Das Boot was able to show us the futility of war and how the leaders in Germany made huge strategic mistakes. Little of that comes across in Dunkirk. Dunkirk shows a great rescue but ignores the fact that this operation was only required because the Allies underestimated Germany's forces and were outflanked by the Nazi advance when the Allies failed to anticipate a German Blitz through the Ardennes. The military strategists were so inept that the whole British army almost went balls up during the retreat. Not all the subplots in Dunkirk work well. A subplot involving a volunteer civilian ship-mate, George, is awkward and unnecessary. Certainly, Nolan wants us to empathize with all the British citizens who aided in the rescue. He also wants us to understand the "shell shock" (PTSD) that the soldiers went through. Both the bravery of the volunteers and suffering of the soldiers was clear throughout the film and a tacked on, haphazard conflict on a civilian boat was not well thought out. The scene is an insipid distraction from the core of the film. However, the depictions of shell shock in general were realistic and impactful. There was also a scene featuring a beached vessel that added nothing to the story but another subplot to distract us from more interesting characters and plot lines. In this way, the film is reminiscent of disaster films from the 70s where each character faces life and death challenges and we briefly see what happens to each one of them. But we don't need to see what happens to every character and every way the soldiers were stranded. All the plots and actions leave us too scattered to deeply care about any of them. The acting was surprisingly flat with two exceptions: Mark Rylance as a private ship captain Mr. Dawson and Tom Glynn-Carney who plays his son Peter. More about their story and bravery and less about the tacked on George would have improved this film. Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton is a waste of talent here. His dialogue is a clumsy attempt to explain the gravity of the situation, but it added little that the battle footage didn't already show us. Moreover, Branagh's stares into space did nothing for the film. But he does look good in that uniform. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overwrought and melodramatic, much like John Williams score for Schindler's list, Zimmer wants to make sure we FEEL things. More subtlety would have served this film well. And the unnecessary discordant drones and grinding sounds added to some of the battle scenes were annoying and distracting. The sounds of war: the machines, the engines, the bombs, the bullets, are compelling enough. There was no need to embellish them. I would suggest that Mr. Zimmer stick to standard action films like "Inception" as I have suggested that Williams stick to films like "Jaws" and "Star Wars." Serious dramas demand less bravado and more nuance. Though the story is bloated with characters and subplots, there were some great directorial choices in "Dunkirk." First, the lack of machoism is refreshing. While there is a lot of posturing and anger in the film, what clearly comes across is that many of the soldiers were rightfully scared and enduring as best they could. There were no John Wayne characters on the beaches, or in this case Benjamin Cumberbatch, proclaiming that the British were going to punch the Nazi's in the nose. Another good directorial choice is not stereotyping the Germans as 'evil.' Certainly, the Nazi leadership was a humanity hating force of slaughter, but the film focused of the heroic British, French and other allies. The cinematography is excellent and the cameras were masterfully placed in the film. An award for cinematography could be granted Hoyte Van Hoytema for degree of difficulty alone. Rating: Matinée. What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for. Still, seeing it in 70 mm is a treat worth the viewing. Peace, Tex Shelters
7.0~Not a Masterpiece but Okay allanradman Sign in Permalink Wow, all the hype about this movie. And as history buff (mostly WW1) I couldn't wait for Dunkirk. However, I kept waiting for the epic bit that makes the film memorable or classic. It never came. Not only was Dunkirk not an epic, it wasn't entirely historical either. Missing were the French army defending the city which enabled the other some 330,000 to evacuate. Missing were epic radio speeches from Churchill. This, in my opinion, would have sent chills down the spines of audiences. Churchill was a masterful speaker with a command of the English language never before or since seen. And missing were the fleets of boats - yes there were maybe 50-75 boats of all sorts, but if you're going to use an airplane CGI scene, it's not a stretch to use CGI to show the armada of boats going back and forth, the ports of England to the beaches of Dunkirk. Other goofs I noticed were a scene where it seemed obvious that this was the filmmakers water line of demarcation. In other words, you can see lots of boats to the right of the camera but zero boats to the camera's left. Very obvious though I'm not looking for miscues, I just want to be entertained in the way the Longest Day entertained. When the tiny ships did arrive there should have been hundreds of soldiers wading into the waters towards the little boats...nothing in the film but a single soldier going where - to swim to England? Also missing and very noticeable were soldiers firing their rifles at the Luftwaffe. All those armed soldiers on the beach and nobody firing a single shot at attacking Luftwaffe dive bombers (in the film)? Doesn't seem believable that an armed soldier would just stand and watch an enemy fighter come down on him and his comrades. Dunkirk was a lot more than queues waiting to be rescued. The French army (mostly French and some British) fought ferociously to keep the Germans away from the beaches. The city was mostly reduced to ruins. In the end, some 330,000 soldiers were evacuated, of which roughly 35- 40% were French. Most of the French went back to fight the Battle of France while some 3000 stayed in England to become the Free French Forces. That was lost on the filmmakers. This was the opportunity to make the next Longest Day film. It missed badly though it is still an okay film - very watchable. But never in the course of human events on film has so much been lost by so few - in Hollywood.
4.0~Not great whackpaddy Sign in Permalink Very overrated. it was a bit boring and dragged on .
6.0~good movie but way over-hyped anglo_anathema Sign in Permalink When a director as renowned for his storytelling and directional ability like Nolan makes a movie everyone expects nothing but gold. Dunkrik is good movie and has some great parts to it. however i really do not understand why people are considering it in par his other movies like the prestige or the dark knight trilogy let alone inception. The story is seriously lacklustre and while has a really good starting and parts in between; it left me with a sense of more to be desired. the acting is very mediocre....and when it all does come together the only thing which holds it by the end is the amazing score by Zimmer. it lacks the meat, sauce and is dry in the core. the same scenes of the bombers dropping bombs on destroyers are played over and over again like clockwork. I hope people do not go with a real high expectation because if you are nolan fan or of good war movies like the thin red line, Saving private ryan or band of brothers you will be disappointed
6.0~Bland and Disappointing inyourimage Sign in Permalink I came away disappointed as I had been looking forward to this film for a while. I will try to avoid spoilers, but will say that there was not a single swastika, no reference to Nazis (or even Germany for that matter), and virtually no close up view of "the enemy." Is this the new form of whitewashing history, and pandering to the ever growing sensitivities of an overly politically correct entertainment industry? At any rate, aside from this same annoying trend that ruined Captain America and Wonder Woman, there was no emotional depth to the movie whatsoever, both in terms of the characters or action. Worst of all, there was an artificial feigned sense of selflessness among the main characters on several occasions. Movie on the whole just fell flat.
2.0~Uh - this was a sad creation. I want my money back siivooja4 Sign in Permalink Where to start tearing this catastrophic movie apart? Many viewers will probably like the storytelling showing the same event from different angles and personal stories. This idea is copied from Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs-trilogy. There is an obvious search for fear of death by drowning or sinking with a ship in a closed locked space, but it just doesn't work. Other movies like Das Boot is a masterpiece of this, but Dunkirk isn't able to copy the feeling at all. Other points: 1. Why film a beach side street in a small French town, but do not even bother to edit out the modern buildings? 2. Show a bunch of private yachts in a harbour. Many of the boats are from the wrong era. 3. Almost 100 000 soldiers died in Dunkirk. This is not depicted in any way. It is an important part of the real story. 4. Wikipedia: "The loss of materiel on the beaches was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to equip about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large caliber, some 500 anti- aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles, and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. " However in the movie we see a few rows of boxes on an otherwise clean beach. 5. Both sides lost over a hundred aircraft in Dunkirk. A loss of over a hundred planes means thousands of missions were flown during those days. Yet we see 5-6 in the movie and at most 3 in the sky at a given time. 6. Men hide in a fishing boat and wait for the tide to return and float the boat again. Germans are "target practicing" at the boat. Water comes in through a few rifle caliber holes. Yet more holes appear under the existing ones. So the Germans are target practicing and shooting way under the waterline of the boat? What rifle shoots a hole in a metal bulkhead through one meter depth? Then the men are able to plug the holes with anything else than their fingers? While textile or almost any material could be used to plug them and avoid sinking. Plot or real stupidity? 7. The sounds were surprisingly low quality. Rifle shots do not sound like real rifle shots. The Rolls Royce on the Spitfire is off too. Hearing it live is a majestic experience, but in the movie it's not even close. Honestly I'm not sure if the cinema had their sound system tuned wrong or if it was the movie, but although I'm not much into music it bothered me throughout the movie. War is hell. This movie is like a slow funeral.
6.0~Nolan Could Film Himself Taking a Poop And People Would Think It's a Masterpiece chodebalm-1 Sign in Permalink I'm giving this film a 6/10 because that's honestly what it deserves. When voting officially opened for this movie here on IMDb, it was at a 9.8/10. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry but I'm not going to be one of those people who just worships the ground Nolan walks on. I'm dead serious when I say Nolan could film himself taking a dump and people would rave about it. This movie is decent. It's better than your average war movie. A six out of ten is an appropriate rating for this film. The acting is good, which the film heavily relies on since there isn't a ton of dialogue. This is also probably Nolan's shortest film, which is also nice since he doesn't make you sit there and subject you to all sorts of his self-proclaimed "mind-f***s" and twists that he tries to throw at you. This movie doesn't try to out-think itself, which is fitting since a war movie doesn't need to be like that. All in all, it does what a war movie should do. Is it worthy of its current rating of 9/10 on IMDb? Absolutely not. Is it better than average? Yes.
2.0~Masterclasss in turning epic story in to pathetic movie smb-48793 Sign in Permalink I really cannot think of anything positive to say about this movie except for having Spitfires in it. But even as much as I love Spitfires they couldn't save this movie. Clichéd, characterless, frustrating, unoriginal, technically wrong in so many ways etc etc. Sometimes just telling a great story is enough without all the arty cinematography done to death. A macro story turned into a micro characterless tale. Watch the original 1958 version instead, better in every way except there are no Spitfires in it.
5.0~Less than the sum of its parts. atoothbrush Sign in Permalink If you have seen many Nolan films I feel you already expect a certain style of product walking into this film. I think it fulfills expectations there. Great production values. Great actors making the most of what they have to play with. Great visuals and cgi. Tense atmospheric score and sound effects. Sadly it doesn't really come together as a whole package. My opinion is there has been a steady downward trend in Nolan films since Inception (with the exception of The Dark Knight which was only elevated by Heath Ledger's epic performance). This film fits right in that trend. IMO, many directors given the elements here would be able to craft a better film. Can't give it more than half marks.
1.0~Dissapointing campoli-s Sign in Permalink Over 300,000 ratings??!!! This is a movie that was review bombed to get ratings much better than it deserves. IMDB should conduct an in depth review when it so obvious otherwise it degrades their reputation for providing relatively accurate ratings on movies. To speak of the movie itself - sad it is. Pathetically slow developing story line. Poorly crafted. The one positive is the cinematography.
5.0~Not a great war movie - just a 106-minute series of vignettes davidarcher Sign in Permalink I went expecting to see, as one critic put it, "the greatest war film ever made." I was disappointed. Not only is it NOT the greatest war film ever made, I'm not really sure what it is. And, if you're not familiar with the Dunkirk evacuation, you're probably going to be a bit lost. The movie begins with the soldiers lined up on the beach, and offers just a few expository comments about how they ended up there. There are no visual cues to help you understand the magnitude of the challenges they face. You never get the feeling that you have almost 400,000 men stranded on a beach, or that they're being attacked by hundreds of (rather that two or three) aircraft. Putting that aside, I had three major problems with the movie: First, I felt like I had walked in during the middle of the movie. Nothing is really put into context, nor do you get to know any of the characters. Instead, it feels like you're watching a series of vignettes, or perhaps a montage, from another film, albeit for nearly two hours. Next, the evacuation involved 340,000 men, hundreds of aircraft, and about 860 vessels, many of which were "little ships" that sailed from Ramsgate. Unfortunately, the movie never steps back long enough to provide a sense of the scale for the operation, and instead just shows a few boats and aircraft and a handful of men. Finally, while thousands of men were killed, the film never lets you feel that on a visceral level. When a soldier or sailor is killed, with a few exceptions, they merely fall to the ground. No one is ever grievously wounded, screaming in pain, or making any commotion at all. Contrast that to the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, which is probably the most intense battle scene ever filmed. The cast is excellent, but has very little dialog or character development with which to work. Will Attenborough, grandson of Richard Attenborough, plays an RAF pilot, while singer Harry Styles plays the son of Mark Rylance, a "little boat" captain. (Rylance could give an amazing performance just reading a phone book.) The film was shot mostly in 65 / 70 mm and is being screened in 125 70mm-capable theaters. The film is incredibly loud, and veterans of the Dunkirk evacuation noted the movie was louder than the actual battle. I'm not sure what to recommend. If you're looking for a great war movie, this isn't it. If you don't like war movies (like Marie) this won't change your mind. Maybe wait for it to stream.
2.0~So - Where's Dunkirk? screenman Sign in Permalink For grey-haired Brexiteers like me, weaned upon a diet of 1950's British stiff-upper-lipped-ness (BSULN), a modern movie re-kindling that - now long lost - spirit was surely a must-see. I hadn't been to the cinema in donkeys' years; put off not so much by modern movies (which are bad enough) but by audiences of ignorant huge-headed bag-crackling crisp-crunching gas-bags who came to ruin the whole experience. And with a comfy chair, big HD telly and unlimited Stella, it would take something special to prise me off the cushions and fork out over £13(!). Well, if any word might do it; "Dunkirk" might. If ever a word conjures up notions of legendary BSULN - Dunkirk is that conjurer's word. I have a DVD of the much cherished 1950's version featuring those grandees of wartime spunk, John Mills and Dickie Attenborough, not to mention a reassuring dollop of Bernard Lee. It's an excellent work from start to finish. Every aspect of the great debacle and culminating "miracle" is included and carefully edited into a coherent story, from home-grown civilian cynicism about the "phoney" war, the collapsing French defence, discussions at High-Command, desperate British regrouping, French refugees, mountains of abandoned logistics, slaughter on the beaches and final deliverance. It ain't no masterpiece, but it's a very coherent, sterling work of typically understated performances, representing people with sufficient depth that you can care about them and their fate; all re-created by character actors who actually experienced both the war and the times. Cut to yesterday. This modern take on the great event is shallow in the extreme. Oh-sure; the combat scenes are visceral enough with sound levels fit to cause tinnitus, but coherent story telling? believable characters? An overview of the great historical event? Forget it! Considering the makers of this movie had almost unlimited funds and CGI, this should've resembled a Cecil B Demille epic. There were supposed to be over 350,000 allied soldiers trapped in Dunkirk! I swear I've seen more people in Tesco's at Christmas than are depicted here. The beaches seem practically empty. And those people to whom we are introduced appear two-dimensional, like cardboard cut-outs. The "collapse" is depicted by about half a dozen British Tommies walking negligently through suburbs, evidently unaware of the war, only to be mown down. One survives and encounters the French rear-guard. That's it. Time for a crap on the dunes. They're deserted, so what the hell? After that, there's a series of small set-piece conflicts drawn progressively together by the choppiest editing I've ever witnessed. All the characters are two-dimensional and unexplained. There's no back-fill story at all. A quite disproportionate amount of time is spent aloft with the RAF. Three whole Spitfires are presented almost reverentially, as if they alone turned the military tide. They skirmish with bombers and fighters, shooting down all they encounter with one quick burst of gunfire. The last one, running out of fuel, gracefully lands on the beaches of Dunkirk, in mellow westering sunlight, as the strains of Nimrod from Elgar's Enigma Variations grind away at half speed. It's frankly mythologising of the most juvenile kind. I almost laughed. (And incidentally; that Spitfire was travelling northeast along the Belgian coast, so the sun would have to be setting in the opposite direction!) If you're a millennial - the sort who wanders vacantly about the streets gaping into the screen of a mobile phone; someone with no more depth of character than those depicted here; raised upon revisionary history and brain-washed into being a bien pensant of the glorious European Union, this movie will seem as authentic as your friends on Facebook. But if you're of an earlier generation; you might want to watch the 1950's version at home, on the big telly, with the unlimited Stella. It's better in every way.
9.0~Unique, emotional and fascinating as usual vborn Sign in Permalink As a big fan of Christopher Nolan, I'm still waiting for a really bad movie of him, so he can improve his skills better. I know there might be many Nolan Fans, who are exaggerating. But this doesn't mean Nolan is overrated, no way. He even deserves more respect for his vision and skills. I'm not a big fan of the "war" genre to be honest and only like a few war movies, but this movie was very different. It was once again a non-linear film and it showed once again that film rules are film tools and can be broken in the right way. So everyone who isn't a fan of war movies as well can enjoy this movie as well. The best thing about the movie is the excellent casting. I felt like literally every actor was fitting perfectly into his role. Great performances by everyone, but especially Cillian Murphy and Harry Styles were out-standing. I'm very proud of Harry Styles taking this path and I hope he will continue with such great performances. Once again Nolan rocked with an unique story-telling. It's a non- linear movie focusing on three perspectives. But what fascinated me most is how I could relate to every character, although there isn't hardly any character depth. It's like making us having compassion with everyone and not only with one specific character. And the combo Zimmer-Nolan worked again brilliantly. I felt like the visuals and the background score were stabbing into my heart. Especially in the most dramatic scenes it was a well-fitting score. Just incredible how he makes a scene terrifying and hopeful on the same time. So, you can expect another masterpiece by Nolan, which not only makes your brain feel satisfied, but plays with your heart as well.
1.0~How is this 8.2* on IMDB? aaronjwindsor-87650 Sign in Permalink I have been a huge film junkie my entire life, war films being in my top 3 genres. This is the first time however I have felt it necessary to express my opinion on a film, normally a film is either known to be good, or known to be bad. There are a lot that are just ok. But Dunkirk has been highly recommended by a lot of people and as you can see by the rating it has received on here, you would probably think this is going to be something special. Admittedly you can see the huge budget this film had, the picture is also beautiful, but this is where the good points end. From the very first scene there is no plot to the entire film, the scenes are very quick and one would think this has been clipped and stitched together by a media student with no experience in the film industry. I personally found it hard to relate to any of the characters, so much So, that I can only remember one characters name "George" and the only reason being is because his name is said so frequently it becomes irritating. The film is supposed to be reflecting on what happened in Dunkirk, however the writer and directors seem to have forgotten this. Over 400,000 men on the beach? At no one time do you see more than 50 people tops in one shot on the beach, majority of the time the beaches look more deserted than my local beach does in the winter. Local dog walkers making up a higher number than the cast of Dunkirk. I also got the impression from the actors that even they were bored filming. Nothing drew me in, the only intense part of the film is the crazy, hyped background music that has been put into every scene foe the 1hour 46 minute film - non stop. It bares no purpose and frankly would have been better without. For around 3 minutes I listened to music leaving me in suspense thinking something big was going to happen, suddenly the music peaked and all that came of it was an enemy plane hitting the water, in an all but average scene. I believe the director has tried too hard to try and make this into a classic, like saving private Ryan. Unfortunately the cast, nor the plot were there to see this through. Majority of the user reviews are between 1-3 stars... This is a true reflection of what the general public think of this movie, the people who seem to have rated much, much higher. Are film critics, who seem to be basing their reviews on the money spent and the picture. Unfortunatly if the reviewed honestly, I suppose this would be rated around 5* instead of 8.
2.0~disappointing jfj1 Sign in Permalink As all other people i wanted to see this so called great movie. I went with my oldest son who as limited knowledge of Dunkirk and ww2. I know quiet a bit about this time period and was expecting a lot, however my expectations were too high as there were just too many things that spoiled the movie for me. Everyone who has seen Dunkirk pictures and movies from around that time period knows what i mean. let me give you few examples, - the only Germans you vaguely see are at the end - the view from the sea to the city and in the opening shows an intact undamaged city, while in 1940 the city was destroyed, it looks more like a holiday resort. - the beached were filled with cars, equipment and most of all soldiers of all nationalities, English, french belgiums and yes also dutch. - you only see few small ships, while there were more than 30 dutch fishing ships for example than the shot at the end with the spit, not to forget the skies at that time in 1940 were filled with German planes and not the few you see in the movie the effect is soo poorly done that its just disappointing. but most of all were were the German soldiers? So i left with a feeling like is this what everyone is to enthusiast about ? the more think about it the more i see that it was a waist of money and the beach view really did it for me, it spoiled everything. Dunkirk was not a pleasure resort but a destroyed city with dozens of corpses and equipment's on the beach. They should have altered it with the computer to make it more realistic. So if you now a wee bit of that time period than don't go, you will e disappointed.
1.0~An Insult To Those That Served. gdgitarz Sign in Permalink Reviews claiming this movie "greatest WW2 movie" are an absolute nonsense. "Dunkirk" barely qualifies for the genre. * There is zero land combat between Allied and German forces portrayed in the movie. There is no depiction of tanks, artillery or infantry engaged in hostilities on land. There is a dozen aircraft and ships from the era and what looks like a cast of a few hundred. The movie does not deserve its title. It is in fact an insult to the memory of "Dunkirk", the professional British Soldier, Seaman and Airman, the civilian and merchant crews of the rescuing flotilla, the population of Dunkirk - to all those souls from both sides of the conflict present at Dunkirk late May early June 1940. * The 2 main characters are cowards. There is a repelling creepiness about their relationship. They don't look or act like professional British soldiers orderly holding on for evacuation rather they act like a pair of modern gender fluid sis males desperately trying to return to their safe space. This is the central story and it is about these 2 cowards deserting their post and using every trick they can think of to push in front of everyone else including the wounded to get aboard a ship home to safety. They even throw their rifles away not long into the movie the gutless scum. They deserved a court-martial sentence to be shot for the selfish, cowardly desertion of their comrades. If the Allied soldiers had acted this disgracefully the defense and evacuation of Dunkirk could never have taken place and the war lost. * A "shell shocked" soldier is rescued at sea by a civilian boat crewed by a middle aged gent and two teenage boys. This soldier flies into a rage demanding the boat steer immediately to England and not onto Dunkirk to rescue more men. In this rage he pushes one of the boys down a hatch to a lower deck where the boy strikes his head and dies thus committing murder. However, on return to England he is metaphorically slapped on the back and told "not to worry old chap you are shell shocked so killing innocent people is totally expected of you. Don't you worry yourself we will lie to the authorities and the boys family so you never face justice. Now off you go and have some fun." * The disgraceful behavior of cowards and and the unlikely, unpleasant murder of a boy are deemed more worthy to depict than the inspiring stories of heroic courage and mateship displayed by the highly trained and experienced professional soldiers these men were. Brave men on the outer defenses and town fought desperately to ensure their comrades safe evacuation. These men knew they faced two possible outcomes - death or capture for the wars duration. The soldiers evacuated would have swapped places with their mates defending the beach without a thought. The movie should be about their valor not the shameful cowardice of deserters or the unlikely actions of a soldier claiming "shell shock". This is perhaps the most over hyped disgrace of a movie I have seen. It is a shameful disservice to the men that fought at Dunkirk and the brave men in tiny boats that came to their rescue.
5.0~Shoot Hans Zimmer mungfish Sign in Permalink A great movie with respect to the cinematography and grandeur of the filming location. The movie captured the dread and hopelessness of the allied soldiers very well. Dialogue was at a minimum as the excellent visuals told the story. My only complaint is the extremely annoying musical score by Hans Zimmer. The continuous sawing against cello and violin strings were meant to increase the drama of the plot. But, it was repetitive and mindless and detracted from an otherwise great movie (it would have garnered at least a nine rating without the score). Hopefully, they can re-score the film someday. If so, it could be a classic.
2.0~Disappointed ll57-742-476055 Sign in Permalink Film gave insufficient background on what was transpiring and why. Little character development. Film seemed short. Beach evacuation scenes looked like they were removing 3,000 troops, not 300,000+. It could have been so much better and also informative. Wait for the TV version.
7.0~Some very well filmed scenes and some very glaring faults. phd_travel Sign in Permalink This movie is a mix of very good and very bad. The good parts are superb but the faults are glaring. First of all the bad parts. The soundtrack is terrible and intrusive. Good music would have made a world of a difference. The dialog is 75% incomprehensible either behind masks or with excessively heavy accents. The movie jumps from one scenario to another too often breaking up the narrative and causing confusion. Night and day seem to be mixed up - suddenly it's day time in the air then night time on the boat and back and forth. Some of the things that are shown seem hardly worth screen time like the 17 year old boy dying and Cillian Murphy's character with his shell shock. With all the brave stories to tell why so much of that awful story? Good points: This is no Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor movie with it's silly love triangle. Quite an antidote to those war movies with too much love story. It's all Dunkirk. The airplane battles are quite well filmed. Some of the scenes are the most tense in War movie history. Worth mentioning are the scenes on the ships when the torpedo strikes, bombing of ships and the men in the water with the fire on them, and strafing on the pier are second to none. The action is really seems in your face. The downed pilot almost drowning was quite scary. But the part with men being shot while hiding in the beached ship seemed overkill. Good that they mentioned how the evacuees weren't sent enough ships and planes for the evacuation and how civilians had to help. This movie is still worth a watch for the great parts.
5.0~Epic war film over-hyped dinobird Sign in Permalink As a history buff, I am easily drawn to historical films, including biopics. I understand the dramatic license filmmakers must take to make what is sometimes flat material into a compelling story. However, the story of Dunkirk and the evacuation of over 300,000 trapped British soldiers is as full of natural drama as stories about D-Day, or the Alamo, etc. My biggest complaint about this undeniably beautiful cinematic special effects party is that if you don't already know the story, the context is murky and the narrative very fragmented. My second objection is to the filmmaker's need to fictionalize characters--there are so many heroic and amazing stories found in this event--no need to make up characters. I would strongly recommend that before you see this film, if you don't know the history, do a little research. Of course, if you do, you'll probably be as disappointed as I was--this could have been a great epic war film. Instead, it is disconnected and hard to follow, both in terms of the interior chronology and the context.
1.0~Like a 99-minute computer game cut scene. Without CGI. justincward Sign in Permalink SPOILER ALERT: The Germans won this bit of WWII. Tawdry rubbish. Summed up by the modern train carriages the 'soldiers' board at the end. Saving Private Ryan's famous opening scene had you flinching and wincing at the succession of gory death scenes without letup; you never had time to worry about WHO was getting butchered. In order to stretch exactly that sort of thing writ large with ships and planes to an hour-and-a-half, Christopher Nolan has had to allow some kind of characterization to happen. The suspense occurs in that you never know whether the character you're looking at (I'm sick of Steadicam btw) is going to last another few minutes or not. This movie is for the generation that has grown up with live, amateur disaster footage. This is a terrible way to inspire any kind of identification with the characters; everyone is expendable, and none of them are drawn in any depth whatsoever. A little vulnerability here, a little courage there, but after half an hour of this all that's left is the spectacle of violent, horrible death. And Kenneth 'No-Lips' Branagh practicing for when he inevitably does Churchill. (The English politician, not the car insurance bulldog. I won't be advance booking). This is why 'Dunkirk' resembles a series of computer game action scenes cut together. You're just waiting for the next one to find out if anything happens. And the music, sorry, the synthetic drone that goes on throughout (what happened to war movie themes?) adds to that sensation. No development, no change in mood - apart from stealing 'Nimrod' from Elgar (a cliché, by the way) - and in the end, no surprises apart from unexpected death. The whole movie feels synthetic, ie artificial, instead of engaging your deeper emotions. It's technically interesting - I wouldn't say 'impressive' - and may look authentic compared to 'traditional' war films, but it's actually just as false, and has less emotional involvement.
1.0~A failed experiment sxh-87483 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is drastically different from any WWII movie I've seen. It's Nolan's bold experiment in exploring novel ways to tell stories from WWII. While his attempt was admirable, I felt extremely disappointed after seeing the movie. Nolan spent no time on developing the characters or telling stories, but instead fabricated a complex movie structure. Some may say that Nolan is intentionally keeping the story simple so that the fear and anxiety on that day can be better conveyed to the audience. However, the intricate time line setting constantly distracts people from the scene and makes me wonder whether he is trying to tell a story or showing off his wild imagination. If one just looks at the story line of the soldiers, he or she may think the movie is a documentary. The protagonist has almost no lines while constantly trying to escape from the beach of Dunkirk. We all understand the cruelty of war and don't need to spend nearly 2 hours in watching a coward running to learn that. Nolan's flat story telling style is a disaster and is the biggest barrier lying between the movie screen and the audiences. Just before I was almost convinced that this was a documentary, the romantic depiction of the fighter pilot pulled me back to thinking it was still a Hollywood movie. The fighter jets didn't miss a single enemy and safely touched down on the sea and beach. Wait Nolan, I thought you were going to tell us Dunkirk was a total disaster. Why suddenly you switched to this romantic depiction of war heros and hope? When I saw the civilian boat leaving the harbor, I thought the main character would be the old gentlemen on the little sail boat. However, all he did was pulling a bunch of soldiers from the sea and navigate the boat through the war zone. The pivotal civilian fleets and common English men who changed the course of the WWII were not at all emphasized in the movie, given no more than 1/3 of the screen at maximum. The purpose of a movie like this is either telling a story or expressing some kind of emotion or a combination of the two. Nolan hasn't done either as there are no developed plot or characterers. I guess he was betting his novel three-stranded story telling would compensate for the weakness. But I have to say it's a failed experiment and does not deserve any higher score than 5 on IMDb.
1.0~Massive disapointment from a Nolan fan riprop Sign in Permalink Ok theres many reviews about this one so i will keep it short as possible. I signed up to imdb just so i could share my disapointment. Nolan has made some of the best films ever....wtf was this? I waited 6 months to watch this and finally watched it on tv. My friend saw it at cinema and said it was amazing. Well i am sure the emphasis on sound effects made it sound good but on tv it was just boring to watch. I watched waiting for this climatic point that never came. Nolans films are usually well layered. This was just drivel and i had no care for anyone in the film What amazes me is how the critics love this film so much. Hans Zimmer has made some of the best scores of all time but there was nothing good in here. Top listed actors waited. No feeling of scale. No character development. No point to anything happening. I could go on and on but you get the jists. Amazes me how this film is highly acclaimed. A true film can be watched again and again on any format. My favorite films include The Prestige and Dark knight. Nolan you let me down and I will not care for your next film now.
7.0~Decent but not great. Music was very annoying. ethanguerami Sign in Permalink Parts of the movie are very good but most of the movie left me thinking "that didn't make sense" or "that it wasn't really engrossing". Then the relentless droning background music left me thinking that it never really built up to anything. It's like the music to a murder scene designed to drive you to clench your hand around the armrest and prepare to be scared... But this movie never reached any climax and I felt cheated by that music leading me to the next dull outcome. I have already warned my friends and now I'm warning you to not set your expectations too high.
6.0~Single page script and few dialogues tclementdev Sign in Permalink What a weird movie. The script should be able to fit on a single page and there are very few dialogues (and certainly none that you would remember). Direction is okay for an otherwise quite boring movie. The only thing that saves this movie is that it's not too long, which makes it not too painful to watch.
8.0~Should have been a three-hour epic Solnichka Sign in Permalink First, the event itself deserved more screen time and exposition. Only 107 minutes for this real-life story? Not enough time at all. Also, no explanation whatsoever of why the "enemy" didn't press the advantage, which is a key element to the story. Second, the three-tiered narrative gets jumbled at the end, obviously on purpose, but it's not a good way to end the film. The out-of-sequence editing ruins the hitherto-positive effect of the trio of story lines, potentially confusing the audience. Those two things out of the way, this is a very good film: good acting, good writing, good cinematography, etc. The three story lines are woven well, demonstrating the different experiences at Dunkirk, and until the end of the film (as noted above), it's edited very smoothly and effectively. Definitely worth seeing -- but it could have been SO much better.
1.0~Terrible roxburghangus Sign in Permalink Really really poor movie, bad acting, gratingly bad music (if you can call it that), no character story and really badly made with zero respect for the history. Modern scenes/items throughout (e.g., modern container terminal in backgrounds, modern fenders on the boats) a warship at anchor getting torpedoed, who anchors a ship in the middle of a battle? A spitfire with no fuel flying faster than it did when the engine was running then turning around to make one more kill before landing, with no engine running! A group of soldiers threatening to throw off a french guy overboard to lighten the load on their boat so it would float when its chest deep in water sinking. One minute the sea is calm and sunny, next minute its windy and overcast. Boats pro-porting to be evacuating 300,000 soldiers leaving the beach/port half empty, the beach scenes showing less than 5,000 soldiers lined up waiting to leave, where were all the others? Also neatly lined up ready to be shot at by panes and artillery. Could they not afford enough extras? Director and writers did not show anything of the history or characters, they disrespected the viewer by thinking the type of events like the above were to be believed, just a horrible movie all round Don't bother watching even when it is on TV Cant believe the reviews are positive at all. Go compare it to well made classic war movies and then come back and give this one a 1 star like it deserves. Better examples include Private Ryan, Gallipoli, The Longest Day, Bridge too far, etc
7.0~It's not bad... but it's not great either... LiveLoveLead Sign in Permalink It's not that Dunkirk is a bad movie, it's just not as amazing as the advertisements or Box Office gro$$ lead you to believe. Between the lack of character development, and the uneven, time switching perspectives this movie was hard to follow and hard to invest in. Dunkirk has some interesting, moving scenes and historical info, but for the most part, it is slow and awkward. It took a while before I even realized that there were scenes being shown out of sequence. There is little done visually to inform you that a different perspective or flashback is happening. You'll see a plane looking down on a sinking boat and then a scene or two later you see people on shore boarding what looks like the same boat, and a few scenes later you realize you jumped back a few hours in time. I'm not sure why they chose to format the movie with all this time jumping when there was only a matter of hours between the flashback scenes, not days or years. It just made the film confusing. Your mind is so busy trying to work out the scene order and playing catch up, that you aren't concentrating fully on the details of the movie and you're not able to just enjoy it unfold. There are definitely a few standout actors, but because there are so many characters and very little character development, along with the weird formatting, most of the scenes have you struggling to figure out who is who, and which actors match with each story's flashback. Maybe if you read this before seeing the movie you'll go in more prepared and be able to follow the film better than I did. All in all, although it is worth a look, Dunkirk is not as awe-inspiring and impressive as other war movies, like Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape and Sergeant York, in My Humble Opinion. 8/2017
3.0~Time wasted pedro-97797 Sign in Permalink Did i just wasted my time? Yes i did....I can honestly compare this movie to that roller coaster all your friends talk about and you feel you have to try it because everyone is talking about it but in the end you wish you didnt listen to those fools!
10.0~Excellent jnmason-38415 Sign in Permalink Realistic. No stupid Hollywood fireball explosions. No stupid shouting, or fake panic. No stars, no heroes, little dialogue all work to make this best film I've seen in years. I saw the film twice, it's not the sort of film you can say you enjoyed, but it's remarkable. I'm really pleased I saw it, I'd see it again. But you really need to see it at the cinema.
1.0~It should be called Dumb Kirk, but worse, it's an example of fascist film making. dpaterson-2 Sign in Permalink This film is fascist because it is frame by frame intentionally coercive so as to deprive an audience of any sense of (1) reflection, and (2) personal power. We are taken though a soundscape of piercing, relentless psychological violence (hey, it's a war film!) with a "story telling" structure that creates hopeless, trapped characters every minute (hey, it's a war film!) in such aggressive editing that we, the audience, are dragged through at least thirty horrific keyholes and back again in the course of the "story". It's not a story. It's six, eight, twenty? stories, again edited so as to thoroughly disorient the audience and hammer us with one water boarding (often literally) after another. (hey, its a war film!) It's fascist because fascism breeds on violence, especially senseless violence and the emptying of personal and collective power violence brings. I forced myself to disconnect from the torture and was able to get both a perspective and angry. Worse, the film wholly ignores the historical reality of the bone-headed military decisions by the French (the criminally absurd Maginot Line) and the British (war had been declared MONTHS ago) (and Hitler was the opposition). The film also sucks dry the already-desiccated hero narrative forced on US population these last twenty years. With writhing violins after an hour and a half of uninterrupted electronic chainsaw sound score, I almost threw up. What I'd like to be sure of is that this Dumb Kirk crime somehow stops Britain but especially the US from continuing the endless wars in the middle east and Africa, where the war dead are beginning to creep up to that sacred WWII yard stick. Somehow I don't think it will. Because fascism wants to give us a world that is dominated by men and violence in which there is nothing to be done. Just like in Waiting for Godot. The film would have been helped enormously by the presence of even one woman (not used for sex appeal), but preferably by thousands -- to counter the narrative of the coming world police state orchestrated by the global corporate state in which patriarchal, fascist principles rely on everyone staying at home, feeling scared, being compliant, and asking no questions whatsoever. By the way, the stupefying dedication is (paraphrase) to all those who were affected by what happened at Dunkirk. So in a loose application, that's maybe all of the World War II population. But if it's trying to be specific, babies born around the time of Dunkirk are now 76 - 77 years old, and the armies of working class soldiers who were victimized by their Dumb Kirk militaries are approaching 100. I'm sure those in particular appreciated this coercive homage to mindless directorial self-indulgence.
1.0~The worst war-thriller in history tobias-66486 Sign in Permalink Totally amazing that this movie has such high scores - definitely bought votes. I love movies and the genre war. This movie does not even deserve to be called a movie and no matter what category people thinks it belongs within the film-world: this was a real failure. I regret buying this piece of garbage. I can write an essay about why this movie is such a let down but frankly it doesn't deserve my time - it has already stolen more than 2 hours of my life.
10.0~One of cinema's best movie experiences Hold_the_door Sign in Permalink "Dunkirk" is the newest film by the movie god Christopher Nolan (Memento, Dark Knight trilogy, Inception) and it is a unique movie experience that everyone should see. It's the story of 400,000 soldiers trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk, in France, during the time of the Second World War. There are many stories actually. Stories of several different people living at that place, at that time. "Dunkirk" is very intense. Your eyes will be glued to the screen from the first to the last frame and its short running time will just make you want to see it again. The cast and the soundtrack are excellent. It's a cinematic marvel. A game changer for war movies. Easily the best movie of the year. One of the best films made in 21st century and might be Nolan's best film yet (or I'm just biased by how much I loved it this first time, because I'm definitely going to see it again). You have to see it too. I recommend seeing it on IMAX or 70 mm.
1.0~One of the most over-rated films of all time Ravenloftrealm Sign in Permalink I hated this film. Why? Don't get me started. But then again, let me get started. The whole tone of this film is all wrong. There is something 'flat' about the whole thing. First of all, there is no battle here. What we have is a series of isolated skirmishes usually involving a few planes here and a few planes there. In fact, this film has so little 'scope' in terms of battle intensity that if I didn't know better I'd say it was shot on a low budget. The film has no star power. It's filled with a bunch of actors I never heard of. Tom Hardy is in it, but you'd never know it since he's wearing gear in his Spitfire. The film is told exclusively from the British side and there are no German characters in it. Since the film is so dry and dull being so British, one can only speculate on whether it would have been of help to get the German perspective as the battle unfolds. Aside from one scene with street fighting, there is no action involving tanks or infantry. All the airplane and ship stuff just get monotonous. The film cross cuts tediously to a small boat in which an older man and two young guys are heading to Dunkirk with a sailor they picked up at sea and two young soldiers, one British and one French, who are using their wits to just get off the beach and into a boat or ship. In fact two thirds of the movie involve this small boat and these two soldiers trying to catch a ride home. As a point of comparison, 'Fury' absolutely crushes this film and if you want to see a good world war II movie I recommend that one. "Enemy At The Gate' also had some really powerful battle scenes. I just think they could have done this much differently and much better.
4.0~Disappointing, perhaps Nolan's weakest (subjectively) Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink "Dunkirk" is a fairly new 105-minute release (2017) and the most recent work by Oscar-nominated writer and (not Oscar-nominated) director Christopher Nolan. It is actually pretty short for a film by him. And the history/war genre is also pretty new for him. Maybe that's the reason why this project did not really work out too well. But first things first. The best thing about the film is the technical side. No doubt the film will score a few Oscar nominations there, for its sound probably, perhaps for visual effects, editing or cinematography as well. But that is really almost the only positive thing I can say here. It also shows that story is way more important than all these previously mentioned factors and this where the film disappoints the most. The problem is not even that Nolan included so many unknown actors. I guess this was even somewhat smart because the soldiers should be a great mass of people like you and me. But Tom Hardy was really completely wasted, what a joke how they used him. His character added nothing and still they thought we would care for his fate at the very end. Oh yeah he wears a gas mask again like in his role as a Batman antagonist. Branagh, another Oscar nominee, was also very much wasted, even if not as much as Hardy. Recent Oscar winner Rylance had the best material (together with Murphy) from the known cast members and he was also the MVP I guess. Or lets better say the least forgettable. Story-wise, the ending was decent, a scene here and there too (like what happens after they find the Dutchman, that's also one of several moments when we realize drowning was a really present danger and potential cause of death back then in these military fights) and the early scenes on Rylance's character's boat were okay too before they do stupid stuff like have an untrained guy shoot down a German plane out of nowhere. I thought the general idea of having Rylance represent marine / water, Hardy represent air (force) and Branagh represent ground / foot soldiers was a nice one, but what they eventually made of this premise was really disappointing I would say. Also the Dunkirk situation is a promising one for a movie, but this is hopefully not all they can make of the subject. Even the British recent movie "Their Finest" that has some Dunkirk references in it was considerably superior. Also this is another Nolan movie that will certainly not get much (if any at all) awards attention for the actors. Only Ledger managed to break the cycle, even if Bale, Hathaway, Cotillard, Caine and some others too gave decent performances at times. Anyway, back to this one here. I cannot say I was well entertained watching it and that's why I give it a thumbs-down. Then again, while I love history, war films have never been great for me, so maybe if you enjoyed the likes of "Saving Private Ryan", "Black Hawk Down" or "Band of Brothers", then you will enjoy this one more than I did and can check it out. But if you don't, then it is best to skip it because I as a Nolan fan (like some of his works, even loved others) never managed to warm up to the material. Maybe the helping hand of his brother as a screen writer could have helped. The actual outcome is perhaps the biggest disappointment of 2017 movie-wise.
10.0~Best war film ever made ian-andrews2000 Sign in Permalink Utterly stunning in every department. Can't find a single fault with the film. My grandfather was injured at Dunkirk and I wish he was still alive to see this. if it doesn't win the best film Oscar, there's something wrong. To James Cartwright (0/10 guy trying to get his political points across). Did you actually see the film?
2.0~Unbelievably overrated hottmale_____ Sign in Permalink Slow, boring, and lacking emotion. Can't believe this is so highly rated. Extremely disappointing.
4.0~Disappointing film on such a worthy story kassdo Sign in Permalink A very big letdown for such a moment in history. Recommend wait for HBO. Editing was terrible posting a foolish timeline that made no sense, midnight in France/daylight in England at the same time. Hundreds of small civilian boats assisted in the evacuation, not the dozens on the screen. Thousands of Brit Troops standing in lines exposed on the beach for evacuation with no ships in sight, waiting. Everything from an odd random torpedo scene to the rescued troops getting pulled into boats, soaking wet in oil/seawater then getting off in England wearing dry crisp uniforms. The best dramatic gimmick? A valiant RAF pilot flies over the beachhead till he runs out of fuel, but he still has time gliding to shoot down one more Hun plane. That creates that final (5 minute) moment in the film where he quietly glides across the beach, providing that requisite film shot of all the British stars watching, biting their lips with respect. Meanwhile, I am wondering why he is landing towards the German held beach? Then with all the emergencies on the plane (off course, landing gear won't come down) he continues to wear his high altitude breathing/comms headset? The plane lands, the pilot jumps out and stands looking at the dunes and approaching Germans. Now being filmed with the golden sunset lighting hue technique, we finally see the glowing pilot's face (IMO Tom Hardy, the best British Actor today) defiantly surrendering. You think they would have used real human stories from the event to tell the story... instead we get scenes created specifically for select stars who dropped by the set to spend the day shooting their lines. A wasted opportunity to tell an amazing story of how the civilian armada saved the day.
7.0~Vivid, sweeping drama with almost no character exposition sirenebern Sign in Permalink I appreciated Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the events in "Dunkirk," and how he focused on the sounds and sights to connect the audience to the terror and uncertainty experienced by those who were involved. Visually, it's very exciting, especially the dogfights in the skies and the strafing of boats on the water. He obviously made a conscious decision to reveal almost nothing of a personal nature about any of these characters, including their names in some cases. You simply don't know anything about them, which is risky in a movie. Why should the audience care about some character we don't know? As the movie plays out, you do come to fill in those gaps a bit due to the excellent actors involved, particularly Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Jack Lowden. I assume Nolan's purpose for doing this was to show that it was this very large group of individuals coming together to do something miraculous in a time of global peril, when truly, their whole world and way of life was in jeopardy. Still, I couldn't help thinking that he might have added a few minutes here and there to give us more information or background on these men. The younger ones seem completely anonymous and almost blank. The soundtrack is very loud at times, and there's "ticking" that conveys the sense of danger and impending doom. It's almost as if you hear these men's hearts beating because they're just terrified. The action scenes are very well done. U.S. viewers (particularly younger ones) who are not familiar with the events of Dunkirk or the larger geopolitical situation of the start of WW2 would do well to read up on it a bit before seeing "Dunkirk," because Christopher Nolan is not wasting any film on explaining it all to you. I think people who like war movies in general or scenes with edge-of-your-seat action will enjoy this movie, but anyone who wants deeper character exposition will find it wanting.
2.0~Screams low budget but it's not!! jpmock Sign in Permalink I was very much looking forward to this film but it disappoints in just about every way. The acting is horrible, characters are uninteresting, and some of the battle scenes are so hoaky I think I could film them myself with some buddies. The acting lets you know right away that it is "acting," unlike in a quality film that sucks you in, mesmerizes you, and you feel like it's real. Not at all the case here. Very amateur and a waste of time. I want my 1:30 back!!!
10.0~Nolans best yet peterrichboy Sign in Permalink I am not who normally worships at the feet of Cristopher Nolan, and I had my doubts when I heard he was making a war epic about one the most critical moments of WW2. In reality Dunkirk was a humiliating defeat for the British armed forces and Nolan really only scratches the surface of what happened. For once we are spared the mass use of CGI instead we see the story through the eyes of three individuals involved in this epic battle. A soldier stuck on the beach,the captain of one of small boats and an RAF pilot. Nolan cleverly moves from each character to character until there paths cross in one way or another. The action is relentless from start to finish and the Spitfire Luftwaffe dog fights are simply breathtaking. Hans Zimmers superb score adds to what is a visual feast. By the end if your British there will be a lump in your throat maybe a tear in your eye. Was Dunkirk a humiliating defeat? Well the history books may have us believe that but By the end of this movie it felt like a glorious victory!
3.0~Void, uninteresting, and cold technical vista from Christopher Nolan luqmanfatahillah Sign in Permalink Nolan has been a storyteller that build his movie on plot rather than character, as the latter were usually just there to move the story along instead of someone to root for. He tried to build fleshed out character in Interstellar and failed to fully portray a human emotion that ultimately renders them unable to be cared about, although he spent the majority of the film trying to get us to care about the characters. In this movie (Dunkirk) he goes back to his usual 'blank-characters and work on plots more' routine and judging by his track record and the lack of clear star actor in the exception of Tom Hardy (who is underutilized and even he didn't bring anything special) anyone coming in the movie expecting a story with no discernible characters are correct. But, what is very confusing is why did he even bother to set up conflicts for these characters (i.e one of the characters from the arc is dead from falling down a stairs (truly) after a certain Cillian Murphy uncharacteristically goes into rampage while he never hinted that the character have violent tendencies due to his shell shock) that requires us to CARE about them in the first place. Okay the 'french- suddenly-thought-to-be-German-Spies- somehow' opened the door that could save some people including the one who were there in the first frame of the film (AKA the young soldier), and that gives us a reason to care when they tried to get him out of the boat while one of the characters tried to stop him and the other are forcing him on gunpoint? If anything, the only tension and dread moment are generated by the score and camera movement and visual. The dialogue itself are..bad. it's on the nose level of exposition, it's uninteresting, and it's just overall unmemorable. Hans Zimmer is a very good composer. How Nolan approach him to do the scores for Interstellar results in a very beautiful score. But his work on Dunkirk is, to say the least, mismatched. To realize that a man like Nolan who insist on shooting his movie on film roll and practical effect would conceive a mismatched, orchestral score that didn't sound grounded and even has techno beat in it that really did not fit the pictures shown. The score is not even memorable, since there's no recognizable theme that would be associated with the movie immediately (such as 'No Time for Caution' in Interstellar or 'Dream is Collapsing' in Inception) and it seems they approach the scoring beat-by-beat rather than working on a certain mood that wants to be conveyed. The visuals are, granted, is beautiful, while there is some poorly lit shot that clearly wasn't meant to be THAT dark. But, it gets tiring after a while due to Nolan's tendencies to reuse the same shot but just from different angle and different object to focus on (like seriously why do we keep seeing the right side of the cockpit on Tom Hardy's plane, is the left gone or something?). On the plus note, the production design and sound editing are of the highest quality. Wouldn't be surprised if it will receive an award or two in that department. The movie takes the theme of survival as an event rather than a state of emotion. It renders the movie to be stone-cold in it's tense moment and dull in it's calm moment (which there is little of), and become something you'd just behold and hear and hopefully immerse yourself in it. But due to his forced effort to make us care about this nameless character, and other reason that is stated above, this could be the least interesting of Nolan's film. I don't see anyone will analyze it's story or direction or even it's color scheme which is downright limited in the coming time. I don't see it as a classic in Nolan's filmography. I see a list of things Nolan should address and wonder where to improve his next project.
9.0~Suspenseful and riveting akwonghuynh Sign in Permalink Nolan doesn't approach Dunkirk like other war movies. There are no scenes of dialogue where the characters are humanised, nor any visceral scenes of battle to hammer in how hellish war is. Instead, the implication of horror and sparse dialogue, coupled with Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack, creates a tense atmosphere where time feels like it's running out. Though the characters don't say much, we relate to them in fear, and action. As expected, there are neat little details in every character's action that makes them unique. This movie is definitely worth a watch.
9.0~a thrill for all your senses. rs8282 Sign in Permalink this movie is a ride from beginning to end. i sat in the motion D-box seats (i always do if this is an option) unlike some recent movies this really added to the intensity of the movie. from the bullets and bombs exploding, to the high g maneuvers and the sway of the ocean, it truly feels like you are there in the middle of the action. the score made every scene feel like something epic was about to happen and it did. this movie doesn't tease you or play with your thoughts, it puts you in the soldier's shoes and you feel the constant fear that they will either die, be left behind or have lost all hope. the way the story was filmed seemed odd at first, if you don't pay attention there are a few scenes that are repeated but told at different times in the movie. so you'll see it from one point of view and in that point the scene goes from day to night and then that same scene will cut back to day and shot from a different perspective after a few other scenes have played out. watch it in d-box if you have the option and this is a movie meant to be viewed on the big screen.
3.0~I won't get that wasted time back markaskew-05970 Sign in Permalink Expected so much after all the hype but left feeling that I'd wasted valuable the time. Glorified garbage which concentrates purely on the German aircraft strafing the beach and not what really happened and the mass slaughter that occurred on the edge of the same beach. The movie spends the second half concentrating on one family who take part in the rescue, easily leaving the dock which is now in Naval hands and then a very boring trip to Dunkirk in which the father lost his son to a rescued soldier who was freaking out and yet no one blinked a eyelid. Utter garbage, just another film Warner Bros has spent vast sums of money creating a story about nothing and marketed with a similar budget.
3.0~Unworthy drjgardner Sign in Permalink Clumsy editing, poor character development, and a lack of historical basis make this one of the worst war films to come along in recent years. What WW2 films did I like best? In no particular order - The Longest Day, a Bridge too far, A Walk in the Sun, Hell in the Pacific, The Great Escape, Saving Private Ryan, Bridge over the River Kwai, Attack, Hangmen Also Die, The Dirty Dozen, Kanal, Das Boot, Run Silent Run Deep, etc.
7.0~Very interesting movie. Imme-van-Gorp Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a war movie that shows three different storylines that sort of come together at the end. Every storyline follows a certain individual in a certain situation. This makes it so that you can really see what happens during an event like this for multiple different kinds of people. It brings you closer to what's happening instead of a main character or something. The first storyline is on land and is mostly played by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Aneurin Barnard. It follows an inexperienced soldier (Whitehead) who is just trying to find a way out of Dunkirk, just like every other soldier at the beach. He then picks up two soldiers (Styles and Barnard) along the way who he stays with for the rest of the journey. I think the best thing about this storyline was the constant fear you felt for what could happen. Something I found really good was the chemistry between Whitehead and Styles, I think the best parts from this storyline were whenever Styles got on screen. The second storyline is in the sky and is mostly played by Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden. It follows two pilots, who sort of witness all the horrible events from above, while trying to help as much as they can. I think I least enjoyed this storyline out of the three of them, because it felt very unpersonal and I wasn't really impressed by anything that happened during these parts. The best thing about this storyline must be Tom Hardy, since his acting was, as always, on par. The third storyline is at sea and is mostly played by Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney. It follows a man, a son and a young assistant going off to sea to try and save some of the men stuck at Dunkirk. I was very impressed with Glynn-Carney's acting during his parts and I very much enjoyed it. I think this has to be the most emotional storyline, because you get closest to these three characters out of the whole film, but one might argue that it is also the most boring storyline, because there isn't that much fear that anything will happen to them. 7/10. -Imme van Gorp
4.0~A monotonic and essentially dull film medcolpa Sign in Permalink I saw the film at the BAFTA screening in NYC on 18-July-2017. I went with some trepidation as my father was at Dunkirk (and my mother's first husband was a RAF pilot who was shot down during WW2). Much to my surprise I found the film rather boring. The vast majority of the action is extremely repetitive. The British soldiers trying to escape are continually thwarted in some way by water, holes in the hulls of the boats, followed by lots of swimming, standing/sleeping on the beach waiting for the next chance to do the same thing. This frustration is inter-cut with two other main story lines (not really stories, and that is the problem). RAF Spitfires coming over the Channel to help. Finally, the heroes of the rescue, the plucky small boats from the south coast, sensibly represented by one craft with three crew. The reality is this is film which we know what happens, as this is a historical truth - many soldiers are rescued by the small boats (I ticked spoiler in case you do not know this!). The inter-cutting of the latter two story lines with the soldiers is filmed is a poor way. First from a technical point of view - the no continuity of lighting. I know the weather is highly changeable in the Channel but the same scene is at once brightly sunlit, then cloudy, then grey, then sunlit within seconds. This happened so much that I wonder if they did it deliberately. Secondly, there is a slight historical non-linear telling of the three stories as they intersect. The idea is obvious to see the story from different points of view. But why? It is not as if the view points generate fundamentally different moral perspectives. However the core problem is there is no real narrative in the film. We do not get a chance to care in any way about the characters. This truth in stark contrast to much much better films about war. The simplest example to point to is "Mrs. Miniver", a truly great film about war and, as it happens, Dunkirk. There are many reviewers giving this new film 10 with 'greatest war I have ever seen'. With no narrative and scene scene showing the same thing, it cannot be. Other great war films: "The Grand Illusion" and "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket".
3.0~what a waste of money & opportunity to make a good war movie ssalim-20457 Sign in Permalink i am giving 3 out 10 just because for sound or else its a boring movie,since this is my first review because i was really angry by watching this movie,they waste good chance to give another great war movie,first i don't understand whats going on,just what a point to show people on the beach strangled,no emotion no comedy nothing
1.0~Unbearable 104 minutes cdpmedia1 Sign in Permalink Art is subjective, so if staring at a Jackson Pollock for 120 minutes is your thing, there is nothing to debate here. So for all you art lovers that appreciate the 'cinematic' art of watching the same plane circle around for 104 minutes to the continuous sonic backdrop of the most irritating droning score I've ever heard put on film, I won't argue that you were entertained. As for the historical and realistic qualities of this pile or the thin and useless character and plot development, you have no case. This movie is truly an epic waste that was torture to sit through. You will learn virtually nothing about the Dunkirk operation and you will suffer through an unbearable 2 hours to find that out.
4.0~Another mediocre movie slaying at the box office kcguice Sign in Permalink Movie making by the numbers. Do this, this and this and you have a hit movie. It looks great. The story is good. The actors are good. The direction and pace of the movie is good. Spoiler alert. Basically this movie is about one soldier's desperation to survive. He is one among 400,000 other soldiers in the same boat -- so to speak. Pun intended. By his own cunning and that of an allied soldier he meets along the way and both of them's outrageous luck they make it aboard ship after ship only to have that ship be torpedoed or sank by bombers. It gets unintentionally comical after the 5th or 6th time. I might have been tempted to doze off; but there is no chance of that because the musical score is deafening. The machine guns are very loud, too.
8.0~A Beautifully yet weak film. mikeyf9 Sign in Permalink Before I bash the film, I should at least praise it. The film like every Nolan film looks beautiful. The cinematography alone can keep you engaged. Also the crew did a nice job creating the look of WW2. I also like the non-main character way of telling a story a little bit because it feels like your in an actual battle where your focusing on multiple peoples lives instead of just one. The acting was also on point from all of the cast as usual in a Nolan film. Now the bad. From the start of it, the film assumes you know who the combatants were at Dunkirk, when it was, and also where it was. There isn't even any slang by the British like "Hun" or "Jerry" to identify the enemy. Were just supposed to know. Also back to the main character problem, although it's good from a war perspective, for the audience perspective, it just seems a very artsy move, which it is. We have no band of character to latch onto. Also the "why" problem. There is no mention of why they are at the beach, why there is a German advance. There is no background!
5.0~Good, Not Great treynolds57 Sign in Permalink My wife and I went to see the current Dunkirk film as an IMAX presentation this past weekend. I went hoping to see a great film and left somewhat disappointed. What could've been a great film, turned out to be only a good film. As has been mentioned by some there is precious little if any character development and I mean very little. Kenneth Branagh has a very small part as a British naval commander overseeing the Navy's part in the evacuation from the beaches at Dunkirk. The score if I could be called that, it's not so much musical as much as pulsating noise very much like Jaws. The story arc is comprised of three different viewpoints of the evacuation: air sea and land. While this is somewhat compelling on the surface, without some details and character development it ends up being spread far too thin. Some things that were confusing or inaccurate: there is a curious back and forth between day and night scenes, but my take was that all three stories (land, sea and air) were supposedly happening simultaneously? That and those few British warships shown don't actually seem to fight. They do a good job of getting bombed and are shown sinking, but not fighting. Come on... I realize that there are few tangible assets (planes and ships) remaining from the WWII era, but surely British destroyers weren't sitting ducks for Stukas? One WANTS to like this film. The history is real and the reality of evacuation of an entire army compelling, but for us, it just didn't work. There is nothing from Churchill, no Admiralty meetings: the details are simply inferred. I'd love to be more upbeat about it, but can't. Sorry...
10.0~One more great piece of Nolan umnichka-80756 Sign in Permalink I'm not fan of movies about war at all, but some days ago I was impressed by The Prestige and wanted to see more Nolan. There are no gory fights or something that will affectedly play on your emotions. However, it held me in suspense the whole screening. Lack of tough story-line did not let me get bored. The story tells us about thousands deadlocked people. So much as wanting back to home, some afraid of conviction and milksop mark. It is not focused on one main person. We can see the situation from different angels, and I liked each. Also, tired of variegated films, my eyes enjoyed color grading and great acting of the cast that surprised me. I like all about this movie, it literally stroke a chord with me.
8.0~CLOCKWORK DUNKIRK / Film magician Christopher Nolan tells the harrowing World War II story code-named Operation Dynamo by crisscrossing the Architecture of Place & Time . . . StoryArchitect Sign in Permalink 1. If you haven't seen DUNKIRK, don't read this. And if you have seen DUNKIRK, go see it again. Ideally, 70mm film (not digital), 2.20:1 widescreen. Because DUNKIRK presents far more than a thrilling visceral spectacle and dramatic reenactment of an historical event. This movie must be seen twice--at least twice--to fully grasp its clockwork architecture. 2. For screenwriter and director Christopher Nolan, Cinema is Art--a grand creative chess game costarring Form and Story. On the rectangular chessboard of the silver screen, the White Knight of Form and the Black Knight of Story (my terms) engage in collaborative "conflict"--"the basis of every art," as Sergei Eisenstein said in Film Form (1949). Nolan knows, A movie is a game, and a game has rules. And in DUNKIRK, a Bobby Fischer level expression of the Chess Game of Art, Nolan plays by very special rules. 3. My second viewing confirmed things I saw the first time about Nolan's One Word Theme: Time. (And sidekick, Place.) And revealed far more I didn't see. Time serves as Nolan's OWT throughout his work--for example, MEMENTO and INTERSTELLAR. Specifically, Story Time. Which in DUNKIRK, Nolan elastically shapes, bends, staggers, previews, rewinds, fast forwards, accelerates, and compresses . . . through his RASHOMON-like artistic filter . . . most obviously conveyed by showing us the downed British pilot's water landing twice. Think about it. Nolan shows us that water landing twice! 4. Through titles, Nolan posts the Place & Time structure of his story up front. Events on the Mole (Land) take place over a week. On the Sea, in a day. In the Air, in an hour--virtually real time relative to the duration of the movie. Slow Land and faster Sea take place in the Past relative to fastest-of-all Air, which takes place in the Present--the Future relative to Land and Sea--until one fateful moment. My second viewing revealed methodical nothing-is-random telling and retelling of key scenes as the Past of Land and Sea catch up with the Present of Air. Land and Sea time moves faster and faster, compression accelerating, to the second act climax when BAM, KABOOM . . . the German bomber (Villain) goes down. Conflagration ensues (signaling False Victory), the Moonstone rescues Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) . . . and action rebuilds until Land and Sea and Air intersect, EXPLODE, for one split second into a synchronized convergent Present of cheers at the end of the second act . . . when the three Place & Time Zones crisscross into a reversal, Sea and Land moving forward into the Present and Future . . . and Air gliding into the Past. All Place & Time lead to that crucial climactic Moment . . . when just when he thinks they're safe, startled--the Villain rising to strike one last time--Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) closes his eyes, resigned to their devastating fate . . . and the frame starts to go white . . . then suddenly, this False Defeat turns to Victory as the last German fighter plane gets shot down. 5. On first viewing, how could we know, Follow the Moonstone--captained by Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance)--which first-time viewers will unlikely spot in the frame of Nolan's first unspooling of the plane's water landing. How could we know, Follow the trawler--the beached bullet-riddled fishing boat--that we see sinking long before we see the soldiers climb into it. But on second viewing, we can see more clearly Nolan's magic act, his sleight of hand, his deft design, simultaneously concealed and revealed, of the Architecture of Place & Time. 6. The stunning Hans Zimmer score and the sound design reinforce Nolan's exacting choreography of Time. Listen for the tick tick. And watch how many times characters look at their watches, including British pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy), who checks his watch and chalks the time on his control panel to calculate how long his fuel will last. See how beautifully Nolan edits the film at the end, collating the frames of Hoyte van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography so that the slow peaceful heroic descent of the airplane onto the beach--when Air and Land and Sea again poetically merge--parallels the same slowing down, the same timing, of the train with our mole. (Nolan plays on the meaning of mole, threading our stand in, Tommy, through the story from beginning to end, seen from the back in the first frame and from the front in the last frame. Mole in a figurative sense: The mole is our spy, one of the main ways we get inside the story. He spies for us.) 7. I need a third watch to unravel Nolan's Möbius strip moves. When does Farrier shoot down that last fighter? Does he loop back after he glides by Bolton? Or does Nolan pull a MEMENTO, showing the sequence backward-because Farrier shot the fighter down before gliding by? A riddle signaling how Nolan ups the complexity of his artistic chess game of Form & Story at this dramatic moment. Not only crisscrossing Time and Place . . . but also Direction and Space. 8. Yes, a movie is a game, and a game has rules--rules that the magic of movies can sustain, bend, and break that the Place & Time-bound reality of life can't. But at the same time, the Form & Story art of DUNKIRK presents a creative demonstration of the scientific truth of the relativity of Space and Time. And Observation. Nolan riffs on Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON (1950), gathering witnesses inside and outside the story, summoning us to witness the film's deep structure as we sort out what's happening . . . where . . . and when. 9. My Silver Knight Rating of DUNKIRK: White Knight (Form): 9 Black Knight (Story): 8 = Silver Knight (Form & Story): 8.5 8.5 Cameras (I explain my Silver Knight Rating system in my IMDb commentary on ARRIVAL.)
2.0~Boring documentary lecajun Sign in Permalink I had high hopes for this film. I enjoy watching historic movies based on actual events (Saving Private Ryan, From Here To Eternity, A bridge Too Far, etc). I was really enthusiastic when it was announced that Christopher Nolan would be the director as I am a fan of his movies too. Then I watched Dunkirk. This movie seems like a 2 hour documentary on the evacuation than anything else. There is barely a shred of any story. We have 3 different scenarios going on that have little to do with each other, besides the fact that they are going on during the evacuation. The dialogue seems to be written half the time by a 10 year old and the rest of the time by an expert in military communications. And it seems like the actors were told to just stand around and do nothing for most of the film. I really can't be live this was made by the same man who directed the Dark Knight trilogy.
9.0~Dunkirk (2017) Film Review scottingram Sign in Permalink The new war, action, drama, history film Dunkirk based on the true story of D Day that took place in June 1944 during World War 2 starring Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth Branagh, Harry Styles once of music boy band One Direction, Jack Lowden. Dunkirk opens as hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops are surrounded by enemy forces. Trapped on the beach with their backs to the sea they face an impossible situation as the enemy closes in. Dunkirk features a prestigious cast, including English Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max: Fury Road) as Farrier, English actor Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies, The BFG) as Mr. Dawson, Northern Ireland actor Kenneth Branagh (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit) as Commander Bolton and Republic Of Ireland actor Cillian Murphy (The Dark Knight films, Inception) as a Shivering Soldier, as well as newcomer English actor Fionn Whitehead as Tommy. The ensemble cast also includes Welsh actor Aneurin Barnard (UK TV Mini-Series Cilla and War & Peace) as Gibson, former English member of English music boy band One Direction Harry Styles as Alex, English actor James D'Arcy (Let's Be Cops, Jupiter Ascending) as Colonel Winnant, English actor Jack Lowden (Denial, A United Kingdom) as Collins, Barry Keoghan ('71, Trespass Against Us) as George and Tom Glynn-Carney as Peter. Filming locations in Dunkirk include countries, cities, places like Dunkerque, Northern France, English counties like Hampshire, Dorset, Holland, US State California, USA. Overall Dunkirk is a brilliant war, action, drama, history film filled with war, action, drama, history, violence, shooting, soldiers in World War 2, ships, boats, air jets, sea, beaches, the will to survive and will, loyalty, team work, togetherness, a race against time, outstanding performances from all the actors involved, a good insight in to what the soldiers had to go through during World War 2 and many other things throughout the film. So I will give Dunkirk an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars and Dunkirk is worth seeing if you like other war films like Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates, Empire Of The Sun, The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, Full Metal Jacket, Cross Of Iron, Schindler's List, The Thin Red Line amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Dunkirk in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.
3.0~Fog of War rking007 Sign in Permalink Between the British accent and the background noise, I could not understand even 1/2 of the dialogue. Also get to know how to identify the German planes from the British. It is very hard to know who to cheer for. This movie definitely needs subtitles. I traveled 15 miles to see it in IMAX after seeing all the good reviews. The sound was so loud that it was annoying but it still did not help me understand what the main characters were saying. What a waste. This director is too full of himself.
7.0~Dunkirk is well-done, but not a legit rival of either its "war" film, nor Nolan produced predecessors chrisguest Sign in Permalink ...However, if you go to see Dunkirk under the impression of having your mind blown by the next great wartime classic of our generation, then you may be slightly disappointed. I admit I was in this group. Earlier on, I mentioned Nolan is my favorite director, and he still is. But after watching him in previous works do things like dismantle the predecessors of the superhero and sci-fi genres in one shot each, I wanted so badly for him to do the same with the war genre. I wanted to leave saying, "Tom Hanks needs to step his game up now with the historical war films, because Nolan set the bar higher again!" But I didn't find myself saying thatat all.

4.0~Where were the 400,000 men on a beach cox526 Sign in Permalink I cant conclude that this was a masterpiece or an epic - it most certainly wasn't - There are a few reviews on here that match my sentiment - the editing was poor several stories come together but are done almost ad hoc with a scene being almost a flashback to a previous scene where a plane that was shot down is then shot down again as part of a different story within the same story (if that makes sense). I watched the 1958 version of Dunkirk and it had more intensity than this the fear of the daily bombing and fear of drowning, fear of not getting off the beach alive - well that intensity was lacking in this there appeared to be a few hundred men on a beach who were occasionally attacked by 3 stucka dive bombers there were moments when you wanted something to happen and when it did you wondered what the hell it was about as there would be no dialogue. I felt like screaming what did you spend £150 millions on. It could have been so much more, special effects could have had thousands on a beach not a random selection of soldiers here and there there could have been more little boats coming towards Dunkirk. However, some things were done well the ship saving men and then only to be sunk again. Showing the desperation to survive and the cost of that survival. The spitfire scenes where we learnt something of what the RAF learnt in aerial combat that prepared them for the battle to come and the crew of the little boat and how they epitomised the spirit of Dunkirk - that was done exceptionally well but I was very disappointed about the rest and don't expect to see Oscars where there was little dialogue to deserve such.
1.0~High expectation but failed badly after i watched it acolytes_nirvana Sign in Permalink the only reason i am giving 2 star is because i loved Tom Hardy's performance and is a big fan of him ! i had so much expectation and was eagerly waiting to watch it but this movie failed me ! Rest of the actors were average for such a big movie! In real history there were total 693 British ships engaged in the action and out of them 226 were sunk, but in the movie i barely saw more than 30 including small ships and boats, it was so unrealistic.. The sound effect was poor and they were constantly saying 300,000 men is present on the beach but there was nomore than 3000 men.. in overall it was a budget movie , i wonder where they really spent 100million dollars
9.0~Entirely enthralled. shirahkinder Sign in Permalink Going into Dunkirk I had no expectations, only because I saw the trailer once and moved past it. It was a friend who got me to go. The beginning held little dialogue, which turned out to set the tone perfectly, causing me to become immediately immersed into a war torn world (WWII). There was a small bit of reading and as an English junkie, or so I like to call myself, that had me stumped on whether or not it was correct grammar. In the end, it was correct. Other than that, the movie was well paced, full of action, and created a connection with all of its characters. The revisited story made for a movie that will not easily be forgotten in my mind. Also, Harry Styles played his role incredibly well. I was impressed overall.
4.0~Where's a Narrative with Connected Tissue? johnclark-1 Sign in Permalink Mr. Nolan thinks that he can break the basic rules of story telling without fear because, well, he is Christopher Nolan. One of the first rules is you have to CARE about your leading characters. Does this happen here? Did we ever get to know anything about the characters' character? No. We look at the thin-lipped dour-faced fave of British drama, the Right Hon, no, Lord, not yet, Sir, Kenneth Branagh. He, along with everyone else, is but a puppet for Mr. Nolan to pull the strings of. As Documentary with punch, OK. As Drama, definitely not. I felt I'd been cheated out of a clear story line, a connected narrative. Mr. Nolan might benefit from examining the book for all screenwriters, Robert McKee's STORY (substance, structure, style and principles of screen writing). As I left the Imax Cinema on Citiwalk at Universal last night, a feast of Forrest Gump shrimp filled the empty space in my stomach, if not my assaulted brain.
6.0~Dunkirk is one of Nolan's WORST movies ! dharmendra-76481 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is one of Nolan's WORST movies ! Why ? Because Nolan's movies stand for things like 1 ) Detailed characterisation . That normally happens by a huge amount of talking between characters 2 ) Great suspense. & no not only endings 3 ) Extraordinary dialogues that give you a high - think " You see I m not a monster - I m just ahead of the curve " . Dunkirk had NOTHING of the above I think Nolan had a drink with Ram Gopal Varma ( hic )
1.0~Inaccurate and boring... beregic Sign in Permalink I gave up after 1h. I knew that this movie is a false "hero" propaganda (Hitler's controversy "stop order" allowing England extract its soldiers denies this movie "under siege" plot) but nevertheless, I thought maybe i see some realistic action.... none of that here...just some dramatized sequences that are suppose to be "real" for city-dwellers . Very bad movie all around :(
6.0~War is hell. But we knew that, didn't we? mciaffa-75333 Sign in Permalink War is hell. But we knew that, didn't we? This well made chronology of hellish experiences in WWII doesn't make for a really good movie or a moving morality play. Shocking as the events may seem on the screen, the film fails to connect the death and destruction with a broader cause that the British were fighting for against Hitler. Despite the uplifting ending, the movie never makes a case for why the losses were worthwhile. Absent the same,the movie gets only a qualified favorable review. Worth seeing, but not best picture material by any means.
4.0~No chills or goosebumps SaifurRahmanMohsin Sign in Permalink The worst Nolan movie so far... Based on how the Academy has been handing out awards, I'd say this would win some Oscars just like how Leonardo DiCaprio won his first for his worst movie ever (The Revenant Movie) rather than the series of epic movies he's worked on. * No bootstrap paradox (which is usually Nolan's signature). * You won't be able to connect to the characters. * No proper character development or back stories. * Overused Hans Zimmer music with no timing. I guess Europeans would like it considering it has to do with their history. Usually, with Nolan movies, there are one or more turning points in the story (with epic Hans Zimmer music to suit it) where the audience is captivated and end up with chills and goosebumps but I didn't have such an experience in this movie.
6.0~Re-writing History rbrb Sign in Permalink The cinematography and direction of this movie is excellent and for that reason at least it is worth viewing. However my understanding of the real events of Dunkirk and the truth about it was that it represented a retreat and a disaster. Yet the film puts a positive "spin" on what really happened. Furthermore: there are many people in the world who are unaware of the history of the real Dunkirk and for much of this picture the events come across-to me at least- as muddled and confused. For the above and other reasons the best I can do is 6 and a half which after anxious consideration I round down to: 6/10.
7.0~Jetlag TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink The Dunkirk evacuation can be seen as three distinct elements working to accomplish this overall goal. The mole, where thousands of soldiers were for a week trying to survive and escape their hopeless situation. The sea, where civilians spent a day sailing their boats to transport the troops. And the air, where spitfire planes could last for an hour before refueling. All have stories worth telling. And as three separate episodes of a mini-series, it could work. Instead, they're mercilessly inter-cut, with this confusing time-line preventing the otherwise willing and game audience from becoming properly engaged with what we're seeing. It works as a series of tiny moments of humanity. Not as a whole. The entirety of this is using the snowball effect previously used well by Nolan in his third acts. This could become exhausting. However, there's time to breathe. Small victories that are celebrated(with whatever tea is available at the time. Not even kidding). There are no leads, merely characters that have more screen-time than others. No development, no one to get into? I disagree. They're all relate-able, trying to make it past the day. Or even just the second. This is tense, and you're never truly safe. It moves briskly, without rushing. This *is* indeed very loud, and those with genuinely sensitive ears may have to wait for the home release, despite that they'll lose out. I recommend this to any fan of Nolan. 7/10
6.0~Boring! sahebaazbanzara Sign in Permalink I was expecting too much for this movie but it was disappointing and boring. The story is good but the way of storytelling is just too boring.
5.0~Acceptable. Shallow, somewhat rambling, a basic drama. josealud Sign in Permalink It is a film that does not deepen in the real history of the battle of Dunkirk; Focuses on the attempted embarkation of the troops; But from a general point of view, has a good photograph, the landscape and the locations are very good, I miss exalting more the dramatic moments of the film, that is, make it more visceral, more vivid. The film shows the same story from different perspectives; Is interesting,unfortunately the transit between scenes, that is, the management of the perspectives in time were misdirected. It could be said that it is a feature that breaks schemas, that is to say, it stops being cliché because it does not include what we could clearly call a main protagonist, it does not include a woman, there is not a love story in the middle of the tragedy, the film Not focusing on heroism but telling the event of evacuation of troops, but we could not say that he moved away from Hollywood cinema to show it from the historical point of view because the truth is very superfluous, etc. The film is acceptable as entertainment plus leaves a tasteless Christopher Nolan one of the best directors, writers and producers.
3.0~A wasted opportunity. Style over substance. PaddySlattery Sign in Permalink Note: This is my first ever IMDb contribution. Lets put a few things aside first, like the fact that Christopher Nolan wrote/directed while Hans Zimmer composed the score; Hoyte van Hoytema helming cinematography with an incredible cast of familiar faces mixed with fresh new faces in a film based on a story inspired by a landmark moment in history where countless men and women senselessly lost their lives at war......Yep, leaving all those factors aside, lets judge this film on its own merits. I should also mention that I haven't heard or read one single review of this film yet so I'm not swayed or influence by anyone. I'm looking forward to hearing other peoples views tho, because I've a feeling this film may divide opinion; maybe not immediately with the hype machine in full flow but later down the line when the dust settles. Anywho.... where to begin!? The positives - The film looks incredible (cinematography, production design and costume) and you know its not a good sign when you have to start off with how good it looks....but it does. It looks great. Oscar worthy greatness. It's the one note that was perfectly hit in this film, in my honest opinion. Speaking of hitting notes... Hans Zimmer's score was, eh, great, too....but.... eh.... let me see..... how do I.....? OK, let's tackle the negatives - Well, you see, Hans' great score was hindered by an extremely disjointed script. Yes, there I said it. This script was an absolute mess and don't give me that BS about "Oh Chris was going for a chaotic mess of a script in order to truly reflect the physical chaos of the" ...no. Just no. You can portray a chaotic mess and still beautifully craft a coherent story with proper character development. (See Saving Private Ryan). Poor old Han's score, which showed great promise at times, was ripped apart during a long succession of badly crafted sequences and non-linear time-lines. What made this 2 hours (felt like 3) even more excruciating was the desperate measure Nolan employed with the sound design in order to hold audiences attention to a story that failed gloriously to do so. At the end of the film, when he turned off the "tension builder" sound effect, I was left there feeling.... WOW. Was that it? Really? I've seen many great war movies in my life ie. Paths of Glory, Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, The Longest Day, Black Hawk Down, The Deer Hunter, The Pianist, Ivan's Childhood, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Empire of the Sun, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc. etc. etc. and what each and every one of these films had in common was humanity. A story that speaks to the heart of their heroes AND villains. Even through a variety of brilliantly chosen lenses, Dunkirk failed to let us in. It just gave us a sequence of events wrapped up in one big event, garnished with great action and visuals and said "go make sense of it yourself". Don't get me wrong, that's not always a bad thing. I love to work as an audience member, but mining for a soul in this film would have felt like mining for gold on the bog of Allen. And such a great selection of character actors, too, including our own (Irish) Cillian Murphy and Barry Keoghan, with so much to offer, but if its not on the page, the actors can only give you so much. I know.... harsh right? Who the fudge do I think I am, wha? Don't worry, the film will make it's millions back and all will be well but I still fell this was a huge wasted opportunity. I watched this film with 6 other people last night and I even spoke with a few others in the cinema after the film. Everyone I spoke to felt let down by the story and how it was told. Everyone also thought it looked great, so I guess there is that. Will Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk stand the test of time and join the extraordinary league of epic war movies? Only time will tell. Personally, I don't think it comes close. Out of ten, I'd give this film a sturdy 5.5. It looks great with great performances and its relentlessly honest in its portrayal, aside from a couple of forced sentimental moments at the end. As for the story itself....Well, it felt sterile and cold. Of course, that was Nolan's intention,I'm sure.
4.0~Garbage leomilan Sign in Permalink Dunkirk, worst movie of Nolan's career. Dunkirk is an awful movie with a confusing non-linear story telling that didn't include any titles to direct audience in the direction of the plot. Also, there was a huge lack of dialogue so even more so the audience got lost. On the bright side the visuals were spectacular and the acting was amazing but that alone can't carry the lackluster plot and bad writing.
10.0~Spellbindingly British. chancerchris Sign in Permalink From my seat on the back row I could see the majority of the audience were middle aged and elderly. All seats were occupied; a full house. From beginning to end there was complete silence and nobody went to the toilets... amazing! I imagine people were remembering fathers and uncles just like I was. At the end everyone sat there as the credits rolled then quietly exited the auditorium. I felt that had I clapped there would have been a roar of patriotic applause. Thank you Christopher Nolan.
2.0~Brexit hgreisman Sign in Permalink Ever since its release, Dunkirk has garnered more than the usual share of column inches granted a movie in the UK press. I can only assume that it has a special resonance for the English audience. Maybe it's all tied into Brexit, and other things that many Americans don't understand. I for one don't understand how British GIs, who'd been serially defeated by their adversaries, and had been on the run for over a month, could maintain their schoolboy haircuts and find time to shave every day. The English equivalent of Hollywood's Central Casting must have been pressed into service: The BEF appears to have been an army of heartthrobs, so much so that halfway through I figured the movie was produced with a gay audience in mind. The retreating Brits must have had an extraordinary quartermaster, because the Tommies sport uniforms with nary a tear or a smudge. Although I can't claim any combat experience, my overall impression is that people bleed when they're shot, and that battlefields resemble smelly junkyards littered with body parts. In Christopher Nolan's vision of war, even the dead are well-groomed. One might think that following media coverage of terrorist attacks, audiences would be bemused at the sight of cadavers that looked like the undertakers had just finished getting them ready for the viewing. That PG-13 rating must require an awful lot of sanitizing. And who, may I ask, kept the Germans at bay so the BEF could evacuate? You'd never guess it from the movie. It was the much-maligned French army; maybe even worse led than that of their ally's. Casualties were heavy among those left behind. After a particularly brutal march to Trier, Germany, survivors spent the next five years as POWs or forced laborers. The genuine heroism of the little guys who piloted their boats across the channel is sadly rendered mawkish by wooden performances and painful clichés. And the CGI that several reviewers rave about looked to me like cartoons; in fact, the whole feature has an animated feel. Toward the end of the movie, my mind wandered, and a rogue thought conjured up memories of Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap, in particular the bit where narrator "Marty DiBergi" describes the faux heavy metal group as one of England's loudest bands. If there's an Oscar for decibels, then Dunkirk is a shoo-in.
1.0~Emotionless, spiritless tripe. Looks great though. jtins Sign in Permalink Like everyone else, I was really looking forward to this. Well, they say that expectation leads to disappointment, and nothing could be more true in this case. The British evacuation of Dunquerqe was on of the most emotional events of the whole Second World War, and this admittedly beautifully filmed, pice of dross conveyed absolutely none of that. I'll leave it to others to pick holes in the technical aspects, but I will say that a Spitfire of that year had enough ammunition for 15 seconds of firing. I'd recommend avoiding this, and finding a copy of Mrs Miniver instead.
3.0~Myeh.... hatlad Sign in Permalink Went to see DUNKIRK a few days ago. It's taken me that long to put my reaction to it into words. Fair warning; probably this whole review has some level of spoiler in the wording so consider this your spoiler alert. Firstly, let me point out that I eagerly awaited this movie. Unfortunately, my thoughts at the end were, "Well, it's a typical British movie." In that, several subplots just started in the middle and ended in the middle. Case in point, no explanation given to how the school chum of the boat owner's kid got into the act of being at the dock to jump on board or why. For that matter, there really wasn't much character development from start to finish which left the whole movie seeming to be pretty shallow and meaningless. And, the whole Air:1 hour, Sea:1 day, Land:1 week thing just fell flat. There was no explanation of that whole flow at the beginning or throughout so the audience was just left to figure it out – or not. And, there really wasn't much credible attempt to tie them all together by the end of the movie. there were several occasions where the same event was suddenly and seemingly out of sequence relived from a different character's perspective. This left the audience thinking "Wait! I'm confused. Didn't that guy already die/that ship already sink/that airplane already go down?" So the audience had to figure out the "reliving" thing all on their own which risked the audience not connecting the events correctly. That whole "last Spitfire" thing was an abomination to the point of being insulting to anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of aircraft, aerodynamics, physics, etc. Firstly, I thought the damned thing was gonna glide so long after running out of fuel that the pilot was going to need an "expect further clearance" time. And to think that an aircraft that's ran out of gas could be capable of superior aerial combat over an enemy aircraft is just downright absurd. The burning Spitfire thing at the end - to prevent it from falling into enemy hands - was fine and factual except that the obvious lack of an engine in the fire and instead a big broomstick was holding up the propeller was a joke. Overall, this whole flick just seemed incredibly shallow. Like an attempt to be artsy that just fell flat. About the only benefit to me seeing this movie was the new perspective to the Dunkirk evacuation that the troops evacuated may have left the beach more than once (as different ships were sunk out from under them) before finally reaching England.
3.0~this won 3 oscars? really?! mohameddawoud-26019 Sign in Permalink Boring, disappointing and repetitive scenes. oh god and the soundtrack, it just does not match with the scenes. two or three fighters, some hundreds of soldiers and some small ships.. and that's it.. is this dunkirk we read about in history books?
6.0~are you kidding me elvinasmi Sign in Permalink Say what you will but it is very overrated. The Batman movies are much more grand and interesting. There's not a single character to root for, hell, there's barely any emotion at all, you'll probably sit through it with a poker face like I did... Such a shame since the movie is wonderfully shot and has a great score. All I'm saying is... Don't hope for a masterpiece right before watching it because it isn't one. Kill down your hype a little bit. :D
1.0~Dreadfully Disappointing timwilzon Sign in Permalink What a depressing movie about a tremendously uplifting event. So many stories of real heroes and heroics to choose from, this Hollywood trash is inaccurate and depressing, focusing mainly on rotten events, and seeming, at least to me, to skimp on matters like extras and facts (photos from the time show warships with crowded decks not just enough to man the sides, ships did not anchor for loading due to the air threat, discipline remained excellent to the very end, even the Spitfires gyroscopic sight in the pretty good flying simulations was wrong for the time). Apart from Kenneth Branagh's role (and I suspect he might perhaps be embarrassed to be associated with the end version as his role stood apart as fittingly uplifting), this movie is insulting to the greatest generation and the French have a right to be upset too. No doubt many, particularly self-styled intellectuals, will disagree with me, and that's okay, but as one who grew up hearing stories from those who were there at Dunkirk and who has read a great deal about it, I think this travesty of a great story is Hollywood junk(unlike Saving Private Ryan which is excellent)!
2.0~Quite disliked it trpdean Sign in Permalink I was bored so much of the film - the plethora of characters about whom one knows nothing - and thus cares little; the remarkably confusing story line (three story lines - which cover one week, one day and one hour - in which we are supposed to see one line's incident reflected in the other story line at an earlier or later time - but this means we wonder which of the 17 times we see a ship blown up is significant to which point in another story line at a different point in the movie? Which of the planes we see knocked down is one we saw at another point - or shall see at another point from a different perspective? We don't care); the indifferent film score - nothing too grand, no real crescendo, nothing that could be described as patriotic; long long stretches in which nothing happens; the deliberate undercutting of the idea of the people as having an idealism great than self-interest - and many of the principal characters deliberately sabotaging the overall effort - or deceiving others - or acting in a xenophobic way - or committing suicide out of fear ... anything to undermine a "spirit of Dunkirk" emotional feeling; All this is quite deliberate by the director - and to have just spent $50 ($23.50 for the IMAX seat, another $27 for a hot dog, soda and popcorn) - simply makes one far more reluctant to attend a movie - no matter the many (wrong-headed) plaudits.
1.0~Stupid mezeraja Sign in Permalink Terrible, boring movie could not stand watching it
6.0~Not so cool zaria-34430 Sign in Permalink I don't know who is Christopher Nolan (i'm amateur), but giving 10 star because he's the director, is wrong. 10 minutes of dialog, no action, no music, no Nazi (i don't think was 5 words in German),airplane fights sucks, you can't call that fight (plus at end, that Spitfire fly 3+ hours with no fuel. How is this possible?). Just drama.Only the end saved this film, and it's the reason i give 6. When you think about a WW2 movie, you expect action, you expect blood, body's parts all over the place.This doesn't deserve a Oscar. Hacksaw Ridge was way better.
1.0~An Honest Review generationofswine Sign in Permalink It starts off well, with a little glimpse of a British Soldier that was as unprepared as the UK for the war. It's a nice teaser... ...then a little story about the civilian involvement with the evacuation... ...And it all comes with the promise of being a British "Saving Private Ryan." Unfortunately it ends up being a lot more Michael Bay than Steven Spielberg. that is to say that it looks nice and sleek and professional but is otherwise lacking in a real story. Spielberg managed to tell a story that was both pro-Soldier and anti-war, and that made the whole Normandy Beach until the very end a pleasure to watch. Dunkirk, on the other hand, gives up about 15 Minutes in and decides to just focus on the action with the story being an after thought. In short it's boring.
9.0~Spectacular Change in Pace for the War Genre EthanBJones_03 Sign in Permalink 'DUNKIRK' was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Fionn Whithead. In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.{And I won't count the story recap as spoilers, you will know that if you had an education. } This movie is a breath of fresh air in a genre were each of its films is fighting for recognition. Dunkirk is a truly intense and thrilling roller-coaster minute one and lasts until minute 120. Featuring excellent performances from the entire cast and Nolan's signature use of effects and sound design, this is a movie that you need to see in cinema's to truly appreciate. Probably enjoyable on a small screen but I 100% believe it benefits from wonders and joys of cinema screens. This movie is retelling the event of Dunkirk. And as far as I am aware, it does it really accurately. We follow the battle from land, air and sea, and the way Nolan interconnects all the stories is brilliant. None of them are connected at first but they slowly begin to join together as the film progresses. The ending is truly perfect and I can't praise Nolan enough for his endings. This may take a while. Mark Rylance was fantastic as Mr Dawson and did a great job a commanding the movie to his will. Tom Hardy is probably one of the best actors working today and does a phenomenal job as Farrier. Conveying emotion purely through your eyes is very, very, very impressive. Fionn Whithead was great as Tommy and it is amazing that he rarely ever spoke for the entire film. Harry Styles was good in the movie. A sentence I never thought I'd have to say and never will again. Cillian Murphy was great in his small role and gave a powerful performance as a man traumatised by the war. Keneth Braghan was great in his more minor role but still managed to make a commanding performance. I am doubly impressed by the acting in this movie due to the fact that it is mostly visual and not-dialogue heavy so the actors had to utilise their face the most instead of their voice. I imagine that is very difficult in today's film climate so I will congratulate every actor in the movie, including the ones whom I didn't mention. As much as the performances were great, the characters were not. The split between liking and disliking this movie is based around the point of either the characters sucked so it was bad or it's a film about the conflict, not the characters, so it is good. I agree with the latter's sentiment more but I do agree that if that was the intention, don't follow anyone. Don't even bother giving characters a name. If we are expected to follow specific characters, the audience expects the writer and director to make us care for these characters. Again I do agree with the idea of it is about the battle but I wont be a blind fanboy and disregard any flaws with this film. I am not biased. This is 2017's technical masterpiece, I think. The effects used are phenomenal and I give bonus points due to a lot of it being practical. If that is actually true then that is exceptional. If there was CGI used, it wasn't very obvious or noticeable. Cinematography and editing are both top notch but that has become Nolan standard now. If the sound design for this movie doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, I will lose my mind. I generally don't care about an aspect like this of a film but when it is extraordinary, you can guarantee I'll pick up on it. Sound design has always been a positive in Nolan's films and I think this may be his best yet. Truly exceptional work. This movie starts with the evacuation of Dunkirk and ends with the evacuation of Dunkirk. There is no in between and it is a film about Dunkirk. Please see this film in cinema's if you can but if not, see it anyway. It is an exceptional war movie which I really deserves its acclaim. Say what you want about Nolan, the man is a great director. I'll rate the film 9 HOMEs out of 10!
2.0~Huge Disappointment dsawyer-94118 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is the most disappointing movie I've seen in years. It made 1 hour 47 minutes seem like 3 hours. Totally boring. BTW, did the RAF really only have three airplanes dedicated to the Dunkirk battle? (I'm kidding but it sure seemed that way.)
8.0~/ justinecollet Sign in Permalink IT CONTAINS SPOILERS Dunkirk : between fear, stress and will to survive The battle of Dunkirk took place during World war II in 1940, when Great Britain tried to evacuate the British troops of the French beaches on Churchill's order. The movie is not really about the war itself but about the soldiers trying to survive the bombings and trying to come back to their country, it is also about the civilians and their patriotism. The tension is very well showed and felt through terrible yet beautiful images and powerful soundtrack amplifying the emotion and letting us worrying for the different characters. Christopher Nolan chose to use different time sets, different stories angles but managed to join them in the end. However, even though it is based on a real story, the storytelling is based on an English point of view, forgetting the Allies (mostly French but also Belgian) that stayed in Dunkirk to support the British troops evacuation. It is not a biopic, nor a historic documentary; it is just about war on the background of the Dynamo Operation. Still, the movie is very surprising because it's very different from any war movie. The movie starts with a very calm and heavy sound where you can feel the emptiness of the streets of Dunkirk broken by the sound of bullet noises and witness the first reflex of the soldiers: flee. That is what it is all about, running away. We understand that we'll follow these soldiers through their escape; it's a survival movie on a background of war. Flee and survive describe best this movie. The movie is very intense and well conducted as we are waiting for a miracle to save the soldiers, we can feel the different feelings they go through, team spirit, fear, egoism, hope, will to survive, but also will to protect the country and defend it. We can see that there are a lot of soldiers on the beach yet; we follow the escape of only three of them. We become attached to them, waiting for the miracle that is going to get them out of this perilous situation. Very few dialogues, lots of silences, and heavy sounds that explain some of the traumas caused by the war (surety, paranoia). Something that is also very different from any war movie is the absences of gore images, what is hard to watch is the time that is going very slowly. It feels like the nightmare is never ending, and shows exactly the horror of the war. To conclude, this movie shows the different states that a soldier/human goes through when his life is in danger: team spirit, fear, egoism, patriotism, hope, despair everything in a very well managed story that is actually three different one ending up in a big one.
5.0~Disappointing steve-585 Sign in Permalink I couldn't tell the characters apart. Having no known actors was the problem. Everybody looked alike. The preview showing a strafing run amongst crowded soldiers was the only thing of interest. I was expecting something like Saving Private RYan or Enemy at the GAtes. Won't bother watching again.
6.0~Overrated and factually disrespectful cheynehop Sign in Permalink Some spectacular scenes but overall sloppy and at times annoying during the Dunkirk battle , RAF LOST about 90 planes and the Germans almost 400. The movie showed only Tom Hardy (and briefly 2 of his mates) taking out 10 or so German planes 800 civilian boats helped evacuate Dunkirk . We saw at most 30 close on 400,000 soldiers were evacuated. Where were they in the movie ? All we had was a couple of hundred either lining up on the beach or ducking for cover from the occasional (previously mentioned 10) German planes -other than opening scene , NO land battles. In reality , Dunkirk town was bombed by Germans with 1000 civilian casualties Tom Hardy runs out of fuel yet not only glides for ages but even manages to shoot another plane down ! what was the point in casting Tom Hardy? Could hardly hear him behind his mask which he only took off at the end annoying "music" - continual frantic violin with occasional accompanying crashing of drums and other instruments ONE redeeming feature - no unnecessary romance !!
2.0~Bored to death pm-szostak Sign in Permalink I know this isn't supposed to be a after-dinner-family-fun kind of movie but my god it was boring... even at the end I still thought there was some action coming, I mean no one would make a movie that dull, wouldn't he?
1.0~Christopher Nolan has no clothes sphwf Sign in Permalink Directorial malpractice is the only explanation for excising the drama from this story. There's a technical terms for what happened here: very bad movie.
5.0~a somewhat dull movie shilieyu Sign in Permalink Too many multi-threaded narrative abuse in this movie, while I felt like asleep in the cinema. The background music is not as astounding or attractive or thrilling as what I heard in Interstellar and Inception. The same Hans Zimmer but not a similar flavor. However, would recommend somebody who loves English accent to enjoy that. I am not favoring this kind of movie anyway.
4.0~Structurally flawed tonyf-46656 Sign in Permalink I am a huge military history buff and was very excited to see Dunkirk in Imax format on the first weekend it was available in the U.S. The cinematography of the movie was impressive, but there were several things about how the movie was portrayed which were very disappointing to me. Asynchronous Timing - The movie tells the story in subplots taking place over a week, another in a day, and another in one hour. This was a creative way of telling the story from several perspectives, but not effective to me, and in many ways a waste of time. Instead of seeing 3-4 scenes shot from different 3-4 different angles, it seemed 75% of the time in the movie would have been better spent telling other story lines - the closing of the pocket around Dunkirk, the Germans decision to eliminate the British with air power vs. infantry, the French people feeling abandoned, the perspective of the civilians, the decisions by leaders on both sides, who gets left behind, etc. Very little character development - The movie was about the characters doing, not being. Again, this was a stylistic choice by the director, but it left me with the feeling that no character - with the exception of the Mark Rylance role - was very likable. Even Tom Hardy, who was featured flying a Spitfire for much of the film, was behind a mask 99% of the time - I could have done as much acting as he had to do in this role. Not enough lift - The real Dunkirk was a disaster for the Allies, but it also was a miracle that so many people were saved. The movie addressed this, but not adequately to my reckoning. The tone of the movie was death and despair, and for a brief moment, there were 4-5 merchant boats which appeared and momentary hope. It seems like for all of the grief the audience had endured to that point that suddenly the horizon would be filled with little boats coming to the rescue of the British infantry - which is what I suspect happened in reality. Tom Hardy's Spitfire - Tom Hardy flew around in a Spitfire for 2/3rd of the movie on low fuel, and eventually had to land it in German- occupied area and be captured. It seems like it would have been just as easy for him to land where his countrymen were instead of becoming a POW, but this isn't my biggest complaint. A Spitfire of this era had only about 16 seconds of ammunition firing time, but Hardy's plane took out more of the enemy than I could count (4-5 fighters and one bomber?). Granted, many of the scenes were repeats of other scenes given the time-bending approach, but Hardy's plane must have shot for 30 minutes or so of theater time. It would have been more effective, for instance, if he had been reduced to ramming the bomber to take it down. I know it is common to take liberties with ammunition in war movies, but this was such an overreach that it became frustrating. Over-ambitious score - For most of the movie the musical overlay featured unrelenting, screeching violins. No doubt, the intent was to add tension, but this was way overdone. I am glad films such as Dunkirk are being made, and I will watch it again when it is free on cable, but it seems like with a few changes, it could have been much better. Instead of dealing with the topic in a thoughtful way, a lot of the movie was overproduced to the point of distraction.
1.0~terrible movie like evacuation eyyuberginercan Sign in Permalink How Dunkirk Evacuation is a disgrace for British Army "Dunkirk" as a movie is a disgrace for Nolan like that. Merely as a war movie, it is a mediocre with its tension and action. Also when we think about as a Nolan's movie it is a huge dis appointment. Disconnected, insufficient and stunk. I hope, Nolan don't make this movie because of Queen's request in exchange for James Bond series.
3.0~Nonsensical vs. Nonlinear mike3386 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's directorial style is described as nonlinear. The historical significance of this well-known World War II event apparently caused Nolan to make a movie with no discernible plot whatsoever, no story, no character development. This mess is capped off with the worst sound I've heard in a movie in the last 10 years. I will acknowledge that I'm an aging movie fan; however, when no more than 25% of a movie's dialog is understandable – even at a modern theater – something is terribly wrong. The spoken words, most already with thick British accents, are virtually drowned out by a grindingly loud score, gun and cannon fire, explosions, and the sounds of war machines. Tom Hardy has a garbled delivery on his best acting day; with an oxygen mask and a wailing British Spitfire ever-present, the viewer is left to guess what he might be saying . . . AND HIS DIALOG IS SOME OF THE MOST UNDERSTANDABLE IN THE MOVIE! Some of the plot, where there is any, is silly (it pains me to even use that word in conjunction with a discussion of such a momentous event in history). When fleeing soldiers discuss throwing one hapless Frenchman overboard to save a sinking – and relatively large – fishing trawler, I felt that I'd wandered into a teen flick. Frankly, some of the "hero" characters are simply unlikable, the two fleeing soldiers in particular. Surely there was some saving grace, right? No, and don't for a minute compare this travesty to such fine war movies as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Pianist", or "Schindler's List". The horrible sound and missing plot are accompanied by flat, washed out color (no doubt begging for Oscar attention), frequently fuzzy focusing probably meaning something to egghead critics, flat and shallow acting without discernible emotion – even when a young boy is accidentally and tragically killed, and scenes that are SUPPOSED to fit together but do not, e.g., darkness in one, daylight in another, back and forth, ad nauseam. Good reviews? Yep, tons of them, many by dutiful Nolan fans stepping up to point out that the rest of us are stupid, unable to understand movie art. Movies with lots of pre-release hype and critical acclaim make me nervous, but hey, it's a war movie, how bad can it be? Ans. Very bad.
4.0~The movie is 3d the story telling is one dimensional . rogerg100 Sign in Permalink This movie is about the British and French soldiers trapped on a beach by the German soldiers. It is a movie with very good visuals and camera work and CGI. It lacks dialogue and character development. Even less so than super hero movies. In Dunkirk you will be riveted to the seats by the action scenes, boats sinking, airplanes, air-gun fights for a good 30-40 minutes, but then you start to wonder if this is what the movie is all about. At the end you just realize you wasted 2h of your life. However, if this movie were not based on an historic event - which could be summarized into perhaps 3-4 sentences, it would not get a vote of 8.5 Somehow people are scared to vote down boring historic movies. Historic movies can have beautiful character development, this one did not. The movie is 3d, the story is one dimensional. Don't give it a high vote just because it is based on WWII..
9.0~Nolan delivers the most beautiful war film in decades eden-rabatsch Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan who might be the most consistently celebrated director who makes both art and money has delivered a masterpiece. Nolan has envisaged the disaster at Dunkirk as a window on the experience of war. This is not a classic war film. With sparse dialogue, even less blood and no Germans, Nolan has given a prism which explores the battle through the lens of a thriller. Throwing away all the usual tropes the viewer is put into the film from the first scene and then spends 108 minutes surviving. The director most often compared to Nolan is Kubrick and here we can see an echo of "Paths of Glory", Kubrick's second and famously anti-war film set in the trenches of the Great War. Nolan takes a wide angle, a cold eye and sets it to form a triptych: three stories unfold and converge. One from the air, the sea in the form of the Home Fleet and finally from the land with the soldiers trapped on the beach. There is no overarching narrative or rhetorical flourishes but just the image and soon a magical thing occurs. The sheer humanity of the events takes your stomach and grips it as tightly as any thriller has and does not let go till the film is over. Nolan is helped immensely on all fronts. The score by Hans Zimmer is always reminding you of time. Time spent in the wrong direction can be fatal, even looking at the sun can be the difference as you hear the notes of a watch ticking away. The film is absolutely glorious. I mean arguably the most beautiful war film since "Apocalypse Now" and Hoyte Van Hoytema (who worked on "Interstellar") has created the best aerial combat I have ever seen. I am not sure how it could have been filmed. The entire vista looks real, the battleships are British and there is nary a CGI effect though the one downside is you never get the impression that there are hundreds of thousands trapped there. This is the best sound effect editing I have ever heard. These are craftsmen at the zenith of their art. The cast is impressive. Totally British as insisted by Nolan, the ensemble includes Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance. Fionn Whitehead is a newcomer and the closest to an audience surrogate but even there it is only because we meet him in the first scene. Everyone is strong but it is Rylance who steals the film. His nobleness in impossible times serves as a sharp contrast to modern views on duty and sacrifice. Nolan has delivered a piece of art which is hard to review. Like all great art there is a visceral experience required. There is little sentimentality and it invokes intimacy despite being on a huge canvas. It is the work of someone at their peak.
1.0~hard to follow, slow. tbearo Sign in Permalink I got it from Redbox and watched it on a 4K UHD smart TV with digital sound, so I pretty much had theater quality and sound but at home. I thought because it was confusing, it made the plot hard to follow. it was a very slow movie and that made it boring. I fully understand that war movies aren't always the" action blockbuster " type and that's fine, but a little backstory earlier in the movie and a few captions of who is who and where would have helped out. i think it's pretty sad to say that the end of the movie was better and easier to follow, more interesting because it gave more information and more story than most of the movie.
9.0~Nolan may have earned himself some high accolades come Oscar season soulsk8ter225 Sign in Permalink No reviewer was lying when they said see this in 70mm IMAX (full disclosure, I saw this on a regular screen). In my opinion, it necessitates it. I can just "tell" from what I saw. The aerial shots alone would provide good reasoning for it, but the sound that those theaters provide with the big picture in front of you will captivate you exactly the right way. This isn't a social kind of film, and it certainly isn't popcorn entertainment. Not a summer blockbuster at all. This film's scope feels very small, even though it carries epic tones within. Nolan really broke a lot of traditional film conventions with this, and I think that exact kind of ambition is what makes this movie work for a more general audience. I somewhat think audience members need to know what they're getting into beforehand to be accepting of that fact, but once they are I think they will be just fine. On a technical level, I think this is Nolan's best yet. The Prestige still might get higher honors simply because of the more demanding writing that is involved, but given what Nolan intended to do, this nearly screams "perfection." Did he try and go for an R-rating? No. Did that matter? Not even close. Did he try and provide massive amounts of character development? No. Did that matter? Depends on who you talk to. I could honestly say that if there were two cuts of this film—an extended cut that develops the characters and this one—you could give us the option and we would find the one we enjoy more depending on what we're looking for. Did he look to vilify the Germans to the point of controversy? No. Did that matter? It didn't, but only one part does stick out for me (the "one flaw" that Nolan often has trouble with in his writing) and I'll get back to that in a moment. "Harrowing" is easily my favorite word to describe Dunkirk. This is a survival film, and that's all it is. He put us on the beach, on the sea, and in the air. He gave the characters a want and will to live with an impending threat for which we understand its consequence, without need of showing thousands of deaths or lots of blood. When one moment of attempted survival ends, another one begins without warning. That doesn't mean the film is relentless action, but it certainly is relentless tension, if for no other reason than Hans Zimmer's score. I'm telling you right now, his score is my favorite part of the film. It's actually mostly a quiet kind of score, but it is frightening and works with the film so very well. Nolan has had a lot of trouble doing "show, not tell" in his past films. This time he has learned a lot, not letting the actors expose everything (acting was fine all around, by the way... not much to say about it honestly, as it's not the film's high point). I did not feel the presence of the surrounding enemies, though. If the film didn't tell us about it, I probably wouldn't have felt the pressure of getting off that beach sooner than later. Hearing the planes incoming was always scary of course, but as we only had the British perspective and a week-long time line at most, there simply wasn't a chance of feeling time cave in on them. This to me is this film's only real flaw. That being said, the only real limitation that holds this film back is that it's based in reality, which means that we are already aware of the outcome. I think for this particular story it's fine, because it's not one specific moment that lets us breathe again... so letting it play out the way that it did is okay with me. I do not think this will go over with people who come in completely uneducated about Dunkirk. I made a mistake in stating that I wanted this film to educate me on the evacuation story. I think I'd rather have learned about it first and then seen the film, kind of like seeing United 93 after having lived 9/11 (not totally, but I was at least cognizant of all that transpired). That doesn't mean to research the film itself, but rather just the historical event. I do hope that Nolan goes back to fictional work after this. Here was an awesome deviation from the norm that he chose to do, and he went out in grand style. I could have used a longer film with fleshed out character development, but this film also works as well especially in the month of July. I see this receiving many Oscar nominations such as score, editing, cinematography, visual effects, etc... I do not see any acting or writing awards... and yes, I see a director nomination as well. If the academy believes some of those earn him victories, then god damn it give him his Best Picture Oscar as well. I can't really yet rank this film with his other films, because it's just so different. I don't see too many of the Inception parallels here. Every film of his outside of Insomnia either does nonlinear or intertwining storytelling, but this one is without the cleverness involved in the script. It's just playing things out as they do. Survive. So to revisit, I believe this may be his best work yet, even if I don't know if it's my favorite of his. I really just want to put this in another category from other films entirely, in which case it's my favorite of "that kind of film." My heart is still pounding from this film. I simply cannot wait to see this in 70mm IMAX on Thursday.
6.0~The realism of Dunkirk.... fmh_markbuys Sign in Permalink Last weekend we went to the cinema to see the movie Dunkirk. Our expectations were high because of many positive stories of people who already seen this movie. However, we were somehow disappointed after we saw this movie. In my honest opinion this movie does not tell the true story of what really happened at Dunkirk and what really went on with all the men desperitaly trying to leave France. Some scenes played next to each other but in a different time level. This made the movie difficult to follow. Also a plane without fuel which was able to stay mid-air for a considerable amount of time able to shoot enemy planes down, was so un-realistic. At least it was a movie where blood wasn't spilled as there was hardly any blood visible. Even though the bombs went down on thousands of soldiers, no blood or any lost parts of bodies were seen. Too bad that Dunkirk is not shown as it really was, however it is a good thing that events like Dunkirk are recorded. So people get a fairly good idea how WWII started.
10.0~Two hours in the war zone, Nolan's best work!!! Hans Zimmer you beauty!!! Rawal_Afzal Sign in Permalink What a fabulous film, what a great depiction of the battlefield. Nolan has doubtlessly pulled off his best work and one that he'll himself find it hard to surpass. Right from the scene where the first aerial attack takes place and the Allied soldier trying to gun down the plane gets wiped away from the earth, the film never looks back and provides one gripping moment after another. The dogfight between the air forces yet will forever go down as the most thrilling scenes in the history of any war film. Mind-blowing work! As many World War Two films do, this doesn't resort to showing blood and gore, or deformed dead bodies to depict a war (which isn't necessarily wrong), but yet makes the point of the horror of a war in a most eloquent way. It seems as if Nolan had over the years been watching war films as a layman instead of a film-maker, and had realised that the public is demanding for something more than just deformed dead bodies. Yet on the other hand, it doesn't show any false bravado on part of the Allied forces. It just depicts the reality of the battlefield, and gives a hint of Forces beyond their control having made it happen. Hans Zimmer's background music will forever be remembered as the ultimate decoration of any Nolan film. That music was killing and created nail-biting suspense even in moments of relief, coupled with it the sound effects that make you feel as if bullets are coming your way from every direction - another highlight of epic film-making. I'd a time of my life, two most thrilling hours ever spent at a cinema. #ThankYouNolan - thank you for the heart palpitations and the shortness of breath! ------- Now, let me address some of the criticism directed at this film by a minority of people, two of which were my brother and my brother-in- law, who went to watch it yesterday with me (first time by the way that I've walked out of the cinema with a split opinion with anyone that I've gone in to watch a film). Yes, the film doesn't show a background or even a short history for the laymen watching of the Battle of Dunkirk. So anyone going into it with expectations of a proper story will be disappointed, as will be those who haven't done any bit of a research on the battle. Secondly, yes it has no characters and doesn't even show a single German soldier, and as a last bit of the criticism, omits reactions or the talks of the people in command from either sides, or discussions from the offices as to what the plan is to get them evacuated and how much under stress they're regarding this, or how the Germans are plotting to attack them. But that's not criticism, that's a misinterpretation of the purpose of this film. Showing all of that to please some viewers would make it a film, and this isn't a film. This a literal presentation of what war is or what the happenings of the surroundings of a battlefield are. Ask yourself, if you were amongst the Allied soldiers stuck there, would you on that beach have an idea of what the people higher up are planning to save you, or what the Germans are plotting? No! The problem is, showing any of that would make it a film with breaks and stopages and will never give you the feel of a battlefield. A war zone, a battlefield is exactly like this and it offers no time to wipe a sweat from your forehead. It is relentless, it is unfair and it constant. Watching it, by the 40th or the 50th minute I myself was exhausted and was saying that such a film should have an interval of 15 minutes, but again, the battlefield has no intervals and being exhausted is a part of it. There are moments when you scratch your head as to whose plane is flying overhead, but here too one has to study to understand that it is after this particular battle that the Allied forces chose to draw a colour- based distinction on their planes for identification. So here again Nolan makes you go through exactly what the Allied soldiers on the ground had to. I'm a fan of Nolan but not a huge fan. I criticise his films when I don't like it, but here he has succeeded tremendously in making you as an audience feel like a soldier effected by it. It's a project, not a film. As for characters and a story, a war does have a story, but a battlefield doesn't. A battlefield just has gunshots, grenades and bombs, and soldiers fighting for survival. At most, the only criticism that I can remotely accept is that the action or the plot didn't have a prelude, which would've been useful for a layman watching this film without having studied the Battle of Dunkirk, But again, Nolan has his own thought process here and it has its own justification. All in all, 100 out of 10 for this masterpiece. I wouldn't mind it getting a well deserved Oscar. Nolan and co. have richly deserved it.
5.0~Dunkirk kjuice-60093 Sign in Permalink Though the scenes were well done and the aerials a plus the whole meaning of why those soldiers were on that beach at that time had no background to the picture. Many have often wondered why the blunder leaving over 300,000 men and equipment on the beach stranded and why the Germans never came further while they had the chance was never explained. It's too bad, they really could have done a lot more with the story line.
5.0~Slow & Boring stevendbeard Sign in Permalink I saw "Dunkirk", starring Kenneth Branagh-Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Valkyrie; Cillian Murphy-In the Heart of the Sea, 28 Days Later; Tom Hardy-The Revenant, Inception and making his movie acting debut, Harry Styles-He is from the boy band, One Direction. This movie was a bit of a dud for me. It is based on true events in 1940 during WW 2. It's directed by Christopher Nolan-Interstellar, The Dark Knight movies and Inception.The movie looks great. But, it is incredibly boring. Maybe die hard history buffs might enjoy it more than I did. For those unfamiliar with the situation, the Allies, including the British, Belgium and French soldiers, were surrounded at Dunkirk, France on 3 sides by German forces, with the English channel at their backs. It was about 26 miles across the channel to Dover, England. The troops were trying to evacuate while being pounded by German forces, including enemy planes. Kenneth plays the leader of the English forces just trying to get home. Cillian and Harry are a couple of soldiers that get stranded off of sinking rescue ships and Tom is an Allied fighter pilot trying to protect the escaping boats from being sunk. It is a testament to the spirit of helping people in a crisis-British civilian vessels were used to help ferry soldiers across the channel-with about 360,000 of the 400,000 troops eventually being rescued. But it is not so much as a war movie but more of a rescue and evacuation movie. There are a few air battle scenes, but overall, it was just slow. It's rated "PG-13" for war violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It might be alright as a rental.
10.0~.It's a visceral movie, with Christopher Nolan's storytelling at it's best, go watch it. kartikarry Sign in Permalink Well, oh well. Dunkirk is definitely a step up for Christopher Nolan (Director) in terms of his craftsmanship. Dunkirk is an unusual war movie that just so happens to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest war movie ever made. One of the main highlights of the movie is the fact that it's a very immersive experience that will leave you feeling as if you've just literally been in a battle. Hans Zimmer's unpropitious background score adds to the uneasiness & fear as to what's going to happen next. Literally, every explosion or a gunfire scene adds to the overall cinematic experience & tension in the moment. In short, the background score & the visual imagery in various naval warfare sequences is pure gold. As for performances, truth be told, Harry Styles did manage to do a convincing job as an actor. Tom Hardy yet again proves that he can be expressive throughout the movie even when his face is covered for the better part of the film. Cilian Murphy, Mark Rylance & newcomer Fionn Whitehead also make up for pretty good additions to the film. There is no lead protagonist in this movie, it's just three different threads relating to the same event that eventually comes together in the end. One of the main things you have to know before watching this film is that it's not entirely dialogue-driven. Christopher Nolan has credited various inspirations for "Dunirk's" cinematic & tension driven experience with minimal dialogue. Overall, 'Dunkirk' is a major triumph in the war-movies genre as well as being of the best films this year. It's a visceral movie, with Christopher Nolan's storytelling at it's best, go watch it. Also, the starting sequence of the movie is purely brilliant, as it is an important catalyst for keeping the audiences hooked throughout it's run time.
6.0~Sigh...disappointed yet again. michaelmcdonald-20730 Sign in Permalink Remember that scene where the boat sank? Or the other boat sank? Or the the one? Or the other one? Thank God, a director who uses practical effects! Too bad I didn't know any of the characters on the boats, nor was Nolan's ADHD plagued camera able to focus on a scene long enough for me to concentrate or care before another quick cutaway. Also Kenneth Branagh staring at the sky with a horrified look upon his face. Powerful stuff the first time. Not so powerful the second time. Okay, why is he doing it a third time? A fourth time? Now this is getting comical. I demand subtitles on all future Nolan movies. I could probably understand 20% of the dialogue, if that. I'm pretty sure they're using Hans Zimmerman's score on the next season of 24. Maybe that'll save the show, or at least fool you again into thinking you're watching something epic and suspenseful. I miss the guy who directed Memento, the Prestige, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. Nolan's last movies may appeal to you die-hard fans, but his best work is in the past. Before you dismiss me, ask yourself honestly if, when this movie is released on DVD, you're going to prefer watching this to the aforementioned Nolan films.
10.0~Apocalypse Now, Saving private Ryan now we can add Dunkirk to the list. frasermcconnel-70795 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is arguably one of the greatest movie directors in recent history and some of his movies will go down as one of the greatest in a respected genre. After his release of a highly confusing, yet satisfying Interstellar movie, we had to wait three years for another release. Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan's first war movie and shortest movie ever released and that are only some of the important facts to know before seeing this masterpiece. Since we already know the ending, there is not much point in describing the plot. We are placed in the year 1940, when the battle of Dunkirk took place in France. The story follows three different perspectives in the World War II – mole, air and the sea. Each sequence pictures the struggles of their respective units to save the wounded and do their part in the Dunkirk offensive. In order to fully emphasize the importance of the battle of Dunkirk, Nolan used very little CGI and even used some old artillery in the movie. One of his most frequent collaborator, Hans Zimmer did the score for the movie and it is easily one of the most important parts. The rescuing scenes with the sense of Zimmer's music will give you chills. And don't get me started on the Imax 70mm shooting. Just go and see it for yourself. Nolan managed to tell the story about WWII and he did not only manage that, but this looks like a documentary. Fionn Whitehead is not only debuting in a major movie role, but he represents the faces of all the soldiers that survived the Dunkirk attack. I firmly believe that from this day on, the term for the greatest war movie of all time will add one more title. Besides Apocalypse Now, Saving private Ryan now we have Dunkirk as well.
7.0~A film that leaves you wanting more, but not in the good way TheBigTuna21 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's' Dunkirk was a not-your-typical war epic with masterful cinematography,technical display, and score that, to all its best efforts, fell flat. The film was based on true events of the evacuation of 300,000 British soldiers from Dunkirk beach during the height of World War II. The film sets itself apart from other war films, deciding to focus on group survival instead of specific characters, bouncing from different perspectives between ground, sea, and air. Each of these mini plots take place along different time lines, giving away new pieces of information as the story unfolds, and eventually meeting up at the end for the climax of the film. Even with all these elements, it still felt as if things were missing from the story. The absence of a main protagonist made it difficult to connect on an emotional level with the characters. There were great, subtle performances by the characters that were given screen time in excess than 5 minutes, but not enough to truly resonate with the audience. The score, as wonderful as it was, played out with the intense build up of a ticking clock that always seemed to be leading to some grandiose action sequence that never came. It's an unfortunate misstep that leaves you with a feeling of wanting more, not in the sense that you wish it didn't end, but that you were robbed of the few pieces of a puzzle that would have led to an exceptional film.
5.0~Highly overrated gcarpiceci-73268 Sign in Permalink I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan, I cannot count how many times I have watched and re-watched Inception and even more Interstellar, I consider his Batman trilogy the best ever produced. I must admit I was a littler doubtful about Dunkirk, I was wondering how Nolan could make a Nolan movie out of such story; but then I thought, "hell, this is Mr Nolan we are talking about, he will do the trick!" and I went to see it. Well, sorry for saying so, but he didn't, this time Mr Nolan's magic did not work out as expected.... I thought the movie is totally overrated, it is still a decent, watchable movie, but not a great one. The plot is rather linear (hey, this is not fiction, so what did you expect? exactly, that was my original doubt as above...), the cinematography is very nice...so, there is nothing terribly wrong, simply this is not one of the great Nolan movies.
9.0~Retreat for Victory davidgee Sign in Permalink Remember the opening scenes in Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? The Normandy beach landings in June 1944. Explosions on the beach, bullets zipping through the guys in the sea. DUNKIRK offers the same visceral experience of combat, only it lasts for an hour and three quarters. There are a few moments of calm between battles and bombardments, but these are always the preamble to the next grim phase of the conflict. Christopher Nolan has directed some weird movies (MEMENTO, INCEPTION, the DARK KNIGHT Batman trilogy). His only 'weirdness' here is to take three separate time frames – a week for the men on the beach, one day for the flotilla of small craft setting out to rescue them and one hour for the Spitfire pilots fighting the German bombers – and meld them into a fairly seamless narrative that condenses the drama into a solid 90 minutes of nerve-shredding tension. The scenes onboard a sinking mine-sweeper are among the most harrowing depictions of the total horror of war I've seen. There are panoramic CGI shots to show the sheer size of the retreating army (400,000) but the script focuses on one soldier fighting to survive the day (Fionn Whitehead), one fishing boat captain (Mark Rylance) and one RAF pilot (Tom Hardy): these three are used to bring home to us that each of the soldiers and their rescuers had a backstory – a home, a family, a life – that they were laying on the line for their country, their king and their fellow men. A spot-the-celebrity element includes cameo appearances from Harry Styles, Michael Biehl and others whom I failed to identify. Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play naval officers who occasionally veer close to the officers parodied in OH WHAT A LOVEY WAR! – I hope this was intended. DUNKIRK joins the 'pantheon' of all-time great war movies and will surely win awards next winter. I was misty-eyed through much of it – and not just because my dad was one of the soldiers who went to Belgium and didn't come back (I was two years old). There's a temptation to see the 'strategic retreat' from the French coast in 1940 as an awful defeat, when in fact – as this version makes clear – many of the 300,000-plus men who were brought safely home to England returned to Normandy in 1944 to begin the destruction of Hitler's military machine.
2.0~Woefully disappointing dave-goodman-130-352295 Sign in Permalink Looking at most of the other reviews I must have watched a different movie. I expected a lot from this movie from the build up and hype, especially given the story line. If you are expecting something along the lines of SPR then forget it. For a start this movie should have been a U certificate as there is absolutely nothing in it that would justify a 12a or even a 12 certificate. All that would constitute a rating above a U (Graphic scenes of violence, Gore element, Nudity and profane language) there was none. The whole film was empty of any feeling of fear or danger of what it was like being involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. At no point do you get even a bit emotional during the movie and at the end you are left thinking Oh Well.. shall we go and get a pizza. I sat alongside a couple of people in their 80's who's only tears were the price of the tickets. They simply said 'It was nothing like that...much worse). This really was a movie about one man and his boat setting out in his frightfully perfect suit and tie in an effort to rescue the whole of 300,000 stranded servicemen. One dogfight involving 6 planes shown from different perspectives (which was not only boring but confusing) throughout the movie, two ships sinking..again shown multiple times from different perspectives and a few queues of soldiers in perfectly clean uniforms (bearing in mind they are escaping after months of combat) as if they were waiting for the canteen to open. When a 'straffe' occurred they all ducked as if ducking from the rain. The worse thing was you were left with the impression that only half a dozen local fishing boats went over because thats all you see arriving at the beach. Tom Hardy in the roll of a spitfire pilot was a total waste of an A list actor and as for the acting debut of Harry Stiles...well give me a break, stick to singing I would say. Mark Rylance is superb as ever and Kenneth Brannagh..well you know Kenneth.. Rah Rah Yah Yah and all that, a proper gentleman he was organizing the hospital ship. Strangely no German soldiers...in a WWII war film, give me a break please. The biggest laugh, all said and done and the half a dozen boats had rescued all 300,000 (which you didn't see) they were welcomed home by the dutiful English lady with a Cup of Tea more less saying 'There There Boys better luck next time. This movie given Nolan's previous work had so much potential and totally missed the opportunity. I give it 2 for the sound effects, which were also awful but better than the movie.
1.0~THE WORST OF THE WORST djneiditch Sign in Permalink I DON'T CARE WHAT THE CRITICS SAY. THIS FILM IS BORING AND USELESS. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. YOU WILL TURN IT OFF AT HALFTIME, IF YOU GET THAT FAR. WE JUST BLEW 6 BUCKS AT HOME ON A BAD, DISINTERESTING, FRAGMENTED, FILM.
1.0~How the hell is this rated 8.3 ?! simonmiller_13 Sign in Permalink What a dull film, two hours watching a bunch of extras stood around on a beach. The usual British bashing, poorly portrayed as either cowards or mindless and paranoid. There is no story, no likable or relatable characters. There's little action, tension or depth, no one seems in any great rush (boats just sit around, drinking tea waiting to get sunk. The disjointed time frames are not clever but annoying. It's so cheap too hardly any boats, five planes and crappy explosions, beautiful blue sky and a lack of effects. No one hardly says a word, it seems so amateur. The last 10 minutes is OK. The actual story could have been so much better, with a good script and director. I think of great war films "Saving Private Ryan", "Hacksaw Ridge ", "Fury" and regret that this is a missed opportunity.
9.0~Just Wow!!!!!!!! webchaat Sign in Permalink Best movie of the decade, one of the finest directed movie I have ever seen. Do not think that this is similar to Saving private. Its totally a different approach. A must watch. Simply awesome.
1.0~So, so boring joysofbookworms Sign in Permalink Ugh, this was so boring; I almost fell asleep! Everyone looks exactly the same and I just didn't care. The special effects were good but again; did not are at. all. Do not believe the hype for this one.
2.0~What a waste.... mts-78680 Sign in Permalink I tried hard to appreciate this movie something; script, acting, cinematic effects...nothing saved me from falling asleep and giving this this very poor rating. I'm only giving it a two because my wife stayed awake and watched it all before agreeing this movie sucked. As usual, those in power give this movie good grades but at least it didn't get too many awards which would have depressed me as much as the movie did. Oh, and I didn't even pay for this so I encourage all to only see if they must but don't waste any money along with your time.
1.0~I walked out nyclizzy-52307 Sign in Permalink Am I alone on this? I think not because I saw a couple walk out as well... Why are the reviews so good? It beats me...I'm really puzzled. Considering the cool previews, It was so incredibly surprisingly disappointing that I literally felt I was wasting my precious time at best. It's truly utterly confusing to see all the hype about it. I should have asked for a refund. I can only say that the film lacks at so many levels that one simply can not connect with it unless there is a pre-existing bias of some sort. Then again, I did not watch the end, but even if it is spectacular, which I seriously doubt, I sincerely wish that I would have done something more productive with my time and money.
5.0~Boring zmaria-84914 Sign in Permalink Very slow plot, unrealistic scenes, and a really boring scenario, I wonder why it has so good ratings...
5.0~Technical excellence, but uninteresting and monotonous Skaigear Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a historical war action drama, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. I have always been a big Nolan fan so naturally I was hyped for this movie. Nolan has knack of taking a genre he has never done before and somehow make it appealing to the masses and intelligent at the same time. A superhero trilogy? Check. A dream heist film? Check. A space travel sci-fi? Check. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of the war genre, but I was still very curious to see how Nolan would tackle it. The film is unquestionably extremely well-made, and I could see why people would love it and claim it as one of the best movies of the year, but to me it was just far too dull. While the interweaving of three perspectives is interesting, I did not feel any tension during the lackluster action scenes because I did not care about any of the characters since their development was non-existent. A lot of the times, unless it was Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, I could not even tell which character was who, complicating things to an already unexciting movie. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was also a miss, which is shocking because I loved all his previous Nolan efforts. Also for a war movie, it really could have benefited from an R-rating, as the bloodless PG-13 makes things even duller than it already is. There are a few things I really liked though, namely the sound design when the spitfire jets were descending down the beach, wailing terrifyingly like monstrous banshees. The acting was also mostly well performed throughout by everybody especially Mark Rylance as a civilian going into Dunkirk to save the men. The film's technical excellence cannot be denied, but with uninteresting action and monotonous characters, Dunkirk was just a disappointment. You can say I do not understand the film, but I believe I understood it just fine; I was just not as enthralled as should be to Nolan standards.
4.0~One long battle scene that lasts as long as this short movie swips88 Sign in Permalink I did go expecting more. IMAX version only accentuated the fact that this movie had nothing else redeeming except good visuals and mind numbing sound. By the time this 1:47 movie was over I lost track of who was who amongst the characters. This is due to lack of meaningful dialogue. This film is basically one long battle scene that is soon forgotten. After sitting through 1 hour of commercials and previews, this film disappoints as just another short half baked over-hyped waste of evening. Not as bad as i describe but should have been more considering subject matter.
3.0~Well... It's LOUD and, umm...it's LOUD. ravenosa Sign in Permalink Really can't say much more about it. No real characters to care about, a needless time gimmick, most speaking parts are given to cutout archetypes to say exposition, and even the most harrowing of moments in the film come off as empty and procedural.
3.0~Absolute joke sawo-1 Sign in Permalink I've seen the movie score on imdb, but forgot that these days one needs to take out at least two points to get the actual rating. With this crucial mistake, I had big hopes that it would be a great movie. I could not believe how bad it was. And I really wanted it to be good. Problem one: Complete lack of character development. Absolutely none. Problem two: Complete lack of scale. The scale here is so far out, it is actually funny. When you are supposed to show a certain number of units, say soldiers, ships, tanks, etc., you have to make sure you are showing something that is at least remotely near the number of units you are telling are shown. The scale with this movie was so bad, that even if you don't know anything about history, it would be obvious that they had no idea what they were doing when the movie was made. The overall realism was non-existent. The plot was so bad, a lot of the time it went against common sense, let alone historical accuracy. Overall the movie is a complete mess - zero story fluency, zero character development, out of this world scale problems - it's like they had no idea what to do or how to do it.
9.0~Land, Sea & Air AaronCapenBanner Sign in Permalink Director Christopher Nolan delivers another superb film, this time a WWII epic recreating the events at the battle of Dunkirk, France in 1940, as Allied troops are forced to evacuate from invading German forces by fleeing to the beaches and harbor, where they await rescue from various ships both military and civilian, while a group of Allied fighter planes do their valiant best to defend them by air. A compelling and realistic viewing experience from start to finish, with masterful score and cinematography. Though there isn't much emotional involvement with the characters, it is the true story being told that is the attraction here, as this important event in the war is finally given a proper treatment, and is a welcome breath of fresh air given the overly cynical and CGI saturated nature of so many modern films. Would have been at home as much in its own depicted period as it is in ours; a real achievement.
9.0~Christopher Nolan just doesn't miss! JamiroBontes Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is about 400.000 soldiers that needs to evacuate from Dunkirk. We follow the civilians, the soldiers on the beach and a pilot played by Tom Hardy. The story telling of Dunkirk is told in such a unique way. I am not going to spoil it because you really should see it for yourself. The movie looks absolutely fantastic beautiful cinematography and gorgeous camera work. But the movie wouldn't without the cracking score compost by Hans Zimmer, after you leave the movie the score will still be playing in you're head. Christopher Nolan's direction is so amazing, you can see that he has 100% control over his craft. Everything about Dunkirk is amazing and you have to see it for yourself. This will go down as one of the best war movies in history right next to Saving Private Ryan. Dunkirk is just brilliant go watch it now.
1.0~Nolan just trying to beat Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Unsuccessful. mvrk Sign in Permalink This movie is just a bunch of vignettes joined loosely together by the fact that they all involve the Dunkirk evacuation. Just a bunch of small stories intertwined together and no real ending except that all the soldiers were evacuated somehow and the Nazi Empire remained an empire for the next five years!?!? I mean why make a Dunkirk fiasco movie in the first place? At least in Saving Private Ryan they show the allies winning in the end. Dunkirk is just the stupid invasion of Dunkirk in which the British didn't have any plan whatsoever on how to win the war. So they send the troops to the beach and then realize "hey we got no plan on what to do next and darn all our troops are about to be killed!" So they mount a form of evacuation in which the British civilians use their boats to help in the evacuation. Awww.....so sweet. Don't be fooled. Nolan is just wanting to be a greater director than Spielberg by making his own WWII movie. And it fails. I mean why choose the Dunkirk evacuation as a source material in the first place especially when there are so many other interesting battles and facts about WWII? Dunkirk just shows the British stupidity in WWII and exposes the fact that Nolan is a hack. Nolanites, now burst with anger!
4.0~The History behind Dunkirk is far more great than it was shown in the film tubzz Sign in Permalink Had immense expectation with this film but was quite disappointing after watching it. Obviously many will disagree, so for them Firstly, the history was really great and also very dark behind Dunkirk. Almost 400,000 British soldiers were strangled on the Dunkirk beach and the German forces were surrounding them. The French brave local men came to the aid of the distressed soldiers and the managed to pull out almost all of them. If someone doesn't know about the event the film will be quite confusing for them. Secondly, there were so many chances for the characters in the film those could have stood out. The German point of view was completely ignored whereas it played a very important part. Not to attack the British forces on Dunkirk was Hitler's one of the greatest mistakes just to give Churchill the feel of the power German has. That part is very important in the film. Thirdly, on the event of Dunkirk there was history's best Dog fights happened over the sea of Dunkirk that just wasn't in the film at all. That eagerness and intensity of the dog fight was just missed. Fourthly, the brave Frenchmen who came to the aid of the soldiers were just neglected. Over 700 local boats came for help but in the film there were only one boat which the whole movie concentrated on. And the list goes on. Over all very much disappointed with the film. 
6.0~Just Never Grabbed Me Hitchcoc Sign in Permalink I would concur with many that the film was overhyped. Nevertheless, to give something as breathtaking in its cinematic efforts a one or two is ridiculous. I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no "Tora Tora Tora" or "The Longest Day" which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable. Still, with a big picture attempt it would have been much better.
5.0~What event? billsuon Sign in Permalink I usually love Christopher Nolan's movies but I was waiting for a plot in this one, and it just never came. Nolan wrote this movie on his own. Big mistake. I'm sorry but without his brother Jonathan, Christopher Nolan seems to have absolutely no clue about how to write a story. Dunkirk is just a series of scenes ideas stitched together without any semblance of a plot emerging from the whole thing. In fact, 30 minutes after the beginning, we still don't even know the names of the characters! The worst is that for an "event that shaped the world" nothing really spectacular actually happens. I was expecting a battle and all I got was soldiers trying to flee France on boats while being shot at by planes. That's not a battle, that's just people-being- shot-at-by-a-plane. I'm giving it 5/10 for the effort, but Mr Nolan, please, next time, get a f***ing writer.
1.0~Bloodless, boring and empty hozhone Sign in Permalink The Guardian summed it up like this: "Bloodless, boring and empty: Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk left me cold." This is the most stupid movie I have seen in decades. It starts with the main 'German' actor speaking German with a horrible accent. Non of these actors convinced me of being German, the main actor utters constantly clichés like 'just kill them all'. It follows the old Hollywood pattern of 'the good guys, against the bad guys, and of course in the end the good guys win. The enemy is just mowed down, everyone of them shot from the airplanes. I had to force myself to watch it to the end, and sat there in disbelief how such an unauthentic, stereotypical portrayal of an important part of WW II history can have accumulated so many positive reviews.
10.0~Wonderful and Brilliant m-maru Sign in Permalink The film begins and directly catches you and makes you feel that you are there, in the sad reality of what happened. Excellent and original film, with an incredible soundtrack, with each scene and the way it is directed. A brilliant cast with great surprises and great talents that stand out all. Every silence in the film is so distressing and real. This movie has a wonderful picture, which on the big screen looks great. For me, this is the best movie of the great Christopher Nolan, without doubt is my favorite of him and this year. Undoubtedly, it will be one of those that will be nominated for many awards and deservedly, a great surprise and that does not disappoint.
7.0~Overrated but good! mohamedmassoud-71470 Sign in Permalink DUNKIRK- 77% Dunkirk was a good movie which was expected from a director like Christopher Nolan who never seizes to disappoint me. However, I felt underwhelmed despite the amazing cinematography, the unique three perspective structure, and good acting... I did feel emotional in some parts which is always a plus for me. Dunkirk should be watched! Story and execution: 24.2/35 Acting: 18.5/25 Camera work: 19/20 Sound: 15.2/20
5.0~No cohesive flow. Hard to follow billgreencontracting Sign in Permalink The movie obviously sets out from the beginning to show that Dunkirk was a mess. I get it but for a movie watcher it is frustrating to not understand for a very long time what the director is trying to accomplish. We must follow A random array of characters from infantryman, to private boat owners, fighter pilots and a couple other characters desparate plight in what must be an middle Day in the evacuation timeline. Scenes are a random collection with no glue to hold them other than the flight from France. An obvious expense was used to create the authenticity which in afraid is rather wasted expenditures. The movie would most likely benefit by using an announcer to help keep us on point. I soent most of my time watching remarking "Well that sucks" but not having too much sympathy since the accosted character had no build up to appeciate his dilemma. I do appreciate the interesting perspectives the director obviously tried to show. Men watching other mens actions and demise from their current perspective was a new experience in cinematography. I do not recommend this for prime viewing, rather something to occupy your time on a rainy day or watch while waiting for the wrecker driver to arrive and tow your vehicle to safety.
9.0~Pure Cinema danielharden Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is without a doubt one of the greats, a modern day auteur, and the filmmaker behind some of cinemas most highly anticipated indie films. The man has managed to find the sweet spot between blockbuster and art film, gaining the praise of critics and casual viewers alike. The man has become an event in himself, everyone knows when a Christopher Nolan film is coming and they flock to the cinema because of his name. I love Christopher Nolan's films, he has yet to make a bad film, despite The Dark Knight Rises being disappointing on reflection. Although not stepping many feet wrong his entire career, I don't view Nolan and his work as many others do, that being as the work of an untouchable God. I try to walk in without expectation or, without having already decided the film is a perfect 10/10, as it seems quite a few people don't do. However, I really wanted to enjoy Dunkirk for my own sake, God forbid I actually didn't like it, I would swiftly be told why exactly I am wrong in even suggesting Nolan could step a foot wrong Thank God I actually really enjoyed the film, phew. Dunkirk recounts the true story of the evacuation of British soldiers from Dunkirk in 1940. The film is high octane, action packed and suspenseful and again Nolan proves why he's a human cinematic event. This film is obviously a Nolan film, there are some star talent in the film, but they are there because they want to work with Nolan, not the other way round. The film is, for the most part, wordless, this isn't really a film for actors to shine, it's for Nolan to show the world how the real thing can be, and is often, better than CGI. With the film being wonderfully wordless, Nolan shows he knows exactly what film is and always should be, the visual art of storytelling. He has obviously taken note from such greats as Hitchcock, using sound and dialogue to further aid the visual, not to overpower it. In today's film landscape this is quite rare, and so you have to give Nolan credit and respect for making a film the way they should, but rarely are, made. This is film after all, not radio. Also to note, Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography in this film is absolutely breathtaking, Dunkirk would be little without his work and he is in need of some serious recognition. Dunkirk isn't a conventional war film, we don't get character development in the form of "who you got back home son?" campfire talks, nor do we get multiple battles throughout the run time. Dunkirk doesn't have a dull moment whatsoever. It is a battle from beginning to end, and so with this, Nolan does not allow us, the audience to rest easy. Nolan doesn't hold off on the tension at all. I personally loved moments where Nolan momentarily lulls us into a false sense of security, only to then provide a sudden jump scare in the form of gunfire, reminding us that you are never safe in the middle of war. Now this is how you use sound as a jump scare correctly. This film is high octane, tense and extremely gripping from start to end. Also this being a Nolan film, he has to make things more complex, he can't just tell a war movie with a chronological narrative structure. Dunkirk follows the same story, from three different perspectives and three different time frames. For audience members, like myself, who understand Nolan's knack for complex storytelling, this will be confusing for a moment whilst you recall previous information to make everything make sense again, and then you will love what Nolan has done. However, audiences who expect to see a war film, which by our conventional understanding is often self explanatory, will forget that previous information and thus remain confused throughout the rest of the movie. I've seen negative reviews say that Dunkirk gives no indication of time, and to an extent they are right, but then again all I can say is watch it again, but this time take note of the opening title cards which read "one week", "one day" and "one hour" it should clear things up, but I do think maybe the title cards could be a little clearer. To conclude, Dunkirk is Nolan's Full Metal Jacket. I wouldn't say this is his greatest masterpiece, I reserve that for Memento. But Dunkirk is an outstanding piece of cinema that proves Nolan's auteurship and that he is one of the greatest filmmakers alive, if not, who ever lived. The man knows film and knows how to make a great, complex one. Hell the guy has a knack for impressing the experts, having actual scientists make discoveries through Interstellar, and now by a soldier who was at Dunkirk, praising Nolan for his accurate representation of the event. Now if that doesn't say it all then I don't know what will.
10.0~I loved every minute of Dunkirk charbelelaro Sign in Permalink Being the last day of the year, I thought I should review my absolute favourite film of 2017. Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan, was a movie which blew me away. I had to see it more than once in cinemas, due to how stunning it was visually. The beach, the ocean and the sky all looked incredible, with the help of little to no CGI, but just purely amazing cinematography. The reason as to why I love this film so much is because of how different and unconventional it is. Dunkirk represents war in the most realistic way. It shows you that in moments of horror, you don't always get to know the soldiers around you and their back story. This film deliberately throws the audience into the climax from the beginning. I loved how Christopher Nolan was able to tell such a simple story in a really complex way. This is shown with his play on time, which made the film all the more riveting. The score by Hans Zimmer added so much, and worked really well with the sounds of war. At times I was unable to seperate the two. Everything from the vulnerable performances to the runtime was perfect. I loved every minute of Dunkirk. The ending left me with goosebumps. So therefore I give it a 10. I've noticed I've mostly been reviewing movies I love, so in between my Star Wars series I will be sharing my thoughts on some films I hate with a passion... Look forward to that.
3.0~What the heck did I just watch???? kanjeep Sign in Permalink This movie was SO hard to follow. The timeline jumps around, telling the same story, three to four times and just confuses the viewer. They used actual Supermarine Spitfires and Spanish copies of the Bf109 and He111 which was exciting, but the scenes they were used it were just outlandish and unbelievable! The whole movie seems to miss the point. Dunkirk was an important part of WWII and it never really tells the story. This could have, and should have, been a much better movie, but sadly, isn't.
5.0~Deluded fantasy bordering on dishonesty. wolfghostninja Sign in Permalink WW2 was a brutal event in human history, more than 90 million souls perished. The best WW2 films acknowledge the fact that this was a war, but this film does the opposite as is demonstrated by its 12 rating. In an effort to maximize profits it presents a fictitious, sanitised, version of what war looks like. Possibly one of the worst post war films to cover events.
5.0~Bored and disappointed houstons-82952 Sign in Permalink So many (p)reviews, so many trailers, so many teasers and ads all around internet made me think that this film was going to be epic, just like Saving Private Ryan. But IMHO, it was far from that. All actors played well, especially Mark Rylance (he was also great in Bridge of Spies). However when the film ended, i was feeling bored. I could wait for a few months to rent this movie on some video-on-demand service. If you expect an epic film, think twice. I totally disagree with the 8.4 rating. It should be around 6.5.
5.0~I don't understand all the hype. Several scenes were ridiculous. adaringdo-1 Sign in Permalink This movie is a snapshot glance at possible events during the evacuation of the allied troops at Dunkirk after the military disaster following the German invasion of France in 1940. I was pretty much bored throughout the first half of the movie and at various times thereafter. Although the historical significance of the events are captured to a limited degree, several of the fictional elements shown were actions of abject stupidity and left me stunned. #1: No hospital ships were sunk by German aircraft at Dunkirk. #2: The events in the beached trawler were so absurd I doubt any person could be so ignorant. Soldiers trying to plug 30-50 bullet holds in the hull with their fingers and then thinking that killing and throwing out a French soldier would make up for tons of continuous flooding. #3: The shooting down of the German bomber (an event that would have taken 30 second in real time) took 10 minutes in film time. I decided the Spitfire must have been flying at about 1 mile an hour. #4: The killing of the teenager had no significance and was a totally pointless plot device. #5 The out of fuel spitfire then made several impossible aerial maneuvers to shoot down a German plane flying 200 miles an hour faster than it was. The only truly heroic person in the movie was the civilian boat captain who managed to dodge his boat around a German fighter attack, a totally absurd scenario. I have never, however, seen anything that indicated German aircraft attacked any small civilian boats. All and all I can't express my disappointment with this movie. I don't think its terrible, but it is certainly not praise worthy.
1.0~Dreadful johnomail Sign in Permalink The idea of this film had so much potential. The execution is dreadful. First off most of the soldiers are too clean, to well fed. Uniforms are clean and also every helmet is pristine green paint. The few we see actually waiting on the beach failed to reflect the terror of being bombed and strafed for days on end. Talk about sheep standing in line waiting at the abattoir!! The acting is a best wooden, at worst non-existent. What a waste of Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy to say nothing of Tom Hardy. There is zero character development, resulting in zero emotion and zero identification with the plight of the characters. OK Spoilers! What was the point of the kid on the boat falling down and dying? Since when do Spitfires have limitless ammunition? ( in reality they had 15 to 20 seconds of ammo ) How can a Spitfire with a dead engine shoot down a bomber? Why did Tom Hardy land his Spitfire towards the Germans and get captured? Why did the soldiers hide in a boat that was outside their perimeter? I could go on but what's the point. Finally, I laughed out loud when Branagh, standing on the mole said 340,000 had been saved, How the hell would he know that? Don't waste your time and money on this film.
5.0~Too much hype for this one! dfwesley Sign in Permalink I read the reviews, talked to people who had seen it, and was led to believe it was the greatest war movie of all time. Far from it. It can't be mentioned in the same breath as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, for instance, and I could name a good handful of others. I was confused by all the separate scenes each lasting but a few seconds. This made it seem an eternity before the Spitfire shot down the German bomber, and there was the damaged Spitfire, gliding and gliding. The huge budget provided for merely a few planes and a token number of rescue ships.How else was it spent? Plenty of noise, stupendous action, and very little acting or even dialogue. No, this war movie was disappointing to say the least.
1.0~A worthless movie wasted on a unreal storyline pbonly-37938 Sign in Permalink Who in his right mind would rate this as a good war movie by any standards. The storyline aside, which it begs to have been based on real events, the film is neither entertaining nor can hold any audience for its factual relevance or storytelling. Will not blame you if you trusted any positive reviewer for this movie here and have ended up feeling cheated. Make sure to note these reviewers name & avoid their suggestions to save such pain in future.
9.0~This is what filmmaking is about frederikbarndorff Sign in Permalink I think most movie fans were excited for this film. I know i was very excited, but then again Christopher Nolan is absolutely one of my favorite directors. Right up there with Scoresese and Spielberg. So naturally "Dunkirk" was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. I have rarely seen a film this thrilling and intense. "Dunkirk" never gives you a moment to relax. It puts you right in the middle of the action and it works. "Dunkirk" is filmmaking at It's finest. Instead of CGI Nolan uses real destroyers and real spitfires. This makes for one of the most realistic war films you will find and this without all the gore and flying limbs you're used to in war films. The score by Hans Zimmer is one of the most important aspects of the film it get's your heart pumping during the non-stop action and in that respect is one of, If not the best film scores of the year. As for the performances those are great as well although we don't really learn that much about the characters. The different characters in the film don't have big emotional arcs. Perhaps some will consider this a big flaw, but for this film it works. In that way It's more realistic. In a situation this intense you wouldn't have the time to tell about the wife waiting for you at home. A scene like that is left out and i never for a second I missed it. Dunkirk is a brilliant movie and one of the best of the year. Nolan once again delivers a great film. A great experience. If you can, i recommend you go see it in IMAX for the best experience. Dunkirk rating 10/10 ⭐️
5.0~Too slow! ehulbert Sign in Permalink This movie moves slower than molasses! It could have shown scenes of how they fought the Germans and how they were pushed back to the Channel, but they spent too much time after they were on the beach.
4.0~Big disappointment algalli-1 Sign in Permalink After seeing the ratings on IMDb I had big expectations for this movie. The movie starts abruptly. There is no set up for the main story of rescue by private citizens. There is no sense of large numbers of private citizens being involved. There is no real emotion developed throughout the story. I never really cared about any of the characters. I simply missed whatever it is that most people felt made this an 8.7. I have seen news reels that were better done. It is the only time in all my years that I felt I could have created a better story and done a better job of directing than those actually involved.
5.0~Epically overrated y-03103 Sign in Permalink I was disappointed by this film. It is a mish-mash of poorly acted and poorly executed snippets. It is unconvincing and unengaging throughout. Quite the achievement given the subject matter and richness of possibilities in 300,000 personal stories and witnesses. Judged by what was on screen it could have been a TV movie with limited budget for a juvenile audience. Dunkirk deserved better.
2.0~Emporers new clothes meyuk Sign in Permalink Saw this at an imax cinema. Boy did the imax 'sound' ruin the talking. The dreary background noises generally drummed out the voices, even when there was no other action going on. There should also have been some quiet passages depicting just the sound of the waves as the soldiers took stock of their terrible plight. The film itself is a jumble of truncated scenes, sometimes repeated, that are not filmed very well. One scene ranged from day on the English side to night in France, then, for a minute, we had a storm only to never see it again. The characters are ridiculous and the lack of factual events is disappointing. This film would have us believe that 300,000 soldiers were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk by a single visit from a number of small fishing boats. Also, that 3 spitfires were enough to provide all the air cover that the soldiers needed. This film is so bad that people must be commenting on it based on their knowledge of the makers and actors involved, rather than what they saw and heard.
5.0~Let down psychotico Sign in Permalink I was expecting an epic film from all the hype and trailers. The number of evacuees didn't resemble the real images of the exodus that took place at Dunkirk. The numbers were thinned down for this film, maybe 10,000 heads compared to 390,000 missing from the screen. the film was purely smoke and mirrors when it came to the soundtrack, repetitive and leaving you expecting something was going to happen... I feel at utterly disappointed when it ended.
10.0~Home ThomasDrufke Sign in Permalink I saw Dunkirk 4 days ago, but I really wanted to sit on the experience and not review it until I fully understood what Christopher Nolan was going for. This isn't your typical war movie, neither it terms of structure or execution. But it is how you'd expect Christopher Nolan to tackle a war epic; with a non-linear structure, tightly written and directed scenes, and one heck of a mind-blowing score from Hans Zimmer. It's far from the easiest film to dissect, but the experience is undeniably moving. Being a massive Christopher Nolan fan, I came into Dunkirk with high expectations and a ton of curiosity of how Nolan would treat a true story. This is the first film of is that attempts to take real-life events and present his own depiction. Unsurprisingly, the thing I love most about Dunkirk is Nolan's direction. Quite often war films look at the big picture (rightfully so), covering events from each side and telling in-depth stories about politics and survival. There's nothing wrong with those approaches, but the fact that Nolan takes a massive-scale approach to Dunkirk visually, when in reality the film is just about soldiers trying to survive on one particular beach, makes it all the more impressive. When you get past the fact that there's little dialogue and character development, there's plenty to love about Dunkirk. Nolan's films all have those defining visual moments, as he often loves to have his non-linear structure be used to its full effect and use the multiple story angles to create a few epic moments. Think Inception, when the "dream is collapsing" and there's 3 different layers of dreams all coalescing at the same time. Dunkirk uses that same approach for pretty much the entire movie, The Mole (beach), The Sea, and The Air. The editing can be frustrating the first time around, as it was for me, especially when you really just want to learn more about each of these characters if they expect us to care at all. Jumping viewpoints turns out to be exactly the way this film should be structured. In reality, none of these soldiers would have time to tell each other their respected backgrounds or life stories, they're just trying to survive. I thought Nolan handled this beautifully. Complementing the rapid editing is yet another terrific Hans Zimmer score. Nolan said in an interview that he gave Zimmer a recording of a ticking clock to give him an idea as to how he wanted the tone of the score to feel. Well, Zimmer took that to heart as that ticking clock is literally heard throughout the film. I love all of the Zimmer-Nolan collaborations, and Dunkirk is no exception. In fact, Zimmer's score could almost be considered more of an impactful character than the real characters themselves. There aren't many composers that can match the intensity that Nolan wants behind and in front of the camera, but Zimmer definitely does. From Tom Hardy's almost dialogue-less performance, to the breathtaking cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, and the incredible work done by Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk is a film which sees Christopher Nolan at the top of his craft. It's the shortest film of his since 'Following' but it may very well be his most emotionally effective film, and that's without developing any characters. Every year I'm hoping to see movies that change the way cinema is made and viewed, Nolan is one of the few directors that constantly break new ground in Hollywood. As much as Dunkirk isn't what I thought it would be, I can't ask for anything more than for him to reinvent the genre. +Score +Non-linear structure +Mind-blowingly gorgeous visuals +The best air-force sequences ever from a war film 10/10
10.0~This Generations "Saving Private Ryan" cdjh-81125 Sign in Permalink Sometimes when I anticipate a film for so long, all the way through its production from the time it is announced it's almost an odd feeling when i finally sit down in the theatre and watch it for the first time, But unlike in the past this film did not disappoint me in the slightest, not only did it live up to my, honesty unreasonably high expeditions, it exceeded all of them by being something I never expected. The structure of the film was something I wasn't sure would work, having three perspectives all in different times could have been rather jarring and incomprehensible but it wasn't, it only helped to add to the scale and stakes of this whole event and not only how important it was that it succeeded but also just how difficult victory was going to be to achieve. This film doesn't put much effort into developing its characters, usually that would bother me but here it didn't. I got the impression that this film wasn't about the characters or the actors playing them but instead about the situation they were in. I didn't have any issuer getting behind any of her because the importance of this operations success was so well established it was clear how important it was for them to survive and get home. While Dunkirk is most definitely not a performance piece all the actors are great in this film. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy are probably the stand outs but the new comers do deserved credit, they don't have much dialogue but they but still perfectly convey they're need to survive. Christopher Nolan has been one of my favourite directors of all time for so long and I knew he was going to do magnificent things with this movie and he did not disappoint. He did some of his best work ever here. He kept such a consistent pace from the opening scene he puts you right into the situation and doesn't let up by constantly showing chaos and destruction all within camera with no cgi or green screen making it feel all the more real. The aerial dogfight sequences were incredible, nothing about them felt fake, they felt real, intense and confined and because of them only lasting one hour of time they never let up. As much as this film showed a lot of death and insurmountable odds it also has such a great message about hope and what people can truly accomplish when they band together which gives this film a much needed heart instead of it just being a non-stop thrill ride. Dunkirk is a cinematic masterpiece, it lived up to everyone of my incredibly high expectations and exceeded them giving me one of the most unique war films ever made. Everything from a technical, performance and writing standpoint was done perfectly to the pout where this film felt more like an experience and less like a viewing. 10/10-A+ (Incredible)
6.0~A technical marvel without human emotions akshaygopakumar Sign in Permalink In a scene, Tom hardy saves thousands of lives by making a fighter plane go down to ashes. But the scene had no impact on me as an audience. This is in fact the problem with this aesthetically perfect movie. We do not feel for the soldiers at any point of time. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overused to such an extent that the focus goes to the music score instead of the visuals. Dunkirk could have done so any things right just by having a higher run-time. In 100 odd minutes, the movie just, don't move us. It had all the perfect components for a movie that would remain in our hearts for times to come, but getting out of the cinema hall, only the burger I had in between remained with me. Not the best Nolan film Not the best war film Not even the best film of the year
3.0~Waste of time patbradley435 Sign in Permalink This is no Saving Private Ryan, most definitely not because it is tedious beyond belief. There is no character development and the excitement and tension is non-existent. I switched this rubbish off after an hour. Please trust me, this is not a great movie like some are saying it is. The script is dreadful, as is the acting. It is almost impossible to believe in anything in this Nolan debacle. Even the air dog-fight scenes were intensely mediocre. Do yourself a favor, watch Private Ryan again or Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. They tread this heap of garbage into the ground. Hey, you don't believe me? Go sit through it and tell me I'm wrong.
3.0~Too many confusing story lines about individuals lordbusiness19 Sign in Permalink I had the opportunity to preview this movie and was very excited to see it as I am a history buff. **Spoiler**As the movie starts out, we are introduced to a few characters, whose names were either never said, or I could not hear them. (The background sounds--the "subtle" music that was playing while the characters talked, or sounds of walking, just any ambient noise--was so loud that it covered much of the dialogue, and the sound effects of the war were headache-inducingly loud--don't know if that is the movie itself, or the theater--but why wouldn't the dialogue have been louder as well if it was the theater?). So we have these characters, and then all of a sudden the story shifts to some other people, who don't seem to have any connection to the first few characters. And then we shift to more new characters, and then to more. All in all, there are about 10 story lines going on, I guess to tell the story of Dunkirk from more than one perspective. However, the movie seems to just randomly jump from one character story line to another without connecting all of them, or having any kind of overall plot arc (other than the story lines are all about Dunkirk). It reminded me of the multiple story lines from Love Actually, except that in that brilliant movie, all the story lines are connected and make sense together! I wish the focus had been a little narrower, and stayed on one or two characters and their experience, rather than showing a breadth of experiences, but no depth. There was no character background given on anyone, so I never developed any kind of connection with any of them. As there was no character background, there was also no way to develop the characters. They all seemed very flat. And surprisingly, unlike almost every other WWII movie out there, there was no "historical synopsis" at the end--you know, like "Dunkirk was a success, and is the only time in history that civilians were called on to aid the troops." (I don't know if that's true or not, just saying something they might have said), or some little nugget of history that really finished the story. Overall, it was filmed well and acted well, but I felt like the dialogue was lacking to really tell the story of the characters, and the dialogue that I did hear was not sufficient to enthrall me or help me to know the people involved. So disappointing that we don't get to know those characters better, I think their stories would have been very interesting, and lent a greater depth to the movie. But the stories, their experiences, just aren't there.
2.0~Why do people like this movie?? EricMcCullough1 Sign in Permalink I saw Dunkirk in a pre-screening before it was out for the general public and I was very surprised that it got the reception it did. In all fairness if you're reading these reviews to decide if it's worth watching or not odds are you are probably going to like it because so many people seem to but I can't for the life of me understand why. I think the soundtrack is just plain bad and mostly droning. I never felt emotionally attached to any of the protagonists so couldn't care what happened to them and overall it just feels like nothing really happens throughout the whole film. I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan in Inception and Dark Knight but this is a dud as far as I'm concerned.
3.0~A hot mess pajeme1956-1 Sign in Permalink I hated this movie. It did a horrible job of telling an important period in history. the script was amateurish. However, the biggest problem was the editing. I can't believe this is on any "best" movie of the year list.
2.0~Loved the sound effects daniel-boss Sign in Permalink Really loved the sound effects - the planes, the sea, the bullets pinging past. The rest was utter dross. Baffled by the rave reviews, 2018 is a new record low for standards.
4.0~Dunkirk or "Christopher Nolan Wants To Hit You Around The Head With a Bat" Parks Sign in Permalink There's not much said in "Dunkirk" for a lot of the time. Occasionally, officers heave into view for some handy bits of exposition, but mostly this is a film where the soundtrack consists of tortured metal grinding, diving bombers screaming, engines roaring and Hans Zimmer's score. And what a score it is. More industrial BWAAAMPS and thuds, as if the sounds of battle were not horrific enough. It's to make the point that war is hell. I get that. Although I've also come to the conclusion that war could potentially be worse if it was accompanied by a Hans Zimmer score. The story mainly consists of one event that took place during the Dunkirk evacuation, seen from three different points of view, that you then see three times during the movie. Yes, playing around with a non-traditional narrative structure is cool and clever. But it's also kind of pointless in a film like this. I mean, we in the audience sit there, potentially in suspense - will the thing that we've seen happen twice before in the movie happen again the third time?? Well, of course it will. Suspense gone. Patience running thin. The movie ends abruptly on a note of patriotism. Nothing wrong with that. But hearing Churchill quoted as Elgar swells isn't exactly subtle is it? But Christopher Nolan seems to have lost touch with subtlety. He wants his audience bludgeoned, beaten, BWAAAAAMP'ed into submission. I think I'll stick with David Lean.
5.0~The film lacked that "WOW!" factor. chernan-21744 Sign in Permalink This film was average. Maybe I went in expecting too much from this production. It show definitely be on WW2 enthusiast's watch list. It was worth my time, though. I just can't seem to come up with what the film was lacking. Hopefully, others will get more out of it than I did. I really expected much more action in the form of actual battle scenes. I won't say the film is a 'must' watch, more like "should, but not missing anything spectacular if you don't watch it."
5.0~early reviews calls for Oscar clean sweep? getjono Sign in Permalink don't get me wrong, this is a good movie and well worth the visit to the cinema. Some of the action shots of the fighter pilots were among the most realistic I have ever seen in a WW2 flick - but seriously the early reviews were completely overstating the movies credibility. Oscar clean up? - laugh out loud. Im a detail person, so to be worthy of an Oscar Id have to say continuity of the basics must be right. If you look at the boat crossing, whilst the wind is blowing in the right direction for the journey -the sea condition and weather are lacking consistency in each scene. they go from very choppy disturbed seas to almost flat calm. The beach shots are more of the same. crikey in some shots the tide is in, others its not. I could go on and on with goofs and inconsistencies throughout the movie but wont - you expect these things in a many average films - but please... if this is an Oscar nomination then standards have dropped
6.0~Utterly underwhelming as a piece of storytelling and a piece of entertainment texasrangerdan Sign in Permalink I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this film, being a fan of about everything Christopher Nolan does. There were 2 ways the story of Dunkirk could be told: 1.An epic which showed broadly the scale of the operation, the death toll and the effect on the war. 2. Follow a group of characters and experience the story through their eyes as they go through it all. It attempts the latter and falls short in a big way. Paper thin characters across the board left me completely disinterested in the story. Even Tom Hardy failed to evoke an emotion. What were his character traits? I couldn't name one except the obvious bravery. The effects are seamless, I will give it that, but the quantities of everything are somewhat baffling. I think I saw less than 10 aircraft in the whole movie, yet dive bombing is largely the focus of the film. Did they run out of budget? I think I watched a different film to the other reviewers.
1.0~Not at all what I expected and thats not a good thing.. elielilemasabachtani Sign in Permalink First of all this is not a movie, nor a war movie. This is not even a story or an adventure. Its nothing, its liek sitting and watching comercials or something, and the bad ones. It has no point, no purpose and I didnt get it at all. It didnt deliver any feelings or care or anything, OH MY... Fair enough this movie was tedious... I do not recommend it at all. Cant believe how a budget like this can deliver this little and how in the name of Jesus Christ can it get the rating it has... IMDB need to do something about this.
5.0~Modern Example of The Emperor's New Clothes NewandykeFreddie Sign in Permalink I just want to start off by saying that going into this movie I wasn't very excited about Dunkirk in the first place. I saw the uninspiring trailer for this film a few weeks earlier and thought very little of it. It looked like a poor-man's Saving Private Ryan in all honesty. But what got the audience (and the friend sitting beside me) all riled up was the presence of Christopher Nolan's "glorious" name in the sequence. I knew this movie would receive extra praise even before it's release just for that reason. I want to also say that I like to see every movie I can, especially those that are highly praised and recommended by others, in order to give them all an equal chance. So I went to see this movie to give it a chance. I've actually been surprised by many movies and I was eagerly waiting for this movie to surprise me. So I waited. I saw some mediocre, unoriginal and non- unique characters get introduced. I waited more. I saw some ships blow up. And before I even realized how boring and uneventful this movie was, it was over. I sat there in disbelief, thinking maybe I had seen the wrong movie. I looked to my left and right, only to hear my friends and others praising this movie. Had they not seen what I had? Were they not also bored out of their minds? They unfortunately could not pinpoint exactly what made this movie so unique and amazing. I suspect that maybe, again, it has something to do with the fact that it was made by Christopher Nolan. It really is unfortunate that movies like this receive so much praise and will most likely win many Oscars, though they do not deserve them. All because people go into the theatre with preconceived opinions of the movie. Afraid that if they do not like the movie they will be labelled as fools. It's The Emperor's New Clothes all over again...
2.0~Incredibly disappointing. kevinacrowley Sign in Permalink I was looking forward to this movie so much but after sitting through it, I was left feeling empty. I don't know how the critics were kind to this film. I really wish I didn't waste my time watching it. Weak story line, disappointing & predictable special effects, dodgy CGI in places. It didn't feel like a +$100 million dollar film. I only give it a 2 out of 10 because the aerial photography and air- combat scenes were well done for the most part.
8.0~Strong work from a director at the top of his craft. ciskowski Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is tense, sparse, and unsettling. Nolan makes many interesting choices, starting with the 1 week/1 day/1 hour non-sequential action structure, which is effective and yet disorienting. He creates a film about the fate of hundreds of thousands of men, crowded into a small pocket of land and into tightly-packed ships, that feels open, empty, and nearly deserted. Similarly, a film that conveys a constant sense of danger and dread features actors who remain withdrawn and almost unresponsive in nearly every scene. Mark Rylance unsurprisingly provides a standout performance; Hans Zimmer's score is unsettling and dangerous in perfect parallel with the on screen action, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is spare, beautiful, and evocative. Creating such a beautiful yet unsentimental war film is a bold move, and personally I felt a bit less invested in its arc than I might have expected. In this it's almost a counter-argument to Saving Private Ryan. But while I can't say that I fell in love with the film, I definitely recognize the mastery of craft and art, all in service to the director's vision. It's impressive and makes for a quite worthy film.
1.0~The worst war film ever made... merdit Sign in Permalink Hello, I saw this film 1 hour ago and the only thing i can say it is the most epic fail film you will never see. The film has 50 words said in the whole film. The most annoying thing is the god damn music and sounds. From the start pf the film till the end it is the same annoying violin sound that after 1 hour of listening to it i left the cinema room. I have seen many many war films and this one honestly is the worst of all. It does not only disappoints you buy also that music or sound annoys you till you cant watch the film anymore. Compared to other war films like saving private ryan this film is like eating bugs after a chocolate. Disgusting movie....
4.0~Plot spoiler alert if there had been a plot. I don't understand the praise? mjude-32153 Sign in Permalink I am a bit of a WWII buff so knew the story of Dunkirk going in. I can only imagine how lost a person not familiar with this chapter from history would be while watching this movie. Outside of a few lines of text at the beginning that provide an extremely brief bit of background info, there is zero explanation of what is happening so don't expect any sort of history lesson. It's kind of like a documentary that used all of its budget to create excellent reenactment footage but ignored the narration. Instead of a voice like David McCullough or Morgan Freeman to tell the tale, there is an annoying, overly loud, virtually continuous music score that instructs the viewer how to feel every single second. For a few scenes the director must have decided that loud manipulative music wasn't quite enough and elected to use dead silence instead. Frankly, my ears were so relieved during these precious quiet moments that any scene at all, another pan of the sky, another upturned face, a boot in seafoam would have triggered a tremendous emotional response. And yes, scenes are repeated. Remember when you first saw the trailer? When the cold, grey, ominous sky; cold, grey, ominous beach, and c.g.o. water made you feel almost as if something ominous was going to happen? Well, if you appreciated all of that great dreary English Channel atmosphere in the trailer you are in luck because the one thing Dunkirk succeeds in is establishing an ominous, dreary atmosphere. It's kind of a miracle how minutes and minutes of panning clouds, water, and beach don't begin to get old until about 45 minutes in. That's about the point when you sneak a look at your watch and realize that nothing more is going to happen. At my first watch look I was still hopeful and subtracted 35 minutes for previews which still gave the movie time to, you know, start moving. By my third time check I found myself wishing that I had paid A LOT more attention to one of the young dark headed guy's garbled words during the first ten minutes because I was starting to worry that I had missed something drastically important to the plot. But it turned out I hadn't missed anything more important than determining what was going on in any of the three, non-linear, confusing story arcs. Dunkirk follows the separate stories of a soldier, a sailor, and a pilot who are just trying to get home during war. Except for the pilot, who glides his plane down on the wrong shore. And except for the sailor who takes his children into known danger because he already lost one son to the war and loses another son on the journey but doesn't seem to mind. But these lads might not even be his children. I either forgot or it somehow slipped by me in the 50 or so spoken words that I actually understood. Regardless, I liked the sailor character the best by far, if only for the fact that he had the lead speaking role. At the end, the director predictably juxtaposes the bleakness of the beach at Dunkirk to the colorful landscape of the English countryside to suggest that the war is behind the dark headed soldier guys. And as one of them reads aloud from a newspaper about how silly their mission was, their countrymen somehow know that the newspaper is wrong and welcome them home with drink. Oh, he also reads part of Churchill's famous, "We will beat them on the beach," speech in what might be the most awkward style ever recorded. I assume this was done to hammer home the fact that young men who go to fight in our wars are just simple, uneducated fellows. But really, I have no idea. This movie might be deceitfully deep or just a collection of nicely filmed war images. I left the theater not knowing a single character's name, not caring the slightest about any of the characters, and not able to even coherently describe what happened. It was like retelling a fading dream that seemed to have narrative and importance but only images and atmosphere remain. What is even more astounding, but to my great relief, I couldn't even remember enough of the nonstop, blaring score to hum a single bar. SUMMARY: If you've never seen a war movie you might be very impressed by Dunkirk's power. Or, judging from the positive critical reviews, you might have seen all of the major war movies and still be impressed. I honestly have no idea. POSITIVES: *Great attention to atmosphere and mood *Great cinematography *Probably will get people interested in learning about Dunkirk and WWII *Reaffirms that war is bad *Does not rely on gratuitous violence *Might be the only realistic war movie of the past 30 years that could be appropriate for kids *Story is told from a creative, non- traditional p.o.v. NEGATIVES: *Boring *Repetitive *Is basically a silent movie outside of the ear shattering score and sound effects *Incomprehensible narrative *Zero character development *Zero historical context *The score ODD INCLUSION: *I get that the director wanted to show that war is hard on the regular people who are involved. And I get that fear is hard on the bowels. But TWO pooping scenes/references within the first five minutes?? COMPARISONS: *The movie "Carol" which was long on atmosphere and got critical acclaim but was a lazy snooze-fest
3.0~Tell the STORY, for God's sake! pauldaguirre Sign in Permalink A grating example of how modern filmmaking has utterly lost the ability to tell a story. They've got the budget. The actors. The locations. The camerawork. The sound. And after nearly two hours, there is no coherent sense of storytelling in any direction, emphasized all the more by that relentless, anachronistic musical score... We can only pray the 'slice of life' era of filmmaking will end soon. I'm exhausted from so-called auteurs forcing audiences to do the work they themselves haven't done.
2.0~Absolutely terrible csgrego Sign in Permalink Nolan's inexplicable time jumping and terrible soundtrack does absolutely nothing to tell or enhance the story of Dunkirk. The reasoning Nolan gives seems pretentious and comes from a guy that desires to be thought brilliant or produce movies only for his own enjoyment. In the end it's simply a hot mess.
9.0~A movie about war that does not have war heroes marcelloguidetti Sign in Permalink I watched several war movies in the past years, and I always enjoyed the most the fighting scene, the rapid movement or the story regarding the event, the planning of the mission,action. What I loved in this movie is that it doesn't tell you a story as if you were a far away spectator, it takes you from your sit and puts you straight on that shore and tells you: "This is war, now we are going to experience it together". I felt the stress the private felt while trying to escape in every possible way, I felt the lack of oxygen in the underwater scenes, I felt the heaviness of the silence in the infinite seconds of waiting. Generally war movies, always try to draw a line between good and evil, underling who is the friend and who is the enemy; what I felt during this movie is that, more than trying to create two different groups, from the very beginning what is pictured is the human nature in the war zone: surviving instinct. There are a few scene where it does not matter on which side they were, the only thing that matter was: "Mors tua vita mea", another detail that add truth and authenticity to the story. Another thing that this movie has is, at least for me, being unpredictable. I didn't know, or catch, the destiny of the characters, until the end, until the very last scene I didn't know what was going to happen to every single character of the story.
2.0~Terrible Movie - Proof that critics are paid off princevince-86783 Sign in Permalink A wise man once told me "the Majority is always wrong" and if you doubt this. All you need to do is watch this travesty of a movie which is an insult to the intelligence of everyone who paid to see this movie. No plot, no character development, no dialogue for god sakes, I would be stunned if anybody leaving the theater even knew the names of any character in this "movie" now I may not be Roger Ebert, but aren't those things I mentioned pretty much essential to ANY movie? Is it technically amazing as some have stated? perhaps, but I could stare at a Windows 10 background and get the same visuals, the movies need an actual story, actual plot advancement. The entire movie consisted of basically 2 scenes, a plane flying, and a ship leaking, the end. my entire section was falling asleep. For me, this was Christopher Nolan living off his name, and critics being paid off, the great reviews that this film has gotten is an affront to the intelligence of the movie goers, and is completely absurd. By far the worst film of Christopher Nolan, and one of the worst of the year, which means it'll probably win an Oscar. What a joke.
1.0~Dullwork should be the ideal title for this one Lalpera Sign in Permalink I am still trying to pick up the pieces of my brain after watching this so called 'epic movie ever' with so many dumb accolades! I am still at a loss to figure out what the heck Nolan was trying to tell us? Is it the 'heroic work' of allied troops; which actually to me, were lamely waiting for their death? Or was it about just one single heroic job of a RAF pilot or two? Or just about a story of some crap Nazi pilots, all of whom just got shot by one or two RAF planes who were running even without a drop of fuel? Some pilots can kill even when they are gliding so I guess miracles happen, doesn't it?? And the pain of racing your brain in between millions of scenes just nearly assassinate you! Why did Nolan think he was creating climax by swapping a soup of 3 main background scenes over and over, so quickly, till the end where that juggling-in-between scene job exhausts you to near death? It totally kills the smooth flow of any story telling if there was any! I don't have anything to comment about acting because there was no acting of any significance. All the actors were like monuments. And what was that guy Fionn was doing as Tommy, I don't have heck of an idea! There was nothing to comment about music either which I did fairly OK with my strong ear plugs. Editing was the mantra for Nolan it seems and probably is much better than the director's job I must say. In short, just waste few dollars and hours and get a boring dull story with an endless cacophony!
10.0~Staggering cinema. Not "getting it" is very much on you... eonbluedan-1 Sign in Permalink It' s 1940, 400,000 allied troops are cornered and cut off on the beaches of Dunkirk; with the enemy closing in, and no cover or defence, they await annihilation or a miracle. We experience the moment as the characters do, without unnecessary exposition or dialogue! This proves quite the departure for Nolan; there is a lot here that owes more to silent cinema than anything else, but his images often say all that needs to be said. An opening frame invites us to join a group of soldiers. Next, the loudest onslaught of gunfire kicks the film into another gear. We are given as much pause for thought as the soldiers we follow. We run with Tommy, played here by a Fionn Whitehead, and like him, we are aware of comrades falling dead next to us, but it is all panic and no time; we will lament their loss later. Set to the ticking of a watch, we feel Tommy's heart pounding with ours, and we know the tone for this audacious movie has been set. We see the event from different perspectives and from within different time frames. Right now, not many directors can build momentum like Nolan. The jumping to and from different characters' point of view, the corkscrewing impression of the editing, events echoed and mirrored by Hans Zimmer's Shepherd's Tones and persistent, all enveloping score, acting at times more like sound design than music; it all results in a constant rise in tension, to the point of almost being exhaustive. This said, the editing also serves another purpose. The "Miracle of Dunkirk" is a grand story, with every soldier, every pilot, and every civilian having their own point of view. Nolan wants us to build up an overall picture of the event purely through subjective experience, so of course we spend a tiring week with the terrified boys. Of course we spend a desperate day with a fisherman as he and his familial crew sail their way into action. Lastly, given the fuel constraints of the RAF, whose decisions had to be immediate and impulsive, always a choice between defending the beach or getting home, why would we spend any more that an edge-of-your-seat, quickly-cut hour in the cockpit of a Spitfire, as they do their duty and enter into dogfights to keep the German aircraft at bay? Each timeline is contracted or dilated to give everybody equal measure and importance, whilst staying true to and very much in their situation. Yes, this means we're kept on our toes; we have moments of confusion as timelines cross over and we see the same thing happening from another point of view, but as we head into the finale, as well as the aforementioned tension and release (which is just exciting cinema), we also get to see how, despite very different perspectives, everyone was working together, and how sacrifice and struggle for duty were par for the course for all involved, whether other people knew it or not. It is important that we the audience recognise this bigger picture, and as everything clicks together in an emotive final convergence of efforts, we not only see the justification for the techniques adopted, but struggle to imagine the story told another way. That is, at least, without going down a standard route, with objective storytelling employed. A proper review not being complete without comment on the elephant in the room, it must be said that Harry Styles does not stand out like the proverbial sore thumb at all. Frankly, he carries his scenes with aplomb, and surely, following the Heath Ledger lesson, and now this, it is time we learned that, maybe, Christopher Nolan just knows what he's doing better that we do? As to the other big names, there are moments from that remain with me so long after having seen it: Kenneth Brannagh and Mark Rylance can say so much with so little, their faces and gestures doing the heavy lifting to deliver a lot of the human emotion, and it would appear Tom Hardy has Oscar-worthy eyes! You need see nothing more through the course of his drama to have a complete sense of the type of man his Farrier is. We talk about great acting and achieving realism through imagination, but with the knowledge that Nolan actually took everyone to Dunkirk, sank real ships, sailed real ships, flew real Spitfires overhead, employed real explosions on the beach, and even rejected green screen and CGI in favour of cardboard cut-outs, it seems imagination wasn't too necessary for these already consummate actors. Nolan's principle fan base will be well prepared for what they get; but with his insistence on holding back from the audience any perspective not afforded his characters, ala 'Memento', some knowledge of the "Miracle Of Dunkirk" might put the more casual viewer in better stead. Regardless of which camp you fall into, or indeed of whether or not the movie does it for you, certain things are for sure: With no melodrama or cheese, and no superfluous fluff or emotional subterfuge, 'Dunkirk' is a purely experiential movie, a technical marvel of a war film unlike any other I can name. It also stands as a beacon in Nolan's career, characterised by his desire to cultivate an audience willing to keep up with him. And perhaps most importantly, this is a key moment in world history that is often overlooked; a disaster averted which, had it not been, would have seen the history books written very differently. That this event has been marshalled by a confident and sincere director, who has surely by now cemented his name alongside those of his own heroes, is reason enough to see 'Dunkirk'.
5.0~A Technical Achievement in Filmmaking Devoid of Any Depth or Emotion RustyShacklefordd Sign in Permalink Make no mistake, from a technical perspective Dunkirk is an absolute achievement in filmmaking. Shot in portion on IMAX and completely on film, it's a visually gorgeous movie with breathtaking cinematography of dogfights in the sky and battles at sea. The sound effects and mix are possibly the best I've ever heard in a film! The gunshots are and loud, frightening, and realistic and every scene with a plane closing in sounds as if it i flying right above the audience making for an all the more immersive experience. And as always, Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent and powerful score that is one of the best I've heard in a film in quite sometime. Yet, Dunkirk makes the same mistake that many technical and visually impressive films do, it forgets to give us any reason to care about what's going on within it's craft. Nolan has made a film that is strictly about the event that took place and has chosen to tell it in an unconventional non-linear structure with three different areas of the event taking course over the span of a week, day, and hour. By within a few minutes dropping us into all the chaos unfolding and not stating the structure aside from brief "One week...etc." cards in the very start, it takes a little bit of time to fully grasp the way the story is being unfolded and difficult to get into during the first act with things moving at such a quick pace . The biggest issue with Dunkirk though is that there is nothing to get invested in. I'm debating whether to even say this movie has any characters because none of them have any depth, personality, or background. This is a film where we are suppose to be rooting for the survival of these people, yet aren't given any reason to care about them other than the fact they are soldiers fighting the enemy. As the film progressed, I found myself not wanting to see where the actual story would progress, but instead hoping that there would be something else I could appreciate visually or technically to keep me from losing complete interest. Another big issue is that Nolan desperately wants this to be a grim and horrific portrayal of war. However, this is difficult to do when the film is restricted to the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. This is the perfect example of a film that needed an R rating to fully be effective in what it was trying to do. Take films such as Saving Private Ryan or the recent Hacksaw Ridge in which the battle scenes become borderline horror films due to not just their suspense, but brutality and graphicness. Not that Dunkirk needed to be a Gibson gorefest, but it's portrayal of war feels all too tame and can't deliver on the level of suspense that's built up in the scenes proceeding it. That isn't to say the film isn't without tense scenes, one in particular where soldiers are hiding in a ship that is being shot at for target practicing is particularly nerve-wrecking as well as the climax and the ending are also very well done. As for the acting, there isn't a bad performance here, but with little dialogue or much to do other than look frightened the cast isn't given a lot to work with to show off much. Tom Hardy's role could have been played by any other actor and it wouldn't have changed a thing which can be said for most of the cast here. For a film that has openly taken pride in how experimental, unique, and going against what is norm in Hollywood, Dunkirk ends up being exactly what Nolan has been criticizing. It's a complete exercise in spectacle that's trying to get a pass with it's unique style and filmmaking techniques to excuse it's lack of depth and emotional core. I can appreciate Nolan for taking a different approach to a war film and it certainly showcases his talent as a director, but just because it's different doesn't automatically make it good and without any real depth, characterization, or emotion only further provides evidence of his weakness as a writer. If the film had been trimmed down to 30-40 minutes and released as an IMAX feature it would have been much more impressive, but the film itself is an empty exercise in technical achievement that's in it's own way a new breed of cynical filmmaking.
1.0~Much hype--ended up rooting for the Gerans rmestl2 Sign in Permalink Lots of explosions and gore--no character development all, some wonderful Ed Wood like continuity problems (scenes changed from day to night to day to night even though all the action took place within a few miles of each protagonist). Frankly hard to tell who was who. The film missed the three major points of interest of Dunkirk-- 1. the bloody resistance the Brits and allies must have put up to keep the Germans at bay long enough for the evacuation to happen; 2. how the order to mobilize civilian ships in the rescue effort was communicated, and some background and insights into the men and women who responded so gallantly; and 3. how Churchill and the folks at home reacted to the news and how Churchill kept everyone's pecker up. Don't waste your money
9.0~A stunning blend of cinematic perfection and enthralling action leolazza Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is an experience not to be missed. State of the art cinematography sees a welcome exchange for enthralling camera work, soundtracks and composure over bloody combat, resulting in a quintessential portrayal of the Dunkirk evacuation. The plot, despite being gripping, is not the films strongest point. The films intention is to provide an accurate and stunning representation of the Dunkirk evacuation which the film was ever so successful at. Prepare to be taken back by tense aerial battles over millions of kilometers of vast, unforgiving ocean and experience the hopes of 400,000 soldiers rise and fall as each ship comes and goes, taking the lucky and leaving the rest to wait in fear. Unrivaled visual effects pose the relentless German forces as a greater threat then ever as you cling to your seat every time an enemy aircraft swoops in dropping fatal bombs and unceasing machine gun fire. Enemy threat will always be in the back the of your mind, allowing the film to be a never ending climax, providing every scene with captivating tension. Be sure to watch this masterpiece in a cinema to experience the intended impacts of Dunkirk's splendid audio and visual effects which are best enjoyed by surround sound and large screens rather than on your laptop screen while sitting on the couch. The film is complemented by terrific acting across the entire set with Harry Styles commendable acting debut adding a special kind of novelty to the film. I would highly recommend Dunkirk to any and all history buffs, anyone seeking accurate depiction of the Dunkirk evacuation or anyone who appreciates quality cinematography and an altogether brilliant movie experience.
6.0~All the excitement in this movie is not from the war but by accidents olivergadlarsen Sign in Permalink I just wanted to point out how much this movie isn't really exciting because of what you would think of. Lets count the number of stupid things that happens and I am not sure I remember them all. 1. The brave kid that goes on the civilian boat to help bring back soldiers get accidentally pushed down a few steps of stairs and gets brain damaged where he first gets blind and then dies. He is called a hero in the papers in the end of the movie when he literally did nothing and could had done nothing more than take the space of one soldier. 2. When a pilot lands in the water because he didn't have enough fuel and his gauge broke he can't get out of the plane because the lock to get out of the plane is broken and now he is in the danger of drowning. 3 and 4. Some soldiers are going inside a grounded boat to wait on the tide to take it back out. Next thing the enemy starts shoot practicing on the boat. This of course makes the boat leak and they can't go outside because of the enemy. So when the boat is finally long enough out they go outside except one soldier gets stuck, yes stuck and not because of the other soldiers! So he drowns. What a humiliating way to die in a war. 5. When the other plane run out of fuel the pilot doesn't think of trying to land where the other soldiers are. No he want to land a long way down the beach and when he is close to the ground he pulls the lever to get the landing gear ready, but wait... The landing gear is stuck! Major spoiler: The landing gear goes down just in time, but he of course gets captured because he didn't bother to land in the safe area.
5.0~Good but not a great movie srikrishnabhagwan Sign in Permalink From strictly action point of view the movie scores big but otherwise very ordinary movie. I still consider Saving Private Ryan as the best movie based on WW II. Dunkirk does not have any drama. Whatever human elements shown is at the superficial level. Very disappointed.If they had started and ended the movie based on some family drama then it would have scored big. Churchill's famous speech in the Parliament is read by one of the character from a news paper and does not have any effect. Instead if they had played the audio in background it would have had much greater effect.
3.0~A horrible mess of a movie - but beautifully shot mollystroll Sign in Permalink I gave this movie 2 stars for the photography - it is a beautifully shot film. I gave it one additional star for the first few minutes of what could and should have been an epic movie about an epic historical event that took place during some desperate, difficult and heroic days in World War 2. The entire British Expeditionary Force and French -- some 400,000 men - were surrounded by about 800,000 soldiers of the German Wehrmacht and pinned against the sea at Dunkerque. The trapped Allied forces were hammered on a constant daily basis by air and by heavy artillery. The fighting on the front lines was often desperate and bloody. It is estimated that some 60,000 Brit and French troops were killed or wounded during the nine days of fighting around Dunquerque, as well as over 1,000 civilians. The small boat navy that came into action from 27 May-4 June to evacuate the trapped armies was able to rescue 338,226 men, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops. Left behind were 35,000 to 40,.000 mostly French troops who held the perimeter until the last moment and then surrendered. It was a miraculous escape - beyond even the most optimistic of hopes. Churchill, for example hoped to get 30,000 back to Britain. The small-boat navy did ten times that number. None of that is shown or even hinted at by this movie. Instead we endlessly see a few hundred perfectly queued lines of Brits calmly standing in line in plain view on open beaches waiting to board ships that haven't arrived. Really. Never mind that in actuality those orderly lines would have been murdered by air attack and artillery bombardment. There is no hint of the desperate fighting that took place on the perimeter. There is no sense of how dangerous it was for the small-boats when they approached the beach to take on soldiers. Of the approximately 865 vessels that participated in the evacuation, 243 were sunk - most by artillery fire or air attack. That's almost one third. The drama, the danger, the desperation, the fury and horror of war, and also the heroics - all of these elements are missing from this beautifully photographed film. If one wishes to see a more accurate depiction of what The Battle of Dunkerque was probably like, see the combat segments around the town of Arnhem in the film "A Bridge Too Far" or the beach landing scene of "Saving Private Ryan". THAT's what Dunkerque would have been like - just standing up out of cover beach would have been certain suicide. Instead "Dunkirk" offers a non-violent experience, perhaps "a meditation" on war without actually portraying warfare. One of the most intense battles of World War Two reduced to a few gunshots, a couple of explosions, and an aerial dogfight shown 3 (or was it 4?) times from different viewpoints that made no sense. I guess the beautiful photography from the different perspectives was impossible to give up. Even Kenneth Brannaugh is wasted - spending his time on screen on a pier urging soldiers onto the maybe 20 boats portrayed in the movie. You would think an Admiral might have other issues to deal with? It is difficult to understand what the intent here was. They didn't make a war movie; nor did they make an attempt to tell the story of Dunkerque. It's a mess - but it is a beautifully photographed mess.
1.0~Impressive on Technicalities, Complete Failure on Scale abhinav-prkash Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a visual treat for art-buffs and students of cinematic discipline. But for everyone else, especially those who love history, the movie is a massive failure due to it's sheer incompetence in capturing the scale and import of the biggest military evacuation in modern history- 3,38,000 allied soldiers saved by over 1000 boats and ships in just a week. Dunkirk was not just any other battle incident in WWII. It's the story of how a large number of civilian vessels and navy ships safely transport around an enormous number of soldiers back to home. Its about achieving impossibility, doing a miracle, defying all odds only because so huge number of people were to be saved by so many untrained rescuers. Dunkirk is all and only about scale. Take this scale out and it becomes meaningless. Ask yourself - would anyone had given entire incident a second glance if there were 1000 soldiers to be saved and 20 odd boats came from Britain to do the job? No one, including Christopher Nolan himself. Yet he takes this subject and almost in a blasphemous treatment of its importance, does away with the very scale that made Dunkirk 'Dunkirk'. What you see is an empty beach, a handful of soldier, a few odd boats in water, and two spitfires in sky, trying to play out a theatrical enactment of entire event. And that's what this movie is- just theatrics and technicalities- creating temporal disturbances in story lines to impress the gullible, patching oddball narratives to cover- up for plot weakness, raining down musical scores to hide its lack of substance. I hope Mr Nolan never makes a movie on memory of Hiroshima attack - because then instead of a giant mushroom cloud that killed over 40,000 souls and decimated a city we will see a mild explosion and a couple of smoked huts.
9.0~An intense and terrifying IMAX experience unlike any other. tyson-hunsaker Sign in Permalink The latest film by Christopher Nolan takes a substantially different approach to how the audience experiences another real-life based war event from our history. Make no mistake of it, this isn't a by the numbers war epic with character arcs and dramatic dialogue. Nolan utilizes the spectacle of practical effects, core-shattering sound design, and genuine shock and terror of survival in war to deliver an intense 1 hour and 47 minute roller coaster. It was bold, different, and frankly terrifying. The film presents three different perspectives: beach, sea, and air to immerse the viewer into the various and thrilling aspects of the events of Dunkirk. Each perspective gives an interesting context to how the events unfolded and at first, it was difficult to grasp the timeline and when things were happening in relation to each other. However around halfway through the picture, the pieces fell together naturally and made a cohesive movie; surprisingly without too much effort from the audience to "figure out" (which one can come to expect when watching a Nolan film). During the presentation, a genius element to the film became quite clear which felt consistent with the actual event. While the characters got no back story and the protagonist/antagonist relationship was essentially nonexistent, the intention and execution of why Dunkirk was made the way it was became clear. During these events, no one had time to become personal with anyone or care where they were from. They didn't want to talk, relax, connect, or continue fighting. They wanted one thing: survival. They wanted to go home and not experience this anymore. So does the audience feel the same way. As precisely effective as the experience was, I wanted to leave. I became so blown away by the reality of what I was watching that I was begging the film to end. Moments made me feel sick to my stomach (and definitely done so deliberately by the extraordinary filmmakers). The audience will "survive" this experience of Dunkirk and it's difficult to say it's enjoyable but assuredly one of the most unforgettable experiences in a theater. Pacing was perfect. The score was thrilling and constant like a ticking time bomb that won't stop. Acting was decent but nothing that stands out. Technically, it's the marvel of the year that can't be missed (especially in IMAX). Having earned the title of "masterpiece" it's difficult to see myself watching this again and even rushing others to go see it. It's something you can't quite be prepared for and maybe something that's difficult to make it through. I'm amazed at the cinematic ability Christopher Nolan has at showing us how when a master can understand the rules of movies so perfectly, he can break all of them to mold and change the medium of filmmaking to something we can't expect.
5.0~Disappointment The_Polish_Commoner Sign in Permalink I am a complete politics and history buff and eat up documentaries and historical films very willingly, especially those having to do with WWII. Unfortunately this one was quite disappointing. We follow the footsteps of three characters/groups of characters. A young British soldier stuck at Dunkirk, pilots trying to defend the skies above the English channel to allow vessels safe passage, and a father along with his son and son's friend trying to save the soldiers at Dunkirk with the use of their boat. What could have been a phenomenal movie falls short. On the one hand, it is a little boring, with not as much action as one might expect. In my opinion this is caused by the division of the story between three characters as you don't really develop a connection to any of them. Furthermore, there is very little dialogue in the movie, what typically doesn't increase the excitement level. We are humans and human interaction is typically what interests us most. Granted this is WWII and not a time for deep dialogues, but the lack of thereof decreases audience engagement. Finally, and this is the most confusing/annoying part, the scenes are presented as simultaneous events on the one hand, as they are intertwined and the pilot ends up on the father's boat, but the scenes do not take place at the same time. At one point the scenes jump around between broad daylight and the night, which is rather annoying since we don't really know what has taken place first. A final disappointment was the lack of proper presentation of the amount of soldiers stranded at Dunkirk, over 300,000. On the beach at one time we might see 1000 or 2000. So where have the rest gone? Obviously you're not gonna place actors in giant scenes, but make areal shots and add thousands of people stranded on the beach. That actually shows the reality of the situation. If we didn't know what really happened, we might think that the Brits are saving some 2000 of their men. And then there is the question of the civilian fleet, which was (maybe still is) the largest civilian fleet of vessels ever assembled. Unfortunately we do not see the amount of ships (which in reality was over 800). I feel like the movie is just slightly oversimplified. The story isn't could be more concise and a clear time frame like the time of the day or how many days had passed would have been helpful. Also, the evacuation of Dunkirk took a couple of days, with more soldiers being rescued every day. This could have been exemplified by the following of a second soldier's attempt at being rescued.
8.0~Dunkirk lacks the character development to be in the pantheon of great war films, Hawkensian Sign in Permalink There is an engrossing immediacy about Dunkirk, you are thrust into the action and the grip seldom loosens. It is pure action, pure cinema. The problem with this is that there is little plot and little characterisation, so the impressive spectacle does get slightly repetitive at times. This could have easily been a two-and-a-half hour picture, so there was certainly room for greater character development. It wouldn't be excessively negative to say that this was something of a missed opportunity.
10.0~amazing really recommend it gerardo-961-749549 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk was an amazing movie with directed by the one and only christopher Nolan and it was a masterpiece the movie was really short and had a lot of character development in the movie you will be amazed by the acting for this debut actors. The movie was brilliant but it missed something that is just a minor priority for the film. there where too many character and a los of different names we didn't even know for example there were a lot of character that were importante in their role and they never mention their name.
1.0~When "computer generated imagery" can teach you a lesson in history paolomarchiodi Sign in Permalink For sure, many and many viewers went to the cinema with great expectations for the movie Dunkirk. Most of them thinking it would be like the "New Saving Private Ryan". Unfortunately it is not so, and not in the sense that it is not an action packed block-buster. First of all, Dunkirk is not a bad movie, but it is not the movie it was expected to be and was so anticipated. The decision taken by the film director Christopher Nolan, not to use computer graphic, or to use it as less as possible, was in this case, in my opinion, the wrong choice. I speak as a history buff, so obviously, I had great expectation in seeing huge scenes and pictures, that only movies can give from past events, like bringing a history book or memories of veterans alive. Dunkirk isn't that, and that is, in my opinion its greatest flaw. It is important, for such a movie, to let you learn something, to get an impression, to perceive a past event, something maybe you have read about, but you never could really imagine. This is were Saving Private Ryan, speaking about WW2, (pardon me this comparison, it is the first that comes to mind, I could cite countless others Stalingrad, U-96 or for example Platoon for Vietnam War), really shines and where Dunkirk completely fails. Transmitting you an impression, a feeling for such true immense and tragic events. In Dunkirk, you have to imagine what is happening around the focus of the camera, you have to know the context, you don't get it served, transmitted. Before you go for this movie, to really appreciate it, you have to document yourself, or most of what Dunkirk was, a true gigantic episode in history, will simply don't emerge or even reach you. In my opinion a war movie, or maybe a movie with a historical background has to literally take you to its time, transport you in its century and let you leave the movie hall with a feeling of astonishment, curiosity and desire to learn more about what you just saw, maybe even kindle a passion in in the specific subject. With Dunkirk this is not the case, it is a good drama, but for sure it is not a history lesson and even less a historical movie. At the most, it will leave you some impressions, that you get from the different points of view from the protagonists, but all them without a real and remaining contextualization. Nothing that will make you think about it on your way back home, nothing that will stick in our memories and maybe would have helped to fill a gap in the common knowledge, of so many of us.
5.0~Brilliantly hyped up as usual for a Nolan flick except for the sheer of joy of SFX less cinematography chandanshivaramu Sign in Permalink Seeing this flick on a wide screen theater and the charisma of WW2 was supposed to be a thrilling ride for me. But, it turned out to be an ordinary affair. The positives: ultra realistic 35mm shot, devoid of any visible special effects, shot from 3 different perspectives was indeed a brilliant piece of cinematography. The negatives: Too many. Firstly, there is none of the breathtaking thrills of Saving Private Ryan to which it is constantly compared to at the moment. Secondly, the story is wafer thin, it could have easily been made as a short 20 minute documentary with all its intended effects. Thirdly, the narration is skewed, land/air/sea scenes are deliberately shown 3 times making it a monotonous and irritating viewing at times. Fourth point: The set pieces look ordinary as i just cant compare it to the gigantic mass evacuation of 200000+ British soldiers to UK with just 100's shown on the screen. The arrangement is a drab affair for a epic scale as this. Fifth point: Most of the cast look washed, non-charismatic, very less screen time, sans basic emotion and simply ordinary. Noteworthy exceptions are obviously Harry Styles and the masterful Mark Rylance. Ken Bran looks comical with his pencil grin. Overall, this is a decent WW2 movie muddled with repetitive scenes with no depth in characters made by a visionary director with a speck of vision bundled in to a boring plot (pun intended as it could have made with a brilliant opening scene and a climax to match it). Finally, to my utmost relief, this movie need not be watched many times to understand its simple simplicity as is the case for Nolan's earlier multi-layered flicks.
1.0~don't waste your money babs-40556 Sign in Permalink I was so glad I saw this on HBO and didn't pay for it in a theater. If I hadn't known the story of Dunkirk I would have a lot of trouble figuring this film out. Unbelieve small boat scene. Unbelievable air craft scenes. I can't figure out what the critics love------maybe they have stock in the company. See "The Darkest Hour" a very good film
10.0~Dunkirk is an authentic, practical piece of art that is visually stunning and technically perfect newmailbrendan Sign in Permalink DESCRIPTION: "The enemy have driven the British and French armies to the sea. Trapped at Dunkirk, they await their fate. Hoping for deliverance. For a miracle." REVIEW: The film unfolds both beautifully brilliant and intensively subjective. Known from Nolan's non-linear story lines, this approach is technically mastered by his vision of the story. The plot is stranded and told with 3 perspectives in 3 different time-frames. This element of storytelling device causes for a comprehensive, full-scale picture of the event. The filmmaker is in that way able to tell the whole evacuation in just under 2 hours runtime (his shortest film since Following (1998)). It is neat and compact. Not overdone and rely on zero exposition; I think he heard the fair share of criticism here. So, introducing first: The soldiers waiting on the beach by the Mole, which lasts a whole week. While the horrors upon the sea wave a time of one day. The battles in the air and Farrier's plane engine run and roll for one hour. As the story progressed, the sequences synchronize while the story lines intertwine. All that backed up by a blistering and blasting score delivered, once again, by Hans Zimmer. Fun fact: Zimmer used Nolan's own pocket watch as the ticking time sound heard in the background. It's crazy how the sound intensifies the ticking while the action- driven plot thickens. One more quite notable technical aspect, there is little to no dialogue. The director studied silent-films while prepping for the project. This, of course, means that there is a lack of character development and story insight. Though this may cause some dividedness from viewer to viewer, as getting used to this rarely seen structure. However, one should know that it doesn't matter. It's an experience where you're part of. You're invested in this whole splendid act. From start to finish, the whole movie is actually one giant action sequence and an epic thrill-ride. And so it begins: The opening of Dunkirk, where soldiers are wandering and walking around a deserted street, papers (that read: "We Surround You") sailing through the wind, landing on soldier's helmets. When suddenly enemy fire emerges and one young soldier survived the shootout, only to find himself on the beach with (realistically supposed to be) 400.000 other soldiers looking scared into the sky seeing German planes approaching and ultimately unloading aerial bombs on the beachscape. (I still feel sorry for him not having had the chance to properly take a sh*t, but I bet he probably sh*t himself considering the circumstances he would find himself later in.) Later down the line we find ourselves in the utterly thrilling target practice sequence where soldiers are trapped in a boat, hoping to float into the water, only to find themselves hostage by unexpected flying bullets hitting the under deck. There occurs a leak and one soldier dies immediately just after a single, innocent peek. Meanwhile, a friendly pilot was shot down out of the sky and now finds himself in a similar situation. He is trapped in his own cockpit, hostage from the heavily flowing water that's filling up inside, only minutes away from drowning, he tries to break out. It's all about building up suspense here (Hitchcock's way of filmmaking). And, perhaps the most memorable moment in the movie, Tom Hardy saving the lives of thousands of soldiers on the beach. With his plane run out of fuel, he sails through the wind and floats in the air, opening his small cockpit window to hear and receive a roar of applauds by the people on land. In another scene, the rest of the surviving soldiers are hopping on a train at night, and later waking-up to a "new-world". Channeling back, Ferrier's plane is slowly descending, comfortably landing onto the watery beachscape. Knowing that he's gonna get captured by the German and held as a prisoner of war, he first burns down his plane, in case the enemy benefits from the technology that would only be added to their already advanced arsenal. The flickering burning flames fill up the frame as soldiers are approaching in the distance. A silent hero is being sacrificed, but "we shall never surrender". And just before cutting to black, there is a completely silent shot of that young soldier sitting in a train, wondrously- looking up. The cinema was completely silent. You could only hear that mundane sound of a newspaper. Indicating that life simply goes on. VERDICT: Christopher Nolan has crafted another brilliant movie. Once again, he showcases his direction and writing skills powerfully as well as artfully. Zimmer's soundtrack is bombastisc. It fits perfectly into the film. The cinematography is beautifully done by Dutch cameraman Hoyte Van Hoytema (DoP, Interstellar) The acting performances also feel pure and real. (Nolan intentionally casted young and inexperienced actors, some roughly just 18 years old. This was done in order to increase a stronger sense of reality). Personally, I love that the movie doesn't linger on cliché war-porn, forms of perfectly scripted dialogue. It neither suffers from being cheesy or unoriginal. Instead, this is in fact probably the most innovative movie you'll ever seen. It is purely practical and wholly experimental. The director really emptied his tank with this unique take on the war genre. An achievement in modern-day cinema that is an authentic and traditional piece of art. Dunkirk can arguably be considered as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Definitely in recent memory. Time will tell how well it holds up against films such as Saving Private Ryan. But to say the least, Dunkirk is a magnificent triumph. There's nothing quite like it. It doesn't try to be something else. It is masterfully grounded in it's own perfect picture that it's painting and portraying. This is as close and real as war films get. Realistically, flawlessly executed. That's why it works time and time again. 10/10
1.0~Dumb-kirk! jetbatt94 Sign in Permalink I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was greatly dissatisfied. I've read history accounts and watched documentaries on the evacuations at Dunkirk, but this movie in no way represented what I imagined. I was not sure what was going on most of the time, nor who the central characters were. The individual stories kept cross-crossing And intersecting in some weird time warp scenario. It took me a while to realize I had already seen the same scene but from another character's perspective. Groundhog Day-Ja vu. At the end, I just didn't care anymore. Spoiler Alert- No Germans!
5.0~A disappointing miss. vark365 Sign in Permalink I was so looking forward to this movie but was soooo disappointed. The biggest? The surrealistic sense to it compounded by the constant droning of the monotonous "music". The overall feeling was just out of place. That plus the cheesy special effects ie, the rubbery flapping wings as aircraft hit the water, ground view of a spitfire that ran out of gas gliding along at mach 3 or the "armada" of small boats numbering maybe 30. I could go on and on. Then there was the total lack of character development. No doubt a lot of effort went into the making of this film. All a wasted effort. 5 stars is generous.
3.0~Shallow, Docile and Inexplicably Resolved War Film Wellenstock Sign in Permalink Not sure this film deserves 8 stars. I'm not sure I've seen a more docile war film. The actors seemed empty and without much to say despite what they are supposedly experiencing. The scene with men in a sinking boat considering throwing someone out to reduce the weight is nonsense. The boat is metal with a dozen geysering holes, they're waste deep in water. The film was resolved very quickly with no clear explanation.
1.0~Let me save you some cash and time jeffcaldwell-1 Sign in Permalink This is absolutely the most boring movie I have sat through. Little dialogue, characters you couldn't care less for, most of the dialogue is mumbling, the score is annoying, the time-line is confusing to say the least. There were 350,000 men on that beach, in the movie there are a couple hundred at most. Full of cliché lines that make you cringe. No enemy, no stakes, no obstacles for the protagonist whoever it was.
9.0~Strives successfully for grimly realistic portrayal of war, but still leaves "the Dunkirk Spirit" strengthened jrarichards Sign in Permalink We watched Christopher Nolan's "Dunkirk" as maybe the only Brits in a cinema in a country for which consequences and memories of "the War" are different. For them this was another WW2 depiction, for us an examination, not just of the reality of war, but also of a British legend, and Britishness itself. There were fewer tears in surrounding eyes than in mine. For "Dunkirk" is indeed a moving experience, but also - rightly - a powerful, shocking one - so much so that I felt moist eyes might give way to a full-scale blub even 10 minutes on from the credits. Few films achieve such a two-level emotional impact. "Dunkirk" is epic in spite of itself, but this is no "The Longest Day". But then the latter was portraying an advance towards victory, while Dunkirk was - as Churchill noted - a severe defeat - and equipment-less retreat - that made any subsequent victory look far less plausible. In the film, we are reminded of the toughly correct decision to hold back some ships and planes ... in anticipation of the next blow. Yet - again unavoidably - Nolan's presentation captures the spontaneous (and hyper-British) emergence of feelings of pride and joy and relief at being reunited, in some sense "safe" with "our boys" on our beautiful and (comparatively) tranquil island once again. The end segments of the film are done perfectly - all is understated, entirely unjingoistic, deeply affecting as a visceral solidarity suffuses us, even as the returnees themselves feel unsure of themselves. The main body of "Dunkirk" resembles that ending in being "of few words", as Nolan intended, but also differs. Patriotism is pared down, nuanced, mostly down to vaguely "running commentary"-like remarks from Sir Mark Rylance in his role as a captain of one of those little ships, "Mr Dawson" - as based on a figure whose taped voice lives on at the Imperial War Museum. While a 1930s boat is filmed, it WAS NOT a Dunkirk participant, though other shown vessels WERE. Dawson's voyage crystallises the "sea" component of a "land, sea and air" configuration that Nolan deploys, to hint at what the British Army was doing on land, the RAF in the air, and the Royal Navy plus other craft (800 in all, with up to 60 apparently portrayed in the film) on those 25-odd miles of sea separating a Bosch-like vision of hell from "home". We are warned at the outset that these stories run to different time-frames, but enigmatic information given so soon will probably go unabsorbed by most. In fact, the RAF chunk actually (faithfully) reflects a 1-hour mission, while Dawson is taking a day to cross the Channel, and the lads are at Dunkirk for a week... This "separation by elements" at least might seem clear-cut, but is not, as the different media and forces keep interacting, with this just adding to the sense of fluidity ... and chaos. Nowhere is really safe; water might seem better than an exposed beach, but is cold, can even burn and can fill a cosy dry place in seconds; bullets enter boats stuck on land; ships and soldiers fire at planes; planes strafe ships and soldiers; planes come down on sea or land; soldiers walk into water, come back out and then wade in again... Given the nearly-340,000 rescued in real life, as set against the few thousands that died, Nolan's film might seems a bit death-obsessed; but what we see - perhaps more than in any other war film - is how random choices, attempts to "beat the system", just being in the wrong place, can mean death, while others live on in chance fashion. As the above sentence hints, plenty of less-than-noble behaviour is shown. There's some Army-Navy solidarity, but we also watch ratings abandon ship while soldiers are stuck below. There is also Army-Airforce resentment ("Where were you?", asks a young soldier - well the RAF had indeed been there (flying 2739 fighter sorties over 9 days), and the film makes their risks and sacrifices clear - with real planes used in the film-making; and history tells that 106 of those precious assets were lost (to 262 enemy aircraft)). There is even tension between soldiers of different units, as well as an incident in which a panicked soldier (accidentally) kills a civilian, etc. A counterbalance here is Sir Kenneth Branagh's mostly cool and gritty "Commander Bolton" character, alluding to real-life hero James Clouston - a Canadian-born RN Officer and "Pier-Master", who indeed spent days on "the Mole". Hopefully, the Branagh portrayal also pays homage to Clouston's boss, Capt. Tennant, who patrolled the beach with his megaphone for days (and perhaps even to the great Admiral Ramsay, in overall charge of the Naval operation then, as also at D Day). Notwithstanding "the Little Ships", Dunkirk was a Royal Navy show, God bless it... Indeed, one is overall swept up by a growing wonder at Operation Dynamo, in spite of the many smaller-scale ugly incidents depicted. The desperation, lack of thought, inability to see the big picture and sheer fear that overcome young and often inexperienced military personnel at the given moment are made clear, and we in our comfortable cinema seats must be ready to forgive. Cleverly, the Rylance character (for noble enough reasons) also consciously overlooks misconduct he's seen, in order to start building the Dunkirk legend. And, even if we do know how selfishly and crudely certain individuals behaved at given moments, doesn't that merely offer enrichment in terms of truth and reality? Hence Nolan's great achievement with "Dunkirk" would seem to be to offer realism of setting and equipment and behaviour in his vignettes, to shock and move us more than ever before with the manmade debacle that was Dunkirk; and yet to leave us more convinced than ever as to the manmade miracle.
9.0~Not a Nolan fan but this was monumental PrashunChakraborty Sign in Permalink I was quite uncertain about Dunkirk, I strongly disliked Nolan's last two films and the one before that felt a bit too inspired from Satoshi Kon's Paprika to really have an identity of it's own like his Insomnia, again not an original work. Nolan has been a director who has been out of form for nearly ten years in my opinion however with this one, Nolan has again become one of the directors to look out for. This is indeed worth the hype, the best war film in years. A technical masterpiece worthy of the IMAX experience. What really surprised me about the film is that dialogues are kept to a minimum and Nolan is always a dialogue heavy director, first 15-20 minutes or so just have a handful of lines, it's all about the environment and the atmosphere, which was very refreshing, I have always criticized his films for having more to say and less to show but he makes amends here. Nolan does add his own signature to the film by mixing the timelines of multiple story characters but it's done to a minimum so that isn't gimmicky and doesn't overstay it's welcome. However it's more of a technically flawless masterpiece of a war film (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down etc.) rather than an emotional or character driven one (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line) which is fine, I wouldn't necessarily rate the latter group higher than the former, I do like the latter more but each group has it's appeal and I enjoy both. In the acting department everyone gets the job done but I wouldn't single out anyone as giving a standout performance, Mark Rylance almost gets there though, he is the audience's character, the heart of the film, the common man. This is as much as Hans Zimmer's film like it's Christopher Nolan's, so much so I wish there was lesser usage of background music in it which is almost present in every scene, background music doesn't necessarily enhance the atmosphere of gun shots, shells and bomber planes flying, was sometimes being a distraction and breaking the immersion. All in all these are minor nitpicks of an otherwise an excellent film. Nolan's finally back on track after nearly ten years and this is his best in my opinion replacing his previous best Memento.
4.0~Disappointing agmoldham Sign in Permalink Finally got to see Dunkirk last night. Having seen the reviews and IMDb score was expecting to see one of the movies of the year. Have to say that I found it hugely disappointing. There is absolutely no doubt that this is a very good film from a technical viewpoint. The cinematography and action cannot be faulted. However, I go to movies to be excited by the journey of the characters. There was very little put into the characterisation of the cast. There is no doubt that actors such as MArk Rylance are excellent, but their talent was totally ignored in this production. If you want to see a movie which knocks you out with the realistic feel of war then this is for you. If you want to see a movie that is full of interesting characters and story then definitely tune into something else.
4.0~Dunkirk another hyped movie "Spoilers" and "Review" joe-riquinha Sign in Permalink This film had too much hype before playing in the theaters for what I seen, if you had to compare war films from the past for example; Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers film series, even The film "fury", blows "Dunkirk" out of the water literally and figuratively. How can you have 400,000 soldiers on the beach, and not have them do nothing but dodge incoming bombs, and then just stand there and do nothing while staring up in the sky for the next bomb to drop, plus the film had no film shots of the enemy "Germany" but of a couple of scenes of the enemy air planes being shot down, also in the film were a submarine "U-70" from the enemy torpedoing rescue ship escaping Dunkirk, the submarine was never seen in the in the film but you do see a silhouetting torpedo under water from an aerial view heading towards England naval rescue ships. too many mistakes were made by the director and production here . No war scenes really? 400,000 troops on the beach and no action and where were the french army? 2 stars at best
2.0~Absolute garbage movie, no soul. adamcomito Sign in Permalink I put off watching this movie for a while because of the bad reviews but finally was in the right mood to sit through it. It's just isn't good at all. The story is all over the place and by the end you really don't care one way or the other for it. Now Brad Pitts movie 'fury' wasn't great but at least it had decent action. This has nothing. Lame air battle scenes, lame ocean battle scenes, lame gun battles. Literally the first scene when the young soldier throws his rifle away because it's jammed makes me think 'is this going to be dumb? ' Pearl Harbour was better than this and that's saying something. Save your time and go play 'Call of duty - WWII', much more realistic and entertaining than this.
10.0~Dunkirk (one of Nolan's best) joelfooramos Sign in Permalink Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan starring Tom Hardy, amongst other stars tell the real event during World War II and how 400,000 soldiers were able to escape. After watching this movie I can easily say this is one of the best of the year, hands down. From the opening sequence to the final sequence, the movie doesn't stop at giving you a single breath of air. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and beautiful. Every shot in this movie feels completely on-point, not a single take was misplaced. In my opinion, this is Nolan's best directed film to date. To my understanding there was no use of CGI, every battle sequence was practical effect. The air sequence where Tom Hardy's character is in is absolutely breath-taking. The film doesn't have much dialogue, it rests on the amazing score by Hans Zimmer and boy, what a score he pulled off. This is a film that is about the event rather than the characters and that's where the movie for some might not work. In previous war films such as Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge, you get to know the characters or get behind them-rooting for them. In Dunkirk, you don't get that. You don't get that one scene where you get to dig in inside a character and root for them. As I said, this film is about the event of Dunkirk. So, if you go into this film expecting great characters you're gonna leave disappointed. But if you don't go with those expectations then Dunkirk is a perfect film. For my final grade, I'm gonna give Dunkirk 10/10
10.0~Dunkirk Nahtoreya Sign in Permalink This movie is great! For someone who is currently serving in the Military, i love the idea of military like movies and this movie sets a scene for anyone who wondered what its like going to war or battle. This movie is one of my favorites to watch. I've seen it 5 times so far and it just gets better every time. I suggest you go and watch this movie if you haven't done so and your into the whole " military theme / war type " movie genre.
3.0~Masterpiece? NO! Historical? NO! Intense?NO srdjannalis-51135 Sign in Permalink Best war movie ever made, not by far. The only good thing about this movie is a few great cinematic camera shots and that is it. Lets see where to start (spoliers coming): 1. Apparently German Army participated in the battle of Dunkirk; with 2 Henschel Hs 129 bombers, 3 dive bombers Junkers Ju 87 (Stuka's) and 3 Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters, which were all apparently shot down by 3 RAF Spitfires. As that is the only German troops you will see the whole movie! Myabe they were not there? Batman got them on time? 2. You have two genius actors Sir Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy, but you write a scenario where both of them have 10 lines in the whole movie? I don't believe that Tom had more then 2 lines that lasted for 1 min. Now people will say, you don"t understand the story it self is a main character! That is all fine, but then I can watch Denkirk documentary, it is more intense then this! 3. Harry Styles should stick to music, as his acting is very One Direction. I mean everything is so predictable, you just look at him and know its a movie? There is no suspense in his acting, there is no character build up what so ever, etc. I could go on and on, many more things are bad about this movie, but I would be in danger to write more words than what are in screenplay of Dunkirk! Wait to come on Netflix, DVD or something, don't waist your money in cinema. PS I gave it a 3, it will probably end up around 7 when all hype dies, but I expected a historical intense masterpiece, and got nothing!!!
4.0~A Mess jb07-660-944395 Sign in Permalink Once again the curse of Written and Directed by the same person strikes again! From the very start, we watch well trained (from my own knowledge of history - this movie provides no background), British troops run down the middle of the road when fired on. Even untrained troops must have the instinct to seek the nearest cover of a door or alleyway? The bland music is annoying, and was probably done to save time and money on background sound effects which would have added so much more to the drama. After bombs are dropped onto the crowded beach, soldiers die, but you hear no wounded crying out for help. The British Spitfires, while recreated extremely accurately, appear to have limitless ammunition. The time shifting is totally confusing. One moment we are watching a scene in bright daylight, the next it is night, then back to day again. What confused me most was when one pilot watched his wingman ditch, then he proceeded to shoot down a German bomber, after watching it in his rear view mirror for a while? Why would he do this? Why wouldn't he just turn and shoot it down? A little later we go back in time to be with the pilot ditching. He then struggles to get out of his plane, but is eventually rescued. A little later, he watches his wingman shoot down the bomber! Are you kidding me? Unless his mate had been circling above, and given the time frame from the previous scene, the bomber should have been shot down whilst he was still trying to get out of his downed plane, and it would have happened miles away from where he was rescued. Rather than provide a sense of the magnitude of Dunkirk, the film would have you believe, until one of the last scenes, that only a few large and small ships and boats took part. It doesn't show the lines of men in the water up to their shoulders waiting to be picked up. It doesn't even give you a sense of the time frame of several days. Indeed, the ships shown look too modern to be early Second World War destroyers. For those reviewers calling this the best war movie ever, I'm guessing this is the first you have watched. Now go see Band of Brothers, to see how a real war movie/TV series is done. Then see if you can find the original movie Dunkirk, starring John Mills, because although rather slow in places, this movie is still so much better than this new attempt.
5.0~Swing and a miss! sijoe22 Sign in Permalink OK, but could have been sooooooooo much better, considering the historical material they had to work with. For those who don't know what movie is about, it's based on the true story of the evacuation of Dunkirk in France during World War II. That is, 400,000 British & French soldiers were TRAPPED, with no hope of escape possible, as the German army them surrounded. How important is this? Virtually ALL serious military historians agree that if the Nazis took proper advantage of the situation, World War II would have ENDED, right then and there, and Hitler would have taken over Europe, Asia, Africa, and who knows what else. Anyway, movie BORED me, and I'm a serious history buff. Movie focused on six or seven guys, under fire, yeah, private boats helped to evacuate them to England, but didn't come CLOSE to getting the message across that THIS was the greatest evacuation in world history. Too bad. Oh, and could have used subtitles- those British accents are indecipherable. As movie ended, and before final credits began to roll, audience should have been told, on screen, that "This was the greatest evacuation in military history, thanks to the hundreds (if not thousands) of British citizens who used their own boats, at their OWN peril,to rescue their own countrymen, and so on..... Maybe have a few interviews of some of the survivors still living would have been a nice touch as well. When typical moviegoer leaves theater, he may have no idea of the importance of the Dunkirk evacuation, and what it meant to world history. Wonderful topic, movie done poorly.
9.0~Another Great War Movie thetanner-14324 Sign in Permalink Short and sweet, was this move outstanding? In my opinion, no. Was it good? Absolutely. Do I recommend seeing it in the theater? Yes. There is plenty of action that feels and sounds better at the movie theater. Now, The movie was not outstanding, and not Nolan's best work (hard to top The Dark Knight). However, It definitely was a very interesting and well-done film. The action scenes are definitely there, and I always felt like I was on the edge of my seat. There is a constant track playing in the background of nearly the entire movie that gets your heart rate up a little bit, and just adds to the already thrilling adventure. There's not really a "story" like there is in other war movies (i.e. Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, etc...) There is a plot, which is mainly rescuing the British soldiers from Dunkirk, but it doesn't feel like a cohesive story. However, it works... somehow... The two characters who were most prominent in the movie rarely spoke, but that doesn't feel like a negative. I think it was actually a brilliant move, sort of to show how intense war was. They seemed so shook up all the time, like they weren't even able to talk at all. All in all, between the wonderful musical composition, and Nolan's superior directing and writing skills, this was a good movie. I don't think you need to rush to the movie theater to see it as soon as possible, but I would recommend seeing it at some point. 7/10 *This is my first review, hopefully I did okay for writing it at 1 in the morning! I look forward to writing many more in the future!*
4.0~An emperor without clothes, a film hugely overrated rblenheim Sign in Permalink Of all the films in 2017, the biggest disappointment to me was Christopher Nolan's over-packaged and over-publicized "Dunkirk", a film with aspirations of grandeur that ended up delivering a narrative mishmash that completely lacked emotional involvement. My guess is that the film, displaying choppy editing and confusing transitions, might have been the compromised result of its filmmakers changing their minds while frantically trying to mold it into something cohesive. Watching it, at times I didn't even know where I was supposed to be, and at one point I turned to a friend who had accompanied me and asked, "why is it night here?" without realizing until later we had been seemingly in the hold of a ship. Moreover, it seemed an attempt was made to cover the narrative weakness by having actor Kenneth Branaugh stand around and deliver hackneyed lines (written by director Nolan himself) to take the place of dramatic action, scenes that seemed phoned in from another movie. But a more surprising weakness was the failure of the flying scenes to work up much excitement. Why its aviation scenes were so timidly done and so lacking in intensity, even in 70mm, astounds me still. Finally, when the end credits came up on "Dunkirk", due to its need for more 'fleshing out' and clarity of focus, I felt I had experienced merely the outline of a movie instead of a completed one. And a war film that seemed to fail at the very simple things that even average war films used to achieve with ease.
10.0~One of the great masterpieces in its genre..Chris certainly in his prime Remembering_BeautifulDreams Sign in Permalink This movie is an experience in itself. Nolan puts the viewer into the battlefield at Dunkirk during WWII.We experience the same dread , urgency and tension as the solders of the 3 allied nations felt whilst being surrounded by German troupes, facing attack from air, land and sea. As a Nolan fan i've come to love his unique way of storytelling and the cerebral mind-games he plays with his viewers. This movie(except maybe insomnia) follows a rather straightforward story line, thought he does play with perspectives that intertwine and overlap in time(his trademark non linear storytelling) amplifying the intensity with each passing minute. Hats of to Chris. He no longer has the luxury of making a "good" movie, only excellence will satisfy us. Also hats off the Hoyte van Hoytema for a spectacular cinematography and Hans Zimmer for his compelling sound design. Peace.
7.0~Horrific event without horror DVR_Brale Sign in Permalink First and foremost, Dunkirk is PG-13 movie. There's almost no blood, sweat and real war horrors in it. What we're basically seeing is a sort of a documentary. Dunkirk's primary goal is making you aware of in how difficult situation British and French soldiers were. That means that there's little dialogue in the movie. No personal story is embedded in it. But what is really strange is that there is not so much action neither. Action is distributed throughout the movie and always comes as a climax to previous developments. That's why you can hear silent but noticeable "tika-taka" sound throughout almost the entire movie. Secondly, Dunkirk is a very tense and loud experience. Story itself never rushes but steadily grows until it bursts. I believe emphasizing that effect is the reason why Nolan decided to tell the story in a non-linear fashion from three different perspectives; that way he can constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. If that weren't so, Dunkirk would frankly be a boring movie. All in all, if you're tired of violence, superficiality and too much talking but love tense story-line, Dunkrik is spot on. As for the war movie veterans: you may find it a bit unconvincing. It's still worth giving it a shot.
5.0~Something missing? hpilling-52010 Sign in Permalink You have to love this or hate it, I can see why it divides opinions. Leans a little heavy on the art house flick for me but a good friend loves it. If you are fan of minimal dialogue and even greater minimal cast then you possibly will enjoy it No CGI is fine but what it lacks is the overwhelming sense of numbers on the beaches Don't get me wrong it's not a bad film and taken as a stand alone project is watchable It just won't have greater appeal to all, try it and tell me if I'm wrong or right
10.0~As complete as a movie can be livnstrong Sign in Permalink Riveting, moving, revealing, and inspiring. This is as close to a masterpiece as it gets. Even aspects such as the sound and editing are exceptional. Nolan, the crew and cast really do the history and memory of Dunkirk justice. You can tell that this was a labor of love and respect for Nolan. But he gets strong support from everyone who made this movie.
1.0~Disjointed Mess! Shocking continuity issues make it an unbelievable yawn fest. breakingvideoonline Sign in Permalink *** This review may contain spoilers *** So, it looked promising and so lets start with the PROS; The intro sequence all 6 minutes (including the first dive bombing) should have continued for the whole movie - EPIC! That's it for pro's, really the rest will just make you depressed. CONS; A poorly cobbled together film without a story and achingly under- utilized actors. The awfully executed chronology lacked any reference or worthy explanation, exposing the glaring continuity issues and unbelievable plot mechanics. Sure tell a few different stories, but please at least maintain continuity WITHIN each story, it's as though the decision was made to have all these points of view early on - yet when it came time to film they did it over 2 days. A few extras lined up on a beach and some borrowed planes. F*$*. we are approaching the 2020's dammit - use some bloody good CGI as you clearly can afford it. The movie fails to portray even a 1/1000th of the actual evacuation - there were +- 330 000 troops leaving and over 60 000 killed ( thanks Wikipedia) yet ... Nolan fails to deliver any inkling of that sort of magnitude. The Brits left behind 63,879 vehicles including tanks and motorcycles + 2,472 field guns .... holy s*$(. but do we see a single tank or gun ... maybe 5 trucks and tug boat --- woo ooh ... also the ending is Horses excrement, climaxing with some stupid spitfire pilot who is SO worried about fuel, yet manages to fly around and engage bombers for the WHOLE FILM right up to, and after its engine stops ... SURE ... then it unbelievably swoops around with no engine (they obviously just cut the sound to make it look like the engine had stopped) and then swoops past TWICE along the beach and it is assumed by the plot that it engages and SHOOTS DOWN an approaching Stukka dive bomber -NO! NO! I CALL BULLSH$T MR NOLAN! So major bullsh%t climax moment out of the way, onto the meat and bones of this cut and pasted high school conceived garbage pile. Day, morning, evening, rough seas, very calm seas - NEVER bloody mind - just SHOOT the scene dammit! The "DAY" progresses achingly slowly and even although we see two sunrises / sunsets / a storm and everything in between we are meant to believe it all happens during these story points, what LAZY film making .... I do not believe. I never much cared for this Mr Nolan chap - and now after wasting my few dollar I feel confused for the future of film making and even more disappointed than ever for the general intelligence of the world. Are audiences/critics really that shallow / attention deficit that they cannot come up with an honest review so that others may find out before wasting time and effort? pathetic for a $150 Million budget. If i could SAVE 50k p/a i'd have to work for 20 YEARS just to make 1/150th of the budget... and yet THIS is the result. These people are living in a ridiculous reality paid for by you and I>
6.0~Good subject idea, really mediocre result gofastergetrounder Sign in Permalink It is worth a look. The subject had all sorts of potential. The production and photography is generally well done. Unfortunately, it just really doesn't work. It apparently attempted to isolate on a couple individual story lines, but the characters are for the most part very poorly developed. Mark Rylance/Mr. Dawson/Father/Boat Captain was pretty much the only character that was developed enough to hold any interest. Tip for Producers/Directors: If you get Kenneth Branagh for your movie, use him one hell of a lot more and better than they did in "Dunkirk." No one else was developed enough to be of any real interest. Furthermore, I didn't think the movie did a very good job of showing either how desperate the situation was for the soldiers stranded there or the magnitude and difficulty of the evacuation. Near the end, it is like a "oh yeah, here comes the Cavalry" with some rote shots of some smaller vessels coming to evacuate. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was distinctly dissatisfied with this movie. Not a horrible movie, but definitely one I found disappointing.
6.0~Hipsterish affectation of an "artistic" war movie. mraos Sign in Permalink This movie is so paper thin I really can't write much about it. So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British "Thin Red Line" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed "master of the craft". But anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you'd be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It's ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there... If Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism. And this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we've seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it's just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive "experiences" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It's almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it's a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that's it. And even those become repetitive after a while.
4.0~The struggle to write a positive review is real. petricor Sign in Permalink It's hard to rate and review a movie like Dunkirk. To start off, I knew what I was going into, and yes, the film lacks character development, plot, and dialogue. I know this. I understand Nolan's reasons behind this. After all, I've seen every one of his movies and most at least once and I admire their direction greatly. So I get Dunkirk is supposed to be an intense survival action movie. You don't really need any of those aforementioned elements in a film but you better hope you have done enough of a good job on the other elements holding a film together. So instead of reviewing what we don't really have because that would be unfair, I'm going to review the things we're still given. Also divided into a triptych, because I, too, can be clever. "1. The Cinematography: 1 hr 46 min 2. The Sound: 1 hr 46 min 3. The Theme: Last hr (as you are struggling to pay attention)" The Cinematography : Lacking. The camera darted from frame to frame and scene to scene like it was the one shell-shocked. It's not that it was like one of those action movies with shaky camera where you have no idea who is fighting who and what is going on. It wasn't that bad. What I mean is it lacked gravitas. It stayed on each scene long enough for us to understand what was going on but it all seemed devoid of momentum which was strange given it was a survival film. For example, there are air scenes which are just long enough to see the sky and sea tilt on their sides, with gorgeous shades of blue, and then boop - cut to new scene. There is no gravitas because there's no time for it to happen. All the beauty of those particular scenes and other scenes gone and wasted because nevermind -- they needed to fit more disjointed scenes and give us a feel of "air, sea, land." Okay, fair enough, but let me enough the nice cinematography instead of butchering it up. The Sound : Hans Zimmer is amazing, he basically made Interstellar the bombastic epic sci-fi it was, but the sound in Dunkirk just didn't do it for me. No melody. No distinctness. Boring. I'm not stupid regarding what they tried to achieve here - put a ticking clock in the backdrop and instantly amp up the suspense. It's kind of clichéd and feels cheap. Other people probably think it's a clever use. To me, it's more like film making 101. Boring and kind of insulting. The only thing it did for me was prevent me from going to sleep so at least it served some sort of purpose. The Theme : I've seen a lot of reviews give Dunkirk flack for lack of character development and a lack of emotions however there are emotions to be experienced in this movie, but I'm not sure if they're anything but grim. The irony of Brexit negotiations going on right now and the rare episodes of emotion in the movie have not been lost on me. Suffice it to say, Dunkirk shows the dark side of human survival. At the end, I didn't really feel like the enemy of the film were the Nazis. The true enemy was people turning on one another. I don't want to give away any spoilers so this is perhaps too cryptic. In a struggle for survival, how do we not lose our humanity? And what if we do? Those are the big questions Dunkirk asks. In conclusion, while I seemed to have gotten a lot of the intellectual decisions behind the production of Dunkirk, I still cannot applaud its execution. It fell flat. The only semblance of movie magic I am accustomed to from Nolan I got at the end with one of the British RAF airplanes. A rare moment of all three cinematography, sound, and theme combining into something poignant, moving, poetic. But just like that.. it was gone. Marred by the next scene which defied all semblance of events and time and ruined my moment of movie magic. I am absolutely flabbergasted by Christopher Nolan. I am not sure why everyone's saying this is his best film to date. It pales in comparison to his other movies. It pales in comparison to other war films. Is it because it's the most accessible genre of the movies he has done? The least cerebral? Cue all the typical Oscar nominations and fanfare but Dunkirk can't and won't fool me. Nolan, here's hoping your next movie is not a big gigantic mess like Dunkirk is. 4/10, 1 for each element above and another for that one particular RAF airplane
10.0~2 thumbs up! FrenchEddieFelson Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan succeeds in the challenge of describing a non-winning subject (a stinging military defeat) and highlighting the spirit of solidarity and hope. An uninterrupted and deliberately oppressive music, a high-quality photography, talented actors, ... two thumbs up!!!! As a sweet euphemism, I'm not a fan of war movies, but Christopher Nolan signs a masterpiece of the seventh art.
4.0~An assault on my ears wigglytoes Sign in Permalink I went to see Dunkirk at the very end of it's movie theater run. Therefore I've heard how great it is, and was expecting to be impressed. Maybe I was expecting too much but I was underwhelmed. Now a day later I have found out that 'the Mole' is a dock for loading ships. Where the screen showed 'The mole, one week', 'The Sea, one Day', and 'The air, One Hour' it meant that there was going to be three different story lines occurring over one week, one day, and one hour, simultaneously. I didn't realize, while watching the film, that that was how the film was setup. (I was trying to figure out what a Mole was. It would have really helped if they said "The Dock - during one week", etc. Plus the movie continuously cuts back and forth between these story lines. So you move forward in time, then back, then forward. Throw that all together and you can see why the movie is very confusing to some. I'm very familiar with the story of Dunkirk so the jumping around from time line to time line didn't throw me off that much. Except for when it was obviously night time in one story, and daytime in another. If I only had known that there were three movies going on at once. It would have made a lot more sense. My biggest problem with the movie was the sound track. Perhaps this only occurred in my theater (I doubt that), but it was oppressively loud. Not just the bang bang of guns firing, that's expected in movies these days, but here there is constant background droning. Not airplane noise - just really loud single note background noise. I took a tissue and stuffed it into my ears within 10 minutes of the start of the film, and I never felt that I could take the plugs out. The next biggest problem is the lack of a coherent story. I went with a friend who didn't know the Dunkirk story, and she had no idea what was going on. Over 300,000 soldiers were evacuated! You never would have known that through this movie. A third of the soldiers evacuated were French! You will have the opposite idea after the movie. Hundreds of small boats helped in the evacuation! The film shows about 12. The real WWII soldiers were well disciplined, and while there is always chaos in war, there was a chain of command in control! In this film there seems to be 3 people of high rank and everyone else is a private and on their own. There are some good points to the movie. Not enough to justify the current price of admission, but it wasn't a total waste.
9.0~Christopher Nolan has done it again! benruiz-78852 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has had a marvelous run as a director, especially in the last 10 years. He has been able to adapt his grandiose style into a variety of genres such as the superhero genre (The Dark Knight Trilogy), sci-fi (Interstellar), and "thiller" (Inception). With his latest movie he has decided to adapt the infamous "disaster of Dunkirk" to the big screen and here, we have another fantastic film to add to his already impressive filmography. Nolan manages to make an emotionally grueling war movie that frankly does not feature any of the genre clichés one might expect. It is solely about the event which means Nolan refrains from ever giving the viewer a moment to breath. Without giving too much away the structure of the storytelling the movie provides is probably its strongest element, that will keep you buried in the films grasp. As well as Hans Zimmer subtle yet effective score which, just like the movie, almost never lets up. The technical aspect of the movie is perfection, everything from the sound design, the cinematography, etc. Nolan once again brings us a technically beautiful film. One small thing to keep in mind is that this more of a suspense movie then it is a war movie but that did not bother me, it is just worth noting. Regardless, this is a fantastic movie that will most definitely be defined as a classic. BR
1.0~THe worst movie on WWII Mauricio-marzano-531-686644 Sign in Permalink I am fully disappointed with that movie. Brazilian specialized press is saying that is the best movie of the year. Elio Gaspari in his papers' column said today the movie is excellent. I fully disagree. First of all it is a boring movie. I had two or three times the wish of leaving the theater. As a matter of fact, some guys did so. Second, is a quite illogical movie, regarding space and time. They mixed together time shifted events, and I just realized that reading the critics. Third is a type of horror movie in which the intention is to scare you. Why the sound is so loud? I had the impression Count Dracula would show himself up to bite some soldiers' neck. After spending and loosing 5USD with the ticket and regretting not to leave the theater before movies end, I realized that was the worst movie on WWII ever shot. I dare to say that is the worst movie ever shot about any war, not just WWII.
9.0~A Terrific War Piece For the Ages Jasper-8961 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a masterfully shot film with brilliant stunts and superb acting. The only possible aspect lacking in the film was the characters and their development, however this film didn't choose to focus mainly on the characters but rather to focus on the events that they went through. The dogfights and ship scenes fully immersed the audience into the action. Throughout the film, Christopher Nolan, decided to intersperse the three perspectives to then be able to link all of the events together. The inclusion of each perspective including 'The Mole', 'The Sea' and 'The Air' added to the suspense as we can see how the struggles through one section may affect the other perspectives. Christopher Nolan, once again, produced an outstanding film, that details the events of Dunkirk. 9/10
7.0~Dunkirk: The Disney version. zeki-4 Sign in Permalink "The best world war 2 movie to date"? Really? As a guy who have been brought up on ww2 movies, I had to attend the first showing. Especially since there were so many "best ever" headlines. So there I went. This movie is one long action sequence that stretches 106 minutes. But if you deduct the number of times that the exact same situation is shown, but from a different camera angle at another time in the movie, it barely passes the 60 minute mark. And after Hardy shoots down his fourth German plane, a stuka divebombs for the fifth time towards the beach, or Branagh looks up in the sky for the 7th time, it gets repetitive. This actually felt like one long teaser prologue to 'Battle of Britain'. (If the rumors are true that Ridley Scott is doing his take on Battle of Britain, all I can say is: get busy!) In 'Dunkirk' there's almost no dialogue, no conflict between any of the characters, no character development at all and the enemy is completely faceless. So this makes it a rather forgettable movie for me, unlike 'Hacksaw Ridge', 'Saving Private Ryan' and many of the other great world war 2 movies, that show war like it is: bloody. 'Dunkirk' is rated PG-13, which will sure please all the young Harry Styles fans. In retrospective: The 5-minute Dunkirk segment (all shot in one take, an available on You Tube) from the movie 'Atonement' still makes a much larger impression to me, than I think Nolan's first (and hopefully not last) world war 2 movie forever will be doing. But besides that - what Nolan (and collaborator Hans Zimmer) always do really well however is to create suspense, and there are some real nailbiting scenes in there, which make the ticket almost worth it. I left the theater disappointed, though. Expected it to leave a larger impression. It didn't. If you would have preferred 'Titanic' to be a movie that started right when the ship began sinking, 'Saving Private Ryan' to be all about the Omaha beach landing, and 'Braveheart' to be all about the battle of Sterling and Fallkirk, you don't mind cardboard characters, and you often find yourself muttering "when do they get to the action-part?", then 'Dunkirk' is definitely for you. For people who enjoy movies for emotional context, also: be advised that you won't find it here.
3.0~Very poor primaveranz Sign in Permalink I expected a lot from this movie after seeing the reviews, however after 5 minutes I realised I would be disappointed. Wooden acting, modern warships, aimless script, obvious use of models, the list goes on. This really is very poorly made given the technology available nowadays, especially to anyone that has any knowledge of the war (or even of movie-making) I am amazed that it has such a high rating.
3.0~No more than a good TV historical drama dufourbenoit Sign in Permalink Is this a scam, or has the capacity to be critical been lost due to the very sensitive and emotional subject of the film. For me, it seems like a joke... How could this momentous and dramatic event in our recent history be presented with so little means and ambition ? From books and historical reports, the boarding was a mess, planes were all over the sky, there were myriads of boats and ships, the beach were left with tons of discarded equipment and weapons... We see none of that. How can you give an idea of what it must have been with only a few sparking clean vintage planes, one small war ship, 12 period fishing or leisure boats... How could so many shots taken on site incorporate 1960's, 70's or even 80's buildings, street furniture, modern container cranes... How can it be night for the scenes at sea, and day for what happens on the beach, in Dover, or in the air at the same time ? How long can a spitfire fly after it has run out of petrol, and still manage to fight... For those who like history, it is a waste of time. For those who like action and war scenes, it can be watched but will be a disappointment For those who seek emotions and a peek at humans behaviour during the event, there is reasonably good acting, in a good British drama tradition. I suggest to wait for one year and watch it on TV where this show belongs.
1.0~The worst movie of the year steve-30705 Sign in Permalink And the worst movie of the year goes to... Dunkirk! This was absolutely the most horrible movie I've ever watched in a long time. The music or noise (from Hans Zimmer) was terrible and loud which was very surprising. The dialogue or the lack thereof was, well... pretty much non-existent. The story was... Oh there was actually a story? I must have missed that. Anyway, this is the last time I listen to IMDb which gave the movie a rating of 8.6/10. Morality of this post? The world is full of idiots who can't fricking rate a movie
1.0~Disappointed charlie-watson2 Sign in Permalink What was the point of making this movie? The acting was so-so and I suppose the plot was accurate but I left the theater wondering why I just watched that. I do not know the historical accuracy of the film but had a very hard time believing the scene where only one soldier shot at the fighter jet strafing the beach. They all had weapons, why did they not use them? This movie made the soldiers look like cowards and I doubt that they were.
9.0~Steals pure cinema back from the grave dug by Marvel/DC donuts_69 Sign in Permalink World War II movies are a genre that until very recently, with 2016's Hacksaw Ridge, had found its way to the back shelves of big budget productions. Since the last re-imagining of the segment back in the late 90's (Thin Red Line/Private Ryan) the ultra-intense and graphically violent content has worn most epic war stories into tired reheats that have lacked the inspiration that rekindled audience interest with those earlier releases. There has been no shortage of stories to tell, but with the explosion of the super-hero movie and re-booting of classic franchises, many major studios have let the War movie fall by the wayside. On its surface, the story of Dunkirk from an Allied perspective would seem to be a difficult sell to said production companies. More evacuation zone than battleground, neither bloody defeat nor heroic victory and a technical aspect that would guarantee a difficult shoot – it's no wonder someone like Chris Nolan had to be behind the camera to get this one off the ground. The film itself drops the viewer straight into the thick of it. We have all seen our share of WW2 movies, we don't need to establish who the heroes and villains are – this is a simple survival story told in a way not seen before. This is not about finding one specific protagonist and their struggle to escape the beach at Dunkirk, this is an all-encompassing vision that rather focuses on the duty of those involved. Organising the Evacuation of Dunkirk required steadfast dedication from all involved in the face of impending doom. The outcome of the European campaign would be determined by this events success/failure. There are 3 perspectives used for building the story – Land, Sea and Air. A typical but original Nolan twist involving time-lines across the 3 aspects allow for key scenes to be viewed from each perspective at slightly different times during the film. The movie shines through its pure film making rather than relying on a strong leading performance or stand out battle sequences. In saying that though, the performances on screen are exceptional just the same. Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh take nuance to lofty levels and provide moments that stay with you long after they play out on screen. The subtlety of stout British earnestness (read: Keep Calm & Carry On) is the hero here and represented to perfection, especially in Hardy's case given he wears his flight mask/goggles for the entire movie and barely has a dozen lines of dialogue. These are three men going to heroic lengths in order to do what they all knew needed to happen for the greater good. Where other movies show soldiers smothering grenades or running a gauntlet of gunfire to take ground, here again the viewer is treated with enough intelligence to know what each mans' actions mean in the bigger picture. The scarcity of dialogue from the film is not restricted to Hardy and where some may find the lack of conversation in the movie a bit distracting or crippling towards development between characters that may take the story onto more familiar ground, this is where the film real strength comes through. By allowing various elements (Weather, Colour, Sound and actions of the characters) the spaces of silence allow the viewer to interpret the unfolding drama in their own way, thus creating a far more powerful build in tension and emotion. Of course the cinematic elements of the production are delivered to the highest possible standard, Zimmers score soars, Van Hoytema utilizes cutting edge IMAX technology to bring new levels of detail and scope to screen (I saw this in 4K IMAX Laser @ Melb) while Nolans' direction and writing is as clean and concise as ever. With over 70% of the film shot in full IMAX scope, this is cinema at its finest. I was completely won over by the Aerial dogfights and amazing sound design of the classic Spitfire warplanes. The number of extras stacked up in columns on the beach or the practical set pieces where entire Destroyers are sunk. Take your pick of any of these or scores of other memorable moments from what will surely develop into a future classic for the WW2 film canon.
1.0~What a disaster.. the movie that is... alangilbert-23096 Sign in Permalink Ever since the end of the second world war, the phrase 'Dunkirk spirit' has been used in Britain to describe courage and solidarity in times of adversity. However, this film chooses to focus on a young soldier who tries every underhand trick he can think of to get on board the rescue vessels ahead of everyone else. Where's the bravery or self sacrifice in that? Instead of identifying with this "hero" I became increasingly angry with him and had nothing but contempt for his actions. Why not push in front of everyone else by pretending to be a medic? Why not pretend to be a survivor from a ship that's just been bombed and sunk? Not only do you get priority access to the next rescue boat but you get a hot drink, food and warmth before your comrades left behind on the beach. I was actually happy that every escape attempt failed for this character. It wouldn't be so bad if there was some dialogue to help us identify with Tommy's fears or motivation but the first part of the film is played out in almost mute silence. A group of soldiers walk through Dunkirk without any conversation or discussion of their situation. Thousands of soldiers stand on the beach waiting for rescue with no-one apparently talking to each other. I'm sorry but this is just unrealistic. But then it's equally unrealistic for Tommy and his comrades to have walked through a clean and rather modern looking town of Dunkirk where there is no damage to any of the buildings, despite the fact that the enemy (don't mention the Germans) are attacking the place. Freshly swept roads, clean windows and picture perfect sandbags for the French army to hide behind surely the filmmakers could have built a decent set to depict a war damaged section of town? Christopher Nolan has said that he wanted to avoid CGI in this film and opt instead for a realistic approach. Okay, CGI has become all pervasive in modern films (and some of it is downright cheesy) but there's surely no reason why it couldn't have been used in this film to create the illusion of more soldiers on the beach or extra boats out at sea. Trying to depict such a large scale and epic event as Dunkirk in a realistic and authentic way is virtually impossible without using some CGI. The cinematic device of three different story lines being told on three separate timescales just doesn't work in this movie. The constant jumping back and forth between the different threads leads to some jarring continuity effects. One minute the sky is overcast, the next it's clear and sunny. One moment it's nighttime, the next it's daytime. It's a shocking mess. Halfway through the movie I found myself shifting around in my seat feeling increasingly irritated and it wasn't just the misadventures of our "hero". I realised it was the background music causing my discomfort; a relentless, monotonous assault on the ears. War might be hell but this soundtrack isn't far behind. When the small boats arrive at Dunkirk, a stirring rendition of 'Nimrod' from Elgar's 'Enigma' variations is played, albeit played at quarter speed. Is this really counted as being an original music score as stated in the credits? Sadly the answer appears to be yes because Elgar's music is no longer under copyright protection. The fact that somebody got credit for writing this particular section of "original" music is absolutely shameful. The clichés: when Tom Hardy's pilot has a problem with his fuel gauge and has to start making manual calculations on what fuel he has left, what are the chances that he will actually run out of fuel before the film ends? Well knock me down with a feather! He's run out of fuel. Gosh, I never saw that plot twist coming The young boy who jumps on the small boat at the last moment as it leaves England, not realising (in his naivety) that it could be a dangerous journey. What are the chances of him being badly injured or even dying? Oh look he's dead. Surprised? Well only by the manner of his death and the lack of concern from the skipper of the boat when told of what's happened. What are the chances that our brave Spitfire pilot (who's just ditched in the sea) is going to be rescued from drowning at the very last second as the water laps over his head? What a cliffhanger! Our small boat gets there in the nick of time to save the day! On the edge of my seat and holding my breath with excitement? Er, no. Then we have that ridiculous ending. After shooting down an enemy plane (don't mention the Germans) Tom Hardy runs out of fuel. In an outstanding display of flying skills, our pilot extraordinaire not only manages to glide his Spitfire up and down the beach a couple of times but shoots down a Stuka bomber in the process before making a picture perfect landing on the beach as the sun sets. Why bother landing on the beach? He could have flown back to England in time for tea and tiffin. As the sun goes down he destroys his aircraft so the enemy (please don't mention the Germans) can't get their hands on it. Quite frankly a crash landing would have been much more entertaining and an appropriate epitaph for this sorry farrago of a movie. Verdict? This film is a turkey.
1.0~So, SO bad. ian-witts Sign in Permalink Terrible effects, over 300,000 evacuated but no use of CGI and there was typically around 200 just milling around, almost 1,000 civilian boats took part but the film decided to depict about 20 of them. There were modern building around the beach, the Spitfire effect at the end was just laughable, characters were terrible, didn't tell a story, no scenes really mattered, etc. Most of all, one of the biggest logistical missions of the war with countless brave civilians stepping up and doing their duty for king and country (and significant loss of life) and we get a terrible action (!?) flick with no real acknowledgement for the heroes. I also believe Christopher Nolan said he didn't want to include Churchill in it as it would make it political. Genius.
1.0~Horrible gassiotthouse Sign in Permalink Walked out of the movie after watching it for an hour. The actors do not talk very much in the movie but it seems to have music playing in the background quit a bit. The movie went from one scene to the next to the next to the next, it kept jumping around so you never really get into liking one character or the other. It was a very slow movie and the War scenes were less graphic than what you see on regular T.V. I would rate this movie below a 1 if I could. Definitely the worst war movie I have ever seen. I have no idea how anyone would rate this movie better than Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, or any other war movie. To sum it up, wait for it to come on DVD if you really want to watch it because I promise you that you will thank me for saving you money!
1.0~a rather pointless and flat film grumpy-3 Sign in Permalink could not see the point of this film, as usual all the critics applaud a very flawed, unemotional and very banal film i was looking for the experience, the spectacle but there was nothing. the cutting between the timelines was utterly pointless and distracting, in fact everything in the film makes sure you do not get involved, you do not care for anyone or what is going on. Again Nolan puts in really bad unbelievable things, would a pretty heavy spitfire be able to glide and manouvre for some considerable time and then do a perfect landing. once again he bombardes you with an ear splitting soundtrack, zimmers pounding racket, bombs, bullets and other sound effect have the effect of distancing you from everything. in the entire film i don't think one boat or ship was seen moving even when they were supposed to. there were over 900 boats of various sizes, he shows about ten, in the air the luftwaffe were creating havoc, we see three spitfires and about six to ten German planes. all in all an insult to the men being rescued and the people who came for them.
2.0~Perhaps The Most Underwhelming War Story Ever Told gsfsu Sign in Permalink The evacuation of Dunkirk was one of the greatest achievements of WWII but you would not know it by this film. The story bounces around every few minutes to show another side of the story and becomes so disjoint that the episodes could be exchanged without altering the story line at all. The faces of the British soldiers all have that thousand yard stare and for the most part are expressionless. Not much to recommend this movie.
1.0~This is the shittiest war survival movie ever! jahanzeb-abbasi2011 Sign in Permalink I am a huge fan of nolan even after reading few bad reviews on IMDb i went to watch it. And this movie is complete piece of crap nothing is good inside this movie some one said watch it on IMAX this movie is masterpiece i assure you this movie is not have enough worth to watch it for free go for The great escape 1963 or Das boot but don't watch this crap really disappointed!
1.0~Bad Movie. All are paid reviews. Crazy_Cracker17 Sign in Permalink Let me tell you the truth. This is not a good movie. I really don't know how and why this movie got good Ratings. May be because of Christopher Nolan's Trolls as always. or may be paid reviews. Anyway, Movie is really BORING. This movie could have been much much better if they didn't try to show this in Christopher Nolan Style. In whole movies there is just one thing, They just keep adding new Background music, keep it increasing to make us feel tension. No any story, no character development, no any explanation. Nothing. Just weird things keeps going everywhere. I had to take a nap for 10 miniute. Such good war movie shouldn't have given to Christopher Nolan. I suggest don't go for it. ask your friend before going or just watch it in PC.
1.0~The most overrated movie ever mrmotaz Sign in Permalink I went to this movies with very high expectations and I was really disappointed. I am not sure what went wrong but I guess it was supposed to convey the magnitude of the events as well as tie the spectator emotionally, sadly it failed miserably in both. The only one i felt for was the french soldier, meanwhile all other actors were just bland and i couldn't care less for. Moreover the movie couldn't at all convey the magnitude of the event (only a word at the end of the Movie we save 300,000) All i can say is that was painfully boring. The music was annoying most of the time. It was just bad storytelling and I really cant understand how can anybody like this.
3.0~A terrible movie arnaudmallaisy Sign in Permalink it's a very annoying war movie, the worst I have seen since like forever.. nothing is realistic, acting is terrible.. nothing makes sense I don't know what else I can write to describe how bad is this movie. I wish I could help more
7.0~A technical masterpiece, Empty at emotional core narendrarastogi Sign in Permalink Dunkirk and Saving private Ryan both movies are based in WWll but there is a huge difference. On one hand Saving private Ryan relies on human emotions and depth, Dunkirk relies on visuals and effects. Which is definitely a bad thing for a war drama where film lacks the emotional depth which should be generated after watching a war movie ( like in Schindler's list, SPR). Dunkirk, almost as War for the Planet of the Apes, plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the background score and effects in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted. The sound of planes passing above, the gunfire, and the explosions all contribute to a compelling thriller like situation, almost similar to Saving Private Ryan. The cinematography is great. The effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting, authenticity, WWII vehicles are on spot. The best part about movie was the minimal use of CGI, which are the dominating part of action in the movies these days. While the characters in this film aren't that interesting, Harry Styles, is excellent at his debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. The only character in the movie which I cared for was Mark Rylance's. The concept of three parts coming together, the beach, the sea, and the air is an interesting idea. I should love this film. Historical drama? Compelling story? WWII setting? One of my favorite director ? Amazing cinematography? Mind blowing sound? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection. If I reviewed this based on technical achievement.. it's a 5 star rated movie. But it lacks the emotional depth and it had nothing extra ordinary to take home. I simply can not put this in the list with Saving private Ryan and Schindler's list. At the risk of sounding like a person.. trying to take a different stand, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star movie? Definitely and Unfortunately, no.
3.0~Devastatingly Disappointed will-reed Sign in Permalink -Contains Spoilers- After reading such amazing universal critical praise, my less than stellar experience of watching Dunkirk obligated me to write my first ever review on IMDb. I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, in many ways I think he has truly changed cinema and how we experience film. I would go as far as to call him a visionary artist. This is why Dunkirk truly baffled me. Let's think about the technical facts of the Dunkirk evacuation, it is said over and over in the film that there are 300,000 men on the beach. We see maybe 1,000. A mass evacuation this scale took hundreds and hundreds of vessels. We see upwards of 30-40. And the Luftwaffe was definitely assailing the beach, yet in the film we see a paltry 8 planes. There is something missing here, it's called "scale". This film has a complete dearth of it. And that is a shame and blaspheme to the experience of the true Dunkirk evacuation. Beyond the obvious factual incongruities, there are glaring narrative holes. We have no connection to these characters, they seem cold and distant from us. There is no character development whatsoever in the film. I understand that Nolan was trying to show the entire character of the Dunkirk evacuees, but again we only saw a minuscule few hundred of what was supposed to be 300,000 so this argument is moot to me. We don't even get to see one Nazis either, so the "grand villain" that was forcing the evacuation was never even on the screen!!!! The score and the sound design have been mentioned by many reviewers, and again I was so underwhelmed. There have been so many better films for both scores and sound design, too many to list actually. Yes, there is some stellar cinematographer, but we expect that from Mr. Nolan. Finally, I've heard and read "One of the best war films ever" so many times now. Give me a break. There are many many better war films- Ran, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line, and Saving Private Ryan to name just a few. I'd suggest you rent or buy one of these instead of watching Dunkirk. I wouldn't waste my time viewing this film again. I hope Nolan's next film is far better.
4.0~Disappointment - not recommended kim-kirchhoff Sign in Permalink Verdict: Disappointed, do not go and see this movie, unless you are a fan of war films, and can accept that you never get to know the way to many characters, never getting an emotional connection. Revisit either Interstellar or Inception instead. Do not relay on the critics and their reviews, this film is like a musical director having way to many instruments and way to many musicians, the potential is there - but Nolan failed for the first time i a long long time. Story: I have so far been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, both his choice of stories and how to tell the story, but this film leaves me with a feeling of being an very close observer to battle/war, hearing and seeing the action - but missing backstory, the touch, emotional connection and depth of the way to many characters. This is actually one of the greatest issues especially when Nolans uses great actors like Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy and many others. The potential is huge. The trademark non linear story telling, gets a bit confusing, as you see plane fights from multiple angles during the film, daylight and night is mixed in a strange way, sometimes it takes you minutes to notice the time jump. Many scenes are repetitive, seen from different angles/different characters. Visual: Great cinematography, by Hoyte Van Hoytema who also did cinematography for Interstellar too. Nolans choice of using 70mm film, instead of going digital might work better in a real 70mm theater, but the completely renovated theater with the best in both digital projection and sound I attended resulted in a "fuzzy" look compared to recent digital films, this might be how Nolan chose to do the print the film. HD Trailers for Dunkirk look much more crisp/clearer colors. One might hope for a better analog to digital conversion to Blu Ray or UHD Blu ray - but then again this film will become less impressive a home, compared to the big screen and the massive sound. Sound: Both the sound and the music was way too loud, especially in a premium theater made for Dolby Atmos (which this film is not). I guess that Nolans basic idea is that you are "in the action", planes flying over your head, guns blasting etc. I had ringing in my ears leaving the theater, and covered my ears during some of the flight scenes, as did my wife.
5.0~Awful. A lost opportunity. desertfox1942-178-876030 Sign in Permalink A disappointment and lost opportunity for a good filmmaker. The disappointment began from the first couple of minutes. Leaflets falling from the sky "We surrounded you" with a perimeter around the city of Dunkirk and right after the group of soldiers being shot at which means the Germans were already in the city and close enough to the beach to literally throw the BEF in the sea, as we soon found out when the one survivor passed the french barricade. After that you merely had beautiful scenes. No plot, barely any dialogues, just beautiful scenes. You might as well work as a photographer if it comes to nice images only. The soldiers standing like ghosts on the beach doing nothing. Not even simple things like smoking or eating. Look at any wartime photographs and you'll see how fake this film is. No scenes showing the British retreating and being saved. You only see boats at the end of the film rescuing them while in reality it was a whole operation that lasted for days with a lot of action happening, but no let's just give it a surrealistic, poetic approach like Terence Mallick did with the Thin Red Line since it is one of the favourite films of Nolan. Pathetic. Also, timelines. Why the timelines??? Nolan is obviously obsessed with them. They worked in INterstellar and Inception and I loved that. But leave them out of Dunkirk! And what's with the bad sound mixing? First there was Interstellar and now Dunkirk where you could barely understand what is being said because the music is louder than the actors!
3.0~Beautiful cinematography but still left me cold.. andalus-91860 Sign in Permalink As expected of a Christopher Nolan movie, Dunkirk has beautiful cinematography. I enjoyed the sometimes dizzying shots of the airplanes and the ocean but it made me appreciate the range of filming. However the movie itself was devoid of a plot. I understand Nolan was aiming for a movie geared towards survival of the soldiers, but I was not particularly moved by their struggles. The plot was too scattered for me. For instance, I was under the impression that the movie started out with "the mole", which was later referenced to, but never followed up on, which confused me very much as to what they were aiming for in terms of the story line. The fighting scenes were drawn out WAY too much and could have easily been cut down by 30 minutes so that I didn't have to watch 2 hours of essentially nothing. Also, the pounding music was suspenseful in the beginning but eventually began to hurt my ears. Also, as a side note,I later read on the actual events on Dunkirk and learned that Indian soldiers had a significant contribution in the events at Dunkirk, as they were a colony under the British Raj at that time. Nolan claimed that he didn't want to politicize the movie, but I don't understand how not including Indian soldiers would have politicized the movie. Thus it gave me the impression that in spite of beautiful graphics, I was yet again watching another stereotypical movie with white people saving the day during a war at the core of the movie, while pushing aside the contributions of other people. It might not matter to a lot of people but I would have personally liked to see SOME historical accuracy, along with a better stitched plot to keep me more engaged *yawn*
8.0~Dunkirk" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most kaptenvideo-89875 Sign in Permalink Ahh... Nolan. Who doesn't love Christopher Nolan, eh? One of the most acclaimed directors working today, a cinematic genius behind modern classics such as "The Dark Knight" trilogy, "The Prestige", "Inception" and "Interstellar"... Well, I hate to be a party pooper (as always), but I have never shared the mad love every other movie fan I know has to share for him. I mean, his works are a'ight, but I never found them to be as great as everybody else seemed to think. I guess I liked early Nolan the best – "Memento" and especially "Insomnia" –, when he was more interested in characters and building suspense than just creating the biggest baddest epics available. Of course, Nolan is good at creating suspense and orchestrating action setpieces, but even his best works "Inception" and "Interstellar" have suffered from being overlong and pompous. Not to mention his third and last Batman which felt like a big pompous piece of crap. Having written all that, I liked "Dunkirk" a lot. It's not only one of the finest movies of 2017 (so far), one of the most thoughtful war dramas I've seen, and also Nolan's best yet. Although if you go to cinema expecting his usual, you may well leave disappointed, because this epic World War II tale is quite unlike anything we have come to associate him with. After all these years, it must be supremely difficult to create a war drama with something fresh to show or say. But Nolan is not afraid of challenges, and he has managed to pull off a movie which is both epic and intimate, artsy and mainstream- friendly, adrenaline-filled and deep at the same time. It's what the movie lovers always wait for but rarely get: a thinking man's blockbuster. "Dunkirk" shows the experience of war from the another angle rarely seen or thought of, at least in movies. It's about human frailty, loneliness, isolation and enduring the limbo between chaos and salvation that war is made of. Of course, there's also enough explosions and eye-candy, but the whole thing is rather artsy in a good way. Not much dialogue or clearly defined events too, just people waiting (because there's nothing else left for them to do) and trying to survive. There is not even a single clearly-defined central character, although there are several main story lines to follow, sometimes not in chronological form. The story is about thousands of Allied troops surrounded by enemy forces, trapped on the beach and waiting for rescuing. We have some well-known actors here, such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy, but it's not really an actor's movie (ie, meant to let somebody shine) but fitting everything into a carefully crafted cinematic mosaic. Speaking about war part, I especially loved the flight and air battle scenes. The immediacy, the sound effects. Also the fact that they were often made from pilot's viewpoints, so it feels more realistic. The pilot shoots and we see target plane catching fire only after a while, for example. All in all, Dunkirk" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most. It's about real things, emotions and experiences, and the action is thrillng. Another beautiful achievement for one of the most liked and successful auteurs working in mainstream cinema today. Watched it in IMAX which probably add something to the experience, at least from technical standpoint. But it's surely a good looking and sounding movie on any screen or setup, methinks.
9.0~My awestruck eyes, ringing ears redfor Sign in Permalink This Nolan Brilliance, from the beginning: Imagine running for your life, to escape your enemy in a World War. In this case, the German Luftwaffe suddenly releases propaganda leaflets (urging your surrender) on your mates and you. Not dropping your weapons immediately, a sudden burst of bullets downs your unit members, as you frantically flee to stay alive. Thus is the opening of 'Dunkirk'. It sets the remaining roller coaster ride of death versus survival, often with mere seconds determining the fates of many. Wounded warriors on a ship with LARGE red crosses on its side are also fair game: the ship explodes and floods because not enough Royal Air Force Spitfire fighters are available to defend it. The direction and cinematography are wonderful. Numerous subplots are so closely interspersed that transitions between them may sometimes startle you. But there is no denying that this is a massively, memorable, cinematic classic. Kudos to all involved with its making. Was the editing fun? As stated during the end titles, this movie was shot and edited using (70mm!) film. It's playing in at least 35 mm, 70mm, digital, and IMAX formats. Standard cuts so smooth they're not noticed, cross cuts, and sometimes the fading in and out of madness and/or darkness, are intense. The 'B-rolls' created with additional cameras are astounding. The courageous civilians in private boats – seemingly without (except for skirmishes with the German military), serious injury to but one only – is alone amazing. Correct that: a shell-shocked crew member of a sunken English warship causes the demise of a selfless, courageous young man. The private vessel is the 'Moonstone'. The scenes leading to this heartache caused my greatest pause: if one is bleeding badly from the back of their head (and clearly growing weaker), wouldn't it make sense to role him over, to a face-down position? At least then, might the hemorrhage form a life-saving clot? The history of the Dunkirk rescues raises more questions. Are nurses and doctors not civilians? Are hospital ships, even when saving soldiers, not off-limits to torpedoes? They weren't, just as rescue boats of private civilians were not exempt from attack. Kenneth Branagh's 'Commander Bolton' delivers easily-noticed exposition. He quickly states he's not leaving Dunkirk, for there's so many more souls to be saved by the miraculous, civilian flotilla bound from England. Even more rescue vessels arrive, chiming in. Shortly after the film was released, Branagh appeared on 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert', and mentioned the "Dunkirk Spirit", which members of his generation grew up with. He also mentioned that some Dunkirk veterans – now in their mid 90's – attended the UK Premier of the movie. Quoting Kenneth: "I said, What did you think of the film? They said, 'The film was louder than the battle.' " Colbert's audience laughed loudly. About 90% of the way into the movie, I had to move close to the rear of the theater. My ears could no longer deal with the volume level of being about a dozen rows back from the screen. You'll feel low- frequency sound effects within your body without damage; your ears may need plugs to fully avoid hearing damage.
2.0~An Honest American Review TheTruthDoor Sign in Permalink How is Dunkirk getting so many raving, positive reviews when it is such a lousy film? The reviews are mostly from Europeans with a blind pride or they have an emotional attachment to the actual battle. Also, the director is from England. You see if this movie fails, which it should, England's pride will take a hit (the home of James Bond, the Queen and all that royalty bs). My HONEST review of "Dunkirk"...I say "honest" because there is just no way that someone could give an honest review of this movie without saying something negative about it. I knew in the first 5-minutes that it was a turkey. Honestly, it was almost laughable from the start. The acting, the editing, the corny captions, the predictability, the audio, the video....it was all close to laughable. Dunkirk today is a tourist resort and Nolan filmed the beach scenes on the beach in Dunkirk. Imagine taking a modern day beach town and filming a war movie set in the 1940's on that beach. Laughable. I know you are going to ignore my review, because of the unbelievable reviews it is getting, but you will REGRET IT. I cannot and will not lie to you, "Dunkirk" is a stupidly bad movie that absolutely DOES NOT deserve the good reviews it is getting.
2.0~Use just one of those millions and hire a script writer susand1108 Sign in Permalink The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is the cinematography. Make no mistake: this was a horrible movie -- not just boring but horrible. The characters, if you can call them that, were undeveloped and unlikable. How can you care about a character if they haven't even got a name? Nothing but a hodge podge of "intense" scenes, one after the other, and yet they all look alike after a few minutes. There was no attempt to tell the inspiring story of Dunkirk. If you didn't happen to know it (and certainly if you came in one minute late, after the silly title card intro), you'd be completely lost. But then why would you think this was about Dunkirk anyway? How could you mistake the couple of hundred soldiers on a beach, three pilots, two ships, and one fishing boat for a story about the Dunkirk rescue? (My mistake, by the end there were maybe a dozen boats.) Where did the money go? Certainly not to CGI where they could have beefed up the numbers accurately. Certainly not to an actual screen- writer who might have given us a narrative. It must have gone towards having all those glorious BS rave reviews written. And don't get me started on the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer should be ashamed of himself. 7000 measures of the same loud droning strings!
3.0~Good cinematography Horrible script nolane-75584 Sign in Permalink I agree with the other reviewers about the cinematography so I won't go into that. I love WWII movies, and historical movies in general, and I was really looking forward to this one as I didn't know all that much about this event. The promos for the movie made me think this was going to be about the evacuation of Dunkirk by the hundreds (thousands?) of civilians. Alas, it ends up being a survival story. Don't get me wrong, the story from the point of view of the GIs is a story that needed to be told. As my 89 year old WWII vet movie companion stated, nobody should forget this event. The movie did a good job of portraying the GIs' struggle to survive. Here's a question for you, when did this event take place? Yes, we all know it takes place during WWII, but when? Well, you won't learn that from the movie. Nor will you learn about the civilian rescuers. Not how many there were. Not their stories. Not where they came from (all over England or just a particular area?). Not how long this evacuation took. Not how many GIs were rescued. There are a couple of vague references to the civilian program and one line referencing an approximation of how many men were rescued. There wasn't even the usual post-movie paragraph giving the facts of this event. Other than a lot of men died, you won't learn much else about this event. The movie attempts to follow the GIs on the beach, the "air" battle such as it was, and the voyage of ONE civilian boat. At the beginning of the movie there appears on-screen the numbers 1, 2 and 3 - with a time period after each one. No explanation. I sat through the entire movie thinking what the???? After the movie, and after I Googled the event, I'm guessing that those were supposed to let the viewer know the three time-periods during which the 3 separate story lines of the movie take place. But it's just a guess. If you just want to watch a "pretty" movie, this is for you. But beyond that, as a historical movie it's just awful. The movie was confusing, disjointed, convoluted, and lacking any substance whatsoever. And the characters? There weren't any. Nobody to get the viewer involved in the movie. My takeaway from the movie was these men were sitting ducks and a whole lot of them died. If you want to see a movie that is indirectly about Dunkirk but is world's better than this thing, see "Their Finest", it's definitely a 10 star movie.
5.0~A huge disappointment! rsaada-112-810327 Sign in Permalink I had high expectations when I arrived to the movie theatres to watch the latest film by Christopher Nolan but sadly my expectations fell way short. Nolan failed to capture the grand scale of the historic battle of Dunkirk. The entire movie revolved around a small boat that travels south across the English Channel along with a few other boats. In the air we have 2 to 3 planes engaged in boring, slow-paced dog fights. On the beaches we have a couple of hundred soldiers with no equipment except their guns. Now let's compare that to reality. According to historic records the following equipment was left behind on the beach by the British after evacuation: 700 tanks, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large caliber, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, 20,000 motorcycles, and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. During the evacuation 243 British ships were sunk and in the air hundreds of planes were involved in dogfights among which some 400 were shot down. The movie didn't come even close to capturing the scale of the battle and has very little dialog. You would think the soldiers were mute! I think Nolan should stick to science fiction movies rather than historic non-fiction.
2.0~What a disappointment this movie is jacdeleeuw Sign in Permalink The beginning of the movie isn't bad but after about 45 minutes the movie starts to bore: it lacs a continuing and understandable storyline; similar scenes are repeated too many times and the "music" in some scenes starts to irritate. The conversations between the well known actors are reduced to a minimum. The director missed the opportunity to add historical information, maps, a good timeline, a view from the German perspective, it all would have added to the quality of the movie. To us Dunkirk is a missed chance: the operation succeeded, the movie is a disaster.
2.0~Good they told it was about Dunkirk....... prohibited-name-1761 Sign in Permalink If this was a random war movie I think everyone would say it's bad. But because it has historical reference everyone claims it's good. To movie is slow, without context and I even question if we saw something historical. Had a hard time keeping my eyes open and after it finisched I wonder what the hell I just see. Start of the movie was great, but after that it dropped to lower levels and it never stopped falling.
2.0~This movie is overrated kavirajkalsi Sign in Permalink 2 stars for the french woman. from effects to Turtle style slow moving story-line. this movie is a punishment for those who want to spend their 2 hours for a good movie. You can skip if you only want to watch good movies. this movie is just feel like Director think the are paying the viewers to watch thats why he/she make it like "Mah lyf, Mah Rulz".
1.0~Does not live up to the critics reviews martyn_pearce Sign in Permalink I have never bothered to post a review before for any film. But I feel that I must to point out the nonsense of film reviewers these days. I see the critics post as must see, film of the year, et, etc. This was billed as a film with fantastic sound. I found the continuous droning noise whose pitch increased during the film to what I hoped would be a fantastic climax, but I the drone included what sounded like whale noises and more boring droning noises with occasional sounds of gun fire. I was bored after 15 minutes, the ridiculous story of the kid in the fishing boat, the original bit about the spitfire pilots and the nonsense of the soldiers taking cover in the boat.....absolute shallow lazy boring rubbish filming. If they added a decent music score it may have kept me interested. This film does not show it as it was its just absolute cap and does not come across as a powerful film at all. A waste of money.
7.0~A lot to like but could have been so much better kmhowie Sign in Permalink I saw it yesterday and I am sad to say that it did not live up to my expectations. It was a movie that I expected to like and wanted to like but it just came up short. There was a lot to like but there was much that was superfluous and too many ways that I believe it could have been made better. I believe that more context would have useful. A few lines of introduction as to how the situation developed was not enough. Somehow there should have been some way to convey more vividly what a disaster it would have been had things turned out differently. Only passing mention was made to the decision by Hitler to halt his tanks. The possibility of a reversal of that decision, by all accounts, created a sense of impending doom over those who were aware of the situation. This could have been used for more dramatic effect, of which there was otherwise not much. Another facet of the story of Dunkirk which I think got extremely short shrift was the assembling of the flotilla of small boats which crossed the Channel for the rescue. To many people this was THE main story of Dunkirk. It almost appeared that the side story about this was inserted so that the acting talents of Mark Rylance could be put to use. It seemed to add nothing to the main story. The battle scenes were great cinematography but I don't think there would have been lost if there had been fewer of them. I often feel guilty when I am critical of a movie like this but I don't think that simply making a movie about a serious topic does not always make for a good one.
2.0~Complete waste of time draggmask Sign in Permalink The movie is kind of a mix between Saving Private Ryan and There Will be Blood. But imagine that you remove the saving of, Saving Private Ryan and put There Will be Blood into it and you have this movie. I love Memento, The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar, some of Nolans other movies but i'm sorry to say, this movie is lacking purpose, depth, plot and overall content. It could have been a excellent movie. It shows the horrors of war through it's amazing CGI, however that's all it does, and it's far from enough.
4.0~Personally this is the slowest war movie in the history of war movies. badaluca69 Sign in Permalink So many cut scenes. Can I just watch one single spitfire take out the entire German Air Force without cutting to a sence of a fishmerman driving a boat? Is that possible? Plus it wasn't a "miricale of Dunkirk" Hitlers panzer corps we're ordered to halt. Slaughtering countless of Brits waiting in line for sailboats weren't his main concern at that time. Either way I still don't understand how people enjoy this movie. But each their own.
1.0~Were all the film critics who raved about this given backhanders ? rcaglynn Sign in Permalink Quite easily one of worst films I have ever seen. I really was looking forward to this , especially after all the hype and rave reviews from the so called film critics. I honestly think I couldn't have made a worse film than this one even if I had tried myself. Everything was wrong about it., no sense of urgency, suspense, the awful events leading up to the evacuation, the feeling of being surrounded.... I could go on and on..... but I'll just finish by saying avoid this pile of poop at all costs.
1.0~Worst movie ever! lietus0 Sign in Permalink Watch it only if you have nothing to do at all. It has no story, no emotions, no characters, also you only see perspective from allied side, and that is not enough if movie is marked as historical. You would get more enjoyment watching documentary about Dunkirk evacuation.
2.0~Almost a total disappointment puckamo Sign in Permalink The story of the "little ships" and their rescue of the British army at Dunkirk deserves a great movie, and this is not it. Or even close. The first scenes are compelling, and the vision of the troops standing in line on the beach, queuing up patiently for the transport that might never come, is striking. Mark Rylance is superb as always, and Kenneth Branagh shows up, though he doesn't have much to do. I've heard from friends that they found the Spitfire dogfights boring, but I didn't- they are often confusing, and the shots from the pov of the Spitfire pilots are too short, but the scenes stay in your mind. But after about fifteen minutes the relentless, incessant, ever-present "music" of Hans Zimmer begins to wear on any sensible viewer, especially once you realize that there's another hour and a half to go. This "music" never stops, and once that becomes apparent, and the time jumping starts in earnest, the movie really starts to grind, with only momentary flashes to show what it could have been. Christopher Nolan should stick to the franchise movies and let someone with some sensibility handle the real-life epics.
2.0~Outdated war propaganda falbpe Sign in Permalink The point of a new WWII clon movie always is something misleading. ¿Really we need a WWII movie every month? Now, the music and photography are very good; but soon we realize than the plot and the drama is thin, and the more important part of a movie always should be the dramatic elements. Of the three stories that is about the film, none has the slightest interest; the more weak is the aviator story, and really do not fit with the others. Maybe without this part the movie it would have been better. The problem with historical war films is that they only work when present themselves as allegorical or symbolic; for this reason Apocalypse Now (1979) is a great movie. The reality of the past is something than change with the time; and is really hard to believe today in the cinema like a neutral source of historical contents. And the point of filming a movie with the only sense to encourage the British and American people to enjoy the war against Germany, seem something outdated or very forced. But I have no doubt than Dinkirk will win one or two Oscars: it has the necessary measure of mediocrity.
5.0~Not the kind of movie I expected... kriskennedy-79484 Sign in Permalink First let me say that I give this movie top marks for cinematography and how it tells the story strictly from the standpoint of the soldiers on the beach at Dunkirk and the difficulties they faced in escaping the continent for England. Unfortunately at this point the movie loses relevance and goes downhill in a serious way because for any movie depicting events in wartime it is essential that the story be told from the opposing side as well. Christopher Nolan would've been well-advised to watch just about any other film about WW2 from the classics of the 1960s and 1970s up to and including Clint Eastwood's portrayal of events in the Pacific theatre with Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. I believe Nolan's response that portraying the German side of the story as irrelevant today is completely misguided but also a distortion of history in the worst possible way. The fact remains that the Allies were able to escape from Dunkirk ONLY because the Germans halted their advance for a period of 48 hours and yet none of this is depicted in the movie or the conflict that may have existed among the German High Command at such a decision and why it was made. Suffice to say this level of breathing room allowed for the successful evacuation on the scale it occurred and not merely because of a few rickety boats coming across the Channel helmed by sporting yachtsmen who answered the call on behalf of Jolly Old England. Its almost a hagiographic assessment of the British when in fact they themselves saw how doomed they were in the words of Lord Gort, the commander of the BEF who stated "I must not conceal from you that a great part of the BEF and its equipment will inevitably be lost in the best of circumstances". Which it was in point of fact as the amount of material left in Dunkirk took quite some time for the British to resupply and even then only with American assistance. I really wish I could've given this movie 8 or 9 stars because the potential was there for so much more but shooting it in 70MM film just isn't enough to merit a higher rating in my view when a great deal of the story here was completely omitted. For those unfamiliar with these events in time, and in truth Dunkirk is one of those war stories not frequently told, it serves to inform a younger audience in a misleading manner about what really happened, how and most certainly why.
1.0~Bullshit !! modianubhav-43-269586 Sign in Permalink My greatest fear while watching Nolan's new movie if that just because he has delivered back to back world-wide hits and seen as the most intelligent film-maker; critics and Nolan-fans are obliged to given 10/10 ratings even if the movie is very average or even bad. Dunkirk finally turned my fear into reality. The movie is simply plain boring. You don't feel attached to any character. I don't even care if they die. The Aerial shots featuring Tom hardy all seem repetitive. It was not "immersive", "out of the world" experience as many critics are saying. One critic wrote that there was pin-drop silence in theater. Yes, I agree but not because people are tense but perhaps they are sleeping. And dear western media, I know world needs a anti-war message right now but that doesn't mean you start giving rave reviews to such a pathetic movie. ALL PEOPLE know wars are bad. EVEN TRUMP knows that. EVEN Hitler knew that. We don't need a Nolan-movie to realize that. Half-hour into the movie and I was desperately waiting for it to get over. The only people who might like it are Britons because they have heard Dunkirk stories growing up and might relate to it. But for rest of the world, it is simple plain boring. Save your money and better watch Dark knight at home. Giving 1 star to bring some sanity back into the world. Although the movie might deserve 6/10.
8.0~The Best War Movie That I Have Watched Since Saving Private Ryan. My Personal Best Movie Of This Year ShadowRomeo1784 Sign in Permalink My Personal Rating 8/10 Short Review - Dunkirk is a war film that shows us how terrifying being stuck in a war can be. instead of focus on character's development like most war films do, christopher nolan did not included many talkings because of he wants to show us that in a middle of a war we cannot just sit and talk about the character's back story instead we jumped into their situation and now watch them how to survive and endure being in that situation. that i understand that's the main difference between this film and the considered best war film "Saving Private ryan" the atmosphere and soundtrack of this film is so superb that it gives us chills the feel of fear of war, the trauma it caused. that's what i exactly felt watching this. horror is not the right term for this film it shows us how terrifying a war can be. Impressions - Dunkirk is an excellent film. what i love more about this film is the cinematography beautiful shots from the aerial combat the special non cgi effects the atmosphere. the soundtrack the plot did not mattered that much and in my opinion not that special but the way this film's message to us. telling us of the story is the superb. giving us the message by feeling it through soundtrack and seeing it on character's reaction being on that situation. amazing film. my personal best movie of this year hands down. and i will definitely gonna watch this film again. Downsides - Dunkirk is not a film about a war hero. Dunkirk is not a film for everyone especially people who only cares about characters. Dunkirk's intention of just jumping in to the situation might not suit everyone. it did to me. but i'm seeing some people that are not satisfied with it. just like what i said above this film's intention is different than other war films do and in my opinion that makes it unique and love it even more. Pros: Great Cinematography Great Sound Design Realistic DogFight Realistic Sound Effects No CGI The Tension And Fear While You Watch This Film Especially On IMAX The Timeline Between The Land, Sea, And Air. Very Immersive Amosphere Cons: There is No Unique Story About Characters This Movie Did Not Even Had Any Memorable Dramatic Moments Not For Everyone Especially If You Like Story. Rating On Each Aspect Story: 6/10 Cinematography: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 Acting: 7.5/10 Dialogue: 6/10
3.0~Fails the "I'd watch it again" test kingsinuk Sign in Permalink There's just something missing here. I know, I'm supposed to tell you what it is, Dramatic scenes well acted and stunningly photographed don't make a movie; there must be a story. Great movies, even good movies, start with a coherent story; one that can be told by an elder around a campfire. The director lost the story and his way. In the end, Dunkirk fails the "I'd watch it again" test. Has there ever been a film you considered the "Best Picture" that you didn't want to watch again? Of course not. It makes you wonder how many of the Academy members saw "Dunkirk"... P.S. Mr. Dawson, the boat captain/father is masterfully played by Mark Rylance. His performance is the only thing that's Oscar worthy about this film.

6.0~The continuity guy should be shot joaosantos20 Sign in Permalink The movie is OK, i really don't understand the hype and the amazing reviews. It fails to show the scale of Dunkirk, it fails to show the feeling of being in a war, and i was amazed how they shoot a scene in a middle of a storm and a second later clear skies, this people are idiots that can't keep something so simple not be such a complete anticlimactic BS. But the worst is the ending, cliché like you have ever seen in your life. And again the plain that starts to land in closed skies and lands in a sunny day. This people are morons.
9.0~(Minor Spoilers) I almost wish this movie would be without dialogue, it is an aesthetically incredible film. lukas-meister Sign in Permalink I will start this by saying that Dunkirk is a bit of a different war film for me, because it doesn't focus on having a tight, cohesive narrative and clear protagonists which in most cases increase the emotional impact it has on the viewer. It instead establishes a basic premise: It is WW2, the Allied forces are surrounded by the Nazis and we watch them as they are evacuated near Dunkirk. This premise and so the beginning of the movie also let us know that TIME is the most important aspect of this film, and we are reminded of this fact in nearly every scene by not only the circumstances (a sinking ship, chances are you could die) but also by the brilliant soundtrack which resembles a clock ticking until the very end. Time is of the essence. Time decides if you die or live. So now that the baseline is established, the viewer is simply thrown in there to see how people deal with this situation which makes the film feel very real and honest. Throughout the film we follow 3 separate, loose plot lines (See, air , land) and watch how they try to survive. It becomes clear that even though these 3 lines tackle the war from very different angles, they cant really escape the war and it affects everyone, whether it may be being in close danger or fearing the danger could be close one day if you don't act now. Everything happening in the immediate foreground is always overshadowed by the key elements of the movie: The lack of time and the need to survive. I guess Nolan described it best when he said its more of a thriller than a war film, because creating tension is the main objective here and the music, acting, directing and cinematography support and emphasize this incredibly well. Overall i would almost wish for Dunkirk to be without dialogue because aesthetically, visually and musically it is just magnificent. The sound is amazing, the lighting and the effects are gorgeous. Hans Zimmer finds the right timing for every tiny instrument, ,let it be loud and overwhelming or quiet and empathetic. Zimmer controls Dunkirk in his very own way. As the film draws to a close the disruption between loud and silent moments increases, this is superbly supported by the cinematography and directing which change the focus according to the events unfolding. The switching between narrow and wide scoping becomes more rapid. What adds the most to the suspense i would say is that the switching between the 3 plot lines becomes more and more rapid as well, until we finally see that they are not as separate as they were before. In my opinion the criticism that it doesn't have a story, main character and no emotional impact doesn't really hold up because not only is that not needed in this film, it also isn't the goal of Dunkirk. This film is very observing, from micro to macro and back to micro. Sure, it delves into the psychological impact of war and the violence it creates, but it doesn't linger. It just pants a picture. As far as negatives go, i think there is some unfounded pathos and stupid dialogue in there that kinda weakens the observing nature of the film, but it certainly is nothing major. The acting is good but nothing special, which it doesn't have to be anyway. I think this could objectively be Nolans best film to date because it doesn't really give you a lot of room for emotional or story related criticism. Instead the scenes are very structured and you can pinpoint to exact moments if you talk about it. After the premise is established, everything happening makes sense. Everything these character do makes sense, nearly everything say say makes sense. The reason why Dunkirk works so well and keeps you on edge might be its short run-time which also makes sense if you look at the artistic decisions behind it. Now i can just thank and congratulate Nolan and everyone involved with Dunkirk for creating such a great movie.
2.0~Made me write my first review mkp1984 Sign in Permalink I love war movies and watched most of them. But this one movie made me write my first review. This movie is a piece of art, art as in something different but not a movie. It's not realistic, nor intelligent and without feelings, just a lot of slow and nice video clips. It could have been so much better. Since i love military movies I went to the cinemas for this one but left the saloon with what i thought was cancer.
5.0~Simply lacks depth and breadth of the event - but a good movie pvasa-70224 Sign in Permalink Nice sound and cinematography (will win academy for both), nice tense beginning. It was a good focused story "At Dunkirk" not "Dunkirk" just don't get that overwhelming feeling of the magnitude of the impending disaster or evacuation/salvation. The title "Dunkirk" implies evacuation of 400,000 poor souls and German tank columns right behind(8 miles away in reality! The German high command is not shown with any conflicts between Luftwaffe, the army and Hitler. Watch it Imax though, nice cinematography.
8.0~Dunkirk is an Intense and Memorable War Movie About Courage Against Insurmountable Odds CANpatbuck3664 Sign in Permalink *Minor Spoilers Ahead* I would normally do a plot summary but the movie Dunkirk is so focused on telling the story of this escape in a unique way that even giving you anything but the bare bones information feels like giving away too much. If you know your history, the evacuation of Dunkirk took place over approximately a week from May 27, 1940- June 4, 1940 where Allied troops (predominately British and French) were forced out onto the beaches of Dunkirk by the German army. With so many soldiers in one place and with the Allies lacking clear evacuation plan, it made them easy targets for the German air force and navy. The lives of over 300,000 soldiers hung in the balance. This movie primarily centres around soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), mariner Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and their heroic efforts in this conflict. A lot of Dunkirk will take your breath away. The best parts of Dunkirk are white-knuckle tense and I found myself breathing heavier and trying to turn away from the screen. The movie envelops you and puts you right in these soldiers' inevitable doom. This movie wants to place you in the middle of the action and they accomplish that on every level. There are scenes of soldiers drowning or being burned alive that are just gut-wrenching. I've seen some war movies feature similar scenes but I think that Dunkirk might have performed them best. There is so much in Dunkirk to be appreciated and Christopher Nolan's commitment to practical effects and filming things in a unique and interesting way are chief among them. The action here is mind-blowing but it feels grounded and that makes it more effective. Nolan could have rested on his laurels and just turned anything out but it feels like he took this story to heart and was committed to bring an understanding to the world of how important this event was in British military history. Dunkirk takes a surprising turn in that there aren't a lot of big name actors despite it being a Christopher Nolan project. That isn't to say the acting is lacklustre, the cast does their job admirably. Instead of relying on the material, they have to let you know through their body language and their expressions. Tom Hardy is his normal excellent self, he can convey more with just his eyes than some actors can in their whole bodies. Mark Rylance also does good work, he's good at being reserved yet he can really get you to feel. Kenneth Branagh also fares well, he's a veteran and he does his job capably. Fionn Whitehead is excellent for a relative newcomer. There are many more actors and I didn't find a weak performance among the cast. I do have some small complaints about the movie. The first is that even though the movie does detail the timelines of the main characters, things can become confusing when the stories interweave with each other. Second, it can be hard to distinguish who lives and who dies because you don't have any personal knowledge about who each actor is playing. The characters blend together at times and there were a couple of emotional deaths that I couldn't figure out who didn't make it until I could determine it from a process of elimination. My biggest complaint is that the beginning and the end of the movie drag a little bit. I feel like that even though this is a fairly short movie, they pad certain things out or the movie falls in love with its cinematography (which as mentioned above is phenomenal) and forgets to tighten things up. I also found the score a little overbearing early in the movie but that concern faded away as the sound editing and the haunting musical choices are excellent at producing horror and nail-biting suspense are great on the whole. If you think about high points and low points, Dunkirk's highs place it an elite category of war movie. The look, the action and the fascinating story can stack up against the best of the best. My low points weren't wrecking the movie for me but it did take me out of it here and there. I'm so glad I got to see Dunkirk on the big screen though, even if I was a couple of weeks late. It's a movie to be seen in the nicest theatre you have around to fully appreciate it. I applaud Christopher Nolan for taking on this story and even though this isn't my favourite movie of the year or even my favourite war movie, it is a valuable piece of cinema in its own right. If you can, I definitely recommend you check it out on the big screen if you can.
6.0~Another boring cliché Hollywood epic war drama. orengross Sign in Permalink The plot was chaotic, fast running, scenes jumped from site to site - I assume the director tried to give the viewers the chaotic atmosphere of war but at the end it was another missed war drama with nothing to remember off. 20 years ago there was order in the plots, as the time of the movie passed the plot progressed, there was actually discussion between the characters, and the players actually played their roll , now days only special effects and occasionally a discussion between the characters with characteristic dull drama chats. No wonder a lot of movie stars moved to the TV industry. The cinema is dead.
5.0~Dunkirk Underwhelms mfredenburg Sign in Permalink Just saw Dunkirk. I am going to go against the flow and say I found it to be mediocre. Did not like many of the directing choices Nolan made. Many of his choices felt contrived and made it hard for me to maintain my willing suspension of disbelief. Kenneth Branagh was in the film, but was heavily underutilized. We never got a feeling for the miracle that was Dunkirk. And we ended up with a surprisingly small film for such a big event. One example: over 800 small boats enabled over 300,000 British soldiers escape, yet we never ever saw that. Consequently, the film completely failed to capture the scale of this event. I suppose Nolan was trying to give a view of Dunkirk from the perspective of a few hapless British soldiers who had a very small / micro view of the war. This particular group, unlike the vast majority of British troops, appeared willing to do anything to get back across the channel with little regard for their fellow soldiers. Ultimately, I just did not find them very believable and I really did not care about them. Likewise, the French's only role was to try to get on the ships. One of main unsympathetic characters was a French soldier who stripped a dead British soldier to so he could pretend to be British in hope of getting across the Channel. The fact that is was the French that fought a fierce rearguard action that gave the British time to effect the rescue was ignored. Scenes that could have been powerful - weren't - because the proper foundation to make them powerful was never laid. In not using CGI to give the viewer the true scope of Dunkirk (using real boats, people, planes and ship would have been cost prohibitive), over 850 ships and over 400,000 troops, was not shown. One would have never guessed the RAF fought hard and deployed hundreds of fighters to combat the bombs raining down on the men waiting on the beaches, flying a total of 3,500 sorties and losing 145 aircraft while the Luftwaffe lost 156. In the movie ships rolled over after getting hit by single bomb and the fact that Naval ships can actually fight back was ignored. In fact an armed civilian ship, a paddle wheeler, actually shot down 3 German airplanes en route to successfully ferrying 7000 soldiers back to England in seven round trips. So in the real Dunkirk larger ships survived multiple attacks from German aircraft and actually shot them down. We get none of that from Nolan. Consequently, he created a distorted and inaccurate view of Dunkirk. I can appreciate artistic license, but Nolan went too far in creating his sparse and tiny Dunkirk. So while I generally like war films, this one underwhelmed me. It was not a bad film, but it was inaccurate and there are many far better war films. On the positive side I did see it in IMAX and some of the scenes were spectacular. The soundtrack was also powerful. If you want to see this film, see it in the theater and see it in IMAX. I do not think it is worth watching on the small screen. We deserve a real film about Dunkirk.
7.0~The film that almost saved 2017 Cinema mikeinator24 Sign in Permalink Listen, Christopher Nolan is a very talented director; most of his movies are good, some are rather great, but only one film he's made has really felt that it had a bow wrapped around it, and that was "The Dark Knight". Dunkirk fell the shortest of this achievement, while still being immaculately beautiful and a tremendous technical accomplishment. This is the biggest film shot on IMAX and 70mm, both, to ever be released. Dunkirk told a painstakingly true story of World War II, in a new way, with very little dialogue (and when there was any it was very plot heavy), little personality in characters, and contained feeble amount of emotional moments. Dunkirk just wasn't what I want out of any film. I appreciate going against conventions, many of my favorite directors and film are know to do that. But still, I seek a more emotional connection than this repetitive, near documentary style war film. It was kinda boring. Character, ethos, and anticipation are what mostly keeps me interested in a film. And for those things to be established, characters usually need to speak about something other than the plot. The cinematography while containing some stunning, and beautiful shots, was in all not overly brilliant. I was a big fan of the close ups, the ultra wides that just look beautiful on large format film!, and a few others scattered throughout. I've seen better dog fights. I served it's purpose. The color grading was amazing however! And the sound was stellar, honestly some of the best gunshot and bomb sounds effects I have ever heard. For all of these things is why this film gets a 7 instead of a 6. But where it counts, in the story, this film just does not fulfill my desires, nor my expectations for Nolan. Like Interstellar, there is still an empty hole in this film, something isn't quite tightly wound. It was a great undertaking of a film, and a new technical frontier for what is possible with large format, still when you compare this to another true story like Titanic, I can surely imagine that there could have been a more emotionally involved way of telling Dunkirk. When side by side, this is one of my least favorite Nolan films, ie. the Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Momento, heck I'm still debating it over Dark Knight Rises.
3.0~Hyped beyond imagination! fizzixmeister Sign in Permalink For all the hype surrounding this movie, it was a dismal disappointment! I don't doubt for a moment that the battle for Dunkirk was grueling and tremendously heart-wrenching, nor do I diminish the sacrifices of those genuinely embroiled in this part of the war. The film lacks real continuity, genuinely embraceable characters, and ethos. In the entire film there were but 4 characters who even warrant the viewers' regard. The artistic panache of Kenneth Brannaugh is wasted in this drawn-out, mishmash of cinematography and monotonous soundtrack by Zimmer! War films, such as "Gettysburg", "We Were Soldiers" and "Pearl Harbor" tell episodes of war better than this celluloid catastrophe. God bless those who sacrificed their lives at Dunkirk. Your memories deserve far better than Nolan's self-aggrandizing "epic".
4.0~Astonishing! nondescriptbox Sign in Permalink The score (and the film) are definitely different and not to some people's taste, but I think that's mainly due to pre-programmed expectations for both film and film scores as defined art forms. I did feel like I was there, if only as an observer. I also cried, especially in the last half. I lived in the U.K. for almost nine years, so maybe that influenced my feelings, but even so, I was both riveted and moved by the cinematography, the direction, and the score! Having said that, I did 'notice' the score a couple of times, so I guess that shouldn't happen--nothing should take you out of the film right? Also (before I went to see it) two friends reported that the movie was 'too loud,' others said the acting wasn't good, they couldn't easily hear the actors speaking, and that there wasn't much of a plot. Again though, I think this could have been the result of having certain pre-formed expectations of mainstream movies in general. On a side note, I saw a YouTube video by Vox called, 'The sound illusion that makes Dunkirk so intense.' It explains something called the Shepard-Rlisset Glissando,' which is what I heard as the reminiscence of the Rolls Royce engines in the English planes. Wow! For me, the sound design and the film may be avant garde, and maybe I wouldn't want these styles in every film I see, but this one will definitely make it into my permanent collection!
4.0~No Characters, No Plot, Disjointed. rakasome Sign in Permalink Viewed 08/04/17 Just left the theater wondering what I just saw. There was NO character development. I did not of cared about them. When a character did speak, they were mumbling or the effects drowned out what they were saying. Time was artsy-fartsy jumping from night to day. Ships that should have been loaded with humans barely had anyone standing on the rail. Large explosions in the water with no smoke. One character says there are 400,000 men trapped. Then a shot of the beach shows maybe 1,000. Maybe. TERRIBLE ending. Brannagh should have laughed this one off. The director/writer is obviously quite full of himself. Dunkirk will show up on "Best Of" lists. What a shame.
1.0~Don't believe the HYPE. This movie is garbage melcraig204 Sign in Permalink After enduring this film I was blown away to discover the critical acclaim for this movie! Not to mention the IMDb user reviews! This movie took me to a whole new level of bland. To take one of the most significant events of World War 2 and turn it into THE most dull and bland cinematic experience of my life. The film was woeful. I have never been so detached from the characters in a film ever. I'm thinking the entire script would be lucky to fill more than a page. Not to mention the action. We have around 400,000 men needing evacuation. But it looked like a couple of thousand. There was no scale. The action was damn stupid from start to finish. Did they hire an expert? Hell no. I'm an ex soldier and that is not how any of that action sounds. Not to mention the cruddy no stakes PG 13 action. Did a main character just die? No idea. The editing was so terrible. And who cares if a character dies. There's no character development. So there's nothing to invest in. What a mess.
10.0~A must see film grah1956 Sign in Permalink I read some reviews that pull certain parts of this film apart, unjustly in my opinion. The Direction of Mr.Nolan was outstanding, the musical score from Hans Zimmer was so very powerful indeed.The length of the movie is only about 109minutes, so quite short to tell the harrowing events of Dunkirk. This is not a dialogue driven movie, but one of powerful scenes and dramatic music. The plot needs no explaining, so I wont. In my opinion this rates as highly as "saving private Ryan"
2.0~Soul-less. Confused. Loud. Disappointing. snk2005 Sign in Permalink Being an avid war film fan, I was beyond excited seeing the trailer for Dunkirk and couldn't wait until it hit theatres. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. By the end of the film, I was actually mad. I have to agree with some of the reviewers here who've stated that many of these glowing reviews are paid for, because what they're describing isn't even the same film. Before the artsy-fartsy daggers come out--no, I don't need tons of backstory to feel invested in the characters. It's war, it's brutal, and I can surmise what it must be like for these brave souls. But when I come out the film and can't remember a single character's name (or worse, even care about them), that's just crap storytelling. Art should inspire a connection. This left me devoid of anything to be honest. Scale...I may as well have been watching a tiny pocket of some soldiers, fighting some war, taking place somewhere. Part of what's so astonishing and inspiring about Dunkirk was its sheer scale. This insipid attempt to condense it to bite-sized POVs is insulting. You would expect at the end when the character (I literally can't remember his name) began reading Churchill's announcement to be roused by emotion. But since the film didn't generate any, and the delivery was so bland, it didn't even click with me what he was reading until I heard, "We shall fight on the beaches." Lastly, a film doesn't have to be linear so I don't mind differing time lines. This however, was like some art-house, "look at how cool I play with time" film school project. I'm sorry...GAWD I'm sorry... but this was bad. I think about 100+ reviews explained why it doesn't work. Storytelling has been used by our species for centuries to share POVs, be morality tales, entertain screaming kids who won't sleep...you get the picture. NONE of that happens if your audience doesn't connect with the story. This was an experiment and indulgence. A $150M indulgence and waste of viewers' time and money. Shame on you.
3.0~Wow- The MetaCritic Score is SO WRONG! Mikef999 Sign in Permalink Why, WHY would anyone WANT to see this movie... it was about the most depressing 1.5hrs I've spent in a long time. After 45min of unrelenting misery, I could hardly wait for it to end. I knew going in that the subject matter was tough, but totally unlike a similar movie in the genre, like Saving Private Ryan, there really wasn't any great acting, heart tugging moments or ANYTHING to cheer about. Particularly annoying about this movie was the score... the constant high pitch sound, meant to evoke tension (?), will give you a headache and it never lets up. The ridiculous back and forth between story lines (and day and night) didn't work for me... and I never felt the empathy toward characters that I probably should have. The ending was SO dragged out... and lifeless. A movie doesn't have to make me "happy" to be entertaining... but sitting through this one felt like punishment. The media critics are idiots... save your money for something else less depressing- like a root canal, maybe?
8.0~People say this movie lack characters and story depth, well it doesn't need one. shailendra-singh435 Sign in Permalink A lot of good movies have come in war genre and it is difficult to generate something new without risking much. But Dunkirk is NOT a risk taken, it is all original and pristine. This is a war movie without too much blood, explosions, and dynamic camera movement. there is no emotional melodrama but the psychological terror that one feel with almost every scene. This movie is something new, a different perspective on the situations of war, you don't need to know the backstories, you don't need to think about the person but you need to think about the situation, experience it. It's the fear, it's the unforeseen and instant enemy that anything can happen anytime. It's when in 3 seconds you feel for relieved soldiers eating bread to trapped underwater in the darkness. You experience it all in the shoes of the soldiers. You are the character, if Nolan had made it like his typical thriller then it would not have been this better, it is intentional and he succeeded in it. "Is he a coward? Mr. Dawson- "No, he is shell shocked." you will never understand what he was into, and you don't need to, you just have to know it. What you see and what you hear is complementary and extraordinarily captivating. The best dog fighting scenes in a movie ever. Film direction and cinematography is wonderful and engaging, but the best part of the movie is its original score by Hans Zimmer. He really nailed it. Next time we will hear a lot about Dunkirk in the 2018 Oscars.
10.0~People expected to see Batman and got disappointed. jaychammer Sign in Permalink After reading so many negative reviews i had to make account just to write this. Every single negative one star review had same complaint about the movie and its "lack of depth,lack of characters background or emotional bond to any of characters". They obviously got prepared to watch totally different movie and got disappointed. This movie is about macro picture not soap drama about characters. This is war, in war everything is confusing, everything happens random and there is no much detail beside what you can see and hear. This movie is authentic,my uncle was in war and he confirmed that he has never had more realistic experience watching a war movie to remind him of war days. I got bonded to characters very much, not on some certain characters , but on soldiers in general. I did care about their life, i did feel emotion towards those people fighting for their lives. I even read there were some people asking for more CGI in their reviews. Guys just go watch some Marvel movie and stay away from movies you cant understand.Thanks.
5.0~ordinary stuff cdcrb Sign in Permalink did you see the trailer? then you've seen the film. there are no surprises of any kind. trapped soldiers in France are rescued by British ships. there is no acting to speak of. not a lot of gore, either. most of the movie is tom hardy gliding around in a plane, which has run out of fuel. when the soldiers are rescued, the film still has another 20 minutes to go. it's all by the numbers. the reviews have been glowing. I guess I saw a different Dunkirk.
3.0~a failed attempt of whatever this was supposed to be Zaffy-1 Sign in Permalink I am not even sure of what I just watched... Was it a series of "vignettes" about the Dunkirk evacuation? Was it a long music video clip with a WWII theme? Was it the prologue of a new WWII video game? all I know is that: -it wasn't realistic -it wasnt well acted -it had poorly written (if at all) characters -it never succeeded to make me feel anything.. nor the war terror, not any sympathy for the heroes (who??) not any agony for the whole evacuation. Nothing, nada, niente. In an a nutshell, I never understood what the Director wanted to say with this movie. I am not even sure what he had in mind.. This film failed to give me anything at all. 3 stars only for the great music.
10.0~This movie was so rich, so detailed and so profoundly moving that it's hard to put it into words. Christopher Nolan is back and he's here to show us what a master can create. uhsheen Sign in Permalink This review will be mostly spoiler free but I don't want to be banned so I clicked it just to be safe.. The basic plot revolves around the 450,000 odd British soldiers trapped in Dunkirk, France as the German troops close in. They don't close in on foot though, instead opting to pick the trapped soldiers off from the air and sea. This movie isn't a propaganda piece touting the glory of British resilience; most of the movie is just young men trying to survive, petrified for their own lives. The threat is ever present, there was a wonderful sense of tension throughout the entire movie. You really felt the cinema shake as the German planes closed in on the soldiers and let loose their bombs and you can feel the thick fog of fear. The enemy in this movie is very interesting because you never actually see a German face. The enemy is just a looming threat and comes in the shape of torpedo attacks and bombs from planes. I read that Nolan spent a lot of time studying silent films and how they built tension which is pulled off masterfully in this movie. Like the movie Gravity once this movie begins there is no down time, they are constantly being attacked in one way or another. The casting for this movie was absolutely superb. Our very own Barry Keoghan had a short role that I would liked to have seen fleshed out more but he pulled it off very well. Cillian Murphy was wonderful as always and played the role of a shell shocked soldier. Mark Rylance stole the show for me and put on a stellar performance as the father who is doing his duty to his country. His bravery never fades. Fionn Whitehead and Aneurin Barnard were excellent choices and I liked how Nolan chose largely unknown and inexperienced actors to mimic how young and inexperienced the soldiers really were during the war. When I heard that Harry Styles was in this movie I figured that it was just a clever ploy to pull in more ticket sales but I absolutely stand corrected. He put on an authentic, honest performance that was very impressive. There's a great scene in a boat where you see how he is affected by desperation and sheer terror that really sold it for me, his performance was extremely consistent. Tom Hardy is a chameleon... Any role he plays he is completely dedicated and immersed and you can't peel your eyes away from him. He has some of the most nail biting scenes and his scenes toward the end of the movie were very emotional and moving. Strangely enough some parts of the movie felt like watching old WW2 footage; it was grainy and real. This movie didn't rely on CGI, it was gritty and honest and beautifully shot. You really can't talk about a Christopher Nolan without talking about Hans Zimmer and the soundtrack. There were some scenes that were reminiscent of the docking scene in Interstellar because the music flowed so well with each scene that it evoked a sense of urgency and intensity. This is a phenomenal soundtrack. The movie starts to a ticking clock and it's only a matter of time until time runs out. There is very little dialogue in this movie but it isn't missed at all. This movie is an emotional power horse. I was genuinely moved a couple of times throughout it and it's one that will stay in my head for a long time. THE GOOD: Casting was perfect, the lesser known actors held their own weight against some of the veterans. The cinematography was fantastic, you really felt completely immersed in the movie. Hans Zimmer's score was Oscar-worthy. The movie will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout. THE BAD: The story line is not always linear which was confusing. Dialogue was sometimes hard to hear (but not necessary) _______ Dunkirk is a fantastic movie, it's as simple as that. This should be the standard of movie that other directors should attain to achieve and here Nolan proves that he is one of the greatest directors of all time. The acting is superb and the entire movie is a treat for the eyes and ears. Don't miss out on seeing this in a cinema.
4.0~This movie totally left me feeling Nothing! dcstar-54315 Sign in Permalink Ok I'm probably the one of the biggest Nolan Fans. All his previous movies were breathtaking and amazing. This movie however, cinematography was ok. But loud music then complete silence then again same thing. Long cuts. This movie made me bored in middle and i had to see it in skips. I know Nolan and team tried but it just didn't work for me. Just nothing i feel after watching this. Can't recommend. There are many war movies lot better than this.
4.0~Take me out of this beach as soon as possible... Emmet_L_Brown Sign in Permalink I was waiting for this film with great anticipation since it was announced many months ago. WWII films are one of my favorites genres, and with that, I am talking about classics like The Guns Of Navarone, The Eagle Has Landed, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Keeping that in mind, I must say that I left the theatre utterly disappointed, not only with the shallow narrative of a major WWII event but, with the way Chris Nolan decided to tell his story. ** SPOILERS AHEAD ** The three point of view storytelling is somewhat confusing, first because it is not so obvious what Nolan is trying to do, it takes a while to notice the dynamics, and, the always present continuity errors (gross sometimes) do not help either. I am not attached to traditional storytelling, and most of the films I like had some kind of alternate scripts, but for my liking, it went a bit too far with Dunkirk. Another major flaw is the shallowness of the story, all the characters are almost like supporting characters, with no lead or at least one or two characters you feel empathy for. Maybe Noland made the "lead character" the event itself, but it is not depicted with depth or detail (I will not mention historical accuracy) it deserves either. The icing on the cake was, in both positive and negative senses (caveat: I am an aviation enthusiast and work as an airline pilot), the air combat scenes. Impressive work and kudos for Nolan for not using only CGI, always a pleasure to see, and hear, some Spitfire/RR Merlin in action. The air combat sequences were, indeed, the highlight for me. But also a major disappointment, as ** MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD ** the final sequences practically disregarded all the laws of aerodynamics and energy management known to men (back then and today). Planes can not fly forever, do air combat maneuvering and then fly sustained and prolonged level flight without an engine running. Period. 4/10
2.0~I just didn't get it cristea1 Sign in Permalink My WW2 knowledge is very limited and i never heard of Dunkirk before this movie. I still don't know much about it, it seems it's a town or some place, where a WW2 battle took place. And i guarantee that the vast majority of people don't know much about it either, so, you basically have to know the plot of the movie before watching the movie. Because you won't get it from the film. It's just a bunch of guys that don't talk much and try to run the whole movie from an invisible enemy. Oh, and a plane pilot that shoots other planes, although that was confusing, i wasn't sure if there was just a pilot we were following, or more that looked similar. Even during the battle i could not understand if he was shooting the other planes or the others were shooting him. Everything was a mess. I don't expect everyone to hate this movie, but i know a lot of people were just as confused as i was which makes me very intrigued by the high ratings it received.
7.0~A visual masterpiece, but lacks humanity. marshalllarsen Sign in Permalink Dunkirk was a great movie, and a great war movie, but I don't think it was one of The Great War Movies. The cinematography and the action were incredible, but it didn't have the emotional heft of something like Saving Private Ryan, The Hurt Locker, or Apocalypse Now. Dunkirk was fast paced and incredible tense, but the quick editing robbed the film of any moments to breathe and for characters to interact or form. That isn't to say that the editing was bad. On the contrary, it was a fresh take on a traditional WWII setting. But I never knew any of the characters. I didn't care what happened to them. I felt like I was watching pieces in a bombastic game of chess instead of a real human struggle. Besides mild stress and pure awe at some of the set-piece moments, I didn't feel much of anything. Overall, I'd say the movie is a masterpiece in the sense of what can be put on film, and I'd absolutely recommend that you see it in IMAX. It's a visual treat! But I do not think it has the staying power of other, more human war films.
1.0~Cartoonish flim-flam! stewart-01051 Sign in Permalink I am not going to write hundreds of words describing the almost infinite number of flaws in this movie as others have said it all very eloquently. If directors want to make a cartoon version of an event then surely they should have the guts to tell us it is a cartoon? This movie is about an historical event called 'Dunkirk' and any person with an iota of knowledge about that seminal event in British history would expect to see a story that closely approximates that event. This is not that story!
1.0~Huge disappointment FinViewer Sign in Permalink I found reading the Wikipedia article of Dunkirk evacuation to be more rewarding than watching this movie. I get the point: this movie is supposed to be distressing, but shouldn't the anxiety come from the emotions of the characters, not from bad film making? Now that the plotline could have been presented in five minutes and there are no characters in this movie, what are we supposed to watch here?
5.0~Bit of a letdown andrew-york80 Sign in Permalink I was expecting a lot from this film based on the reviews but walked away puzzled and disappointed. Where, for example, was the amazing score that people had mentioned, I knew there wasn't much dialogue, but where was the acting to compensate? Anyway reviews are in the eye of the beholder but to me this simply wasn't a great film for me, and insulting to the troops who were largely portrayed as selfish cowards.
5.0~Disappointing fivesticks Sign in Permalink My wife and I both came away from this film very disappointed. The great critical acclaim did indeed elevate our expectations but the movie just had no depth to it. There were no plot twists, no character development, and there was an incessant dramatic music score throughout the entire movie. It's like hearing the Jaws music for two hours. It simply lost all effect. Kenneth Branagh is the postcard for the overacting, pompous British thespian and he stands on a dock for the entirety of the movie in a Captain Crunch uniform filling the role to a "T". A good amount of other cheese was layered throughout the movie. The movie was bereft of heroism save for Tom Hardy's character and a few other spots. It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not a great movie. Certainly not one you would go back and watch again.
9.0~A brilliant experience of a horrible episode avik-kumar-si Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a beautiful film, and an exceptional one. It's not entertainment in the usual sense. It's an immersive experience. Like any war film worth its salt, Dunkirk is, at its core, an anti-war film that harps upon the horrors of war and its futility. As you watch men stranded on beaches, trapped in a boat awaiting to be killed, the pointless nature of war strikes you. Dunkirk shows you men trapped in a no-win situation, with a haunting background score by Hans Zimmer conveying the constant fear. If you think the constant bombardment of the score was an overkill, you are getting closer to imagining the plight of the men stranded on the beach, in the ships at Dunkirk. In Dunkirk, Nolan parodies war, where old civilians are the only hope for young soldiers. Where small boats provide relief when the big, bad ships are easy prey. Dunkirk featured the best dogfight scenes I have ever watched. The cockpit-view shots of a Spitfire chasing an enemy craft with the endless sea beneath you and the skies above meeting at horizon (which, ironically, you are in no position to savour) are wretchedly beautiful, painfully tense. This film's very different from most of Christopher Nolan's earlier works, with a scarce screenplay, no major twists and an end you know. But Nolan's innovative non-linear storytelling breathes life into this tale, which he then teases out of you with the tremendous sights and sounds of a horrible episode from human history. Congratulations Nolan, for once again bucking the conventions and leaving your signature in a new genre!
6.0~Lacks an emotional core Prismark10 Sign in Permalink In Mrs Miniver the film had a propaganda even jingoistic elements that inhabited its story and characters. Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece but the story lacks an emotional core despite having excellent actors such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance. At one point I thought where is Hardy? The film is set in a nonlinear fashion and unlike Saving Private Ryan, director Christopher Nolan has eschewed blood and gore. Set in 1940 thousands of Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk waiting to be picked up and sailed back to Britain. We focus on Tommy, a young soldier who has survived a German ambush. He meets another young soldier called Gibson on the beach, who is burying a dead body and says little. They try to make their way onto a ship by acting as stretcher bearers and taking a wounded man aboard a hospital ship. We see these two young men just wanting to survive and each time they meet with some unforeseen event. Dunkirk shows the evacuation from land, sea, and air. Rylance plays a small boat fisherman who along with his son and another young boy are sailing to Dunkirk to pick up survivors. They have already picked one up along the way who is heavily shell shocked. Yet his story is hampered by an appalling side plot of a young man injured and wanting his old school to know that he did something important. As the film has little dialogue, Nolan wants to create atmosphere and suspense through its visuals and music. In that sense it only partly succeeds because the film lacks dramatic impact.
1.0~RIP to my great grandfather. oncheoncheoncheblablabla Sign in Permalink My great-grandfather who was 40 years old at the time died on the beach on Dunkerque. I have yet to watch this film but considering it's made by British and Americans I doubt it will be accurate historically and also I have read journalists reviews saying France was totally removed from this story. Well, 1/10 until I see it and/or change my mind.
5.0~On the beach Lejink Sign in Permalink In which Christopher Nolan attempts to do a Spielberg in widening his palette to take in a major war-themed movie a la "Schindler". Does he succeed, well, I don't think so. Nolan has spoken about the unusual construction of his film, taking three stories on the day, one being two young soldiers' desperate attempt to escape the carnage on the beach over the course of a week, the RAF pilots attempting to protect the air-space over the Channel within one hour and the crew of a small private boat in one day making their own way to try to help relieve the situation and then sort of sort of slow / fast forwards them all on from there, cutting from one to the next in triangular order, from start to finish. These switches, I have to say, I grew almost irritated at by the end, to the point of anticipating them even at key dramatic points in the story. I guess his big idea was that rather than attempt a massive-scale over-arching narrative of the events at Dunkirk, he attempts to tell the tale with just these three microcosms and infuse them with the different human traits at play in such a desperate situation. Thus we see the young soldiers on the run from the start displaying fear, selfishness, ingenuity but yes, even cowardice as they try anything to get aboard a leaving ship, only to end up threatened with drowning in an abandoned boat they'd hoped to commandeer and use to get to safety. With the pilots, we witness calmness, bravery, loyalty, flying skills and ultimately self-sacrifice as they fight overwhelming odds in the air while in the rescuing private boat, again we see endeavour, courage and compassion as the crew of one middle aged man and two young boys attempts to make a difference by saving as many as they can. Was this approach the best way to convey the big picture here...I'm not convinced it was. Some of the incidents seemed contrived and at odds with the realism sought for elsewhere, especially the incidents of the young cabin boy on the small cruiser and the French soldier who ends up with a bunch of hardly heroic British soldiers under deck, trying to escape drowning. Sure, the depiction of the terrible ordeals they each went through is realistically portrayed, on water, land and sea, but ultimately it lacks the realism of say "Saving Private Ryan", (sacrificed obviously for the 12a classification to no doubt ensure younger viewers could get to see it), so there's no blood or bits of bodies as you would otherwise expect. I'm not sure I saw even one German in the whole movie. There's very little dialogue either so there wasn't much room for acting skills to shine other than by reacting mostly with British pluck to events, which actors like Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance can do all day while Tom Hardy is confined almost exclusively to the cockpit of his Spitfire. The best I can say about pop star Harry Styles' acting debut was that I didn't even notice him until my wife pointed him out to me in a scene right at the end. Commendably, Nolan keeps his film to a 105 minute duration when it would have been easy to bloat it to double that length, but in the end, I didn't feel at any stage that I was actually witnessing real events, always that I was watching a movie, which for me, as I say, makes it ultimately a failure. The miracle of Dunkirk was that 300000 got home safely under insuperable odds, whereas here it seemed as if barely 300 made it. Mr Nolan should turn his telescope around.
10.0~This movie is not really a movie, it is art, and this review will treat it as such. peder-66515 Sign in Permalink First of all this movie is not really an entertainment product. Therefore what you know about film is now invalid. In order to truly understand this film you must expect it to be nothing like a movie you know. If you do not, you will not be able to see this film for what it really is, let go of prejudice and comparisons, because they don't apply. Step 2: Due to cultural heritage of movies, letting go can be tricky, especially if you are a younger viewer, whose knowledge about movies is based on the MCU. This is because of dialogue and especially the kind of dialogue you are used to in movies where people die and baddies are really powerful. You will not find any dialogue to paint the background of any character. It is widely understood that a character must be specially known in order to care about him or her. However, there is no point in making a flat generic cliché story to really understand that this character is really important, if you actually don't have unimportant people to begin with. Caring about a few people out of 400000 is actually if you think about it a little messed up. We humans are equally important when it comes to our lives. Usually promoting one soldier in a war movie and defining bad people is done through cannon fodder stand ins and mass murder on gigantic scale, or just crucifying key people. However, if you see things from a more sane perspective, all lives matter, and if you were one of them you might find that desperation makes you think about yourself as more important. Once you find something different that is then a reason why. If 400000 soldiers are desperate, and one need to go for the pack to survive what would you do were you one of them? Step 3 - watch the movie: There are no soap opera scenes, you will experience that bullets are terrifying. But most importantly look not to dialogue but to actions and situation to understand what is going on, where do they look what are their motives behind this and that action, and finally listen to the environment. They say that an image says more than a thousand words, or as Batman would put it: It's not who I am underneath, but my actions that defines me. This is a movie where you are meant to feel and observe the full experience. Because this war movie is as real as they get. Forget about faces and look at them as anyone even yourself, understand that who Harry Styles and Tom Hardy are really don't matter. The point is exactly that you shouldn't be able to tell, as they are not meant to be important, they are all just people fighting for their lives. England already lost the battle, they need their soldiers home if they are to not lose the war too! Each soldier want to be the one who survives, thus important characters ruins the plot; anarchy. This movie is really a window into the past, and one which quite accurately actually show what happened. Which is truly astonishing and terrifying. Before concluding, we must understand that time in this movie plays a central part, as the noose tightens, so does the 3 time-lines, which get more and more intertwined, this means more and more cuts, because each time line has a different time span. These cuts are made with care and the music gets more and more intense as we go, it really is something you won't appreciate fully until you have left the cinema! This movie also looks beautiful, but it has to be authentic if you are to believe you are there. It is very rare I sit in a cinema and actually get physically engaged, I don't really recall that happening, not even with cheap jump scares. This movie is psychologically really heavy on a subconscious level, and you really should think about pg-13 if your children are not mentally strong, but it takes an intelligent and adult mind to also truly grasp the horrors fully, war crimes are being committed and they are not imprinted in your subconscious disbelief that these things actually happened in real life, but the true horror is that they did. Acknowledging the care and effort the director put in this movie is the only fair thing to do... you may not like what you see for entertainment, but that's not really the point either! This is art, a TRUE master piece. This is something else, which is what in my eyes is the best movie ever made, outstanding and incomparable. It is like saying that Mona Lisa is better than the statue of David, it doesn't really make sense. You may like the painting more than the statue, but that doesn't mean that the statue is better. What makes this movie better than any other movie to me, is that the director cared and broke all rules, because he followed his own. This movie might not be for you, but if people don't feel connected to the horrors of this movie, they simply didn't know how to appreciate it. Thus the two opinions on this movie are those who didn't get the point and people who don't like what it is, and then those who loved it and can appreciate it for what it is, however there are most definitely those who think any movie by Christopher Nolan is a master piece, and I don't think they are honest to them selves. Dunkirk is a master piece, and thus by definition and its own rules it can only be 10/10... but a thing of which there are only one, it's both the best and the worst. Thanks for reading.
9.0~Nolan's new Masterpiece to behold IngJane Sign in Permalink Dunkirk or also known as Dunkerque is a true-story of teamwork, heroism and humanity which took place during the World War II. British soldiers are surrounded on all sides by Germans as are French soldiers. The film focuses mainly on British soldiers, and the presence of French soldiers as war- allies is addressed as well. Before watching it, I already was super-hyped for it, it was after all my most anticipated film of the year along with Call Me by Your Name, and Oh My God, it did not disappoint. What an incredible movie, it is not just my favorite movie of 2017 by far so far, but also my favorite Nolan film. Nolan's new masterpiece, instant-classic, film-treasure or whatever one wants to address it like, is an incredible achievement not just only for directing, but most of all an achievement for technical aspects of cinema. Every sound detail, the score (I'll get to that later), cinematography, editing, sound editing and of course the directing by one and only Christopher Nolan were perfection to witness. I don't know if Dunkirk will win Best Picture but Nolan will win the Best Director Oscar, I wasn't this impressed by directors work this decade, not even by Birdman, Gravity, The Revenant, La La Land and they all won Best Director. The story, the story is real, it happened. Would you believe it could've happened if it wasn't a proved true story, would you think it can only be fiction? Probably not. Just try to imagine it: Dunkirk a Film by Christopher Nolan When 400,000 soldiers couldn't get home; Home came for them. And after you watched the movie. Two scenes in particular were so scary to imagine being real but how many soldiers died that way in WWII? Countless. And also there is character development and you really feel for them, especially George, Peter and Mr. Dawson, but still none of the characters are going to be iconic like Oscar Schindler is, because, again the story doesn't center around one, ultimate hero. So many things I love about the film, the only criticism of the movie was that there's no character development. It was so smart of Nolan to not give one of the characters a girlfriend he loves so much and he probably knows he will never see her again but he has to serve his country. The film starts at the event, the evacuation at the mole took a whole week, it took civilians one day to come to Dunkirk and the air force fought for an hour. Why adding an irreverent story for just one character when the whole point of Dunkirk wasn't just about one person? I did like every performance by every actor, it doesn't have a lead character as all of those soldiers that got saved, the civilians that helped, and the air-force were all heroes; Churchill too. The three actors I think are really stand-outs for me at least are Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, but of course, everyone does a great job. Mark Rylance is the only Oscar winning actor in the movie, and although he won the Oscar for being quiet he proves those who thought he didn't show anything besides a quiet character, well he can yell. And Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy are such a professionals. Tom's just great in everything and he owns every scene he's in, and Cillian is one of the most underrated actors of today. And I saved my favorite part for last: Hans freaking Zimmer's score is eye-opening, the best score he's ever done by far and Supermarine is one of the best pieces of music ever. While I was going home, I still felt like I heard the music, every sound I heard I tried to make Supermarine of it, and I still feel like I hear it. An unforgettable experience.
3.0~very disappointing pepe4u22 Sign in Permalink heard the buzz for this movie and just was so disappointed. the movie starts not even referring to the Germans or Nazis but called them the enemy oh my goodness sanitizing of history strike one. I watched and was shaking head on the continuity as one scene would have night and then go to day and the strange pacing for the tom hardy character as one scene is battling the Germans on limited gas and an hour later he is still flying and lands what the heck. plus this is a war zone but the horrors of fighting also are sanitized with pc sanctimony I was bored watching as one never can feel a connection with the characters which is something I noticed in the wonderful era of war movies of the 1960's as in that period all major actors seemed to be in the military which gave a certain gravitis to their performances in this movie all performances are hollow and unengaging.
3.0~Boring alexmackey-80976 Sign in Permalink If you need to use the restroom in the middle of the movie, just go. You're not gonna miss anything.
10.0~Great war movie brynnharms Sign in Permalink I have never given a ten on any movie...until now. This movie moved fast, and was intense from the very beginning. Nolan does a great job with several viewpoints being woven together. There isn't time spent on deep character development, and some won't like this. The hero of this story is the action...and there is a ton of that. The visuals are stunning. If you want to be entertained on the edge of your seat, and you are tired of 2+ hour investments, this is your movie.
1.0~broken eardrums mhs-99042 Sign in Permalink 30 minutes into the movie I poked my eardrums out with a fork. The movie sounded better after that.
7.0~An academic movie for sure but a good movie? remakesramistake Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a fine director. I really like his directing skills and his smart ways to tell a story. "Interstellar" and "inception" are both two of my favorite movies and I'm also fun of his older films like "Memento". So I was really excited when his newest film "Dunkirk" came out in the cinemas. The movie had really good commercial releases and is also consisted of a really strong cast. So the results were expected at least for me to be phenomenal. Did that happen? In a way yes but I have to say that I ended up really dissapointed by the film in the end. Don't get me wrong the film is amazing in some parts. In fact its technical aspect is excellent in every form. Nolan manages to create an amazing atmosphere. The viewer is feels like he is witnessing the events of operation Dunkirk at first hand. Hoytema's amazing cinematography is captivating and makes you fell claustrophobic even though most of this movies events are taking place in outer regions. And of course Nolan's genius directing does an excellent job telling us the events from three different aspects of the operation; land, seas and air. But then what is the problem with this movie? Mainly its the story. The movie lacks plot. Sure it tells about the events that took place at the operation but apart from that we don't see something amazing from the part of the characters. The directing feels detached from the story element and gives the feeling of a more docimanteristing aspect. But this movie is not a documentary. And when you are done admiring the technical aspects of the movie and you start emphasizing on the story element things are starting to collapse a little bit. The movie is filled with plot holes (like Tom Hardy's choice in the closure) or with some elements of Nolan's references to previews of his movies that doesn't give justice to this film (like Cillian Murphy's character who is introduced to us standing like Batman in the peak of a sinking ship). Overall, Nolan's movie is an academic movie. It should be teached in film schools as how to make a beautiful film. But it's not a masterpiece and surely not HIS masterpiece. And also is a movie made only for a cinema screen. Seeing this movie anywhere else will make the movie loose it's artistic touch.
1.0~Dunkirk – I want my money back! steve-3629 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk – I want my money back! No back story. No character development. Almost no dialogue. Film makes no effort in getting you to care about these characters. Besides knowing your history, you really don't have any reason to love the good guys or hate the bad guys. There is a constant ticking sound that plays like a time bomb about to go off. Like in many movies the last 10 seconds. Except here, it played for what seemed like 25 minutes straight. I began to wonder if I'd have been better off being one of the extra's that got killed off in the opening scenes. I'm sure this will be hailed as some sort of masterpiece for its visual and sounds which aren't bad save for the stupid ticking time bomb. But the music is so over down. The impending doom that we know from a Jaws movie or any horror flick is constant throughout most of the film. Done to such a point you begin to question if there is going to be an actual story here or are we just going to witness a battle more in a documentary fashion. This reminded me of the first half of 2001 a space odyssey. No story. More of an opera than a movie. But at least 2001 started to tell a story of actual characters. This is totally for the artsy fartsy type. They should add a new rating for this type of movie. Rated AFB. Artsy Fartsy B!@#$#it. I hated it. A waste of time and I want my money back. I'm sure it'll win the Oscar for Best Picture as it's totally made for those AFB types that vote on who wins. Normal everyday people should avoid. You'll hate it.
10.0~One of, if not the best Nolan films yet brodyreyno Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is more than a simple summer blockbuster. It is a thriller with masterful directing, execution, and music. It is a work of art. Let's start with the practical effects. There isn't any CGI used in the film. All the planes, boats, and explosions are real. It adds to the authenticity. Hearing the Stukas as they bombed the troops on the beach was terrifying and made you wonder what exactly it felt like to be on the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940. The spitfires and ME109 German fighters were amazing too. The Stukas are never seen from an aerial view as well, just from ground, really selling the dread and fear people felt when they heard its infamous whine as it swooped down. That was captured perfectly in this movie. The aerial combat looks very good, and is done with real planes. It is amazing. There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film and there isn't a central character to develop. That may be a bad thing to some, but I don't mind it. It is telling the story of the battle rather than a person's story during the battle, and I like that. All three phases of the battle, air, seas, and land are shown and three different groups of characters are portrayed. It does a great job jumping from phase to phase. This movie looks incredible. The sets are all practical, the explosions are real, and the performances are great. Hans Zimmer made a great score that builds intensity, adding a ticking clock to the pieces to build suspense. This movie is suspenseful and a thriller meant to show the terrors of war, rather than the horrors (not the same thing). Every moment had me on the edge of my seat. It was intense. The film is only one hour and forty seven minutes, which is quite short for a Nolan film, but it feels longer because of the constant action and suspense. Dunkirk should be considered for movie of the year. It is one of Nolan's best films. He can do no wrong it seems. 10/10
1.0~Twisted and completely unshocking. Terrible Film. ed-1975 Sign in Permalink Within minutes I realized what a terrible mistake I made made going to watch this film. It seemed liked a sub-par TV series with no atmosphere and wooden props. So many mistakes. Spitfire running out of fuel and then managing to down a Stuka bomber and then fly past Kenneth Branagh (you could even predict this moment seconds before it was that trite). Talking about poor old Kenneth spent most of the film wandering up and down a pier... nice work if you can get it! Stukas bombing soldiers who remarkably all stayed in one piece after being hit. In reality many of them would have been in seriously bad shape and not many would have been in one piece. The horror would be unimaginable... may be this was for the certificate but it was just so unrealistic. Spitfire canopy stuck... oh yes.. it had to happen didn't it! It's like in plot development somebody came up with that bright idea (not)... entirely predictable. Characters were so wooden that no sympathy was allowed to develop. And Germans bombing clearly marked hospital ships. I find that piece of revisionist history sickening. Even the Luftwaffe would have court martialled and hung any such offender. A terrible film.
1.0~AAA+ movie turned broing network-3 Sign in Permalink Seldom have I seen AAA+ movies turn so boring, so fast. The story is not Dunkirk and the musik it meant to keep people on the egde, but again fails so badly at that. Left the movies with a feeling that I just wasted 2 hours of my life. Please just pas this movie by, as it is a waste of time.
4.0~Missing a story and its historical mystery dforster Sign in Permalink I so looked forward to seeing Dunkirk but sadly I concur with the negative reviews. I feel I must add my voice to counter the majority. I want to add the following in addition to my main objection - the overblown incessant sound really hurt and prevented me from appreciating any of its parts. The story of Dunkirk - how it came about and its evacuation are fascinating and historically intriguing but sadly none of this was brought out. Dunkirk did not provide context to the battle as it unfolded even confusing what little story there was with oddball editing, e.g., day and night times bounced around. Dunkirk had a chance to explore why the Germans did not attack to fully destroy/capture the allied troops which by all accounts they could have fairly easily done. There was one reference in the movie when it was mentioned almost in passing that the the German tanks simply stopped their forward motion but nothing was said about why or even wonder why. I have read of possible reasons concerning Hitler's order not to destroy the expeditionary forces but now with the perspective of over 70 years this should have been included as the key missing piece of this story. I gave Dunkirk a rating of 4 instead of 1 because of its visual production value but I am being generous.
1.0~HORRIBLE MOVIE! hollingj-31582 Sign in Permalink Could not have been done any worse. No story lines and very, very, boring. You keep waiting for something to happen other than some explosions and shooting. Then there's no ending, the thing just stops (mercifully). Don't waste your time
1.0~Hated it! lesvp Sign in Permalink There is no context, so if you don't know the history, it's rather pointless. A lot of suffering by people you don't get to know or care about. And probably the most obnoxious soundtrack ever created. It's a relentless ticking and pounding throughout the entire movie, making what little dialog there is harder to understand (which is par for the course with newer movies). And the theater (screening room) I was in had it so loud I covered my ears the whole time so as to not damage my hearing. Of course, it's technically proficient. But most movies are. We've advanced technically while story telling has gone downhill. I'd have walked out had I not taken a friend. I guess it's okay for video-game mentality: action with no purpose. But if you're looking for an engaging story or insightful history, you won't find it here. And, though I didn't live in that era, the behaviors seem inconsistent (selfish) with the documentaries, veteran interviews, and films about WWII I've seen.
5.0~stopped watching walked out ela-42975 Sign in Permalink Maybe I missed a good movie. But as an old soldier, I didn't want to watch anymore after the Nazis put nearly fifty rounds into that Frenchman and the British soldiers didn't retaliate. The British officer had an automatic weapon and could have easily killed every Nazi standing in a row and out in the open. The British were in a building which provided cover from return fire. You shoot the officer first then whoever remains. Maybe rules of war have changed but there is a reason officers in battle don't have their rank on their helmets. You shoot them first. I think now after all the reviews that I have read that Maybe I should have stayed. Like I said maybe I missed a good movie.
2.0~This Year's 'There Will Be Blood' . . . .Spoilers fdbjr Sign in Permalink . . . . referring to another critic's darling that was actually a very, very bad movie. This picture is even more badly miscalculated than 'Interstellar', which is saying something. Historically, Dunkirk was a logistic miracle, in which a disorganized flotilla of amateur yachtsman managed to spirit off 300,000 plus British soldiers, trapped by Nazi forces. Now, if you want to do a micro story, fine. But you do have to put in scale. Instead, we have these meandering lines of soldiers on the beach, fewer numbers than in some cineplexes. We see nothing of the flotilla until 90% of the movie is gone, and even then it's a throwaway. The bulk of the movie is spent on a single ship, a single Spitfire, and a couple of rather unlikable soldiers looking for a way home. It took me quite a while to realize that the stories were not in sync, that I was looking at several different time frames. How clever! What totally unnecessary complexity! This might STILL have worked,except that Nolan does not bother with any more than the barest exposition of the characters. So instead of seeing the Grand Evacuation, we see the struggles of several ciphers, completely out of context. Add to that an ear-splitting, incomprehensible score, and you have - not a disaster movie - but a disaster.
9.0~To Put It Short and Sweet -- Go See Dunkirk on the Biggest Screen You Can Find cyifly-2 Sign in Permalink If you love war movies, Dunkirk is surely one not to be missed. It's quite likely going to be an instant classic in the ranks of Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and - most recently - Hacksaw Ridge. It will loose something if you try to watch it at home, no matter the quality of your home system. It's one of those films that really needs the big screen -- the bigger the better -- and best sound system you can find. With that said, the movie does have some flaws. Most of which I will give a pass and write it off as "artistic," and Christopher Nolan has earned that right. As I discuss the flaws, please understand that I really enjoyed the movie and strongly recommend it. Most of it was very well done. If I was to be petty and pick out what I think some others might not like, I would say most movies have a heavier, more distinctive plot. A beginning, introducing and developing the characters and setting up the plot; a middle, setting up the conflict the main characters will spend the movie solving; an end, where the main characters solve the conflict. If you need such a movie, then Dunkirk may not be for you, because the plot was not that clear. This was more like showing the audience an event than telling them a story -- An event that was hard, yet entertaining, to watch. The movie does have characters and somewhat of a plot, but they are not distinctive nor defined. The characters kind of run together and the plot is a bit unclear. The same scene unfolds slowly from three different points of view. From the view of an infantry group -- who are all basically the same height and build, same haircut and hair color, same uniform and mission. This is why they are difficult to tell apart when they are all running from some sort of peril during their screen time. Another points of view come from characters on a small boat and again in small planes and their characters are more distinctive, but never really developed either, because the plot is not really defined. Everyone just wants to survive and spends the whole movie trying to do so. And that is the basic plot -- Survival. Everyone is trying to survive this long war scene. The whole movie takes place in, what seems like, one afternoon. But, somehow, that plot works. It was obviously not written or directed to be a typical story in a typical movie. It's the same tense war scene shot from the perspective of three different groups of people, with no single, distinctive, main character, plot or point... And it worked perfectly. The scenes are shot so beautifully, that when you are with the infantry group, you feel like you were down in the dirt with them and want to dodging bullets. When the perspective would change, you got to see the same scene again, but from the air and the pilots' point of view and it felt like you were sitting in the tiny plane with them. When you watched the same scene from the boat crew's point of view, you could almost feel the boat shaking and the smell the sea salt. The shots are exquisite and details are fully thought out. You can hear the sand falling around your head, the gun chambers rattling the airplane and it seems you can reach below and touch the white caps of the ocean. The only real flaw for me was the story was not clearly set up. Unless you had prior knowledge of Dunkirk and it's history, you would have to have an explanation. I'll give a short explanation with no movie spoilers: The English went to help the French when Germany invaded during WWII. Germany was too strong and not only pushed the French to the coast, but the English right along with them. The Germans changed their strategy from fighting the French/English by shooting one bullet at a time to coming in from the sea with planes and bombing the troops at the beach, on piers and on boats -- intending to kill many more in one attempt, in hopes that they didn't go back to England and regroup. The movie quickly moves to the beach in the beginning and you or only given a quick blip of how they all really got there. For that, I gave it 9 out of 10. That is not giving away the movie -- There is so much more to this. The direction is great, the acting was on par and the special effects were seamless. If you are not a war movie fan, this will not change your mind, but Dunkirk will likely be around come awards season, and rightfully so.
1.0~Overrated paul-96952 Sign in Permalink Not to belittle the topic of the film but it really is overrated and dull....
1.0~This movie is terrible. Am I in the matrix????? pearla-02149 Sign in Permalink Where do I start. I suppose it's that I feel compelled to write my first ever review. This is an abomination of a "film". From the horrific score to the lack of character. From the ear splitting sound design to way he tried to "Nolan" the chronology. From the dull screen play to the lack of any act structure it's a boring, aggravating mess. How is this getting such good reviews. I can only think that everyone, as I did, expected it to be another Nolan masterpiece!!!??? I've never wanted to leave a cinema more and I was forced to sit through the ungodly mess that was Transformers 5 last week.
1.0~Watch this if you want to get really bored and annoyed lazre-form Sign in Permalink This is a war related movie which plot is that everything goes wrong in the air, at sea and on the ground. The movie is as boring as watching the grass grow. To cover up the boredom of the movie they have hired the master composer Hans Zimmer. The problem is that that Hans has accidentally composed the "thrilling" soundtrack for a completely wrong movie. The music mainly consists of "thrilling" buzzing noise made with synthesizer and also of tick-tock sound of a stopwatch which stops few times during the movie just for the reason that it can start again in a minute. The soundtrack just doesn't fit for this movie at all. Only thing I liked in this movie was the Spitfire plane which cruised on the air without an engine for couple of hours, I laughed so hard for this. There is no epic and intense atmosphere or tension on this movie, it's just so dull.
5.0~This time Nolan disappoint. Badly. johnny-77589 Sign in Permalink First 10 minutes are great. Just what you expected. You almost crouch and hide to avoid the bullets, your heart races and that sound terrifies you. You are at Dunkirk: lost, hungry, desperate. And stukas are above you. Than just repeat that over and over again, in the boat, on the sea, in the plane....and every time is less and less involving. Nolan is still Nolan: great shots, superb sound mixing, and he plays with the mighty water like no other (very much like in interstellar "waves" planet) but there is no real involvement. And it lacks sense of scale and dimensions, credibility (expecially for the spitfire gliding sequence), and the worst: time. And we are talking about the master of time, here! Sorry Christopher, this time is a no go! :-(
10.0~An innovative thrilling masterpiece!! fireblitz Sign in Permalink This movie is yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.The storytelling is extremely innovative and interesting where the story of the evacuation has been told from there perspectives-land,air and water to give a detailed experience of the evacuation.Coming to the technical aspect of the movie,it is a complete unrivaled,moving and a near perfect experience.Every technical aspect has been brilliantly addressed.The score and cinematography is completely astounding.Its a must watch in IMAX where one can appreciate and feel the technical brilliance of the movie.Some reviewers may complain about the handling of individual characters,however since the movie is a portrayal of overall survival during the evacuation rather than a personal experience and point of view during the event,it really doesn't matters.The best point about the movie is that its so thrilling and well paced it keeps a viewer at an arm's length throughout the short running time leaving him/her completely satisfied.On short note it is one of the best war movie ever made and Nolan's best work since Inception.
8.0~Nolan does it again. yrallabandi Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk has been perhaps one of the year's most awaited movies, quite rare for a war film. The man has been behind some of the best movies of the 2000s and 2010s, such as Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar. So how does Dunkirk fare against his other works? Quite well, actually. Dunkirk is an amazing movie, and you can really tell Nolan put loads of effort into it (the film was a passion project of his, apparently). The guy certainly knows how to direct a film, deftly weaving through multiple plot lines. It's a visual achievement: The film looks gorgeous, even in the digital screening I was subjected to. I can only imagine how incredible the IMAX 70mm version was. And yes, the film is rated PG-13, meaning there's not as much blood and gore as an R-rated movie like Saving Private Ryan. But the way this film is shot, it doesn't need it. The blood and gore may be an added bonus at best, or a gratuitous distraction at worst. The same can be said for the swearing: Of course, there is the usual PG-13 swearing (and even 2 f-bombs) but nowhere near the level of, again, Saving Private Ryan. But the way the dialogue is written, you probably wouldn't notice. Speaking of dialogue, there's not that much in it. This is a departure from Nolan's usually verbose scripts. He often lets the cinematography and sound design do the story telling. Speaking of sound design, there is some incredible work here. It is quite realistic, making the experience more immersive and terrifying; I can see an Oscar nomination in this area. The score is also insane: Thunderous and tense, this one is probably one of Hans Zimmer's best works, and that is saying something. He is one of the greatest composers working in the film industry. So, tight direction, beautiful cinematography, smart dialogue, incredible sound design and a fittingly intense score - why did I still give this movie an 8/10? Unfortunately, the shallow characterization is more than a small handicap to the experience. Nolan did this on purpose, but this is one of his decisions that, in my humble opinion, backfired. None of the characters are given any substantial character arcs; we don't even catch the names of a few (which sadly include the lead of the movie). This makes it difficult to latch on to the characters and care about why they're fighting. The closest we ever come to any character fleshing-out is Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson, and even that isn't much. It's an unfortunate choice, and prevents this movie from being the "masterpiece" it probably could have been. Overall, though, I was really impressed with Dunkirk, and I'm really excited to see what Nolan does next.
6.0~A Decent Sunday Afternoon Movie Best Watched At Home. benj-20839 Sign in Permalink Firstly, i want to say i enjoyed the film, nothing amazing like the critics and Christopher Nolan fans have made out but i think he achieved what he set out to do, with all the parameters he set himself regards to the differences with actual Dunkirk history and the filmmaking style he wanted to use. It certainly isn't one of the greatest war films ever made, far from it but it is a decent experiment in filmmaking, if your into that kind of thing. Me and my friend both thought it was like a good film you watch at home on a Sunday afternoon. And having watched it on the big screen i would say that thats the best way to fully enjoy it too, at home, which i would rather have seen it at. You'll understand when you see it, its just one of those films. If you watch this in Imax like i did, make sure you take a tissue because the sound becomes unbearably loud after a little while and you may need to plug your ears up, especially when the aircraft segments start and with the bigger explosions abit later on. Even with tissues in ears its pretty loud too but its nicely bearable. So if you do go and watch it at the cinema then i wholeheartedly recommend watching it in the standard 2D screens, mainly because of the unbearably loud volume and bassy sounds in Imax, mixed with the other film soundtrack noises makes everything sound muffled. And also because it isn't such the big visual spectacle as they've lead us to believe. Nolans previous films and those of say Ridley Scott or Peter Jackson have given more scope and reason to watch their films in an Imax screen. Overall though, i found the film enjoyable, JUST above average. It plods along nicely for a 95 minute feature, with 10 minutes of end credits also. There isn't a dull moment in this from my perspective. Nolan does make you feel sorry for the characters he wants you to feel sorry for, but for a war film it isn't a greatly emotional one. I don't understand why its been given such high ratings as the visuals, sound, story, character development and overall feel don't warrant such grand praise. I can understand why half the audience have really disliked it for the above reasons also, as there was no storyline and there's barely a character for the audience to attach themselves to. Plus there's a lot of difference in regards to the sheer numbers of aircraft's, boats and people not present here. I did feel the grandness of the peril these boys were actually in really missing because of this scaling down from Nolan, which was his conscious choice to leave out. I have to admit that adding CGI here and there really would have given this moment of history a more realistic vision of it's devastating scale. I expected to see really amazing choreographed air combat sequences too but they were just OK, they did the job but nothing spectacular or exciting. There have been way better and breathtaking aircraft combat scenes from most other films, war or sci-fi! If you didn't know Christopher Nolan's intentions in his film as i've briefly alluded to above and are expecting to see an epic masterpiece of a war movie in the vein of films by directors like Stanley Kubrick, Michael Cimino, Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Ridley Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg or Mel Gibson, where the visuals mesh breathtakingly with story, characters and emotions then you may be disappointed with Dunkirk. Dunkirk feels more like a brief and confined moment of an evacuation, with small scale pockets of peril at its heart, and knowing that will help you appreciate this better, hopefully, but by how much i don't know, for me its a 6/10, just above average. It's definitely not on the scale the critics and fanboys have sold it on, for a general audience! Even though i enjoyed it i still don't see how such high ratings are being thrown at this. And its a shame the film doesn't convey the epic grand scale feeling of terror that history has told us.
1.0~The most overrated director of our era LProductions-837-667666 Sign in Permalink Nolan showed promise more than a decade ago - albeit flawed, but entertaining - with "Memento," but it's been strictly downhill since then starting with the utterly predictable movie (I forget the name) about the twin brothers' magic act. Except for Batman fans (average age: 16?), it has all been downhill since: nothing new, nothing of any serious entertainment value for anyone over 16. I guess there is a box office draw for that crowd. "Dunkirk" tries SO HARD to be a film for adults, but it consists of one dreary, uninspired scene after another. I left the cinema about 1/3 of the way in. I think this shall be my final encounter with Nolan. There are too many other up-and-coming directors whose work deserves attention and evaluation.
10.0~Christopher Nolan's most visceral film till date mrinaldutta90 Sign in Permalink Disclaimer: Being a lifelong Christopher Nolan fan the review may seem biased to many, but Dunkirk is in so many ways not a typical Christopher Nolan movie. A few words about the screening: It was 6.45 PM midweek on a Wednesday, booked tickets for the first Australian public screening of Dunkirk in its 70 mm glory. Imax Melbourne went to the extent of reinstalling their 1570 film projectors to project this movie as was intended by Nolan. Dunkirk would be screened in both the 1570 film format and its upgraded Dual 4K Digital Laser systems for the weeks to come. Christopher Nolan has been making movies mostly centered on the science fiction genre. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar and Inception are all deeply steeped in the genre and could be easily classified as Sci-Fi Action films, but very well made Sci-Fi Action films, some of the best in the genre it is created in. Whereas Memento, Prestige, Insomnia and Following could be roughly put into the Mystery genre. All nine films had something in common, the scripts were based out of works of fiction if not original fictional screenplays. Realism is not a genre Nolan operated in. Neither did he make a movie based on war. Operating in a similar genre throughout their whole career is not a trait of a director striving to be one of the greatest in his generation. Nolan tries to become one of the best in his generation with Dunkirk with one of the most realistic war films ever produced. Dunkirk is a film about the epic struggle of 400,000 British troops trapped in the shores of Dunkirk as a result of a military disaster, probably one of the worst military disasters of all time. With the German troops closing in on them the only way they could save themselves is to somehow cross the narrow English Channel and reach home. As easy as this sounds the reality of the situation prevented the troops from getting home easily. The shallow shores of the beach prevented big ships to land and rescue the troops and the strong tides prevented small boats to be paddled. Nolan decided to narrate the story from three different perspectives inter-cut into each other- land, sea and air. Each perspective spans out over different time periods, the Land narrative plays out over a week, the sea over a day and the air only an hour. As usual with his films Nolan employs non-Linear narrative to tell his story. Editor Lee Smith plays a very important part in cutting between the three narratives to provide a crisp and expectedly perplexing view toward the story. Match cuts are used expertly to bring a visual coherence between the three perspectives. Nolan and Smith is successfully able to provide different vantage points to the same events taking place in the movie making the experience complete. Dialog is sparse in the movie, and character development very thin. The script is only half the size of his previous films like The Dark Knight which were all heavy on character development and narrative momentum mostly built through dialog. This was done by Nolan advertently as he didn't want the characters to be at the center of the action, he wanted the viewer to be. He also wanted to tell the story by what's happening on the screen rather than what was spoken. The same reason made him cast actors who are not famous faces with the exception of Tom Hardy (who had his face covered like he has for most of his films) and Cillian Murphy who played the character of a scared pilot afraid to go back to Dunkirk. He didn't want the audience to relate to the actors as heroes, just feel the experiences they are having being part of this incredible situation. The objective was to provide a visceral experience to the audience which can only be experienced to its intended extent in a theater. The bullets fired feels it's fired at you and you can smell the sea in the drowning scenes. The tension in the film is gripping. Nolan decided to cut the movie around the 100 minute mark because beyond that it would have been impossible to hold the almost Hitchcockian suspense. Hans Zimmer was masterful as always and played a massive part in adding to the visceral experience, the sound of the ticking clock (synthesized by Hans from a recording of one of Nolan's own watches) plays a very important part in the visceral experience. Van Hoytema shoots this mostly using 70mm IMAX cameras, I could only imagine how difficult it would have been for him to shoot using such a mammoth camera from such difficult vantage points. His wide angle shots are expansive and helps provide the scale of despair we were looking at. Nolan and his production team delivers and hits the ball out of the park with Dunkirk. People walking into the theater expecting a Dark Knight or even an Interstellar may be disappointed as he shifts his genre and objective with this production. Although Guardian's Andrew Pulver's comparison to Kubrick may be a bit premature, but he is definitely on the right trajectory to becoming one of this generation's greatest.
1.0~When Nolan and Zimmer can disappoint you at the same time k-bakhoda Sign in Permalink What a sad disappointment! To be fair, it's an OK movie.. However it fails to deliver in regards to the strong story telling expected from Christopher Nolan; also makes you wonder what happened to the great movie scores Hans Zimmer used to compose. Matt Seitz has a high opinion of the movie yet says: "If somebody were to ask me if I liked this film, I would tell them no. I loathed parts of it and found other parts repetitious or half-baked. But, maybe paradoxically, I admired it throughout". I agree with him except for the last part. I didn't find much to admire about Dunkirk except for the camera work.
4.0~simply boring charles-536 Sign in Permalink Without a doubt, one of the worst soundtracks ever, continual droning that never stops. NO character development. A series of dark disconnected snippets accompanied by the never-ending drone propels the film into the realm of pure boredom - sort of like air escaping from a balloon until it becomes flat. Though, to be fair, I have to admit - some of the dogfights were pretty cool so I bumped my rating up to 4 stars. To compare this film with the likes of Saving Private Ryan, FMJ, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter or Black Hawk Down is simply laughable. The film's best scenes are all in the trailer. Watch it and save your time and money.
1.0~Very Disappointing jacquieminniemouse Sign in Permalink Very Disappointing,I was expecting a really good movie, with all the equipment around today I was Expecting a movie to be Remembered, for Ever and it be a monument for our lads that offered, and all too many times gave there lives, at this battle, the old black and white movies are still the best and by the look of it they will take some beating. its such a shame there was so much potential, for a movie to remember. Their was one good thing about it though, with not many speaking parts in the movie There were no F*** words in it, so I actually saw the movie through to the end, well done for that, nasty words spoil so many good movies, and TV programs, and that turns them into movies u can't sit and watch with the family. My uncle was in the navy he joined up underage, He wanted to do his bit, his ship was sunk, he saved his friend who was badly injured, his friend died later while they were in the water, He was the only Survivor, he still wanted to do his bit, so he went back to sea and he was sunk again, but he Survived along with many more lads from his ship. God Bless Lads thank u all for helping to save our Country's our lives and Life as we know it.
1.0~Most boring movie of 2017 galijanach Sign in Permalink I, like most people, believed the hype around this movie and was really disappointed when watching it. Do yourself a favour and avoid it.
3.0~Two countries divided by a common language i_humanist Sign in Permalink A spectacular, important and inspiring . . . flop, I'm afraid. I wanted to see this movie on the big screen - some movies require that to be given the chance to live up to what they're supposed to be. But this is no Patton and no Great Escape. I'm surprised it is rated as high as it is on this site. Not only myself, but another, older man whose opinion I respect, agreed that the sound track, dialogue, or NOISE was practically incomprehensible to the American ear. I honestly would have preferred SUBTITLES for this movie. Then I might have understood the dialogue. This is a problem with many movies in the past 20 years - music and sound effects drown out dialogue. Have you gone out socially lately? Ever notice how loud everything is? The zeitgeist lately is: when in doubt, crank up the volume. Of course, we know that we have become braying donkeys in response. I'm going to give this movie a second chance. I'll watch it at home where my sound system gives me three options for the sound. Perhaps the BluRay will also give me additional options. But the option I'm really looking for is subtitles! In English. I read English. Chevy South Hadley, MA
9.0~One of the finest WW2 films that wasn't a war film cormacjohnkelly Sign in Permalink Enough has been said already of the brilliance of this film and of Nolan's direction, so this will be short. This is a thrilling and harrowing look at the Dunkirk evacuation, and the victory it should be recognised as, not as a shameful retreat. Nolan focuses on the event itself rather than on the characters, so the little dialogue and the ordinary characters are not missteps. This is an unselfish and balanced look through different perspectives at the event. It was in no way excessive or gratuitously violent, but extremely intense throughout, capturing the desperation and the fear. This was a jarring, real and incredibly important film that told a spectacular story of human triumph.
6.0~More of a technical showcase than a good film. SlyGuy21 Sign in Permalink The technical aspects of this far outweigh the story, or characters, or anything else in it. The story focuses on the Dunkirk evacuation, which I know next to nothing about, and how the soldiers were evacuated, and that's about it. The cast has some big names in it, but there's no main characters, the entire ensemble just feels like supporting characters. So with no focus on any characters, or plot, the effects better be good, and they are. It's shot well, it's filmed on location, it looks gritty for a PG-13 war movie, and it managed to pull off two F-bombs without getting an R rating. Aside from that though, there's nothing impressive here. If you put more focus on technical aspects, then you'll probably like this movie more, but I need a plot to stay invested, and there's none here. You may also enjoy it if you have a ship sinking/drowning fetish, because that happens a lot in this. It's not Nolan's worst, but it's not his best either, just OK.
10.0~Just one word. SPECTACULAR. xnikcac Sign in Permalink I went to see the movie last night and didn't want to have my hopes and expectations high, I usually do that, if I wait for a movie to come out for over a year, so I am not completely overpowered by the hype of seeing the movie finally. From a start, in second or third minute of the movie I had tears in my eyes. It may have many reasons, why. But even the start made me feel like, its gonna be good. And as it starts, the movie is packed, Christopher won't let you take a deep breathe, there isn't a single boring scene. You will be constantly on edge, and even though I know the whole story, I know a lot about WWII, i still hoped everyone included in the movie will survive. Also seeing how important the boats were, when I confused-donated last year to get one back to museum, it just made me really happy seeing how even a slight help can mean the world. Fionn was realistic, easy to believe and easy to love and support and cheer for him not to die. Harry Styles did a spectacular job, knowing that guy for about 5-6 years from the medias and the ex boy band, he outdone himself. He did everything so right and everything seemed so real. Cillian Murphy did amazing job, I truly could feel his emotions trough the screen and it just proved me he is one of the greatest actor of this age. Also, Tom Hardy, doing as much as he could till the end. If you are emotional about what happened in the war, you will definitely will be happy about how this movie was filmed, how great it was and how every character was real enough for you to tear once or twice. I am actually going to see that movie again tonight, and probably will later than on DVD, just because it became my favorite movie, replacing Gone Girl and American Sniper quite easily. Definitely recommend.
1.0~Imagine the worst movie you've ever seen... ktc-11120 Sign in Permalink ...that movie was better than this. I've seen plenty of horror movies... but not one has terrified me more than seeing this prime example of what Hollywood has come to now. The two hours of this film were just a disgrace of what a rich studio can do for a quick paycheque. If Christopher Nolan wanted the audience to feel as shell-shocked and horrified as the characters in his movie, then he truly succeeded. I have never wanted to escape the situation of being in that theatre more than his characters wanted to escape that beach. First of all, this isn't your typical war movie. There was no bloodshed, no gore, not even any real violence, which some might find refreshing. However, there was also hardly any dialogue and zero character/plot development...you know, things you would expect in a basic movie. I wanted to care for the characters so badly, or anything that went on in this movie. But the scenes were either too dragged out, or they would cut out at odd times, leaving you with a general disconnect from what was going on in any scene. The only explanation for what went on was just in the form of incomprehensible murmurs from the actors. This movie was based on a heroic and honourable rescue mission, and if the audience was made known of this simple fact, it would have set such a better tone. This movie had so much potential. If Nolan focused more on plot development rather than aesthetics, this movie might've actually been worthy of the multiple Oscar nominations it is going to get. To sum it up, this movie is basically a beautiful war-themed music video on mute. If you can appreciate that as a movie, then maybe you will enjoy Dunkirk. As for me, I'd rather watch worms hatch eggs than come anywhere close to a movie like this ever again.
1.0~An unbearable musical about the Dunkirk evacuation in WWII pedrolanza Sign in Permalink I was confused wheather I went to a nightclub or the movies, because the annoying music sounded from the very beginning right until the end, nonstop, it was criminal. This musical resource is getting ridiculous in general, but especially for a war film, as it takes all the realism away from combat scenes, there is no music in war, why would a director would chose to avoid a single moment of silence is beyond me. The movie barely had a script and very confusing timelines, it was difficult to understand what had already happened and to match it with other scenes about the same events. There was very little dialogue and the characters were very shalow, watching them getting killed did not make the slightest difference as it was not emotional connection to them. All scenes were constantly drowned in loud, annoying, dramatic music trying to somehow convey the desperation those soldiers must have felt, but overusing that resource ruined the movie for me, I left with a headache. Some truly unrealistic scenes also, especially close to the end, where that Spitfire runs out of fuel and still manages to shoot down a German Stuka. Terrible movie, the critics must have been bought, there is something off about that 8.5 score, dozens of people agree with was a 1 star film. Weird.
5.0~Intense, but quite boring teekay Sign in Permalink Let me first say, I'm a fan of Nolans other work, and it's not that I have anything against war movies. The movie was very intense, not only in direction but also due to the score. But I must say I found the film mostly confusing, at first anyway, and actually a bit boring. This is by no means a "run of the mill" war film. It kind of reminded me a bit about Black Hawk Down in the way that it depicts a situation more than having a storyline. After a while I got that the three situations did not happen at the same time, and I figured that the pieces would fall into place at some time, which of course they did. But I couldn't help but thinking the way the story was told, was because it would have been even more boring to tell the story chronologically. So I guess Nolan did a good job in that sense, but I still found the story to be uninteresting, even though it is based upon an important and significant event in WWII.
2.0~WOW, that was Boring! murrayhof Sign in Permalink Short and Sweet, just watched in 12/25 on Blu-ray, glad I waited. I love War movies especially WWII movies so I was very excited to see this one and I waited about 7 months for it to come out. Boring, dull, bland, vanilla, did I say bad? So much better out there, I am sure it will still win an award or two, for sound maybe? Wait for it to come on TNT in a year or so then you can fast forward to the end.
10.0~Why this could actually be one of the best war films even after accepting its weaknesses t-viktor212 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is one of the rare cases a film receives a huge critical acclaim and a mixed reaction from the audience. Some reviews arrive to consider the praise for the film being based solely on the name of its director, Christopher Nolan. The main criticisms that Dunkirk receives is: poor character development, repetitivity of the action, little emotionality. Dunkirk indeed doesn't really have character development. This is a fact. You get to know something briefly about Mark Rylance's backstory and his son's friend George, but nothing about anyone else. There is a reason for that: Dunkirk relies mostly on its fast pace, which simply does not give enough time to fully develop characters the way, for example, The Thin Red Line did with Stavros, or Saving Private Ryan did with John Miller. I dare to say that's not something the film needed at all. Stopping the story from taking its course so that Harry Styles and Fionn Withehead talk about their backstory and are more identified as characters would have taken away from the whole suspense feel the film expects the audience to receive. We got to love John Miller because of the night-time church moment, or the past reveal scene, or the scene in which he talks to Ryan prior to the final battle. These scenes are also those which make Saving Private Ryan a 2h40m film, with about 1h40m of action. Repetitivity of action is a criticism I understood while watching the film. As many of the readers might know, this film tells three story lines contemporarily: one that lasts days, on ground, one that lasts less than a day, on the ship called "Moonstone" and another that lasts less than an hour, on the spitfires. These storyline become increasingly interconnected through the film, until the final climax. What sometimes happens is that you see the same action from a different perspective ten minutes after you have seen it from another. So, the film's first sequence that involves Spitfires has three of them flying over the sea, and there is a sailor ship in the corner of the shot. 30 minutes later you will realize that the ship was the Moonstone when you see that same thing from the perspective of the people on the ship. There are several of these repetitions. That's why some viewers felt it repetitive: most of the time (expecially the ship scenes and the plane scenes) they saw simply the exact same scenes. Anyone familiar with Nolan must know how he either did complex story lines on a linear plot, but is more known for the non-linearity of Memento, The Prestige and so on. Dunkirk is following this habit in a truly outstanding and clever way. Dunkirk had no "Earn this." scene, or any moving John Williams score. The ending had some emotionality to it, but no other scene in the film. Dunkirk doesn't want you to cry. It wants you to feel the suspense the soldiers felt. Up until the last minute or so, not a moment of relief is left to the audience, and this is conveyed through the fast pace of the film and its very intense Zimmer score. Taken alone, the score is very similar to others he composed, but it does what is needed for the film's intensity. As for accuracy, I looked up the main things about the Dunkirk evacuation before watching the film. A lot of elements are slightly mentioned or implied. E.g. the french defending the perimeter, or the existence of a second dock for the french, overall the sense of chaos is fully present, and the film delivers it well. There are some minor inaccuracies or simplifications, true, such as the German planes' scheme colour being one that they didn't use until some time later, which apparently was an intentional choice, but all the main details of the Dunkirk evacuation where there, in my view. When the movie finished, I was relieved through the ending, but it delivered the intensity and climax that no other war movie gave. And Dunkirk did this without showing a single nazi soldier or without true warfare scenes: this is why Dunkirk should be considered one of the best war films made so far.
10.0~A very special war movie indeed david-fernandez Sign in Permalink Beautifully shot and crafted the desperation of being on the losing end of a full military retreat. Out of hopelessness comes salvation. The multiple different story threads intertwine and are often partially repeated from different perspectives, the big acts of heroism from individuals and the little people combined is quite uplifting and moving to watch. The movie almost reminds me (in mood and design) of those 1960s, 1970s and 1980s movies .. Waterloo, Battle of Britain, Barry Lyndon .. sort of slightly detached. A must see for war history lovers and investigators of the human condition when under bleak, mortal threat.
6.0~Watch the 1959 film for a better understanding of the event malcolmgsw Sign in Permalink In 1990 I attended the 50th anniversary celebration of the event.We were fortunate to have veterans in our group who had been at Dunkirk.We went onto the beach and they recounted their experiences.None of them would appear to be similar to those shown in the film.I have to say that till I read some of the reviews that I realised that the action is non linear and some is repeated.Maybe that explains why the Spitfires kept on firing when in fact they only had 9 seconds worth of ammunition.In any event there were few RAD planes at Dunkirk as they were being withdrawn to England.Then we have the small boats.It seems to have been overlooked that they were originally sent over to ferry troops from shore to navy ships.It was only later in the evacuation that the boats ferried troops back direct to England.No French troops are shown on the beaches.In conclusion the film is overblown,noisy and inaccurate.So loud I had to take my hearing aids out of my ears. Watch the 1959 film instead of this.
10.0~Wonderful movie, and very poignant if you understand WW2 SamwiseG Sign in Permalink This is the best, and most thought provoking war movie I have seen for a long time....yes Saving private Ryan was great, but it still couldn't extract itself from that 'America won the War' attitude that underlies most Hollywood produced movies. This film however shows a real understanding of what it was like to be at the sharp end of WW2, when the UK as an island nation were stretched far too thinly trying to defend itself and its allies. The acting performances are understated, but excellent at the same time...none are likely to get Academy nominations, but each played their part in portraying the full gambit of emotions that were taking place during that particular low point of the hostilities. I sat in a cinema with many teenagers surrounding me, and found myself hoping that they understood what was being shown to them and that they appreciated the sacrifices that were made on their behalf. Having scanned many of the other reviews it is interesting that many detractors seem to prefer that Hollywood approach to WW2, and appear to have no comprehension of the reality of the early 1940's ..... this is a sad fact, and whilst its not great to dwell on the past it is important to understand it. Well done Christopher Nolan and all the cast - definitely a must see movie.
3.0~It's not a Rambo/Arnlod action film. methodman-14473 Sign in Permalink Sorry to disappoint or go against so many rave reviews but, honestly, none of the people I went with liked it. Slow moving, no character development, no plot, no major fight scenes, no hero, and, unless you are already an historian, the audience is not given sufficient background information to understand what is really happening. In reality, it is still debated why Hitler called off the advance and inevitable destruction of the British Expeditionary Force and French and Belgium troops at Dunkirk, some even suggesting that he wanted to end the war on the western front before America and Russia entered the fight. But I digress; the movie although cinematographically and visually stunning is a summer blockbuster flop. Save your money and catch it on cable.
3.0~So disappointed - this movie had no soul english_artist Sign in Permalink I was so looking forward to this movie and knowing the history of Dunkirk I thought I was in for a really moving movie that would make us proud of the people that rallied together to get the solders home. But my wife and I were very disappointed with Dunkirk. The sound throughout the movie was awful with repeating sounds repeating over and over for ages driving you mad. But if this was its only flaw it would not have been so bad but the movie was very disjointed flicking from one thing to another and it took me a while to work out that we sometimes were watching the same scene but from different perspectives. The characters in the movie meant nothing to me and I did not care about them at all which is a tragedy for such a moving story as Dunkirk it was as if the movie had no soul. I have heard of people being moved to tears watching this and the only tears we would shed was for the £20 admission fee. Go watch a great war movie like Hacksaw Ridge which is in a whole different league to this
9.0~Other war movies get rickity wrecked!!! andrewr-18094 Sign in Permalink Great war movie, was blown away (no pun intended)! Get ready for an action packed adventure that tells a story of a war, a war where battles are fought and innocent men are killed. There's also a medic at some stage in the movie but I wont spoil it and tell you when. The only down point of the movie was the 40 minutes that Tom Hardy kept saying "I'm on him", it just seemed to get really repetitive. 10 out of 10 would recommend to consider watching this movie!
10.0~Nail biting stuff paul-228-385333 Sign in Permalink I see the review trolls are at it again. Statements like "Soul-less. Confused. Loud. Disappointing." with a rating of 2/10 are actually ironic, because, that is a very accurate depiction of war. Soul-less. Confused. Loud and disappointing. There are no winners. Everybody who complains about this movie being boring and tedious has no clue about war. A lot of war is sitting around and waiting wondering what the enemy is up to, or hoping you will make the next day, which can be boring and tedious but also soul killing. I really enjoyed every aspect of this film and was invested in the characters and their survival all the way. The sound editing and Zimmer's music was also phenomenal and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It was way more realistic and historically accurate than many other movies. I'd say it's an accurate depiction of war. The writer and director set out to tell the story out of the perspective of those who were trapped on the shores of Dunkirk and who escaped to tell the tale, and I can honestly say, he did a good job of it. I have never seen war first hand, but have some close relatives and friends that have seen and lived through it. Those include the Angolan war in South West Africa, as well as civil war in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan. I have heard many first hand accounts of war, and have also seen the effect of war on people's personalities, bodies and on nature and cities up close. It's not the "sexy" version Hollywood has sold to us many times. It's really terrible. I can imagine after you've killed so many times, and you have seen so many people killed and mutilated around you, there are not much emotion left. The way those characters in the movie were depicted, I feel is very accurate. Everybody just keeps going. Some commit suicide. One person I knew, who died several years ago as an old man, was actually in Pearl Harbor shoveling coals on a ship because he was too young to fight. He survived the ordeal because some guy offered him a plank that kept him afloat when their ship was sunk in the harbor. He even named his son as a result of this. He did not talk much about the war, but sometimes when I drank coffee with him, he would speak about things he did and saw. He was also a POW in Japan where him and his mates were tortured. Among things, he managed to escaped by strangling his captor and torturer with bare hands. War had a permanent effect on him and his family. His daughter has told me many times, how he used to wake up screaming at night. That is war for you, and that's what is depicted in this film. I live by the ocean, am involved in maritime sea rescue and also have aviation experience. This film ticks all the boxes for me.
6.0~Disappointing gonzaboca15 Sign in Permalink I'm a huge fan of Nolan movies, but Dunkirk is a boring war movie; it wasn't what I expected. While I found photography and directing to be great, the plot was not up to par. I mean, it's a world war 2 movie, you expect to see some blood here, intense exchange of gunfire. Not only we didn't see that, we didn't see a single german on screen!
4.0~Disappointing paulergatoudis Sign in Permalink I expected so much more from this but it was rather dull and boring. As a plus, the cinematography and flying scenes were good. However, there was a total lack of back story, and character development. I was hoping for an introduction, the British and German Command centres, the rousing call for public help, empathy with lead characters. There was almost no dialogue, so no story, and there was no great ending Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan etc much better.
4.0~What's all the fuss? Not so good. qormi Sign in Permalink For one thing, it was scaled back too much. In reality, Dunkirk was a huge battle involving the evacuation of around 400 thousand men. Hundreds of planes and ships were lost. Thousands of men died. The movie failed to convey the magnitude at all. We see a few planes dog fighting instead of hundreds. We see a few ships and boats sunk instead of hundreds. We follow one character around throughout the movie and it was boring. I really can't say I liked this movie. Great sound effects though.
10.0~Dunkirk Doesn't Disappoint trevorj-67694 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is not a history, at least not in any remotely traditional sense of the genre. The intention of the film is not to educate on the events on that French beach that dreary week, day, and hour. Rather, Nolan used what happened at Dunkirk, a very real part of history, as the foundation for building what is a visceral and ultra-realistic war experience. As only Nolan can do, he turns a smart, if ordinary, concept (a film about Dunkirk) into an ingenious and wholly unique film (an uncomfortable, horrifying, and realistic wartime experience). This is a film that is no fun to watch, as it shouldn't be because war is the worst kind of human evil. Christopher Nolan tries to capture that reality and does so with more gusto than any filmmaker before him. And in that pursuit, his war picture stands alone even among the most insightful war movies. He shakes us to the core, terrifies us, and leaves us traumatized afterward. This was his intention from the start; don't mistake that for bad filmmaking. Dunkirk works because the history of it, the reality that these sorts of events actually happened to real human beings and aren't just inventions of imagination, immediately gets our attention. While we know deep down that none of these particular characters are real, we are convinced that they certainly could have been and the actions depicted on the screen were likely the same of many hundreds of men on that beach. In a sense, these virtually nameless and unexplored characters serve as the embodiment of all those men – human beings just trying to survive another day. We know nothing of their lives outside that beach, but it doesn't matter. Only survival matters. The actors turn in solid performances. This is a film designed to do a specific purpose and it is not to showcase the actors. These actors do their part in making the experience come to life. Hans Zimmer turns in another powerful score. While it falls short of his work on Interstellar and Inception, it should rightly earn him some recognition come award season. There is not one single flaw to be found in this movie. As is usually the case with Nolan, he does all the heavy lifting and everyone else does their part to finish the job. While the second, third, and fourth viewing will prove if this is his best work for me, the talk of Dunkirk being Nolan's masterpiece is not unfounded. This is a great film; there is no doubt about that. It should be said that this is a movie that is very uncomfortable at times. The sound engulfs everything. Occasionally, dialogue is missed because there is so much background noise. However, war is not comfortable so it is natural that a war movie wouldn't be either. It is in these details that Nolan perfects the experience of a war film like no other. If you are looking for a nice evening at the movies, this is not for you. This is an intense, loud, and overall unpleasant movie. Yet, it is beautiful and moving, powerful in its stroke. This is a movie worth watching – not for entertainment but for experience. From the very first moment, Nolan tries to convince us that what we are watching is not only a true story, but might very well be the actual footage of those fateful days at Dunkirk. And, from the first moment, we believe him. We are engulfed by the deafening sound of planes flying overhead and jolted by the bullets ripping by; we scream in horror as men drown in front us; and we feel hopeless as struggle after struggle continues to leave thousands of men stranded as the enemy closes in. This must be real. No other film experience in my life has so deeply and palpably made me feel as if I am living the same reality as the characters on the screen. I left the theater feeling as if I was leaving Dunkirk myself – just surviving to fight another day.
10.0~Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made.A Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece (Which is quite common to him). shobanchittuprolu Sign in Permalink Dunkirk (2017): Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest director of this generation who can handle several complexity themes and can make them commercially successful.Christopher Nolan is the name that makes the internet generation of movie lovers go nuts. He is worshiped by them. Seven of his nine movies feature on IMDb top 250. Five of his movies have earned more than $500 million at the international box office. One would assume that such fame must be a blessing for Nolan. And blessing it is, but it also comes with massive burden of expectations.He never disappoints and after a sci-fi masterpiece Interstellar,Nolan made this war masterpiece Dunkirk.All the early reviews already showed that Dunkirk is another masterpiece from Nolan. Plot: The story of Dunkirk is well known. During the early stages of World War II, Allied soldiers from Britain, Belgium and France are surrounded by the German Army on the beaches of Dunkirk, France. In one of the single largest operation of its kind, commonly known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, around 400,000 soldiers were evacuated. My Review: Nolan is infamous for his non-linearity screenplays.His Inception,Interstellar,Memento all are mind-bending screenplays.But when he took up the project of Dunkirk,all the fans of his got disappointed.But surprisingly,Nolan even molded this war film into non-linear screenplay. Each of the stories occur in different timelines and then merge together in an explosive and breathtaking finale. Each and every scene in this movie is an art of realistic suspense.There are lot of tense moments all over the movie.Nolan successfully made us feel the agony of war in all the possible ways.Be it infantry,air force or sea..it is a true horror. You will feel your pulse racing every single moment of the film. In ways more than one, 'Dunkirk' works more like a thriller than an action drama. 'Dunkirk' won't be the film it is without the cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema and the score of Hans Zimmer. The visuals of the film are just extraordinary, be it the wide shots of the beach or underwater sequences. Hoytema does his career best work here after Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score is inspiring Even beyond the visuals and the score, the film is a technical marvel. I expect the film to sweep all the technical categories at the Oscars, from editing to sound design. I won't be surprised if Nolan himself walks away with the first Oscar of his career. Last but not least.Nolan made me cry in the climax sequences.He once again brilliantly made audience get tears with his heart-warming climax. SO,Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made.A Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece (Which is quite common to him). My rating 10/10
4.0~Quite a disappointment. p-jonsson Sign in Permalink I have put off viewing this film for quite a while. The main reason for this is that I am somewhat reluctant watching a movie where the story is pretty well known before you sit down to watch it. However a few days ago I finally did and, given all the hype, I have to say that I expected more, a lot more. Sure the movie is a cinematically very well down movie. Acting, camera and all that is excellent. Unfortunately that is all there is. First of all, where the hell did the over-inflated budget go? Dunkirk was a major undertaking with almost 400 000 soldiers involved and hundreds and hundreds of boats. We get to see what? A few columns of soldiers, a handful of boats and three pitiful spitfires against a bomber and two Fock Wulfes. To add to this insult we pretty much get to see the same bloody event over and over from different angles. This is an insult to all the brave men that made this rescue possible. There are a few likable people in the movie. Like the Navy commander and the elderly guy on the pleasure boat steaming to rescue. The rest are either psychotic or morons. Realism? Not so much. Like the scene where a bunch of soldiers are trapped in a boat being shot to pieces. Would any one in their right mind really have thought they could plug dozens and dozens of holes with their hands and then sail across the channel? Then we have the spitfire which runs out of fuel and glides around forever over the beach so the director can get some scenic shots done. Other times fairly large boats gets damaged and flips over in seconds. I would also have expected some pre-story. Some build up. But no, the story starts right away with these measly handful of boats and planes taking for bloody ever to drag themselves over to where they are supposed to go. Quite a disappointment indeed.
3.0~A deeply boring, forgetful film. thomasallen-61577 Sign in Permalink I was excited to see Dunkirk and I had gone with some friends. However, I was bored throughout, it was hard to follow, and just too long. The only redeeming quality that this movie had was the portrayal of the characters from the actors including newcomer to acting Harry Styles. I fell asleep several times.
6.0~Good Film but Disappointing at the same time in many ways stevenfreekin Sign in Permalink Just watched the movie on 70mm film and the image quality was exceptional. For the most part it was an enjoyable and entertaining history film about survival during war. It had some great suspense and thriller elements to it. In fact some of the sequences were very Hitchcockian in nature that they reminded me of Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent. If i had to categorize this movie i would say it's an Action-Thriller that takes place during war. My first problem was the Sound & Music. Both were too loud, annoying, distracting, and monotonous that several people got up and left. I almost did. It's the same problem that the dark knight rises suffered from. They mixed the sound so high to make the action and explosions appear grand but it fails since the visuals don't work. There's only one director who can direct great action and explosions and make it look grand and epic that i almost believe its a work of art, which in a way it is. That director is none other than Michael "Bad Boys" Bay. Second problem i had with the movie was too many cuts to secondary characters that i didn't care about. Not to mention i barely cared about any of them since I never got to know them. They should have stuck with just three stories: the pilot, the father and son, and the two soldiers trying to survive. Period. I don't care about the generals, random soldiers, or Cillian Murphy's character either. Third problem i had with the movie was it didn't have a grand scale or scope the way it was advertised. The film tries hard to want to be epic but fails. On the posters it states that over 400,000 men were trapped but in the movie i didn't see that at all. Honestly, it was more like 2,000, then there was like two planes in the sky and a half a dozen boats. Really? That's what you called grand? If you enjoy a historical Action-Thriller that's full of suspense then definitely check it out. Bring some ear plugs if you can.
3.0~Utter Disappointment hammer-400-401899 Sign in Permalink I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie after all the hype it got. But when I did, I was utterly disappointed. Removing the emotions attached to this historical event when reviewing this, the movie made it look like the Dunkirk operation, was just a small evacuation of some 10,000 troops. The movie never got to convey the true scale of the operation. The movie failed to show the enormity of the entire Dunkirk evacuation. In the real Dunkirk, the evacuation was far more chaotic than what was shown in the movie. In the movie, it looked almost organised. Watching the movie, you never got the sense that there were over 300,000 troops evacuated during this event. It focused too much on too few characters, and I couldn't relate to the story, nor did I get the sense of urgency, danger, and/or life or death situations faced by the characters. I respect this historical event and admire all people that were involved in it, but in my opinion, this movie failed to convey any of the emotion and the gravity of this historical event.
5.0~No soul and void of compelling characters wl-casper Sign in Permalink I had very high expectations for Christopher Nolan's latest offering as I'm a big fan of his previous work but Dunkirk is the first of his films I really don't care for. For pros I would say the cinematography, sound mixing and soundtrack are excellent but Dunkirk was missing the most important elements for any film; Characters and a story!! I was blown away by the opening scene and thought this would be another masterstroke by Nolan but there are so many problems with it. Apart from the lack of any interesting characters, the script feels so aimless at times and while watching the film I felt like someone was constantly pressing stop and rewinding. I also had a problem with the dialogue. The lines between the characters were very rigid and did not move the plot along. There was very little emotion in Dunkirk and while I did like the soundtrack I thought too much emphasis was placed on trying to convey tension through the music, be it the ticking of the clock or harsh synths building to a crescendo in the background. The strangest thing and most disappointing was that the film feels like it is building to something bigger the whole time like a grand finale but it never arrived. I had no problem with the fact that the story was non-linear but it doesn't matter what pattern the story is laid out in if there are no people at the centre of the story. I really don't understand how the ratings are so high so far because it doesn't deserve the plaudits it's receiving. I expect the rave reviews to continue as film critics don't seem to be able to judge a film for themselves these days. Very disappointed.
3.0~Disappointing janshedd-1 Sign in Permalink I love history and was expecting a spectacular film. It was not to be. There was no character development whatsoever. You didn't get to know anyone which made it difficult to care about what was happening. The background music was so loud that you couldn't understand the dialogue. Ignore critics and save your money.
1.0~This film is grossly overrated and boring, hence my one star review nicknutmeg Sign in Permalink I would typically rate a film like this 4 stars, which is what it deserves, given that it lacks a plot, any sense of coherency and development, while also failing to get beyond the most superficial and basic summary of the story of Dunkrik. I am giving it one star because I am shocked at the high rating it currently enjoys, given its completely lazy script and disjointed direction. I am disappointed by C. Nolan, and I think he should stick to directing and stop writing scripts because they are awful. There is literally no meaningful dialogue in this film. If you like a contentless, dialogue-light, incredibly unintelligent film that has some nice shots of a dive bomber chasing and being chased on the beach in France, then this is for you. The film has such a severe shortage of dramatic content that it shows the same scene three times from different perspectives (the final scenes of the dive bomber chase) without really adding anything to the plot. Knowing a bit about the history of Dunkirk, after watching this film, it is safe to say that it tells the audience one thing about Dunkirk: there were 400,000+ soldiers trapped there by the Germans, and the British Navy rescued them with the help or requisitioned civilian vessels. I have watched an array of WWII films, from Saving Private Ryan, Letters From Iwo Jima, The Thin Red Line, Das Boot, Enemy At the Gates, and countless others. I have never felt the need to write a review for any of these films because I felt that their ratings were accurate reflections of their worth as films. I am writing this review, which is the first I have ever written on IMDb, because I am so outraged at the hype about this film, given that it was utterly vacuous and boring. As even the most generous reviewers have conceded, the film lacks characters, and thus lacks any real plot. Literally nothing seems to happen the entire film except for a few sailors and pilots being rescued--and one really long chase in the sky. There is absolutely no context given of why they were in Dunkrirk and how they were trapped. The entire drama surrounding Dunkirk, not to mention the massive military blunder made by Hitler at this front, was not only absent, but apparently actively ignored in this film. The film made a point of constantly switching from one scene to another and then back to the first (at certain points switching back and forth between four or five scenes that were only loosely connected to one another). Either people are getting more passive and sheep-like, simply following the lead of the critics who are undoubtedly invested in this film's success for reasons other than a genuine love of film, or they are becoming less intelligent, since this film is the definition of trash. I cannot believe that I read someone saying that this was the best film they saw in a decade. However, when the competition is the 6th installment of Spider-man, an overrated and overblown third installment of Planet of the Apes and other like-minded, mind-numbing agit-prop and trash. This entire review does not even get into the issue in the film surrounding its glorification of war, aesthetically, for the most part, but also dramatically (albeit at a very diminished level, given the lack of drama and character or plot development and depth in this film). The very origins of WWI and WWII lie in the callous and blind aestheticization of war, as in the proto-fascist futurist movement which produced poems glorifying war and modern machines of death. The scenes and feel of war are not adequately depicted in this film. It is far too much of a feel good flick to be realistic or even approach the boundary of realism. The entire film lacked the quality of feeling real, despite the director's desperate attempts to make it feel that way. Saving Private Ryan, despite some of its flaws, was far more gory and realistic than this film (I do not think you can make a realistic war film with battle scenes, especially of WWII without the level of violence that would warrant an R rating). In the end of the film, the soldiers go on a train the England and the train's interior looks like it is from the early 2000's or late 1990's at the earliest. It does not look like 1940's England. The film does not capture the audience through ideas or dialogue or history, but rather uses beautiful camera shots and crowd psychology to please and entertain. It lacks any critical attitude toward itself or the idea of representing war and destruction, and moreover, toward that of representing history in general. This film tells you just about what a knowledgeable four year old could say about Dunkirk: allies trapped by Nazis in Dunrkirk, and British RAF and Navy come to the rescue with the help of a few civilians. Really not compelling. How about showing the audience why Dunkirk even was part of the war? Or showing the local French population, or the Nazis who were invading? Or simply explaining the context in more than three lines at the beginning of the film. This script was lazy and amateur.
2.0~Wish I had missed this one Claidheamdanns Sign in Permalink I've just come from seeing Dunkirk, and I would say that it would have been no colossal loss not seeing it. I nearly left on account of the music several times. It was dragging, tense, and full of disharmony throughout nearly the entire movie. If you've no seen it yet, I would suggest that it's not worth the price of admission. There's my 2¢.
8.0~It may fail in realism, but there is one thing where it shines alexandr-osprey Sign in Permalink I was watching film about war. And feeling was almost palpable. Desperate attempts to escape, omnipresent enemy and death everywhere. Of course, it was only tiny fraction of real event, but remember: it's just a film. Many people say that storyline was bad. I say there was almost no storyline. There was realization of your insignificance, helplessness, desperation, fear. I think that it's what world war about. So, it may fail to tell us about Dunkirk, yet it may tell us way more about war itself.
10.0~One part suspenseful and two parts engaging, Dunkirk is the loudest silent movie I've seen (it's also incredible) RforFilm Sign in Permalink History has proved that war is Hell. Soldiers that have been there and back will reveal that they were in constant fear that any moment could be their last. There was no such thing as a safe haven. The moment they would retreat to their tents and shut their eyes for the evening would be treasured as they were never sure if they would ever wake up. Sure, having their hands on a gun or even knife might give them some reassurance, but the cloud of death is felt by everyone, with the acceptance that they're okay with sacrifice. There are too many war movie to name, but how many of them deal with the actual fear that came with it? Even I'm hard pressed to fully name one. I think it has to do with the ideology that's similar to how the American government wants the public to see its military; fearless. Vulnerability seems to be seen as more of a sign of weakness then humanity, especially in film. It's always about trying to be the hero. It's all about showing that your have to stand and face the enemy. What if I were to say it's okay to run? Dunkirk let's you know that it's alright to dream of home within hopelessness. The film opens with some history exposition informing the audience that it's 1940 and very early into WWII. We are then introduced to three different stories that seemingly blend together as the film progresses. First on the land is about a young British private Tommy (played by Fionn Whitehead) who (along with the rest of the troops) is being pushed closer and closer to the ocean. He joins with fellow private Gibson (played by Aneurin Barnard) and later Alex (played by Harry Styles) as they simply hope to catch a boat that will take them home. The second story on the water is about an older mariner Mr. Dawson (played by Mark Rylance) as he and his son Peter join with several sailors in transporting their ships to Dunkirk to help with the troop rescue. They later pickup a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy) and deal with him wanting to turn the boat around. The last story in the air, centers around three spitfire pilots on the English Channel to provide support from the Nazi attacks. Though one of the pilots Farrier (played by Tom Hardy) gas gauge breaks, he continues to fight as long as he can. If film has been about immersing audiences into new worlds, then Dunkirk will transport you to the terror of WWII. Right from the opening scene (which I will not DARE spoil), I found myself flinching to gunshots and explosions, as if I was in a VR experience. Director Christopher Nolan again extends his belief that cinema should be an experience and Dunkirk is an incredible suspenseful war movie that gave me an idea of what fear I would have felt had I been in the military. It's been said that real veterans of the Dunkirk event felt like they had returned. I can say that this movie looks and sounds incredible. For such a story that shot in a wide scope, you ironically feel that claustrophobia that each of the men in France felt when they thought they were going to die. Sometimes its right on the beach and sometimes it's on the sailboat in the little rooms where that may have been the only safe place. I saw this in IMAX, and I can say that it amplifies the sound to a level that added the number of times I jumped from my seat. Will Dunkirk receive a best picture nomination? It's tough to tell, but I'm sure it's already guaranteed all of the technical awards from effects to sound to especially score by the great Hans Zimmer. The music, like the movie, all feel like a ticking time bomb that will eventually go off, yet you never see the timer. If I had any issue is that the movie does feel a little long even with it's hour and forty minute running time. A lot of that has to do with that you listen to very little dialogue and all the focus is the reaction of the characters. This makes for what has to be the loudest silent movie I've seen. I'll give this ten Dunkirk flags out of ten. Watching Dunkirk on the big screen will feel like a historical roller coaster, so if sound volume doesn't bother you, spring for the IMAX screening if you can. While I can't say this is Nolan's best work, Dunkirk justifies his claim that we need cinema for movies like these.
10.0~Relentless, realistic, unforgettable Christopher_Reid Sign in Permalink I'm a huge Nolan fan. Almost all of his films are in the IMDb top 250 and deservedly so if you ask me. Dunkirk lives up to his high standards but it's different from anything he's done before, including the fact that it's based on real events (during World War II no less). It's a pure movie. It captures events as accurately as possible with little artistic "interpretation". The enemy acts like the shark in Jaws or the Joker in The Dark Knight, they appear at any time, without a face, and cause havoc, fear and destruction. The planes in particular are terrifying as they scream from afar and get 10 times louder when they pass overhead, dropping bombs or strafing along the way. The soldiers drop in anticipation. Most of them get back up once it's gone. Also, it captures the loudness of the bullets and explosions in a way that I think hasn't been done before. It's in-your-face from the beginning. Many films try to affect us by having characters *emote* and tell us their thoughts and feelings. Nolan understands that evoking emotions is really about creating striking images and situations with characters we can relate to. No-one screams out "NOOOO!" or sobs as a friend says their last words. It's like classical music in its restraint. The movie is emotion-less in a way but I found it powerful and moving. I don't need "sad music" and melodramatic acting to tell me to cry. Simply understanding what is happening and why, how it relates to world history and what I might do in such a situation is enough. We feel the continually alternating terror and relief of the characters all the way along. There is little if any CGI in the movie (I can't tell because all of it looks completely real). It's depressing the extent to which movies depend on CGI these days. It frequently doesn't look real at all and can take you right out of a movie (the Justice League trailer shown before Dunkirk was a good example of this). As a result, Dunkirk looks spectacular. The music makes use of ticks (from Nolan's personal watch), constantly reminding us of the scarcity of time and the impending doom surrounding the soldiers. Like the opening of The Dark Knight, there's a lot of string ostinati, gradually building tension as the events unfold and lives are on the line. The movie is made up of three main aspects/locations which unfold in parallel but on different timescales: land (a week), sea (a day) and air (an hour). Nolan has done this several times now. In Inception, dream layers occur at different paces from each-other and reality. In Interstellar, time dilation causes great discrepancies in the passage of time between characters. Memento is made of two main story-lines (one going forwards and one backwards) which eventually meet. Many of the climaxes in his Batman trilogy involve multiple events occurring in parallel. Dunkirk similarly cuts between multiple lines but it is easy to follow and it helps build suspense and connect the parts of the story. There is little dialogue. And that's appropriate, there isn't much to talk about. Characters exchange looks and that's all they need. They're alive. The stranger next to them may as well function as their best mate for now but who knows what will transpire. Dunkirk is a profound experience. It doesn't try to be beautiful or sad or triumphant but just real. And yet, I think it's all of those things. It's thought-provoking and haunting. It's about one of the darkest periods in human history and the biggest evacuation of all time. It's incredible film-making and a serious contender for Best Picture IMO.
8.0~Dunkirk (2017) rockman182 Sign in Permalink When I saw the IMAX feature clip for this film before watching Rogue One back in December, I just knew I had to watch this film in IMAX. Christopher Nolan is probably the most successful modern day director going today. He was able to establish a niche early on, then came out with a very well received comic book trilogy. He was audacious to go for a sci-fi film that turned out to be quite grand. Here, he took a shot at a war film and I think he has done very well. Dunkirk is told in three phases. On the land, in the sea, and in the air. Each section is connected but the duration of time of each segment differs. The week we see on land involves a young Englishman trying to survive while along the way meeting two fellow young soldiers and being sunk by enemy German fire. The sea portion takes place in a day and involves a civilian boat that is run by a father and son and their attempts to rescue as many soldiers as they can from Dunkirk. The air portion lasts only an hour and follows a fighter pilot and his attempt to take down enemy planes while trying to ration the fuel in his engine. Time is definitely a construct that connects each section in a non linear method. You can literally hear the ticking of a clock in the score, and its persistent. Speaking of the score, Mr Hans Zimmer has outdone himself. The score is ever present and it carries on nearly throughout the entire film. It never lets up and is at times majestic, tense, and absolute momentum building madness. The jarring sounds (especially in IMAX) is phenomenal. IMAX was able to heighten the experience. Every loud gun sounding off and every roaring plane is so precise, loud, and absolutely brings you into the world of the film. The script and dialogue is kept light and its so great that way. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue and there doesn't need to be in this type of war film. Nolan isn't exactly trying to build the strongest of characters. The film is really a cinematic experience. The long shots are beautiful. There is heavy use of practical effects and virtually no CGI. It feels so authentic, and Nolan masters the art of cinema here. The film introduces a few fresh faces and includes some familiar ones, even those who have worked with Nolan in the past. Also Harry Styles (who was surprisingly quite good). I think this film ranks quite highly in Nolan's work. I may need to give it a rewatch to see exactly where it does. I can see why people won't enjoy it because its so different than what Nolan has done in the best. I for one, love the direction he is going in now. He's become a bold and ambitious filmmaker doing what he thinks is write and not really pandering with this one. Its got to be one of the best war films of all time already. Definitely up to par with expectations. 8.5/10
9.0~The Next Masterful Movie by Christopher Nolan enterzec Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a wonderful director and all his movies have either been good or amazing so far in his career and Dunkirk is no different. Dunkirk is an amazing theater experience and it should definitely be watched in the theater if possible. The sound was perfection throughout the entire movie, from the minute the movie starts you feel the intensity starts to rise and it doesn't stop for the movies relative short running time for being a Christopher Nolan movie of merely 106 minutes. The set-up of the story not being told in a lineal way and instead in three different parts that intertwines with each other is a genius move by Nolan. These sort of things is where Nolan can really shine in his story telling abilities. A lot of the main actors have almost zero credits in their filmography but with Nolan's directing they seem to act as naturally as they possibly could. The absolute standout of the movie has to be Tom Hardy's performances, what that man can do with only his eyes is astonishing. For the major part of the movie, almost his entire face except for eyes is covered but he stills achieve some great acting and show emotion through out the movie. His character Farrier is involved in one of the most gorgeous shot i have even seen in a movie, it's so peaceful but still in the middle of the war. This truly is a war movie and some scenes were horrifying to witness. It might be a war movie but it's just as much a survival movie. The middle part dragged at some places but the beginning and especially the last 30 minutes were truly amazingly done. The chemistry between the father Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn- Carney) was very well done and their story caught and few bumps on the road but they managed to convey so much emotions with so few words. That goes for the entire movie, not that much speaking with dialogue but instead with what's going on around these characters and with great cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema. Christopher Nolan did it again, he created a really good movie. Score: 9/10 (Amazing) www.filmtvnow.wordpress.com
7.0~An immersive and authentic mess garethlloydjones Sign in Permalink When one of the most acclaimed directors and score composers join forces again you would expect only a masterpiece to come out of it. But let's ignore the Nolan and Zimmer label for a minute and review the movie as it is. The movie does an impressive job in immersion with Nolan's decision to uphold authenticity with real aircraft, ships and vehicles and fantastic sound design. But the problem with this movie was it's lack of depth or scale and was even more diminished with its jumbled mess of a script and scenes. The movie underwhelms the true force of the Germans and the formidable Luftwaffe in the early stages of the war to say the least, and failed to portray the true powerhouse and fear the soldiers were facing. The characterisation was extremely poor and it was almost impossible to form any emotional attachment or even sympathise with any of the characters. The few words spoken in the movie could be partly to blame but wasn't the main reason. It was the characters lack of reaction to the harsh situations presented to them that made them less believable. On the other hand, Mark Rylance who played the sailor of the small vessel was the star of the movie and played his part perfectly. Harry Styles performed well despite being his debut and should have been given more of an opportunity to develop his character but this was extremely difficult due the lack of dialogue. The dogfight scenes were exhilarating to see and became tense at times but this tension was often short lived. The lack of available authentic German aircraft was apparent in the movie which is where CGI could have been implemented. The soundtrack for the movie was far from Hans Zimmers best and was generic with no memorable melodies but the sound of repetitive ticking and noises. Although the ticking mirrored the lack of time for the allies to evacuate, there was still room for Hans Zimmer to represent the awe and disaster of the situation but he failed to utilise this opportunity. All in all, from a world class director and composer I expected a lot more.
2.0~Only gets two stars because... jamesbertis Sign in Permalink ...it isn't Nolan's worst film. Where to begin? This was an all-star crew of filmmakers - cinematographer, vfx producer, sound designers and mixers, composer, producers, and yet somehow Nolan managed to undermine them all. I think the intent was to show the human side of the event by giving us, I suppose, three vignettes of individual stories. And at that it (sort of) works. It's at least a good idea for a film, even if it's completely botched by cinematography that spends more time being artistic than serving the story. Music is a powerful part of cinema and it's very apparent here because the score is literally the only thing that stirred any emotion in me at any point - when it wasn't making my entire body physically hurt. Maybe that was the point? To emulate the stress of actually being in combat? If so it's well executed. The actors did their very best to make you care about them but they're fighting the script every step of the way. They're given nothing to work with: at no point is a first name revealed, nor are we given any solid reason to care about any of them, no relatable moments; unless I suppose you've had a head injury, been shot or bombed, or swam the English Channel. The lack of dialog and overabundance of score combined with the lack of plot, almost non-linear narrative, and dependence on pretty cinematography make the whole thing feel more like an art film. Which is nice but if you want to make experimental cinema don't call it Dunkirk and sell it as a war film. Nolan has in the past given us excellent sound design, brilliant mixing, a good score, great dialog, and cinematography that doesn't get in the way of the story - sometimes more than one at a time. This film fails on almost every point. It could have been worse though. It could have been Interstellar - a film with its head so far up its own a#! that it's nearly unwatchable even once.
9.0~Nolan's World War II turixrios Sign in Permalink I was on the edge of my seat half the time. Dunkirk not only has the best visuals Cristopher Nolan can provide, but it has gripping action scenes. The movie doesn't have a hero or protagonist we can root for individually, it is based on three main point of view. From the air (pilot, Tom Hardy), from the ground (Fionn Whitehead), and from the ocean (Mark Rylance). This does not take away from the movie (in my opinion), rather it gives it a more realistic approach. The score is good, it doesn't vary from the same tones but its alright. Honestly I liked this movie based on how tense and thrilling it was, as I actually cared for what would happen and who would die. The actors were good in this movie, and Nolan once again did a good job as a director. If you are interested only in CGI heavy movies with a more character-based approach, I think you'll be vastly bored. But if you're a film enthusiast go see it for yourself :) My rating: 8.5/10
3.0~A lot of marketing, great Box Office revenue, but a massive turn off. chflouris Sign in Permalink There has been a massive hype for this movie on the radio and specifically BBC R2 where, Chris Evans was praising how good this movie was. The movie in my eyes has no real substance. It switches between 3 scenes, It has average to bad music, it doesn't provide any historical background, it has no dialogues, just a few lines and the constant annoying sound at the background is there to supposedly cause suspense, but in contrast it creates anxiety and is uncomfortable to watch or listen to. Last but not least, the film doesn't manage to show the scale of the Dunkirk evacuation. This is my opinion. I am sorry to say that I really struggle to find anything positive about the movie. If they gave a refund at the cinema i would have gone to ask for one. Apparently, paying a lot for advertising nowadays makes a movie a 9/10.. This is frankly sad, but I am glad other people can see the same side of the coin as myself. People that say this movie is a masterpiece, and they give a 10 star rating are deceiving other potential viewers. I give 3 stars because i want to be objective and say that on the graphic side of things there were good graphics.
8.0~👍Not close to Nolan's best, but a very good movie. junshiwilda Sign in Permalink I was blown away when I saw Dunkirk in the theaters. It was so thrilling just from the beginning sequence, and it kept that fast paced thriller until the end. The film is told in 3 perspectives;the land, the sky , and the sea. In all of those perspectives,I experienced a non stop thrill ride along with Hans Zimmer's score that sounds literally like a timer. The whole film is crafted with the fast paced tempo and time limitations. I really had a great experience watching it in a IMAX theater, and I just thought I was actually there in the movie. The only problem I have with this film is that it is a Christopher Nolan film. I felt like this film didn't have the complexity and uniqueness most of his other films have. Meaning this film doesn't feel like a Nolan film, and I will disagree with those of you who say Dunkirk is the best entry to Christopher Nolan's filmography. But overall, this is one of the best film made in 2017, and I will definitely recommend it.
6.0~An above average suspenseful war film alindsay-al Sign in Permalink With any Christopher Nolan film I had huge anticipation for Dunkirk and I have now seen it and I thought it was alright but definitely a disappointment. The premise of the film sees 400,000 men stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk, they look for escape by land, air and sea. The lead performer in this film is a new actor called fionn Whitehead and I found his performance to be really bland. He is a character with very few lines and he just comes across as a very boring person with nothing special to make you care about him anymore then anybody else in this film. The supporting cast is full of great actors, mark rylance plays a civilian who has a boat to go rescue survivors and he gives the best performance in this film. His character has depth to him as he goes beyond what Is necessary to try and save people even though it isn't his job and he sells this role with a great performance. Cillian Murphy is really good in this film, his altercations with rylance is the best character development in the film. Tom hardy plays a pilot in this film and even though he is mostly just in the cockpit he gives an intense performance that is good for what is required. Kenneth branagh is in this film as a captain of the military and he gives a good emotional performance in the role. The story in the film is pretty simple and it does work well seeing these different people trying to survive this dangerous situation. However, this film lacks any real humanity to the majority of the characters, I don't remember anybody's name in this film or if there is anything unique to them that I should have care about. The script has very little amounts of dialogue in it but it has some pretty decent dramatic dialogue especially between rylance and Murphy. But there isn't really enough dialogue to give it more compliments and no humour at all which isn't big negative for this film but was noticeable. The style of the film is absolutely breathtaking, the visuals are incredible especially when it comes to the fighter pilots where the action is breathtaking and visually stunning. Overall there are certain aspects of this film that are really good but I don't think it really is a must see film.
3.0~Really boring with a lack of character development Essex_Rider Sign in Permalink I hope I'm not the only person to find Dunkirk a quite boring film? There was virtually no character development, little dialogue and an almost surreal change of times. One scene the spitfires are flying in clear blue skies, then we see men in the water in the pitch black, then thinned out groups of soldiers on the beach in what looks like twilight (or early dawn). Mark Rylance and Cillian Murphy were vastly underused as was Tom Hardy. the film was bitty and frustrating.
7.0~Good, but overrated OneMovieLover Sign in Permalink "Dunkirk" is not a bad film, but it does not at all deserve the lavish praise that has been bestowed upon it by critics. Its chief problem is that it has no truly strong characters. Now, some people have said that this is a result of the nonlinear narrative, and they're wrong. The problem, rather, is simply inadequate character writing on Nolan's part. The narrative structure is arguably a strength, as it truly does cause us to feel – for a short while – the silliness and arbitrariness of war. The film's lack of strong character development, however, unsurprisingly becomes a more glaring fault as the film unfolds. Its best scenes are mostly in the last third, though the speech sequence at the very end is overly preachy and heavy-handed. "Dunkirk", ultimately, is an example of how realism to a film's subject does not make that film a masterpiece. Depth is needed; excellent characters are needed. I truly suspect that if you were to show any reasonably good film critic the first 40-50 minutes of this film and not tell them that Christopher Nolan directed it, they would likely see little difference between it and most blockbusters that they are forced to review every summer. Yes, Zimmer's score is strong, and there are moments of excellent camera-work. Nevertheless, the fact that this film is actually being lauded by not only audiences but even a fair number of critics as one of the greatest war films ever made makes me somewhat concerned about the future of film criticism in the United States. What makes "Dunkirk" as significant a work of art as "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Paths of Glory", or "Apocalypse Now"? Nothing, because it is nowhere near those films artistically and intellectually.
7.0~Immersive and visually immaculate, but not fully engaging PubHound Sign in Permalink 7 + I know this is not supposed to be the average war movie where you root for the protagonists but more of a "documentary" take on the genre, and I appreciate the intention, but in the end it often felt a little too repetitive and not as special as I expected it to be. Sure, there are a few memorable scenes, expecially in the beginning, but from then on there are very few surprises. The soundtrack was unexpectedly annoying most of the time.
3.0~A WWII movie with no German soldiers? FAIL! rogerarreola Sign in Permalink I will keep it short and simple. Boring, Boring, Boring. There are some good parts but overall, this movie was slow and at times was a little confusing. The British accents were so thick at times I think there should have been subtitles. The Germans have the Brits pinned down on a beach but there was not a single German solider in the movie. FAIL! German planes are bombing the beach and killing Brits but when they showed the dead soldiers, they were fully intact. Ummmm....You were killed by an aerial bomb that literally launched you 20 feet high and somehow you have all your limbs and no blood? FAIL! Wait for Red Box! Trust me....It's a total disappointment! This movie will probably win best picture or some other undeserved academy award just like Birdman won best picture.
10.0~Another Nolan masterpiece! jiggseven Sign in Permalink The cinematography, the scenarios... everything about this movie is epic and outstanding! Christopher Nolan is no doubt the best director of our times. I honestly would like to say something more but I honestly can't find words to describe how amazing and powerful this movie is! Nolan, thank you for making such incredible experiences! Now please go and watch this amazing movie! We all deserve it!
1.0~Wish I could give it a 0/10 brandonwalker-55251 Sign in Permalink Absolutely garbage film. The worst WW2 flick I've ever seen and 2 hours down the pan. There's probably more dialogue in Castaway than this lazy, poorly thought- out depiction of a truly epic real life event. Honestly, don't believe the hype and do not waste your money.
1.0~Arty, unrealistic, waste of time shattockalex Sign in Permalink I cannot believe the score this movie has. I know it is very arty with great cinematography and that is good, but I really expected more from Nolan. There was no sense of reality for the suffering that went on for those poor men on that beach or for the mass mobilisation of civilians to try and save them. Filmmakers these days have a moral and ethical obligation to tell these stories accurately, especially as very soon we will have lost all our veterans. Too many people believe everything that Hollywood portrays, the least they could do is be accurate. Please do not watch the movie.
5.0~Well made, but too PG-13 Random-Spectator Sign in Permalink It could've been an amazing documentary, had Nolan went a slightly different way with it. But as an action movie it's weak on action. As a drama it's weak on acting, character development and as whole completely failed to evoke any emotions in me. I didn't really care for any of the characters, there wasn't much happening at all and most importantly - for an "ultra realistic war experience" it lacked much in terms of actual realism and violence. You could feel the PG-13 in every scene, there's very little focus on suffering/death and it almost makes war look easy. I just expected the complete opposite from the reviews I've seen. I don't really get where Nolan was going with this. Loved every single one of his movies... until now.
5.0~Lots of noise but lack of scale ianmet-65148 Sign in Permalink Oh dear, where to begin? I expect that this film will now become the defining 'history' of Dunkirk for young people, many of whom probably confuse it with D-Day anyway. The big problem is that it lacks scale. The director wanted to avoid using CGI but as a result the beaches look like an out-of-season Morecambe, as someone put it. To be fair, he would have needed the combined manpower of the present-day British, French and German armies to replicate the scenes of 1940. And where were the vast quantities of trucks, guns and equipment destroyed by the army and abandoned on the beaches? Instead we were given half a dozen old lorries, fewer than you'd see in a scrapyard. Then the fabled 'armada of little ships' hove into view – with no more than about six to eight boats forming a pathetically small flotilla. At least Nolan managed to get weekend skipper Mark Rylance's dress right for the period – collar and tie. But he got it badly wrong for the troops being rescued. In the publicity still of the men gathered on the mole (jetty) they look as though they have popped out of an Airfix kit, with freshly painted helmets and uniforms straight from the QM's store. Not a dented, scarred or missing helmet, and not a missing or bloodied battledress blouse. No helmet straps worn over the brim and no other headgear (forage caps or berets) visible. No bandages or slings, just everyone in parade-ground order. Interestingly, Kenneth Branagh managed to stay stubble-free after seven days non-stop directing operations on the mole. I'll end there, except to note that when the men travelled back to London by train they did so in brightly-upholstered carriages that bore no resemblance to the brown-hued trains that I remember from the '50s and '60s, let alone those of the '30s which would still have been in use in the 1940s.
4.0~I had low expectations and it was still disappointing. room102 Sign in Permalink I always said that Nolan knows how to handle films technically and this one is not different. But this is a 100 min battle scene with almost no structure and very little character involvement/development and almost no emotional connection. Some of the scenes are impressive (I really liked the aerial footage) and the sound blasted the cinema. But it's not enough to make a good film. I didn't feel involved and even though the movie is only 100 min (pretty short in today's norm, which has become AT LEAST 2 hours long) it still felt pretty long. I should probably mention that the hand-held camera (especially in the beginning of the film) was way too shaky for my taste and felt very uncomfortable. Nolan has his hits and misses. He's very capable, but I still think he's one of the most overrated directors and whatever he'll do people will praise as the best movie ever made. 4/10 Disappointing
3.0~Wow, what are other people watching? martin-pace Sign in Permalink This movie came across as sterile, in the extreme. It really did look like what it was - a big budget movie based on events from 1940 shot on location in 2017! I find it hard to believe this movie had a budget of circa $100 million. The aerial action scenes were just not exciting - they should have been with the budget involved. The whole 'panorama' of human activity in this movie just seemed listless and bereft of any heart/passion. Perhaps this is someones interpretation of how the operation developed, but somehow it just does not captures the rawness of war for me. After watching Hacksaw ridge a while back (and thoroughly enjoying it)this just did not work on any level for me. I really could not get engaged with any of the characters, the visuals I did not find particularly awe inspiring and there was little sense of urgency - which led to a feeling that whatever action was being portrayed it almost felt out of context and didn't matter anyway. Momentum was not built up in this movie and the differing stories being developed (the aerial, the rescue and what was going on, on the beach) did not bring the story to any fulfilling conclusion.
1.0~too much visual, poor writing cgoncalves-05898 Sign in Permalink Nolan goes overboard with the visuals, but forgets that a movie must have a good writing behind it, some emotion, I wasn't able to feel invested in any of the characters. For a war movie, there wasn't any tear dropper moment. It felt more like a survivor mode kind of movie, which is great and all, but I missed the feelings behind the whole history. Not a bad movie, but after creating this huge expectations I can't help but feel very disappointed.
1.0~a disappointing cinematic experience waugh-4 Sign in Permalink Well, that was an experience! I've just seen 'Dunkirk' the film. Hard to be rational about it after all the hype and expectation but I can honestly say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. A film with no meaningful story-line or content but plenty of bombast. And noise. Oh, the noise, the noise! It was loud, excruciatingly loud, unnaturally and unnecessarily so, far beyond the pain barrier for my ears. Which I had to cover for much of it as I found it so physically painful. Why so loud? I came out of it reeling and shell-shocked. And as for the 70mm IMAX giant screen experience, what nonsense. I get sharper and better quality pictures on my home TV. It was just very much bigger. The actors wee Mark Rylance and wee Kenneth Branagh were cruising, not having to act at all, just look heroic, misty-eyed and lantern-jawed from time to time, and think of the money. And given given the budget it was disappointing to keep seeing the same three Spitfires, one German Me109 and a single Heinkel He111 in the same shots over and over again. And as for that near-end shot of a burning Spitfire on Dunkirk beach set to Elgar's jingoistic music, that said it all.
10.0~LAND, SEA AND AIR....All in one Film...DUNKIRK adityadshriramwar Sign in Permalink "Dunkirk" IS MUST WATCH FILM... First I would like to appreciate the cast and every technician for making such DIFFICULT film possible. This is First WAR film which was ever made where all aspects of war like LAND , SEA and AIR are covered EXTENSIVELY in one film. That itself is humongous task and Nolan took that challenge and delivered it excellently. I would like to say that every one should go and watch the film.. It deserves one viewing at least in theater (IMAX). MY BEST SCENE :- After the war is over..British soldiers return to England where in one blind man (JOHN NOLAN) giving blankets to the arrived soldiers and praising them for their bravery... Harry Style says :- What we did is just barely survive.. Blind Man says:- Survival is more than enough... (I got goosebumps) Thanks NOLAN for this WONDERFUL film.
6.0~Ouch! rwassmer-75884 Sign in Permalink In a word, disappointing. The film shows 300,000+ mostly brutish, selfish and hateful British troops rescued in Biblical fashion by an armada of little boats crewed by saints. Vast numbers of troops left on warships from the mole or ferried to them by the small vessels. On only one day out of 9 were more taken off the beaches as via the harbor. Poor weather actually limited German air interference over several crucial days - every day looked sunny and fair in the film. One personal observation: Not sure why these Tommies were in the service rather than in the cinema as they all looked like Hollywood heartthrobs - right down to a perfect set of choppers on every last one of them. Very artificial and unsympathetic. My rating of 6 is a nod to the superior air combat scenes.
1.0~A rape of history and an insult to french memory rvvincent-85019 Sign in Permalink Please avoid watching this movie which have absolutely no respect for history, is full of anachronisms and is a grotesque apology of anglo-saxon superiority. Learn an read about history. Nolan made a blockbuster probably to please American public. For the rest of the world an especially in France it represents an insult to the thousand of french soldiers who died to allow escape of the English troops. Prefer "week end a zuydcoote" of Henri Verneuil far better.
6.0~Without The expected Impact SlickRick Sign in Permalink 340,000 soldiers, 700 privately owned craft, but you'd never know it watching the film. A wasted opportunity to convey the super human effort it took to evacuate a whole army from the beaches of Dunkirk. I was really disappointed with this movie. I had high hopes, being that the event was so incredible. With all the fantastic special effects at the disposal of the director, how is it that this film missed out on the most amazing aspect of this historic rescue. 50 ships, a few thousand men, that's how it comes across in the film.
1.0~How do you type a yawn sound? nazgul-15776 Sign in Permalink where to start ... WW2 ended over 70 years ago, so I thought it was the time to tell true stories about what happened back then, but I guess I was wrong, and the allies still need some sort of ego- boosters, where the Germans are portrayed as dumb with fighters made of paper. The movie is very boring and slow to be categorized under war genre, and you can see that clearly even on the faces of the actors ... 400,000 soldiers trapped on a beach, should be a movie scene that everyone will remember for years, yet all we saw were few bored soldiers standing in lines as if they were waiting for bathroom... the lines of people at movie theaters who went to watch this movie looked more crowded and alive than the 400K !! And where are all those civilians boats which everyone was talking about? I thought it was gonna be a huge fleet, yet they were no more than a dozen of them !!!! I am not gonna mention the background music as this was a disaster which needs a separate review by itself... save your time and maybe spend your money on buying any WW2 game which will be 100 times more exciting than watching this
10.0~An Engaging Experience crizzy-78932 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk engages the audience from the first scene. The soldiers of the British army are being directed by their comrades to the beach at Dunkirk. Thousands of soldiers are lining up with great dignity to patiently await their rescue. Churchill has requisitioned civilian boats to pick them up. So, you ask with great anxiety about the result of the herculean effort to rescue and deliver the soldiers to Britain, did Harry Styles survive to the end of the movie? My answer is: go and see. The visual display,the persistent and exciting percussion of the musical score, the booming zooms of the aircraft, bombs, gun fire, and other sounds of war immediately brought me to the beach at Dunkirk while my gut rumbled and vibrated in my seat. I became a soldier on that beach, a Spitfire pilot, and an officer of the Royal British Army. I felt excitement, desperation, patience, forgiveness, sacrifice, empathy, the thrill of the rescue effort, and the possible consequential joy of being able to go home. This movie is an artistically delivered rendition of what it means to be a soldier, a sailor, and an officer. Will you be rescued? Will the support of the Royal Air Force be enough to get you off that beach and back into your family kitchen at home? I urge you to experience what I felt in watching Dunkirk. It's a movie that dramatically emphasizes the importance of persistence, strategy, and humanity in the war against impossibility. Ten fingers.﻿
4.0~Worst Nolan movie so far ivanpetricevic-88877 Sign in Permalink I expected much from this movie, but got nothing. Besides nice effects and good music film is below average. First, it is inaccurate, because Hitler let British troops get away, it was not their effort, but just the mercy of the Nazis. Second, story is very weak, in few words you have British&French forces pinned down by the shore and few boats rescuing them. Caracthers are undeveloped, for example Tom Hardy speaks maybe 10 lines and he is wearing mask all the time. Harry Styles is actually good. There are few acts of so called 'bravery' and after that film ends. By far, worst movie from Nolan to date. Big mess, weak story, ignoring historical facts. 4/10 and I am generous.
10.0~people complaining annoy me archiestarnorris Sign in Permalink This is one of the most compelling and exiting """""""""""war films"""""""""""""" ever. people are complaining about it being a dissapointing film because they thought it would be like hacksaw ridge or saving private ryan. this on the other hand this isnt a war film its a survival film.
1.0~BORING k-karakostas09-440-444085 Sign in Permalink When there aren't main characters it's just one boring and soulless scene after the other. I can't remember the las time I did not watch a movie till the end just out of pure boredom.
2.0~Scutter. kaneciaran Sign in Permalink Pure and utter scutter.not even a war film.one of the most boring over rated films ever made.
8.0~Credible WWII Movie Inevitably Laced with Computer Effects adrian-43767 Sign in Permalink Good WWII movie, admitting early on that historical accuracy is not its intention, and told in Quentin Tarantino fashion, flashing back and forward between incidents involving army, navy and air forces trying to flee Dunkirk (France), or help others make their way back to the UK. According to Commander Bolton (played by Branagh), 400,000 men were on beaches of Dunkirk awaiting removal, and supposedly only about 10% of those men would get out of France - or so were Winston Churchill's calculations because the overriding priority was to use all resources to protect UK territory. Direction is sound, photography competent (though computer effects are obvious), and acting is in such small patches by so many people that no one really stands out, with the possible exceptions of Mark Rylance, who embodies the famous courage of common British people as he takes his small yacht to Dunkirk and rescues British forces stranded at sea along the way; and Tom Hardy, who gets the plum part of the Spitfire pilot shooting the hell out of Messerschmidts and Heynckels. It is refreshing to see a movie about Brits played by Brits, no Americans about, which is historically accurate as the USA pursued its isolationist policy at the time. It is also credible that, at the beginning of the movie, the Brits should want their countrymen to travel first out of France and leave the French to their fate. It is not so credible that, by the end of the movie, Commander Bolton should say that he wants to stay behind to help the French get out, nor do I imagine the Admiralty agreeing to such a senior officer staying potentially within grasp of the enemy just to help the "frogs." It is an unfortunately overly sentimental touch that - in my humble opinion - smacks of Brexit apology. In fact, what happened was that Churchill ordered the destruction of the French Navy's fleet, then the world's largest, so it would not fall into German hands and be used against Great Britain -- and many of the French ships were sunk with French servicemen inside. So much for helping the "frogs"... Perhaps that is why Nolan is not interested in historical accuracy about the events at Dunkirk. All told, it is a film well worth watching that pays deserved homage to the British people's courage, intelligence, resourcefulness, firmness of purpose, and capacity to find the silver lining in the direst of situations.
6.0~Well Made, Not For Everyone MarkoutTV Sign in Permalink This movie is an audiovisual masterpiece, and I am not one to throw the term "masterpiece" around loosely. The cinematography is flat out excellent, as is to be expected from Christopher Nolan. His skills are unmatched when it comes to playing with one's perspective. There's one angle in the film where you see a soldier climbing up the bow of a ship, and the camera sticks with the ship in such a way that it isn't until the last moment that you realize that the ship is in fact capsizing at the very same moment this man was hoping this ship would be his salvation. A single camera trick did so much more to convey the terror and hopelessness of war than a million war movies. It's this kind of camera-work that I simply do not see any other director performing and certainly not to this degree. The audio is equally stellar. Most sounds that you take for granted in a war film: bullets firing, bombs exploding, planes flying and the like stand out in spades here. They all have such a weight to them that each individual example of them stands out in a way that is normally impossible, given the desensitivity to war that we have after scores of Michael Bay atrocities. The sheer brilliance of the cinematography and sound design drastically limits how low my rating can realistically be. But despite those positive points, my rating is indeed lower than most people's. There's a disconnect between this film and myself, and it is this: it can be the most visually pleasing film on the planet. It can have unrivaled sound design, breathtaking action and peerless cinematography. If the movie (especially one marketed as a war-time drama) fails to make me care about what's on the screen, then it's not a ten-star film. And this movie did very little to make me care. The first time a plane flew over head with a deafening roar and dropped bombs on thousands of desperate and defenseless men who want nothing more than to just go home, it was powerful. The first time our battered and bruised heroes (or at least the closest thing this film has to heroes) think they are on the brink of finally getting a break, only for a surprise attack to dash their hopes, it was devastating. The problem is once you have adjusted to the brilliance of the direction, and slightly different versions of the same events occur (bombing attack, plane dogfighting, submarine attack, sinking ships, etc.) a second, third and fourth time, it begins to feel empty. The problem is simple. The film focuses so much on telling so many different stories that it doesn't take enough time to give us a reason to care about any of these characters. What is their story, who are they, what is their defining attribute, beyond the fact that they're on the good side, why should we want them to survive, what is their freaking name? When someone in this film comes so close to escape, only to meet an unfortunate end, my thought eventually became: "well that's a shame, but it'd probably impact me more if I knew anything about this dude. He could be a terrible person. Maybe he left his wife and kids. Maybe he runs a dogfighting ring. What if he doesn't even use his turn signal when he drives? Wait, did they even have turn signals back then? How much longer is this movie? 40 minutes? Crap." Defenders of this movie will say that it doesn't focus on individuals in order to focus on the real main character: the war. They'll say that the point of this movie is simply to tell the true story of this harrowing historical event, and that's a valid defense. But the problem is: do you know what you get when you just tell the story of a historical event verbatim, without taking the liberty to add the character and drama necessary to make it fun and relatable? You get a textbook. A documentary. And the problem is that it was marketed as a movie. If it was marketed as a documentary, it would be one of the greatest of all time. As a movie, it's one of the longest hour and 46 minutes I've spent in a theater. If it wasn't for the visual and audio fidelity, this film would be more at home at midnight on the History Channel than in a movie theater, and there's nothing wrong with that. I like history documentaries. I just wish I knew that's what I was spending $12 to see. Traditions exist for a reason, and traditional filmmaking dictates that films have characters. Characters that grow. Characters you understand to some degree. Characters with motivations and backstories that make you want to go on a journey with them. Instead, this film is just a series of events. A series of unfortunate events to boot. And if that's what you want to see, I'd instead just recommend the Series of Unfortunate Events book and Netflix series. At least those have interesting characters (maximum sass). Despite all my bellyaching, I do recommend you see this film, particularly in the theater. For one, outside a theater, it loses about the one thing it actually has going for it: the excellent audio experience. But also, because I am in a very strong minority so just from a statistical odds perspective, you'll probably like it. This review exists for two reasons: one, to get expectations in line. Do not expect a traditional movie here. This is a collection of oft- repetitive occurrences held together by excellent direction, nothing more or less. But it's extremely well made. And two, so some of the more pretentious defenders of the movie can see that someone can get the point of the film and still not particularly like it. Opinions, man.
4.0~Surprisingly boring botond-kopacz Sign in Permalink I've watched in IMAX where you get the full IMAX experience. And I got it, image was OK, sound was OK. But still, the story itself - which would be an exciting story - was super boring. I never felt a moment of excitement. Probably Hans Zimmer's music didn't helped a lot in feeling this. Storytelling was also too much, repetitive scenes, events all over the story which makes you fell asleep. Perhaps was intentional, to feel that "foreverness of time" of the solders, but still, movies are about entertainment, and an IMAX camera is not enough for that.
10.0~Absolutely Magnificent! AlixSinnamon Sign in Permalink I am not someone who generally enjoys war movies; I went to this fully expecting it to just be something the boyfriend would enjoy. I was so very, very wrong. This movie is, essentially, wonderful. I can't praise it enough. Literally the only issue was the strange way the timeline occurs. There are three separate timelines that involve three separate groups of characters and we didn't figure it out until about a quarter of the way into the movie. It actually didn't ruin anything, however. Very rarely does a movie's fault actually add to the experience, but honestly this made it much more intense. At the end, when all the timelines converge, any viewer should see what a brilliant choice Nolan made in using this unique format. As for everything else, it is perfect in every way. It wasn't overdone, it wasn't underdone. It should go down in history as a staple of perfect cinema. Even though it isn't a 'buddy' type war movie, you still feel immensely for all the characters. This movie also isn't dialogue heavy, but there are definite character arcs and development that is intensely compelling. The cg effects blend seamlessly with the practical effects, which is always a relief. There's nothing worse than overdone cg; it ruins the immersion and makes it difficult to suspend disbelief. Speaking of disbelief, every second of this film is absolutely believable because Nolan crafted it so masterfully. He did everyone perfect in every way to make it historically accurate. It is more accurate than a real documentary. This film was so lovely and intense with the exact amounts of subtlety while still punching you in the face that I ended up in tears for the last half. Dunkirk should win ALL the awards.
4.0~Typically Nolan Alanjackd Sign in Permalink Nolan has an eye for action...but when it comes to dialogue and story he lacks . A well taught history lesson would have had more heart and emotion. As with other "nolanesque" features we keep waiting for the reveal at the end of a massive build up...but alas nothing delivers. Mark Rylance ..who became an overnight sensation in Bridge of spies...cold not help...and seemed to just plod along. After watching this I would suggest watching Saving Private Ryan to see the difference. Not really well made to be honest and I think the subject matter deserved much better. I would imagine people who visit the cinema every now and again would probably get wound up in the hype...but for serious cinema - goers like me..we know the difference.
6.0~Realistic, but boring tstromsn Sign in Permalink In this movie, you are a fly on the wall watching scenarios from various soldiers and civilians during the battle of Dunkirk. You don't get to know the characters therefore care very little of what will happened to them. It's portrayed quite realistically. The flight sequences are the best one, but they are not long sadly and quite far in between. Everything looks authentic. Could not tell where it was used CGI. Recommended to war buffs and history freaks. If you want an exciting and good story, look elsewhere.
8.0~we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan lasttimeisaw Sign in Permalink From a point-of-view of an inveterate pacifist, any war film shouldn't be bothered to watch, whether it wields its anti-war flag or not, because it is either flogging a dead horse or being brazenly repugnant. But when one is made by Christopher Nolan, there is no excuse for a film buff to dodge from facing the man-made atrocity dutifully affixed with adequate dosage of individual heroism gleaming as the silver lining (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a clear forefather), and this is DUNKIRK. Without any question, Mr. Nolan envisions and executes an immersive experience for pampering audience to vicariously partake in the action, its triptych structural arrangement from land, sea, and air with different temporalities starts as a tad discombobulating, but before long would we be utterly blown away by the sheer mastery of its grand-scale imagery and sonic accompaniment, in particular that muffled ticking sound blanketing the infantry pawns as they are continuously besieged by aerial attack, torpedo charge and stray bullets, our protagonist on the land is the Private Tommy, played by a young Tom Courtenay ringer, the rookie Fionn Whitehead, who has no intention to be heroic at any rate when the priority is simply to stay alive. He is first paired with Gibson (Barnard), so as to take a chance of getting on board of a departing warship along with those who are injured, which doesn't work. After biding their time hidden themselves under the mole, they finally land on their feet on another ship, surprisingly, Gibson chooses to stay away from his fellow compatriots, a decision which prompts his life-saving conduct when the ship is sinking underwater, among whom he saves are Peter and Alex (Styles), but the real reason behind that decision will boomerang later, which the ingrate Alex should partially answer for. Here Nolan's script pluckily wrestles with the shadowy underside of the internecine conflicts among the Allies, when nationality hogging the precedence over individual lives. And it is interesting to divine why Nolan doesn't swap the upshots of Alex and Gibson if he really wants to state a point. On the sea, the evacuation aided by boats of civilians brings to the fore of an ordinary family's selfless deeds in a perilous situation, Mark Rylance superbly plays Mr. Dawson, a seafarer who has already lost a son to the war and volunteers to the rescue mission with another son Peter (Glynn- Carney) and a young helper George (Keoghan) in his own boat, en route, they successfully come to aid to a soldier on the flotsam (Murphy, in his best shell-shocked form) and a British pilot (Lowden) almost trapped to death in the cockpit before sailing near Dunkirk, but one might feel a bit disappointed that even Nolan has to predictably yield to the last-second-succor schtick in his own script. The Dawson's involvement also poignantly brings home to us the inconvenient truth: being heroic also entails that one must pay its price, however unpleasant it is. In the firmament, British Supermarine Spitfires (although riddled with malfunctions) engage in dogfight with German bombers, they are the guardian angels of those defenseless earth-bound foot soldiers and unwieldy vessels, Tom Hardy, as one of the pilots, is the ultimate hero specimen, laconic, unfazed and cool-headed, a sublimed understated performance. DUNKIRK's robust box-office revenue bears witness to a reassuring fact that a director's name can still usurp bankability from film stars (whose power is actually dwindling significantly into the 21st century), because auteurism shouldn't only to be ensconced on the art house sphere, it should be the new norm if our film industry needs to prosper, we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan and maybe this time, Academy members can finally cave in.
10.0~Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle somf Sign in Permalink Saw an early screening tonight in Denver. I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all. How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly. When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself. The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good. I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it.
10.0~Revisiting DUNKIRK virek213 Sign in Permalink British director Christopher Nolan is known for being an individualist when it comes to the films he does. Although he is known for doing "commercial" films like BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, many others have seen a more complex side to Mr. Nolan with such psychological thrillers as 2000's MEMENTO; 2002's INSOMNIA; and 2010's INCEPTION, as well as his 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR (a film to be placed up there with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY). Now, in 2017, he tackles the dark subject of the early part of World War II in DUNKIRK. The film essentially ties five different plot lines into the evacuation of French, Dutch, and British soldiers from the French city of Dunkirk in the late spring of 1940 as the German army is about to sweep in and annihilate them. This includes, among other things, British civilians evacuating as many soldiers as they can on the dangerous English Channel crossing, including one portrayed in usual brilliant low-key style by Mark Rylance. Apart from the appearances of Rylance; Kenneth Branagh as an English commander; and Harry Styles as one of the British soldiers caught up in the horror of this battle, most of the actors are young and anonymous types convincingly portraying average people caught up in an apocalypse that threatens to engulf not only England and Europe, but the entire human race. In an era where linear spectacle is the order of the day, Nolan does just the opposite, intertwining several different strands into one complete film, with a maximum amount of visual spectacle, but also putting this battle into focus in a mere hour and fifty minutes. While Nolan doesn't go into the graphic horror of the opening D-Day invasion of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he nevertheless makes the tension palpable the entire time. Nolan wisely doesn't explain all that much, which is what any good filmmaker, especially if he has written and directed the film (as is the case here), should do. This is what makes DUNKIRK a compelling film, and a sure contender for one of the best films of 2017.
5.0~Red Badge of Dunkirk? DWilson100 Sign in Permalink Where to begin... The "soldier lost in the complexity of war" has been done before, and I had high hopes for the film, but I was just disappointed. First, this movie is grim. Not grotesque, just depressing and grim, so prepare yourself. After reflecting on it a while, I think the movie just felt too thin. Thin on scale, thin on character development, thin on dialogue. For a movie called "Dunkirk", if you don't know anything about the battle going in, don't expect much coming out. It's really 3 interwoven vignettes about personal experiences during the battle, mainly 1 group fighting (air), 1 group running away (land), and 1 group trying to get into battle (sea). But for a massive operation with hundreds of planes and ships and hundreds of thousands of men, it just felt puny. Imagine a movie about D-Day where the invasion force is 3 allies against 3 Germans on the beach, with a couple of planes and a ship tossed in for drama. That's the feel. Movies like this can work if they have the feel of man as a small cog in massive machinery, but this just missed the mark for me. And the music was grating. Several times it overtook the screen action in a glaring, bad way. Just not a very good film. Not a total clunker, but not great by ANY means.
9.0~A Psychological War Film SquigglyCrunch Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is the story of the allied troops who were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk and surrounded by German soldiers as they try to survive and escape, meanwhile volunteers sail their boats out to save the soldiers, meanwhile fighter planes attempt to defend the soldiers on the beach from German bombers. Typical to Christopher Nolan, this movie is fantastic. Nolan directs the crap out of it. Not only is his camera-work fantastic, but the scenery he captures is beautiful. They manage to really nail the tone, with it being a little claustrophobic despite the location being a massive beach. The characters are stuck and there is absolutely no way for them to escape. Right from the opening scene, Nolan nails the tone and realism of the film. On top of that, Hans Zimmer's score is far from only being the icing on the cake. In truth, the music proves to be something of a major character, assisting in the carrying of the rest of the cast through this horrible event. The music perfectly suits every situation, and whether or not you feel for the characters, the music makes sure you at least feel a little tense. Speaking of the characters, there really aren't any. Sure, there are like 300,000 soldiers on the beach, yet we still feel for them. The main character has maybe four lines in the movie, yet the reason why he's so good along with the rest of the characters is because the movie sets up this horrible situation and instead of filling the movie with gratuitous war violence, a lot of it is psychological. When a character is desperately trying to escape from drowning you definitely feel for them. I don't know about you, but I don't want to drown. And even without speaking, the characters make decisions and do things that are completely logical and understandable. There are no dumb people in this movie, and as a result they prove to be very human. There is so much humanity in these characters, so it's very easy to relate to them in some way. Part of why the characters are so humane, however, is because of the acting. From the big names like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh, to the first-timers like Fionn Whitehead, there is not a single bad, or even average, performance in this movie. The lead, Whitehead, is absolutely outstanding in his first full-length film role, pulling off a very human performance simply by the way he moves, acts, and reacts. My personal favorite, however, was Cillian Murphy. He plays a shell-shocked soldier and absolutely nails it for the short amount of time he spends on screen. His character holds so much depth and intrigue, I looked forward to every moment he spent on screen. The movie feels real too. The gunshots sound real, and the way the action scenes are shot are in-the-moment and authentic. When Hardy flies his plane and attempts to shoot down others, it's not epic. It's not really even that fast-paced. It's honestly just kind of tedious and frustrating, watching him carefully line up his shot before shooting. And again, the claustrophobia is very real. We get plenty of in-the-cockpit shots that show just how incredibly uncomfortable it would've been in that plane. Again, it's very real and no matter how 'weak' the characters are I felt for each one. And there's so little hope in this movie. Characters end up in terrible situations and don't always get saved last minute. Things happen that would happen in real life but in a conventional movie? No way. Just when you think the movie may be divulging to conventionalism it throws a grenade at your face and you remember that this is real. Towards the end of the movie it felt a little over-dramatic. The music, the narration, the way it was shot. Of course then I remembered that this was a dramatic event. What happened was not pretentious, it was a big deal. Deciding to use a dramatic filming style at the end made sense. If I can find one problem with this movie, it's that at times it felt a little slow. Not that it wasn't interesting, the movie is fantastic at showing the audience what happened without making it long and boring, but it does slow down from time to time. Certain moments may feel a little out of place, but in terms of the plot still make sense. Overall Dunkirk is fantastic. Just about everything works, and you should absolutely go see it. From the music to the directing to the acting, it's great. Go see it. It's worth your money.
4.0~War for Generation Y jazzjeppe Sign in Permalink Regarding the movie Dunkirk When Saving Private Ryan premiered in Bristol 1998, I was the youngest person in the theatre. Around me were elderly English war vets. I could tell, they wore their veteran uniforms and veteran badges. During a couple of hours elderly men and women quietly sobbed in their seats watching, and possibly reliving, the war all over again. This wasn't a normal cinema experience and I don't think I will ever experience one like this again. It changed my view on war and the fact that I and my country Sweden, in fact have no experience of war in modern time. But we are pretty much the only ones in Europe, or the entire world for that matter, with a 200 year history without wars. Steven Spielberg pulled this off. He made Europe remember WWII all over again and he educated the young and helped (?) elderly to closure. Spielberg is a movie maker who knows very well his genres and how to not mess with them. Enter Chris Nolan. A movie maker famous and known for science fiction and fantasy. With Dunkirk he shows at least me that he is as predictable as a dull Adam Sandler. My biggest concern when I sat down to watch Dunkirk was weather Nolan would stay true to the genre or if he would put his sci-fi magic into it. After ten minutes I realised I was watching Interstellar again and I had to fight the urge to actually leave the theatre. What annoyed me the most was the sci-fi sound effects, scifi music score and the shallowness of the historical event. Is the movie good? Well, Nolan's fans will probably like it, Generation Y will like it but people who, like me, had a life changing experience with Saving Private Ryan, won't be as thrilled or impressed. Imagine Schindler's List in the hands of Christopher Nolan. Darn right, thanks but no thanks. I didn't like it at all.
3.0~What a waste (the movie not the war) speaktomenow Sign in Permalink I can't see how this is sitting on a 8+ rating on IMDB. It's a 6 at best, and I give it a three - for the wasted opportunity here that it could have been. The story of the evacuation of soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk is so gripping, and so important it's hard to imagine you could mess it up - just tell the story on the big screen. And yet...they somehow fail to do that. The story is seen through the eyes of just a few characters, and this robs a powerful tale of any scope or scale. It's just basically a one day quick rescue, with a single air battle and a couple of ships. Also there are barely any soliders on the beaches? This is so sad and such a huge waste of money. A boring and pointless waste of what should have been an amazing movie. You won't see this getting any oscars any time soon. Very expensive, and very easy to pass on. Go watch something else.
1.0~Wtf..... nathanwagenaar Sign in Permalink All the good ratings on here made me really want to enjoy this war epic but seriously WTF... this movie is so bad . Boring with very little action. DONT WATCH
6.0~Good but over-hyped Badsharkmoviefan_118 Sign in Permalink I write this review when this movie has a high rating making it the greatest movie of all time I think for the most part this is Nolan fan boys and fan girls it really isn't that great. To me a war movie should invoke a huge emotional response. It should bring you to tears and have you leaving the cinema thinking wow I hope I never have to be put in that position. The great war movies of the past have invoked that response from me. Even Hacksaw Ridge from last year I felt so much emotions watching it. I didn't get that with this movie at all. This movie is so beautiful shot it is truly amazing but it has little else on offer. I found the British accents hard to understand at time like I needed subtitles. I get it is a British movie so this isn't really a complaint but it did lessen it's appeal to me. I also found the directing to at times feel messy. All the interweaving stories made it hard to really get into the movie. I really feel this movie is overrated it is not a bad movie but Nolan really is not as good as people make out he is. This is a bit over-hyped and not even the best movie this year let alone of all time.
10.0~The battle of Dunkirk aveman-10047 Sign in Permalink One of the best war movies I have ever watched and the sound is amazing!!!!In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.
2.0~Save your money pthef Sign in Permalink I love war movies, I downright love them, so I went to see this recently with high expectations. Those expectations were soon dashed against a rock. This movie ... it tried to tell three stories, but told all three stories poorly. Everyone in it was two-dimensional, and it was impossible to feel a connection with any character, not even the one played by the ordinarily brilliant Thespian Kenneth Branagh. It was like the entire cast, including Branagh, were an assembly of extras. There was precious little dialog, and this movie was an utter stink bomb. This could have been a brilliant movie. Indeed, it should have been a brilliant movie. All the elements were there for a brilliant movie, but it was about like going to a ball game and someone runs the bases backward, an epic fail.
1.0~Awful cogsinister Sign in Permalink Whilst writing this review, it asks me at the bottom of the page if it contains spoilers. Well, yes it does. As when I say it's quite easily in the top 10 of the worst films I've ever watched and what I'm doing is saying it's a terrible film. I suppose that could classify it as a spoiler. No I'm not describing any events that happened in the film far from it....as watching a spot on the wall would be more entertaining than this complete and utter dross... Not only is it terrible, but you could also throw in a lot of swear words in also to emphasise even more how dreadful the film is.... Do yourself a huge favour. Don't watch this.
2.0~Boring Film.... kevmac-40897 Sign in Permalink Found it hard to keep up at what was happening. Confusion seemed to be the theme of this movie, and the sound track was awful. I knew the Spitfire was a good plane but I certainly didn't know that it could fly around for ages with no engine.
4.0~It is Quite A Tragedy aharmas Sign in Permalink Technically the film is a wonder. Nolan put me in the middle of the experience. The punishment on my ears will need a couple of hours to subside. I've noticed some reviewers writing about the story. In still trying to figure out if there was any. There were plenty of disjointed scenes edited in such a way that it bother me more than the massacres on screen. In the end. I can't remember any other time I felt so lost at the end of a movie. There were some spectacular moments that makes me appreciate the quality of the special effects and the director's technical prowess. Unfortunately, what we get throughout is an exercise in fragmentation. With barely a thread of a story we can only say we feel as lost as the stranded soldiers hoping something would put us out of our misery as the constant barrage of explosions and foreign continued endlessly. Sadly, the film could have starred no one special as all the major talent keeps looking a way from the camera or is in the dark, facing down, or covered with oil. There is very little emotion here and we get the idea by default. The Nazis are very bad and guns kill. I do have to acknowledge the imaginative score by Zimmer, probably one of his beat giving us the promise of much better stuff to come but after the first 10 minutes, I felt as hopeless as the soldiers in Dunkirk. It is hard to care for anyone when there's so little given as background. Would it have killed Nolan to have ar least one complete character? Posing nobly waiting for the ultimate demise doesn't count. Maybe we will get him back to the heights of his Batman trilogy. Not everyone hits a home run every time. If you like fireworks you're in for a treat, otherwise prepare yourself for the longest day of your life.
4.0~Overhype reviews menboy Sign in Permalink A few boats, a few planes, soldiers in peril and that summarizes this movie. There is no character development. There is no comparison to the great movies like The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan or Patton and I just can't understand the high reviews and a score of 8.5 of this movie.
1.0~A complete waste of time mipas1 Sign in Permalink What a complete waste of my time!!! This movie is horrible and boring. Tom Hardy is great actor and this movie is not worth his skills.
8.0~Engrossing, immersive war drama grantss Sign in Permalink May/June 1940. 400,000 British soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two RAF fighter pilots and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet. Engrossing, immersive war drama. Hooks you from the word go and keeps you hanging on to the very end. Great action scenes with stunning visual and sound effects - very realistic. The sound of the Stukas diving is chilling. Quite a departure for director Christopher Nolan. Clever fictional dramas (eg Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar) tend to be his forte and an historical war drama seems, on paper, too constraining for his imagination. Yet, he pulls it off with aplomb, and uses his talent for mind-games in doing so. The three separate stories operating at different times and eventually syncing provides the alternative to what would otherwise have been a linear, less interesting story. Not perfect though, and certainly not in the same league as the masterpieces among war movies - eg Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Full Metal Jacket, Cross of Iron, Das Boot, Platoon, The Deer Hunter. Some plot developments and actions seem implausible and dumbed-down for a wider, more ignorant audience, and to simple make for greater drama. Tom Hardy's endless supply of ammunition (and 5 kills, including one while gliding) was a touch laughable. Rifle fire being able to penetrate the metal hull of a ship was interesting too... Allied with this, the movie is not as gritty as it could have been. Yes, we see death and destruction everywhere, but some things seem straight out of the book of Hollywood war movie clichés. In addition, the characters aren't that engaging - this is definitely a plot-driven drama, despite focusing on a handful of characters. Not a masterpiece, but very good nevertheless and certainly worth watching.
7.0~Shrug-worthy, meh ---Nolan's first big disappointing epic (borefest) george.schmidt Sign in Permalink DUNKIRK (2017) **1/2 Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Barry Keoghan, Tom Glynn-Carney, Harry Styles. Rather disappointing WWII true-life account of the Brits against Germany from filmmaker Christopher Nolan largely stemming from underwhelming performances from the mostly no-name, one-note actors (in spite the sprinkling of vet Nolan regulars who all have the same logy, water-logged deliveries) and the inaudible, low-speaking dialogue with hard to decipher dialogue (who is this? what are they talking about?) and the fact all the young actors look vaguely alike (yes I get it, that's how it is normally in war pics to begin with but this is one trope I find truly maddening and not since Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' have I ever just not given a damn about any of the characters in a war setting (!) Yes it's historical but you know so what? The only saving grace is the IMAX cinematography thanks to lensman Hoyte Van Hoytema and truly I hate to admit this (and I love him!) but Hans Zimmer's relentless drone of a 'score' just.does.not.let.up.for.one.note! Shrug-worthy, meh ---
4.0~Lost Opportunity andrew-riddell-1 Sign in Permalink I totally love WW2 movies, so when the trailers for Dunkirk came out it was a definite one to see. Dunkirk was a true testament to the British people who sailed out in small boats to bring home the BEF. This was a true story of heroic private citizens saving the day, so did the movie show the true scale of this remarkable feat. In my opinion it did not, you never felt the monumental scale of the evacuation or the danger that the BEF were subjected to on the beach. Instead the focus was on a few characters and what they went through, now this may have worked better if it wasn't for the fact that their stories and how the all interact doesn't happen at the same time. One minute you are at night with one character and then during the day with another, why the story wasn't filmed as each character went through their own individual stories is a missed opportunity. Dunkirk is at best a good movie but no classic war movie, so it will not end up there with the greats.
1.0~Had high expectations but unfortunately omairdoc Sign in Permalink I was hoping for real war scenes and some action But unfortunately it was like a documentary not a war film Please look for another film of this type of genre
1.0~106 minutes of my life wasted geoharrigan-92118 Sign in Permalink Critics must be paid off to hype this piece of garbage Impossible to follow, no characterization, no acting, no plot Nothing but shooting and noise Completely unrealistic Comcast , I want my rental fee back,,, you re complicit
8.0~The immersive 'experience' of war that highlights human insignificance austin0731 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk tells the well known British story of the decisive WWII battle held at Dunkirk, "The Miracle of Dunkirk." Dunkirk is a brilliant atmospheric drama/thriller, it serves brilliantly as to tell the story of a historical event from multiple perspectives through immersing audiences in the midst of the battle and the intensity of the atmosphere. Dunkirk made the stylistic choice to not let audiences get attached to any one character and truly is highlighting the horrors and struggles of the event itself. It focuses on the situation rather than the characters as most war film does, as a result we never get much backstory on any characters and many characters can be confusing to follow and connect with. However as I said this is a stylistic choice not a production flaw and it is a decision that I liked. I liked that Christopher Nolan chose a less conventional route to tell a war story and I think that this is a very interesting way of depicting an event that for the participants must seem extremely dire and helpless. Tom Hardy once again does an amazing job despite once again having half his face covered, yet he still manages to do such an amazing work with his eyes alone. Other than Hardy, Harry Style's acting debut also delivered well and I am looking forward to any of his future works. In fact it seems like a direct personal comment from Nolan to the audience of the true atrocities and horrors of war, by not highlighting the story behind these individuals they seem to lose significance and character almost as if they never existed, now this is a powerful statement in contrary to the clichéd war film trope that depict things like, valorous men charging into battle, widows and children receiving the country's honors, men sharing stories in the thick of battle. No, Nolan chose not to glorify war by showing us what great characters these people are but chooses to throw out the stone cold truth of the insignificance of men in the thick of war and under the mercy of fighter planes. In fact it is even highlighted at one point that prime minister Winston Churchill demands a certain amount of men to return as if they were just statistics and figures, this is a film that doesn't shy away from the political truths of war and serves to caution and remind us of the horrors of war, a reminder to audiences to get their head out of some sort of a dramatised glorified depiction of war.
3.0~Not good at all t-roger1955 Sign in Permalink " An epic film " - said most of the comments by a major number of film critics...Well, no it isn't. For those who want to see a real, well - documented film about how Dunkirk really was during the great escape of the English Army in 1940 the disappointment couldn't be bigger. Technically spoken it is a great movie, but it misses completely the emotional side of the "story of Dunkirk " , the chaos of the event that took place ( the cars and tanks left on the beaches, the thousands of boats on the sea, the confusion an fear by the almost 300000 soldiers ...) and above all: it misses " emphaty "...Only a few times I could see, or feel any emotion for the characters in this movie ( only Mark Rylance is really good ! ) and it seems to me that Nolan spent more time looking for a spectacular shot than how the actors had to play as real people in this historical event. By the way; the music ( or so - called music ) is more than agonising noise in most of the scenes.
10.0~A masterpiece kkuopanp-1 Sign in Permalink I'm currently re-reading Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's "Dunkirk" (which is a fantastic book by the way and highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have a micro- or macroscopic view on the topic) and based on that source the movie is not always historically accurate. On top of that there are some events that seem too fantastic just based on common sense. This was my first impression. Having now seen the movie twice, I forgot and forgave the inaccuracies, went with the flow, and I think the movie is a masterpiece. It is a collage of events from the viewpoint of individuals who in fact lose all traits of individuality when facing the monstrous war. The movie looks beautiful, the soundtrack is revolutionary and the way the different moments in time are sequenced is ingenious and impressionistic. Chapeau!
7.0~Great theatrical experience ennoeoj Sign in Permalink The film is separated in three sub-stories. One follows a soldier on the beach of Dunkirk. This plot had much more potential than what has been done with, but also remains within a dull and realistic scope. One follows a man with his common boat going at the rescue in Dunkirk. This plot was okay but that's all. One follows a pilot flying with his comrade, clearing enemies the best they can in direction of Dunkirk. This plot was exceptionally amazing and moving. I was very touched by it. There are three major negatives in my opinion: ---- Firstly, one of the attractive premise of the film was its acclaimed realism about war. And yet with a PG rating, the film stray quite away from the crudeness of warfare. The most blood to be seen is on gauze and bandage of the wounded. No physical obliteration, flying limbs nor anything in graphic nature of actual war. Possibly, Nolan wanted to make the horror of war accessible to the popular audience, where war movies may not be that attractive in the first place, by using of his reputation. The film is mostly about the psychological perspective of living such event. In short, a strawberry shortcake without strawberry. ---- Secondly, the ambiance brought with the aid of Hans Zimmer score is not without fault. At some point, around 3/4th of the movie, I found myself distracted by this music. The dramatically-epic sounds fill the film throughout, reducing their emotional impact and at time, as aforementioned, feel downright pretentious. In short, no need to force drama upon the act of taking a load with epic music. ---- Finally, throughout the movie, only a handful of German planes can be seen and some out of focus German soldiers at the very end. That's pretty much all there is about the axis in this film, which is a shame. In short, the good versus the bad bias. Not addressing the enemy perspective and showing the allied in a general triumphant light. The film is in a way contradictory in the sense that it is highly claustrophobic, focusing on characters that in turn have little development. There are few scenes of large and extended perspective, with the exception of the aerial sub-plot. A very large shot, encompassing the whole beach, showing the 400000 soldiers would have been epic. Concluding, this is a somewhat great movie. More historic values than its ''censored'' realism despite tremendous practical effects.
4.0~Mercifully short jimapel-86439 Sign in Permalink Way, way, way oversold. What else can you say about a movie that is photographically well executed, but has no discernible plot, story line or character development? Even if there were a story, it was impossible to hear because the audio effects were so loud as to render 75 percent or more of the dialog incomprehensible. Sure, war is hell. And it's loud. What war movie since the days of "Sands of Iwo Jima" hasn't made the same point? And Christopher Nolan spent how much to reiterate that message? The first aerial combat scenes of "Dunkirk" were beautifully photographed, but practically every subsequent scene was a replay of the first. Sure, Spitfires, BF-109s and Heinkels are hard to come by, but, seriously, the aerial sequences struggled to rise above the campy, repetitive air work of the late 1970s series "Black Sheep Squadron." The only saving grace of "Dunkirk" is that it was mercifully short at 106 minutes. It doesn't even come close to challenging "Saving Private Ryan" for bragging rights as the best war movie of all time.
1.0~Waste of time and money wstetler51 Sign in Permalink These so-called commenters they gave it a 10 out of 10 you must be getting paid a whole lot for that oh you must be totally brain-dead and don't know a thing about what actually happened and after watching this movie you still don't first of all it's all occurred over a 9 day period. Second of all the weather was overcast and foggy but the seas were calm . The Germans were unable to see what was going on because of the fog. The British lost approximately 177 aircraft. They also lost eight ships do two actions by submarines motor torpedo boats or German bombers or mines. Most of the people that made it out we're loaded onto larger ships at various docks. Those that could not get into these docks had to anchor out because of the shallowness of the waters in that area and smaller craft ferried the people out to them. This movie was horribly directed conceived and produced bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the actual happenings of that period Of time. This waste of time and money deserves no rating.
9.0~Once I grasped it was a metaphor about events in Dunkirk basilisksamuk Sign in Permalink I initially had reservations about Dunkirk. My first reservation was that the beach looked empty with only handfuls of soldiers visible. You never got the impression that there were 400000 soldiers trapped on the beach. Secondly this must be one of the most bloodless war films ever made and, whilst it's easy for directors to slip into war porn these days, men just falling over when shot is utterly unconvincing. Despite these misgivings I found the film gripping from beginning to end. The aerial scenes in particular were outstanding. The score and sound design were also outstanding ensuring that tension and was maintained and built upon throughout the film. I was also impressed by the mixing of the three timelines and points of view. Going in it seemed impossible for anyone to weave the three together but it works to perfection. Ultimately my take on the film is that Nolan has created a film that is a series of metaphors about what happened at Dunkirk and not a depiction of the reality of what happened at Dunkirk. The combination of the cinematography, score and fractured timelines give an impression of the horrors of waiting on the beach to be rescued that a more conventional approach could probably never achieve. Another director could have produced an effects heavy movie which lumbered on forever with saccharine character backstories and a linear chronology and it would not be nearly so effective. I may be wrong but I think Dunkirk is one giant metaphor. And it works
7.0~Beneath Untold Layers of Tension, an Observant Artist's Touch drqshadow-reviews Sign in Permalink The terror of a quiet solitude, exposed on an endangered French beach and desperately awaiting evacuation at the height of World War II. Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of young men. It's far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialog. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the frightened skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It's also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch.
9.0~Misunderstood Masterpiece bjcarl14 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has up to this point never made a bad movie. Some of them aren't great(Insomnia), but none of them are reprehensible atrocities. The people who hated or didn't like Dunkirk wanted to see something moving and character driven like Saving Private Ryan or any of the other great WW2 movies out there. Nolan chose to make the audience a character in this film rather than have the audience follow around a solitary character in which we place our empathy. To the haters of this film: I understand, but I certainly don't agree. In my opinion, this film should FINALLY get Nolan a well deserved Oscar nomination for Best Director, and depending on the competition that remains to be seen, he might very well deserve to win in that category.
6.0~Not What I Thought It Was Going to Be. Robotvideo Sign in Permalink This was one of the biggest movie buildups of the summer. Before I went to see it I was picturing a Dunkirk version of Saving Private Ryan with realistic war scenes around a set of characters that you got to know and care about, and followed them through some type of struggle. If you separated each scene from the movie they were visually fantastic. But, when you put them all together you still had only a series of great looking clips, not an engaging movie. The lead characters were virtually indistinguishable from the other 400,000 soldiers. You never got to know them as individuals, so it had no impact when something happened to them. Nothing was ever explained, so if you don't know the historical context you still won't know the significance of the event, or even what really happened after you see this movie. I've seen much more interesting and clear documentaries on TV. If you are going to this movie expecting it to be the next big thing, you will likely be disappointed.
3.0~Quite a boring movie. allan-20159 Sign in Permalink I like war movies but I certainly didn't like this one. I feel the title is wrong because it's not so much about Dunkirk as its about some blokes who where there at the time. Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I hate this - Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Flight scenes was like WHO cares. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes. This movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!
10.0~Masterpiece beyzfrommars Sign in Permalink First of all I want to say that Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. In fact, I was really nervous about the film as a Nolan fan because it's his first war film. I've read some bad reviews and they all wrote that the film was a total disappointment. I don't agree with that. In spite of I couldn't see the film in IMAX, I still felt like I was in the film. All the sinking and drowning scenes were so realistic that I felt I was there and drowning with them. The characters were emotionally strong. Especially Cillian Murphy's character was so strong that I could get into his head and see through his eyes. The scene when he asked about the boy that he accidentally killed was so touching. The only thing that I didn't like about the film was Harry Styles' acting performance. He just couldn't make us feel the film's spirit. For example when they realized there was a foreigner soldier in the ship with them he got angry but it was so phony. But I can simply say that I loved the film. Nolan did a perfect job. I'm sure that he will keep doing great films like this film.
8.0~Nolanesque War Movie...very good dasant3 Sign in Permalink "Wars are not won by evacuations..." Words spoken by Churchill after the events depicted in Christopher Nolan's latest film DUNKIRK. Yet, Nolan chooses this backdrop to deliver a war movie that is as immersive as the D-Day landing in Saving Private Ryan. But the similarities end there. Nolan uses three different vantage points each with a different time-line: The Mole, the rock wall protecting the harbor, over a full week; the Air over the course of only an hour; and the Sea over a full day. All this is presented with typeface near the beginning of the film to help orient the viewer to what's being shown. What is unique is that Nolan uses non-linear storytelling. By doing so, we become immersed in the events as though we are each of the characters. Similar to Memento or Interstellar, Nolan again shows confidence in the audience and we are rewarded for it. We won't find long lines of exposition to explain things. Neither does he ask for our emotions in conventional ways. Rather by utilizing visual angles, intense sound, and non-verbal cues, he urges us to become immersed in the story with these soldiers, pilots and merchant marines and day fisherman bringing home across the channel. In only one instance did I sense Nolan obviously building a crescendo of emotions at the events on the screen. Despite this, there is much to appreciate in this film. Where many war movies generally depict impressive battlefield or theater heroism against great odds usually resulting in rescue or victory. Nolan delivers a more poignant look inside war from what Churchill also called a "colossal military disaster." Because of its unique look at war, it is definitely worth a look. B+
5.0~Storey less, soul-less spectacle rrvidwans Sign in Permalink It's all about good photography, good background music. where is storey? Where are dialogues ? Editor was never employed probably. Characters don't know why they are there and what they are doing. Heavy bombs don't decimate kinva of soldiers they just put them to sleep acting on beach ....Forget it. It's a bad cinema from a great director
1.0~Extremely dissapointing playtester69 Sign in Permalink Clearly a movie which polarises opinions, I have to say I found this one of the poorest war movies I've ever scene. Threading a series of individual stories together in this environment is not new - The Battle of Britain is a classic example of how this can be handled - it also did a much better job of portraying the scope of the event - a task which Dunkirk, despite widespread use of CGI, doesn't do: the near empty beaches over strained my capacity to suspend disbelief to the point where I quickly lost interest. Then came the sinking of the unknown hospital ship at the Mole. Unfortunately, this didn't happen - given the number of vessels that were sunk, resorting to this sort of device seems unnecessary and cheap. To me, it failed on every level - indeed there was a point when I kept watching only because of the one bit of suspense the movie tried to create - did he ever get to finish taking a crap?
1.0~No Nazi flags in the movie so don't see it. petrified-50485 Sign in Permalink Just heard on the radio that this movie purposely removed all Nazi symbols and flags. I refuse to watch this rubbish and support these people who wanna change history because something offends them. It's WW2 and show Nazi flags. Many people said it's a great movie , it's a shame the politically correct had to rear their ugly heads again and ruin a movie.
10.0~Pure art excaliber99 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan renewed my faith in movies. _/\_ There is not much of a story here; no characters either. But, this movie was perfection. It felt like living the moment. May be because of the meticulous care taken with the minute nuances of acting, this movie leaves a deep impression. I wouldn't say it's the best war movie ever, but it definitely is one of the best depictions of a war scenario. At the end of the movie, I'm not moved by the story or the characters (I loved that there were no main characters! It made me focus more on the moment) but I felt like I saw a beautifully crafted piece of art. It's job was to show me a small time window of what happened at Dunkirk and the job was very well done.
10.0~An all new cinematic experience, delivered by none other than Nolan davideo-2 Sign in Permalink STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning For his latest big budget, big spectacle cinematic experience, Christopher Nolan has taken his first foray into the world of a war film, rather than the sci-fi/fantasy flicks he's been known for in recent years. And yet, in his desperate quest to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, on this occasion he's produced a film that doesn't actually have any discernible plot to speak of, and is based entirely around the plight of a situation a group of disparate men from different sides of the Allied front during the titular battle. This is a film based entirely in the unfolding moment of the here and now, and his distinctive style has never been more tightly stamped on anything he's made. It may leave some wondering if he was the right director for the project, and how it could have panned out in the hands of someone with a more traditional approach to a war film, say, Steven Spielberg with Saving Private Ryan, but this only serves to highlight how this is an all new filmic experience in its own right. We open in a scene completely drowned of any dialogue, completely soaked up in atmosphere, punctuated by a harsh, drained camera lens and reinforced by a typically heavy score from long time Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer. The immediacy of the moment is captured quite magically, in spite of the lack of superficial things, and the feeling of being an average soldier in the middle of the unfolding fear and madness is feels as real as you can imagine. In focusing on being in the moment, and not on the characters as individuals, yes, Nolan does drown out some sense of character development and emotional investment, but this is further evidence of the films experimental style, asking you to be moved by the immediate plight of the protagonists, rather than the inner battles each respective person is fighting. Once again, an all star cast has been rounded up, including former One Direction star Harry Styles, as well as the likes of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance, although in roles that don't mark any of them down in any individual way. Later on in the film, Nolan also unleashes some of the most breath-taking cinematography he's ever delivered us, over the seas and over the cliffs, almost as magical and majestical as flying over these places for real (but under different circumstances.) In spite of the minimal characterization, there's still a genuine sense of peril and tension of characters during danger sequences, in tightly confined quarters and with time racing against the affected party. Nolan is a director who refuses to do things by half, or in a way that an audience expects or can even comprehend, and while it may overwhelm many, it can be beautifully appreciated by those who look beyond the surface, and absorb a new filmic style. *****
3.0~Seemed like a bad copy of a 90's Guinness Advert. jcmcgee Sign in Permalink Mediocre movie...this director obviously does not understand human emotions (inception...who was the "baddy"?)...this film seems like he has read up on them...and then went overboard! Smaltzy..stupid in bits, it's like nothing so much as a 90s UK GUINNESS advert...I don't think you had them in USA? "Good things come to those who wait"?... https://youtu.be/Y9znA_dwjHw The film was almost exactly like one of these adverts...right down to the scene at the end where the soldiers are handed beers....I almost expected that tagline to pop up! Soldiers commuting suicide at Dunkirk? Spitfire pilots allowing themselves to run out of fuel? Soldiers "hiding" in a boat? A naval commander spending the whole film alone on a pier... Miles from any communications, was this a bad metaphor?? The music...maybe it was well written, but it was overused to the point of irritation..."oh, I'm supposed to feel tense now? Thanks music!"
10.0~Made Me Proud To Be British Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan ? Someone is rather over-hyped in my opinion. He's a director who often reverts to gimmicks in order to sell a movie. Woul MOMENTO have worked in a completely linear structure ? Would INCEPTION have worked without the groundbreaking special effects . Would THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy have worked without the ready made audience for a BATMAN reboot ? To be fair at least with a Nolan movie the film sells itself and with DUNKIRK there's always the problem that a film like this is going flop big time due to the fact that it involves a military defeat of sorts which is box office poison along with the fact that British stiff upper lips don't translate very well to an international audience. In other words I didn't have exceptional hopes for DUNKIRK but even I have to admit this film really delivers and it's all down to the director If you've seen the trailers you know you're going to be watching cinematic spectacle and that's what you're getting . What the trailers don't convey is the oppressive and hypnotic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer which will grab you from the first scene. It's intrusive for sure and crushing but adds to the tension. Make no mistake this is a masterwork in tension . The fractured storyline concerns itself with three distinct sections . One involves the dilemma of the aptly named British soldier Tommy , one involves a RAF fighter patrol over the channel and the final storyline involves a civilian boating expedition to the Dunkirk beaches . These story lines are developed and edited superbly . One storyline is structured so ends on a cliffhanger cut to another storyline ending to a cliffhanger then cut to the dilemma being resolved but is really a case of out of the frying pan in to the fire What also makes DUNKIRK noticeable and sets it apart from other recent war films is the lack of star power . Yeah okay we've got familiar faces like Hardy , Rylance , Murphy and Brannagh but it's the unknowns and up and coming actors like Whitehead , Barnard and Lowdon who carry the film and helps you buy in to the real life situations these characters are experiencing. It's refreshing that we don't get to see a name actor like Pitt or Cruise turn up to save the day complete with colonial accent . Despite the heart stopping tension and carnage constantly grinding the audience down there's also a distinct lack of gore and "war porn" which is also refreshing One biting criticism the film seems guilty of is that it's somewhat cold and aloof with a lack of backstory to the characters lack development. I can understand these points but as I said this film is all about heart pounding tension. One also concludes that there's expressionistic elements in that the characters are shocked by what looks like nihilistic inevitable defeat and this is conveyed to the audience Imagine if Spielberg had directed it where sentimental clichés are to the fore , some soldier pulling out a photograph of his pregnant wife saying how much he loves her and the audience knowing there and then he's not going to make it the end credits. Here however you're thrown in to the cockpit of Collin's Spitfire , of Mr Dawson's small boat or being stuck in a sinking ship with Tommy If there's one thing I regret after seeing this film it's that I didn't watch it in a proper IMAX cinema. I was left gasping at some of the scenes thinking "How could this scene be possibly be better ?" but a couple of days later after I've calmed down I do think not watching it on a proper IMAX screen has been a major mistake and I hope anyone reading this doesn't make the same mistake because DUNKIRK mixes spectacle with distressing personal dilemmas. Some people class the real life evacuation of Dunkirk as a defeat for the allies while other like myself class it as a "Victory grabbed from the jaws of defeat". Regardless of this opinion DUNKIRK is a victory of filmmaking . Filmmaking that made me bloody proud to be British
4.0~Dunturd - Hyped up mediocre pretentious war film - watch it on netflix comps-784-38265 Sign in Permalink Gushing reviews and hype led me to believe this was going to be an amazing war film. So many people compared Dunkirk very, very favourably to 'saving private ryan'. Many rave reviews 10/10 'the best war film ever'& 'Nolan masterpiece' etc. First things first, this film bears absolutely no comparison to 'saving private ryan'. Dunkirk is not fit to be mentioned in the same breath as Spielbergs masterpiece. Saving Private Ryan is deservedly a classic war film that can be watched many times. Dunkirk is (at best) mediocre. Watch once, unremarkable and quickly forgotten, vastly overrated and over-hyped. We went expecting greatness, (which we were led to believe was this film) and left, as I heard a fellow member of the audience state on leaving, "thats 2 hours I won't get back again". It's yet another of those Hollywood offerings, a clapped out ford escort disguised under a 'ferrari body kit'. From outside it looks good, but once you get in and drive, it's a clapped out ford escort. Enough of my disappointment:- The film shows the British/French military disaster of Dunkirk, where the British expeditionary force and thousands of French troops had retreated to Dunkirk, as conquering German armies swept across France using 'Blitzkreig' tactics. The only hope for those at Dunkirk was evacuation by sea or face annihalation. The film attempts to tell the story through the eyes of a Spitfire Pilot (Tom Hardy) A group of British tommies attempting to escape from Dunkirk (including Harry Stiles who gave a creditable performance) and civilian small boat skipper (Mark Rylance) who is sailing over as one of 'the little ships' to rescue the army. The mistake is trying to cram to many viewpoints, with a slightly different time line, into too short a film (1hr 46mins) Also having characters you actually don't care much about. The 1958 film Dunkirk did a much better job on both aspects and was over 30 minutes longer. Visually it's good, (back to the Ferrari body shell) but you don't get any empathy for the characters, particularly the soldiers, who should be the key to the story (being about the evacuation from Dunkirk) The film spends far too long with Tom Hardy, flying his remarkable spitfire, it flies on and on with limitless ammo. He shoots down several fighters, a bomber, and (amazingly) even a stuka whilst his plane is gliding (having run out of fuel) The film title is 'Dunkirk' not 'Spitfire Battles' so detracts from the main story - which surely is about the evacuation of Dunkirk. Mark Rylance is good as the boat skipper with his son plus a 17 year old boy as crewman. However, its a bit Uuh? as he just sails off with his boat as the RN is trying to put naval crews on board, and remarkably knows exactly where he has to go and why. In reality the RN briefed the small boats and gave them routes to skirt minefields etc. On route Rylance picks up Cillian Murphy sitting atop a mostly submerged ship hull. Murphy is a bit 'shell shocked'. On realising he is being taken back to Dunkirk, in a scuffle with the skipper to turn around the boat, the 17 year old is accidentally fatally injured. Pointless sub story compared to the main 'event' (Dunkirk evacuation) Another uuh! moment. The film tries to be 'clever' (but doesn't pull it off) entwining all three story lines to meet at the same event. When Hardy attacks the bomber, attacking the minesweeper, that the soldiers are trying to swim to from their sinking fishing boat and Rylance rescues them. The British soldiers, who the film follows, are remarkably cowardly. Bearing mind the Britsh Expeditionary Force, although small, was a professional army. Not conscripts. I felt nothing for the soldier characters, other than a mild contempt for being so cowardly, no attempt to find their units, just run for the ships, by any means. The film has several good actors, which seemed remarkably wasted, murphy as battle fatigued coward ! Brannagh as some senior naval officer on the pier - more of a cameo Hardy was convincing as a pilot but rather detracted from the evacuation story. In many respects, this film is a glib, colour version of a disastrous part of our military history and a remarkable evacuation. I did get a lump in the throat at the sight of the 'little ships' but only about 7 were shown, and it was almost a 'by the way' scene, as if not important. In reality 800 or so, civilian small vessels, of all shapes and sizes, from paddle steamers to river launches, bravely sailed across to rescue the army. However, you never get the scale of the event nor feel any empathy, let alone sympathy, for the characters. This director is a poor scriptwriter for an historic event within living memory. He should stick to science fiction stories. The sound was mostly loud dirge 'music' that did nothing for me. Whats the difference between a bucket of faeces and the film Dunkirk 2017 ? The bucket! 4.5/10 p.s. I nearly laughed out loud at the end. On a surprisingly modern train in blighty, the soldiers wondered what people would think of them? Bearing in mind how they had jumped every queue and used every deception to save their skins. I think 'cowards' would be appropriate.
1.0~Dissapointing retina-52852 Sign in Permalink Way overrated. 1h 46 min which i will never recover.. 1/10
4.0~Clichéd fchatonly Sign in Permalink I thought this was poor. Most people know the overall story but the small events that made up this film were too predictable and unoriginal. I am old enough to remember the old black and white movies of the 50s where Jack Hawkins, Kenneth Moore and the like delivered stirring speeches. Those movies were better than this . A spitfire cannot glide for so long as in this movie and then to have its wheels come down at the last minute was too much. I could not help but let out a loud groan. That was the 3nd time I groaned the first was when the small rescuing armada of fishing boats appeared and Elgar, or a facsimile of Elgar, swelled up. Talk about hokey! The fighter pilot only managing to open his hatch at the last possible moment. Another groan. Then toward the end the rescued soldiers boarded a train that looked more like southern rail circa 1990 than it did 1942. Moving back and forth in time was too confusing.
8.0~Masterful but not a Masterpiece kate-911-98899 Sign in Permalink I'm a huge Nolan fan. I've watched everything he's ever done multiple times. I've been looking forward to this movie so much, and I definitely enjoyed it. The story itself is worthy of being explored in a film: 400,000 British soldiers are stranded at Dunkirk, repeatedly being hammered by the enemy. If I recall correctly, they didn't show any German soldiers or even say the word Germans or anything like that. Regardless, the antagonist's presence is still powerful and terrifying. We've all seen and heard enough about the evil Nazis at this point in our collective culture to understand the threat they pose. I loved how there was basically no back story for any of the characters. The movie starts, and the threat is immediate. It grabbed me from the beginning. I loved the way it was filmed. The expansive shots combined with claustrophobic spaces made for a totally unique war movie. In fact, I've never seen anything that gave me the feeling it did. I had a sense of the geography of everything. That being said, this wasn't my favorite Nolan movie. I was tense at certain moments, but I wasn't on the edge of my seat, literally getting adrenaline rushes because I was so afraid someone was going to die. I wasn't as emotionally involved as I wanted to be. I also had a lot of trouble understanding what people were saying. The effects and score were so loud I couldn't comprehend about 40% of what the characters were saying, especially Tom Hardy and the other pilots. My boyfriend thought it was the greatest war movie he's ever seen. Personally, Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now are still my favorites. But, let's be real: I'd cut off limbs to be able to write something like Dunkirk. Nonetheless, the emotion and suspense just wasn't there for me.
1.0~One of the most dishonestly over-rated films of all time. 1 of 10. Geff Sign in Permalink Yes, awful. How can anyone honestly give this film a positive recommendation? It is so amateurish. Whoever wrote the screenplay forgot the story. What story is it! It's not about Dunkirk, the famous WWII evacuation of British troops from France. What about the French troops? The British commander says to hell with them. Two cowards are the focus of the story. They will do anything to get out ahead of everyone else who are patiently waiting, keeping order, and waiting their turn. One other is picked up by a civilian boat on its way to rescue troops at Dunkirk, and he fights the crew to not go back. He kills one of them. Great story? I figure they used 5 planes to make the entire film: three RAF fighters, one German fighter, and one German bomber, all classic planes. Why I say this is b/c they only show three RAF fighters in one scene, and then it's always a one-on-one with all the other scenes. The special effects are from the 1950's. I think they did a better job in Wings, 1927. Also, it's hard to figure out what they are saying. I missed half the dialogue, but I didn't miss much b/c it's so worthless a film. It's aimless, boring, pathetic, and cheap. There is nothing epic about this film. It's a sad joke. What a waste of my money. It's one of the most over-rated films of all time.
8.0~****What do people think by giving this film one star?****** itorgov Sign in Permalink Are you fans of S*** movies like "fast and furious 999"? It seems that you need to watch S*** like Wonder Woman! Because this is out of your league! This is not the best war movie i've ever seen but it's a hell of a masterpiece! Watching this masterpiece in the theater is an experience! The game with the time frame is a little bit confusing. But it's one of the things that makes this movie so special! The directing and the sound are incredible! This movie is a hell of a work! All the air action scenes are just breathtaking! The music by Hans Zimmer is beautiful... I'm giving 10/10 just because some people have the guts to give him one star! You should be ashamed of yourself! This movie is not for everyone...
10.0~Dunkirk gets top marks all around. purgatorypriest Sign in Permalink An outstanding 10 out of 10 are the only numbers I've calculated. Christopher Nolan has now solidified his name forever when it comes to naming who had the Midas touch in film making for the last decade+. Behold the assault on your senses...all of them. Dunkirk, from the very start straps you in, forces you to take a deep breath and then grabs those senses and never let them go for the better part of an hour and 35 mins. The sense of urgency you get begins immediately. The visuals are breathtaking. The audio effects immensely impressive. It chases you left and right, from the bottom and from above. You'll tilt your head during some of the flying scenes. That's a rather a neat trick without 3D/VR. 65mm really shines here, filming at its finest I'd say (the whole movie is shot entirely in 65mm and boy does it look fantastic, a true work of art). To get that feeling and the 'I was in awe' cinematography and sound experience you should...no, need to watch this film in a 4K/Dolby Atmos equipped theater or if available in your area, IMAX 70mm. Nothing else will cut it and nothing else will immerse your senses, nothing. Dunkirk will for sure be the showcase Demo Disc for home theater retailers and those wanting to test their Atmos or DTS:X setups. It needs to be said again, this film has some of the most incredible sounds and cinematography ever captured thus far. Making it a sure contender for an Oscar win or 2. Best Picture of the year so far for me. It could very well sweep the Academy Awards in 2018 in at least 3 categories. Hans Zimmer, make way for another Oscar on that shelf. With the masterful crescendo scoring, no one else in the business could have brought my senses to the climax that I experienced. Take a bow and know your legacy and film contributions can never be questioned and hardly replicated today by others, period. From the start, I felt as if I was being pursued by Jaws! I felt like I was drowning at one point. I felt like I was flying and in an aerial dogfight the next. Incredible combination all around, gentlemen. Incredible. The acting is certainly beyond reproach, no question. Skilled directing and producing are a must, but the efforts Nolan and Co put into this film could have been lost if the actors didn't bring their full potential, to convey the desperate situation these men and women found themselves in, waiting to be rescued, all hope just about lost, spirits broken and home yearning. The assembled cast must share in any and all accolades bestowed upon Dunkirk. This my friends, is film making at its Pinnacle!
10.0~Film that needs to be seen on the big screen. kylieayres Sign in Permalink Dunkirk was an absolutely beautiful masterpiece that needs to be watched on the big screen to get the full effect. The visual and sounds of the film make the second world war more real than it ever could be. Watching the film, I could not take my eyes of the screen as it felt like I was there in Dunkirk. I enjoyed the layout of the film and how it showed every persons story at the beach and how it effected the air force, navy, commanders, people on the beach and those travelling to fight. The war was shown in the best way I have ever seen. Watching this film, I never heard soo many people start crying as the ending was soo good and showed how Britain fought and survived the war. Survival at its best.
4.0~Are the reviews even legitimate? jeremiahbucher-29909 Sign in Permalink When I saw the rating and the rave reviews I thought maybe I was about to watch the next "Saving Private Ryan" or "Hacksaw Ridge". No. Just no. This movie lacked action, character development, and a script. It is a very untraditional war movie. Rather than heroic battles and men charging head long into certain death only to find victory waiting for them, "Dunkirk" is a story of men hiding, running, and simply trying to get home alive. Perhaps that was the reality, but reality doesn't always make for good cinema. I think a lot of the hype around this movie is because it is untraditional, but that doesn't make it good. It was boring.
1.0~How to ruin a pivotal moment of WW2 henrik-138 Sign in Permalink This film was underwhelming, tedious and not making the importance and the struggle of the men on the beaches of Dunkirk justice. The film has a narrative which retakes the same moment in time from different perspectives over and over again. It does not bring the story further and just becomes unnerving and tedious. The director focuses on a handful of men, mostly scared out of their wits, trying to show that men are animals (?) who's main concern is their own survival. Where are all the brave men that escaped the captivity of the German Wehrmacht, who strode on gallantly against overwhelming opposition and the horrible sights they have witnessed? This was the saving of an army of some 340.000 men and there was just a handful in the film? Did RAF and Luftwaffe possess five fighters and two bombers put together? Was the movie so hamstrung by its budget it couldn't afford more than a couple extras and no CGI? And what about that awful music; was it even music or did the director just buy a kids synthesizer at Toys'R'us? According to this film all the British soldiers were cowards; really? No, this is not a war movie, this is not a documentary; it is a mockery of the brave fighting men who was saved to fight on to save Europe from the evil of Adolf Hitler.
3.0~Incredibly dull and disappointing film williamhodgson Sign in Permalink I saw this film at the cinema. I was tempted to walk out after half an hour, but hoped it would get better. It didn't. I can't see why this film has received such good reviews. The film made in 1958 in black and white and starring John Mills is far better.
6.0~Average anilk007 Sign in Permalink May have looked great on an IMAX screen. Good sound effects, however, the rest is disappointing and boring.
9.0~The Citizens Mobilize bkoganbing Sign in Permalink Dunkirk played a small part of that classic from the World War II years Mrs. Miniver. If you remember Walter Pidgeon took his small craft out and said he would be returning the next day. You then see his boat joining other small craft and then there's an armada of them heading down the Thames and out to sea. They were heading for Dunkirk and were going right up to the beaches where the large naval vessels couldn't go and taking several hundred thousand British soldiers and a few French who later became the basis for the Free French army headed by Charles DeGaulle. There's's mention here of Winston Churchill and Sir Bertram Ramsey whom I believe was First Sea Lord. The only criticism I have of Dunkirk is that I would like to have had some scenes with the top decision makers as we saw in such films as Patton, MacArthur, The Longest Day, the Battle Of Britain, and others. Especially in The Longest Day we saw the ordinary soldiers and their story mixed with the brass and the critical decisions they were making. On the plus side Dunkirk is a film wonderfully cast with several poignant stories about what was being done and the sacrifices made. My favorite is that of young Barry Keoghan all of 17 who comes on the small craft of Tom Rylance and his son Tom Glynn-Carney just to be part of a great adventure. His performance will bring a few tears to the eye. Of all in the film I hope young Mr. Keoghan will get some notice for a Supporting Actor Oscar. No doubt Dunkirk is in line for some technical awards as well in addition to the big one. With 10 now in the race for Best Picture I have no doubt that Dunkirk will be one of the ten. I've always loved the story of Dunkirk and how that island nation put aside its differences among the subjects and worked together to get that army off the beach. Make no mistake this was citizen mobilization at its finest. No matter what your views were unless you were an out and out Nazi sympathizer you knew what getting those troops home meant. Nothing less than the fate of civilization itself.
10.0~Virtual Experience of war, chaos, horror and hope reisen55 Sign in Permalink From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of the South Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSD or dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down). So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtually relive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror, fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films and books (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights of BATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theater feeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well. It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the film draws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE. Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segment of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intense version of the standard war film. Be prepared to have your life changed by this one. It's that damn good.
10.0~An Instant Classic markcbray Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and he has again delivered with this masterpiece. What I love about the film is that there is very little to it, it allows you to sit back and watch the drama unfold without getting caught up in "how John is feeling." It is more about the event than any single soldier, a concept which I love. Some reviews have been critical, saying there is little character development, but in my opinion while it is minimal it isn't needed because the film is just fantastically shot and put together. The only complaint is I would have liked this to have been longer, maybe added something at the beginning or more dialogue about the unfolding events. However, I'm pretty certain there will be a directors cut when the BluRay is released to address this very minor problem. The acting is also fantastic. Tom Hardy does an incredible job of making you feel like you're in the cockpit with him. Because of the way this is shot, in many scenes it makes you feel a little like you are actually there. Some have compared this to films like Inglorious or Saving Private Ryan, but for me they are way behind this. For real war film/series favorites I would liken this to the Band of Brothers episode where they follow the medic on the front line. I cannot recommend this film enough and it looked amazing in iMAX.
2.0~Overrated YazanDoubal Sign in Permalink With respect and regards to everyone who worked on it; There are no scenes in the movie, just moments.. Big moments for heroes, but the story lacks coherence and has almost no complex characters or interesting dialogues. The film was disappointing and didn't meet expectations. The worst yet is the soundtrack, very disturbing.. I understand that it serves the purpose, but it was really too much for me.
9.0~The clock's ticking templar77099 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is without a doubt my favourite cinema experience of the year so far. I mean, thats not that hard to achieve since in 2017 the only films I've watched in the theatre were John Wick 2, Ghost in the Shell, Spider Homecoming, the more recent Transformers (bleh, bleh, bleh) and Despicable Me 3 (yeah, I did). The rest of it were at home. And although John Wick and Spidey were very good flicks, they weren't as gripping and intense as Nolan's Dunkirk. You know you're in for a ride from very first shot. In two minutes it's already kicking the fan. When we reach the beach and see what many have to do in order to survive comes the sudden realisation of the hopeleness and the miracle that needs to happen to bring all of those soldiers back home. The three separate timelines were just perfect to brilliantly tell this story. The mesh so well and make the film fell fluid and dynamic, always moving, interconnecting events and characters, almost like chapters of a book. We don't get to know much of the characters but I believe that what we're given is enough to figure out ourselves some of the backstory and motivations of the characters. The collective is what's a stake here. We might be confused when trying to identify who's who, specially on the big setpieces, but that just adds to viscerality and intensity Dunkirk excels in delivering. Both the photography and soundtrack are amazing. One friend of mine jokingly told me a few das ago that the music just wouldn't stop and became ad eternum. I didn't know what make of this, but believe that if it was well executed, Nolan could do whatever he wanted. Spoiler - it was. The OST makes for the lack of dialogue - yes, this is almost a silent film - and elevates the action and the stakes. It fits like a glove into the overall tone of Dunkirk. Actingwise is very solid - shoutout to Styles who really held his ground and turned a surprisingly convincing performance. Hardy is brief but gets the hang of it. The rest of the cast is quite good, with many of the actors being unknown, another factor that contributes to establish the collective over the individual. Got to give it to Nolan.
6.0~It looks beautiful and at times immerses you in the action, but that's about it lovesandwich Sign in Permalink Personally, I was disappointed by it. And I actually like Inception and Interstellar. It looks very good, and the scenes where stuff was happening did immerse you in the experience. I admire the lack of dialogue and the use of actors who looked authentic, warts and all. But the characters were almost like cardboard cutouts and I did not feel any sort of attachment to any of them nor did I reach any deeper understanding of them. There was not nearly enough historical context provided. I hated the soundtrack. I found it was grating and at times the movie was just too loud. Some will say it was supposed to be grating, but I still found it pretentious. It's like the usual "bwaaaaaas" we hear for dramatic effect in all the blockbuster films and their previews. It worked for me at the beginning of Inception, but they didn't cram that kind of thing into every scene like they do here, and there was an actual soundtrack that wasn't just bombastic noise IMO. A guy can't even take a dump without the soundtrack trying to make it seem epic. I also felt that many parts just dragged on, and that there were things that didn't quite make sense to me, such as: I didn't understand why all the soldiers stood on the pier like sitting ducks. In WWI, people figured out that you shouldn't build trenches in a straight line because a plane can just swoop down and machine gun everyone in it. Yet here are the soldiers standing exactly in that formation. I was surprised that the planes continued dropping bombs rather than just gunning everyone down. The soldiers also just kept cowering instead of firing at the planes. Enough people firing a volley seems like it wouldn't be in vain. The scene in the boat with the bullet holes appearing and everyone arguing about how someone should leave, even though the weight of the water coming in was several times that of a single man, and then them trying to plug the holes with their hands when I could've sworn I saw things lying around in there that they could have used. Even if they did manage to plug the holes with their hands, they couldn't possibly keep them plugged the whole way, and people will still have to go up to sail the boat. Let alone the fact that it made no sense for Germans, or whoever else, to waste time distracting themselves with target practice on a vessel and giving away their position when in a real combat situation. I found the flight scenes to be redundant and boring. There were times when it did feel realistic and was kind of cool, but then they would just show what almost felt like the same scenes repeatedly. Some say they actually reused footage. When that pilot goes down and can't get out of the cockpit, I felt it was such a drawn out cliché. And I didn't understand why the other pilot stays behind and lands further east on the beach instead of landing and evacuating with the others. I thought maybe it was so that he could be there in case there were other planes to shoot down, but then he would have stayed in the area, not left it. The scenes on the civilian yacht felt unnecessary and unengaging. The flashback to Cillian Murphy's past didn't add anything to the story and wasn't clearly transitioned into, making it confusing. And I didn't understand why all of these people came on the boats when each of them is taking the space of a soldier who could be evacuated. Similarly confusing and pretentious was how there were supposedly three parts to this with an amount of time accompanying each, which I didn't understand, e.g. "the mole (one week)" and "air (one hour)." I hate when this is done unnecessarily. Tarantino loves overusing that. All the British pride schlock was cringe-worthy, from the kid who is a "hero" because he hit his head and died, taking up the space of multiple soldiers as he was lying down, to many of Kenneth Branagh's one-dimensional scenes, to the writing at the end just before the credits. To me, it felt more like a pet project that Nolan enjoyed geeking out over while making, but that isn't as pleasant for the actual viewers, except Nolan fanboys who will eat up anything he does and call it a masterpiece, hence the artificially high rating on IMDb and the glowing reviews everywhere. There are also doubts as to its historical accuracy, though I personally am not knowledgeable in the topic. An article in Slate titled "What's Fact and What's Fiction in Dunkirk" claims that it is largely accurate. But then I've heard others say it isn't historically accurate, e.g. claiming that: -The number of soldiers and boats shown was nowhere near the true scale of what happened -There were anti-aircraft guns present -There were more than three spitfires available that day -There was no high-ranking officer such as Branagh's character on the ground -The beach looked too clean, when in reality there were debris everywhere -The buildings in the background are all undamaged when in reality they had taken heavy damage -It contains many anachronisms: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/goofs
6.0~Highest rated Worst War movie ever. mufckarthik Sign in Permalink Dunkirk should be the first & most boring film directed by Christopher Nolan. Went in with huge expectations for this film. But it was a total let down. This movie is Intense from start to finish, but all that intensity is misfired, and an average moviegoer would feel this movie is a total bore fest. Dunkirk is an experience, not entertainment, and one would expect a war movie to be intense and entertaining, which Dunkirk isn't. Dunkirk should be the Highest rated Worst War movie ever.
6.0~Underwhelming and Uninspiring Attempt spasek Sign in Permalink The best war films have one major thing in common: they focus on the people rather than the events. If you shuttle us from one event to another without focusing on the people, then the attempt is hollow and shallow. Unfortunately, this is the type of film that Nolan gives us. He moves us from one area with hardly any characterization at all. So why should we be emotionally vested? I had my doubts as well when this movie was given a PG-13 rating. The best war films of the past forty years or so have all be R-rated films. Storytellers and filmmakers know not to hold back on the horrors of war. Veterans of Dunkirk speak of how it was like being in hell. We don't feel that nearly poignantly enough. Dunkirk was an event that saw over 800 ships involved in the rescue as well as several hundred British aircraft (not the lone three that we see in the film), of which approximately 177 were lost. Furthermore, the combined efforts of the British/French troops holding off the Germans in the various towns isn't even addressed except for a couple of minutes during the opening scenes. Dunkirk should have been a 3-hour film, encompassing the entire theater that was Dunkirk, with focus on characters in various places to give us the sense of the desperation of what the Battle of Dunkirk was all about. Instead, Nolan chooses to only focus on small aspects of the battle without giving us much substance at all. The pulsing music ultimately fails as well, utilizing a similar style as the one used to introduce the Joker in Dark Knight. Except, instead of using it for ten minutes to increase the intensity, it's used throughout the entire film! Ultimately, because of its overuse, the music loses its power and effectiveness and ends up becoming just annoying. Despite its glaring flaws, the cinematography is very well done. The air combat scenes were impressive, as three planes do their best to protect the boats and ships attempting the rescue. Historically, 243 ships were sunk. A prime opportunity should have been utilized to really get a feel for these civilians trying desperately to cross the channel. Instead, we get a wasted effort. I could easily list over twenty war films that are far superior to Dunkirk. And given that it was one of the pivotal events of World War II, it should have been given the respect that its veterans deserve. The movie lacks cohesiveness as well as emotion. Nolan should refrain from doing another war film. Not only did he fail to utilize characters as the focal points, he failed historically as well, which is nearly a crime in and of itself.
2.0~not good enough pennyelenabooks Sign in Permalink As a fan of Nolan's works, I have to say that this one was a disappointment. I wasn't going to write a review either, seeing how many have been written already, but I feel like I should. Okay, so here's the deal, for what I gathered, you'll either hate it or love it. Unfortunately, I'm one of those who hated it. Okay, hate is a strong word, so let's say that I was bored by it. The first half hour you just wait to see what will happen and for the story to kick in. But, after forty minutes in, you finally realise that the story is there, you just didn't see it. I have to read some reviews to finally get a grasp of what was happening, as the description doesn't really prepare you. After that, it's just a boring movie about ships getting sank and no dialogues. No dialogues would have mean a gold mine of rich emotional performances, but not in this case. The performances were blunt and the emotions just no where to be seen. So, what's left is a disappointing ending and the credits. Overall, I give this one a 2 because the story may have been there, but it wasn't presented nicely enough for me to see it. Plus, there was no thrill in it to keep me interest nor emotion.
4.0~The most boring war/Nolan movie ever anindya-36804 Sign in Permalink When we hear of Nolan ..a war movie is not the first thing that comes to mind .His movies are the ones that are totally mind boggling .Leaves us with an open question at the end.Despite that he has delivered to us a war movie about the more unknown war or rather Allied retreat at Dunkirk.Yes move over US invasion of Normandy chaps ! its time for Dunkirk. The plot of the story, if there is any is mostly covered in the trailers.I understand this was a real incident and there is little room for theatrics when its presented by Nolan.Then again it gets too repetitive planes flying over one another , shooting each other down .Even the dialogues "home..you can practically see it from here " its 3 times in the movie.Yes i counted. You may watch it and like it if you are an ardent Nolan fan ,or a critic who is confused if he should right away disapprove a particular "Nolan" movie.
1.0~An utter disgrace to movie lovers in general, and war movie boffins in particular grunticus Sign in Permalink No context, no sense of scale of what really happened at Dunkirk, no plot, no character-building, plain stupid editing, utter foolish flying. Yet I want to thank the producers! After Fury and Blade Runner 2049 I thought it could not get any worse with cinema these days. But no, this movie was quite an education! I was wrong and and feel enlightened that, yes, it CAN be worse. The rave 10-star reviews on here make me sick. Do NOT see, rent, or buy this crap. If you really want to know more about the miraculous events that took place at Dunkirk, watch the 1958 version, or Mrs. Miniver. I'll give them one star for the nearly correctly configured and painted Spitfires. That must have cost 1,5 million of the 150m budget. The rest was spent on paying people for good reviews, no doubt.
2.0~Cash grab by exploiting an emotional and historic topic nietzsche_is_dead Sign in Permalink Technically, the movie was strong. But that's about it. Watching the movie felt like as if everyone involved with the movie knew very well that since the topic is something that touches an entire generation of people around the world and the sheer scale and significance of the event the movie allegedly portrays, people will and should just slurp it up. Who cares about the story and how it unfolds? Why work on it when we'll just keep showing the horrors of war using nice VFX? People are BOUND to say it's good or they'll be called insensitive. Zero efforts were made in storytelling. It was not a movie and neither was it a documentary. No story to call it the former and not enough facts to call it the latter. It was just a cheap effort slapped up together to have a sure shot way of earning profits. And why shouldn't they? Look at the raving reviews calling it a masterpiece. They do it because it works.
10.0~Dunkirk - Movie review maxigarciasoto Sign in Permalink In my opinion Christopher Nolan did it again with Dunkirk, this movie was realistic as hell. This movie is about the evacuation of 400.000 men during world war II and when I am saying that this movie it's about this event, it's about that, because this movie doesn't have specific characters to relate to or care about. All the characters in this movie are just soldiers trying to survive to this situation. Like I said in previous reviews, I'm a big fan of war films. And most of them are really good because they tell the story about soldiers trying to survive to horrible situations. Dunkirk is about this event in history, and just that. If you are looking for a film with realistic characters and people with families going into the war zone well Dunkirk will like you disappoint you because you are not going to get that. Well, let's move out to the filmmaking. This movie is recorded so well that when you are watching the movie makes you have this sense of discovery to how they make this. Nolan directed and wrote this movie, and you can see it. The direction and how the script works out it's beautiful, this is easily one of the best scripts of the entire year, and this movie doesn't have too much dialogue, which makes it even more powerful when we look back to the story. The way Nolan directed this film makes you be terrified by how the Germans are trying to kill this people. This movie it's not so violent, there is a lot of scenes were some people die, but you just listen the screams and the bombs exploiting around this people. This movie has a presence of fear and suspense during the entire run time, and this feel it's created thanks to the great sound editing and the incredible score composed by Hans Zimmer, this is the greatest score that I have listened in any war film ever. So guys, Dunkirk was even better that I expected. Nolan has made my favorite film of 2017 this far.
1.0~How boring can a movie get usmcjb Sign in Permalink This is definitely a slap in the face of the English people. I can't believe the English were that big of cowards. Not even setting up any kind of defensive lines just waiting to be either rescued or slaughtered. What a crappy mess of a movie.
10.0~Unapologetically, I can say this is one of the best war movies ever made georgebwofford-44106 Sign in Permalink If you read through the swarm of negative reviews, you might notice a common theme: boring, dull, lack of characters. It's incredibly disappointing that they seemed the miss the entire point of the film.This is not a film about heroic soldiers triumphing against all odds while blowing up Nazis with transformer-esque explosions. This is a movie about scenes, not characters. -and every scene is memorable, from the bombings to the torpedoes to the aerial dogfights. My co-worker, who is obsessed with WW2 planes, noted how incredibly perfect they got the British Supermarine Spitfire from the roar of the Rolls-Royce engine to the rattle of the components in the cabin. The accuracy and intensity of the dogfight was captured perfectly as well, mimicking the aerial maneuvers, firepower and damage in a realistic and dramatic fashion. The torpedoes noticed only moments before impact with it's slow monotonous movement sent chills of realization down my spine. Even in the beginning of the film, the way in which the Nazi leaflets were presented gave you some glimpse into the panic and anxiety felt by those soldiers. I felt the "lack of characters" was realistic and served the film as well. War is not about larger-than-life personalities with specialized weapons being bad-asses. It's about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope. If you want characters you can root for and a happy ending where the bad guy in vanquished, then there are plenty of movies for you. But if you want a small glimpse into the despair, anxiety, hope, courage, and will of the British WW2 fighters then there is no better film ever made than this one.
8.0~excellent cinematography, riveting story-line and appropriate music clivehodges Sign in Permalink Quite a few of the professional film critics use the word 'immersion' meaning engrossed; absorbed completely when reviewing this movie. That's exactly what happened to me. One hour 46 minutes later, I came up for air. It's important to remember, though, that the director covers events three times: on the land; on the sea; and in the air. The action is often repeated. We see some episodes from the air, then from the viewpoint of those in the rescue boats, and sometimes, through the eyes of those on the land. If you're not aware of this before you see the movie, the continuity could be confusing. Excellent cinematography, riveting story-line; and appropriate music.
1.0~Rubbish paul-72722 Sign in Permalink This film does no justice to those, like my father, who survived the horror of Dunkirk. The scenes on the beach are thin. There were many more troops and the beaches were packed, the aerial attacks were far worse than shown. The number of German aircraft shot down by rifle fire, which was important, is not shown at all. The destruction of the town and the bravery of the troops defending it is not shown either. Maybe I expect too much of a documentary and not so much Hollywood filming. But scenes of people drowning and struggling to get to the surface probably do not depict the true horror of the situation. This film is not worthy of the name "Dunkirk".
6.0~Looks like a war epic on a budget rlindsay-88363 Sign in Permalink OK, a couple of pointers. If you can't stand films with basically no dialogue, give this one a miss. The story is told basically in a documentary style and for the first 10 minutes there is no real dialog. It does look like the story of a wet weekend in Margate where the territorial army was on a drill. This was supposed to be a massive evacuation of men. There were men everywhere. Even although this is shot in very nice wide format, it fails to convey the shear human scale of the evacuation. One of the other intersecting stories is supposed to be the RAF out on patrol giving cover to the troops on the beach. Unfortunately I think there are actually only 3 spitfires still flying in the world. And It looks like they are in this film. So unfortunately it just looks like the might of the RAF was 3 spitfires that were just on patrol. I think the director tries to make us believe that there were more, like a squadron of them, but it just looks like the same 3 planes. So when they are having a dog fight, unfortunately that's all you are thinking 'didn't that plane just get shot down? I'm sure that's the same plane, why is it still flying..' The rest of it is alright, there are some good scenes and then there are some where you are just scratching your head. The 1958 version with old Sir John 'rugged face' Mills and dikkie Attenbourough is much better, and gives a much better account of the scale of the amount of men trapped on the beach. But then again that was shot just after the war and they had plenty of old tanks, boats and aircraft to blow up.
1.0~Fell flat and disappointing yanshein Sign in Permalink This movie is neither entertaining or educating. It fell flat and unimpressed.
4.0~It could've been better. Sophoclaw Sign in Permalink I saw «Dunkirk» last night. I must say I was expecting something else, something more complete, something more complex, so actually I was disappointed. I was expecting to get to know more about Dunkirk like why it happened, the background, how come the French, Belgian and British armies got surrounded in that peculiar way and why the German army did not finished them off, after all, they only had to drive their tanks some miles forward and bomb them to pieces. Why did this not happen? What was the strategy that left the escaping armies completely defenseless to a powerful enemy? Were the Germans just being kind? I doubt it. Who in the end was responsible for this situation? They could've easily wiped out over 300000 troops. As anyone can see there are a lot of unanswered questions, and this film doesn't help, on the contrary. If the RAF was so infinitely superior to the Luftwaffe, how come the British were surrounded and trapped between enemy tanks and the sea? The film is short in answers and therefore I cannot put it in the category of Great War films. It falls merely as entertainment with shock effects. There are already a lot of critics that have mentioned the lack of character development, the problems with real-time following, and the sudden clipping from one scene to another without relation, so I will not stretch this anymore. But there is another thing that bothers me a bit and that is the lack of knowledge about the enemy. In most Great War films we get to know the enemy so we can be related to whom our film heroes are dealing with. Well in this film the enemy is practically anonymous. The Germans are completely non-existing! This film makes it very obvious the superiority of the great English Spitfire above the likes of the German Junkers-Stuka and Messerschmitt planes which makes it even more demanding to know more about why the British were defeated and pushed to escape in Dunkirk, this film does not make it easy in answers because Nolan insists to see things only from his own navel. This film could've been much better without breaking the budget too much with skipping repetitive scenes and making the enemy more visible. It seems that consequently the director of this film is avoiding getting to know the enemy. This mistake cuts the potential excitement that this film could've possessed. "Stalag 17", "The Great Escape" "The Longest Day", "Saving Private Ryan", "A Bridge Too Far", "Schindler's List", "The Bridge on the River Kwai" all great war films precisely because we get to know the enemy and therefore increase the complexity and interest in the scope of the film. Unfortunately "Dunkirk" is not one of these.
10.0~A Must See. robynsongss Sign in Permalink What a Brilliant movie. We saw this on the night of the World Premiere, intense and packed full of fabulous acting... The camera shots were absolutely spot on, and you couldn't look away for a second without missing a perfect scene. The entire score, coupled with the dialogue and videography made this film and I cannot wait to see it again.
7.0~I wanted more in a Nolan film Anillusion Sign in Permalink I saw Dunkirk at the Dolby Cinema in Eindhoven (NL) last Friday with a friend and in the end we both didn't really know what to think of it. It's by no means a bad movie, I mean visually...man...Hoytema has done terrific cinematic work. Hans Zimmers score was again a stunning combination of sound design and music. But for a Christopher Nolan film the movie left something to be desired. In the past, every film he did, it kept you thinking about it. The implications, the deeper meanings of what Nolan is trying to say to us as a story teller. This one doesn't do that. It's an unfolding of events, and although spectacular, it keeps the audience at a distance. To me the movie screamed 'look at me, look at me' but when you look at it, it doesn't communicate its message. Does it even have a message? Apart from Mr. Dawson I did not connect with any of the characters. When his son dies, I feel for him. I don't feel for any other person who dies. I would compare this with Schindler's List, which has lots of (unnamed) characters, the girl with the glasses, the little boy who tries to hide, the girl with the red jacket, to name the obvious ones. Maybe they have names, but my point is they aren't main characters and their names aren't important. But you experience some of the story by following their events. Dunkirk is a movie that's contrived only of those kind of characters and it constantly jumps between them. Even between time frames, which disoriented me. And there's nothing wrong doing this in a movie, but in my opinion you have to compensate this with context. A reason or connection of why you do this. Why are you telling it this way? Also when a movie starts or ends with titles, and those titles are so crucial to your story that if left out, you can't explain (part of) the movie, for me that's a tell that in the cutting room they discovered the movie or a part of it didn't work on its own. The jumping between time lines could have been fixed by connecting those time lines at some point halfway through the movie or maybe another clever trick. He's Christopher Nolan after all, or are we discovering that it was actually Jonathan who was the clever mind behind Chistophers movies? We don't need opening titles that tell us about hacking minds to gain access to peoples dreams. Inception tells us this as the movie unfolds, although the exposition scene with Ellen Page was a bit too much. The introduction of the Joker in the Dark Knight or Bane in the Dark Knight Rises. We don't need to know who these characters are for the audience to become intrigued by them. I for one did not know the Bane character before seeing the Dark Knight Rises. But the introduction alone, just hearing his name makes you fear him. Memento takes us on a journey discovering what's happening and what has happened. Interstellar, how it connects time and events. Cause and effect are connected. Each movie brilliant on their own. But for me, Dunkirk doesn't fit in this list of movies. Again, I'm not saying Dunkirk was a bad movie. It just isn't, and I still gave it a 7. If it were any other director, I wouldn't be writing this. But for me it wasn't enough of a movie to feel whole. For a Christopher Nolan film, I wanted more, I wanted to be inspired, I wanted to be thinking about the deeper meaning of the movie, I wanted to feel the need to re-watch this over and over and I didn't get that. I just got a movie.
3.0~Boring, meaningless characters, lame action... walked out with 10 min left zenophobe Sign in Permalink This movie was flat out boring. I don't even know why they bothered to put Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy in this because anybody could have played the two characters. Cillian Murphy does absolutely nothing and Tom Hardy flies a magic plane with a broken fuel gauge because Hollywood had to figure out some way to make his plane fly forever while all his wingmates flamed out long before. Tom Hardy flies the ONLY plane to make it all the way to Dunkirk and he heroically saves everyone on the beach single handedly in plane that has absolutely no fuel left in it. Kenneth Branaugh paces up and down the pier in immaculate naval uniform dispensing folksy wisdom and showing grave concern while everyone else is getting the **** bombed out of them and strafed. Mark Rylance doesn't do squat either except show you how a timid pleasure boat yachter can still get up the nerve to steer his boat over to Dunkirk to pick up a few of the lads. Yet another in a long string of "audience favs" that I just didn't agree with.
1.0~Most boring film I've ever seen. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME klaudia_fr Sign in Permalink Honestly, no backstory, non-existent plot, no characters, nothing. Just a bunch of soldiers, running around and hiding throughout the ENTIRE movie, without any lines. I almost fell asleep
3.0~Meh...this movie should have been torpedoed kellyrdobkin Sign in Permalink I like other Nolan films but this one was so boring that I fell asleep while trying to watch it. It jumps around the different story lines of the main characters, but since none of the characters are particularly interesting or their stories compelling, all the jumping around does is make the viewing experience annoyingly tedious. Yeah, there's some meta stuff you can figure out-since this is a Nolan film-but as for the entertainment factor it's a dud.
1.0~Turgid mirihiboy Sign in Permalink I've no idea how this film got the favourable reviews it did. Being an avid war flick viewer, I anticipated an epic film, sadly, what I got was a constant barrage of stabbing violins as the sound track for two thirds of the move, a script so bland and crass it felt like it was written over an afternoon, "Keep em peeled chaps, they like to come out of the sun", good god really?, what next "watch it lads, these Hun like to shoot at you, don't get hit alrite?" If the move was supposed to convey the bleakness and coldness of Dunkirk, if failed, because to 'feel' that bleakness, you have to attach to the characters, which is near impossible. Bombs landing on jetty's lined with soldiers met with silence, not a scream "watch out lads, bomb!, nothing, I actually questioned if there was something wrong with the sound, had it broken, no, its made this way. The final scene with spitfire johnny landing in enemy territory, even though he could have ditched and bailed near a British ship was just nonsense. If you like me love a good war film, then it fails in all aspects. What a pile of tosh.
10.0~Nolan's Finest Hour kaaber-2 Sign in Permalink I can honestly state that no other film has truly given me the feeling of actually being on location, which, in the case of Dunkirk, 1940, is not altogether a pleasant experience. But it's a great, great film. I've never seen anything like it. It is also the most un-theatrical film I have seen to date; it actually comes across as a documentary. The acting is admirably restrained, the dialog all but absent, and the cinematography to die for. The casting is inspired. From the crooked teeth of our main tommy, aptly named Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) to Commander Bolton (Branagh, who always looks any part he plays), everyone could be your average Brit in WW2. No gloss, no glitter. Not even elevated rhetorics: Churchill's speech of 4 June '40 is read aloud from a newspaper, with no gusto and interrupted. Nolan takes the decisive moment of World War II, the evacuation from Dunkirk which was the bleakest hour of the war when it seemed like Germany would win after having subjugated every country in Europe save England. The colossal evacuation, performed primarily by private fishing boats, gave 300,000 men the opportunity to fight again. The subsequent Battle of Britain, one month later, convinced the US about entering the war and aid the allies before fighting in the Pacific, and this was what sealed Hitler's fate. We may be apt to forget how easily the allies might have lost the war – but Nolan reminds us with a vengeance, especially near the end of film when the survivors return to England as they believe in disgrace. They have done nothing but survive. But their survival turned the tide.
6.0~Average at best. Over-hyped unnecessarily. SaranshTMF Sign in Permalink The film is about an unacknowledged story of WW2 where 400000 men, on a beach, were struggling to survive. Movie shows that despite large in number but still helpless to fight, 300000 soldiers were rescued off the beach by civilians. And instead of getting booed for their cowardliness, they were respectfully welcomed in their homeland. Basically showing a fresh perspective on war that sometimes survival is also a victory. The moment you walk out of theater, you will forget the film. No strong characters, unnecessary time line shifts to show a straightforward story made me loose interest in the film. IT IS JUST AN ORDINARY FILM. What could've made it interesting? A focus on how the French sacrificed a lot as an allied force knowing that only 30,000 can survive and British were the first preference. A focus on why only 30,000 soldiers could be saved. This is an interesting one. The water at the beach was very shallow and only one ship could sail ashore at a time during high tide (every six hours or so). A proper background of the events that led to 4000000 soldiers stranded on the beach. It was one of the most clever plan by Germans to make them helpless. Leaflets were thrown (start of the film) asking the french to look at the map. They are surrounded by German army on the front and ocean on the back. There is no way but surrender. However the french saw the shallow ocean as an opportunity to escape ad survive. All these details are missing.
10.0~Best of Nolan. Best of the year, maybe even the decade! arghaoc Sign in Permalink I still don't believe that Christopher Nolan actually pulled off this project using no blood or gore. Telling a story from three different perspectives: land, air, and water, the movie has no particular character arc but an overwhelming piece of storytelling with a minimal amount of dialogue. That said, Dunkirk is THE most immersive war film made to date, and that makes it the movie of the year, probably of the decade and Nolan's best work. When I initially heard that he's making a movie on an actual story related World War II, and given the fact that every one of his work plays with a non-linear timeline, I wondered how he's gonna do it with this topic. But there he was, making all of us scratch our heads with the three different timelines. Chris is a Master of visual storytelling, which is a result of a witty screenplay, extravagant cinematography, and practical visual effects, supported by a heart-pounding musical score by Hans Zimmer. And as always, it needs several re-watches. Plus, I'm looking forward to seeing him grab his first Oscar next year. For Director and Screenplay!
10.0~A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any "characters" nimdude Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for. The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why. The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of "main characters" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the "main characters" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to "develop" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings. 9.5/10
5.0~Gonna take a shot at reviewing this (no pun intended) nyorkergurl Sign in Permalink I'll start with the good. Nolan's refusal to use sets creates a wonderful atmosphere. I really felt like I was there on the beach with them, I felt the gloom and the cold and the mist and the enclosed spaces. The contrasting sunset on the sea with the catastrophe of war made me feel deeply for the humans who experienced this. I enjoyed the humanity in the beginning, the men searching for water and trying to poop anywhere possible. However, my red flag went up at the informative slides at the beginning. In one swift move, any chance of mystery and allure was crushed. Obviously this is a historical event so major spoilers aren't really possible. But, this isn't a documentary. Let the stories unfold. Give us information in text if necessary, but omit the end outcome. "The men waited for a miracle." Okay. So, we now know this movie is about them getting this miracle. Done. We already knew that. Don't tell us, show us. I personally am not a fan of the way Christopher Nolan directs. In this movie as well as Batman, the audience is left visually lost. There are no point of references, no connected images that help us make heads or tails of exactly what's happening. This movie is unnecessarily convoluted. It took me awhile to understand that we are cutting between three different time lines. This is a fantastic tactic, if done with intention. In Dunkirk, it was all just... kind of happening. The film manipulates you by using incredibly loud sounds, which didn't bother me at first because I felt like I was really there with them, but when the film showed itself to be lacking in other ways, I felt fooled by the cheap trick. I found a lot of the film to be simply inaudible. I dreaded the conversations between the commander and the colonel. For me it went "blah blah blah, home" "blah blah blah, home" "blah blah blah, civilians" At one point we even discovered that our stowaway friend was French. I thought it was more of an indiscernible English accent, but my French friend who I saw the movie with filled me in afterwards, and he only knew what happened because he speaks French. Is that a huge negative? Not necessarily. But it felt like I was being left out. There's two types of movies. There's a movie that takes you into it, effortlessly. It isn't something you are watching but something you are apart of. The other type of movie is one that you actively need to watch. You could take it or leave it. It doesn't command your attention. The main event of this movie was people getting off ships, people getting back on ships, people getting off ships, people getting back on ships. There was no through-line to look to for guidance. It didn't highlight the story of Dunkirk from any specific or interesting angle. Like I said before, it just kind of happened. The point of this movie is that it happened. Which, okay, that's fine. But, on top of that, key ingredients of the actual event were missing! The real event included French and Candian and Belgian troops all evacuating over a weeks time, with the small boats. It wasn't suddenly one easy trip the way this movie presents it to be. And while this was happening, British and French men had to stay behind and fight in order to let the others escape. In addition to that, we didn't once see a man on the other side, narrowing and dehumanizing this story. It's oddly convenient that everyone cheered with excitement when the small boats showed up, considering everyone who had gone out into the sea for the past week had been getting slaughtered. Seems less like real men experiencing this in real time, and more like a Hollywood director knowing the end of this story. This part, seemingly the main event of Dunkirk was completely glossed over. Seeing the civilians reach land, seeing the interactions between them and the soldiers, seeing the gratitude and stress and exhaustion is essential. And we got none of it. If your one goal in making a movie is to tell it how it is, at least tell it how it is.
4.0~Wanted to like it, I really did, but... c-a-r-l-o-s Sign in Permalink Just saw this yesterday and I really wanted to like it, being an amateur historian in general and big fan of military movies/books in particular (i'm an old navy sailor). Aah where to begin, I guess with the non-chronological, non-linear format; bad idea for this movie. I'm a fan of it in other genres, but it doesn't allow you to engage or get invested in the event being depicted, much less any of the people. It jerks you back and forth from "week" to "day" to "hour." It feels like it's out of sync throughout the whole times being depicted. I loved the Dark Knight and believe it is the greatest superhero movie ever made, plus a genuinely magnificent movie in general; up there with Ben-Hur, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Good The Bad & The Ugly, the Godfather, even Once Upon a Time In American (another out of sequence movie), and so forth. I know it sort of raps up with all three frames, but you even get to see repetitive scenes (albeit from different viewpoints) again and again. The score wasn't anything spectacular, just a little bit overdone, and sometimes even overtook what was going on screen, bad idea. As another reviewer noted, the historical event was a big deal, this movie was supposed to "film" it, but you only see 7-8 boats on screen, not the hundreds that were actually used; same goes for the extras; I felt this was a great opportunity for CGI boats, planes, and people; I'm not against it for conveying "reality" on screen, especially on a Nolan film, the CGI would have been top-class and wouldn't have been cheesy. Also, the lack of dialogue made it more like a long documentary about the logistics of the event, even though you don't see the grand scale (with a couple of hundred extras, 7-8 boats, and 3-4 planes). I feel bad for not liking this movie more because I'm really appreciative of what the British did at Dunkirk to "fall-back" and live to fight another day and eventually defeat Germany in WWII. The "Greatest Generation" described in Tom Brokaw's book, which I read, was even greater in the United Kingdom, due to their sacrifices and shared sufferings (bombing of London and other UK cities). This movie deserved to be given one or two people to hang on to and grieve with and cheer for and be afraid with and persevere and survive with. Even though the end ends like that, it was sort of anti-climatic. This was my opinion, one man, not representative of anyone else's view point, of which we all know there are/will be many.
5.0~More like a documentary than a dramatic film bobbobwhite Sign in Permalink Not too much I liked about this film. Emotionless story for the most part, with mostly repetitive bombing and killing and a soundtrack that was deafening and unrelenting. The film's color was also washed out which bled any potential emotion from it. Character development was non-existent. Mostly scenes of scared to death young men trying to survive. Didn't like at all the 3 stories in one gimmicky approach to this important historical event. Scenes constantly jumped from one of the 3 stories to the another with no relationship to the last scene shown, only to the last scene of the same story shown earlier. Also, too much repetition and different angles of air attacks, with soldiers constantly in the water from bombings and too little of anything else that made Dunkirk the historical war icon that it is known to be. For example, in one scene it was disheartening and historically inaccurate to show one destroyer that didn't even fire a shot at a bomber that sunk it even as the plane was clearly visible from miles off. And, the many plane dog fights were too repetitive and did not look realistic for the most part. There were also too many scenes that looked "off" in historical accuracy to me, one example being the one of soldiers in an abandoned boat on the beach, being shot at by an unseen shooter, but none of the soldiers were killed or even hit by the many bullets that pierced the boat's sides. Not one. The entire story and editing of the film annoyed me to the point that I ended up not caring much what happened at the end. That is never a good thing in a war movie. The different time lines of the 3 stories were more than disorienting at times as the film cut from story to story and back again, with all time in each......suspended. If this famous filmmaker wanted to make a documentary, he should have made one. What was missing was a dramatic movie. To me, bad form to mix the two but keep an emotion-starved, washed-out color, documentary style story throughout. This story could have been told and shown a lot better.
9.0~Nolan's perspective is fresh and it didn't matter you knew what was going to happen next. arangoc Sign in Permalink This movie has me rethinking my own set of rules which I use to distinguish between a flop and a masterpiece. My mayor rule states that when you can decipher what is going to happen next then automatically the movie is garbage. So... while watching Dunkirk, I guessed instantly how all stories would end. And you too! Bad fuel gauge... crash! Teenager on boat... death! Good old man at helm... success! Pilot drowning... saved! Ahh, including the absurd finale when Farrier lands on a German controlled beach. So this is the genius of Nolan, he turned my "worst movie of the year" according to my usual criteria to a masterpiece. You better get up and forget Netflix tonight and head to your nearest cinema. By the way Nolan, if you ever read this, your engine-less Spitfire flew at the speed of a Ranger from Interstellar, slow it down a little next time.
8.0~A Thrilling, epic ride. Nolan delivers again! NoOneElse101 Sign in Permalink I've been a fan of Chris Nolan since the Dark Knight Trilogy. He is a highly, capable and talented filmmaker. I had fairly high expectations going into the movie because the reviews were so excellent and they lived up and even exceeded my expectations. It's not a straightforward war film, but it does show many of the brutal elements of war. The sounds, graphics and effects are all top notch and the movie works more like a thriller than a straightforward war film. You actually feel like you are in the setting. The character development I've seen a few complain about it wasn't necessary because the point of the film was to show the realism of what happened at Dunkirk. I particularly liked the scenes with Mark Rylance who is excellent here playing a civilian who helps injured soldiers. His performance is believable and haunting. I also thought Tom Hardy, who plays a pilot, did a fantastic job showing the escape from Dunkirk from the air. Overall, Dunkirk is a masterwork of film making and it was worth every penny.
10.0~A story that many of us have forgotten in the form of a movie that none of us will ever forget. theVade Sign in Permalink Dunkirk was one of the best films of the year, if not the decade. Its unique way of storytelling and emotional score provided one of the best films that Nolan has directed to date, and is an amazing masterpiece in modern film. Although its unique way of storytelling might turn some people away, it left me with my jaw on the ground and tears in my eyes. Nolan's direction in visuals have progressed beyond that of Interstellar, and proved to be one of the most visually stunning pieces of film in a long time. With all that in mind, I had the easy task of rating this film, which won itself The Golden V, as Dunkirk received "Straight V's" on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. Nolan continues his streak of memorable films by providing us with a story that many of us have forgotten in the form of a movie that none of us will ever forget. Read more at theVade.
10.0~good education for the folks a generation removed from history getadisasterkit Sign in Permalink Just got back from seeing Dunkirk. 5 out of 5 is my rating. I have a special affinity for WW2 flicks, and this one kept me engaged and the music and sound gave it a dimensional feel without the aid of matrix floating and blowing up space ships. To top it off, it had my favorite actor Kenneth Branagh who I have been following since 1983 and his career with the Royal Academy and his early Shakespeare offerings, and even before his marriage to Emma Thompson. Was surprised to see him since I had not read up on the movie before I saw it with the Mom. Since I loosely follow the WW2 string of battles this one will leave those who have no knowledge of the a fore mentioned, at least engaged and not wanting to go to the bathroom. The movie combines 3 stories that intertwine at the end. Mark Rylance is a pleasant surprise, if you are familiar with his work in Bridge of Spies. Good film to educate teens on what happened with the era of their Great Grandparents. Recommend. Be sure to see on the biggest screen and sound system possible.
3.0~Oh dear, another boring movie! gooneruk-74023 Sign in Permalink I know this is something that actually happened, but surely they could have made it a bit more exciting. I was actually desperate to see this in the cinema, but I'm glad I was away on holiday and actually missed it.
9.0~The big picture on a personal level. carolethecatlover Sign in Permalink All British people know the story of Dunkirk, but few other nationalities may. A written prologue of what happened and why might be useful for other nations. Also, what happened to all the French? It tries to encompass the entire event by telling the story on the land, on the sea, and in the air. All the actors are superb. The sets are amazing. I felt dirty, wet and cold after watching it. As a movie it cannot be faulted, but it is not enough of a documentary for those who don't know the story. Also, I understand that 100s of small boats took part, but only a few are shown. The Spitfires are the real stars of this film. Aerial dogfights have not been seen (outside of star wars) for decades. The Music is annoying and distracts from the 70mm visual action on beaches and in the air. Do see it in 70mm. Take a blanket and a cup of tea.
5.0~So & So thomas-147-89750 Sign in Permalink The only thing that I could enjoy was that it felt like watching an old war movie. I could have understood this movie if it was shot in the 60's or 70's, back then they would have made it in the same way probably and it could turn into a classic. But with the resources given to filmmakers in 2017, this movie is just unacceptable and insults the classics with all the goofs and shortages. We don't see any German face in the movie, only their bullets. Is this really Dunkirk surrounded by Germans? No way. The city is so clean! and lastly, I really wonder how this movie holds an 8+ rating when most of the written reviews are below 5. Uncredibility for IMDb too.
4.0~Now that was dull! jordan_bel Sign in Permalink Looks to me like Mr Nolan's director career is on the same track as Mr Night's (shamaya, Shimalaya, whatever). Their first or second movies (Memento, superb) were by far their best and it's all downhill from there (Interstellar, yuk). Dunkirk kind of lets you down on all accounts. No attention paid to the anachronisms (modern buildings, container cranes... lol). No characters whatsoever, except as solid as usual Mark Rylance. The storyline would fill half a page on a notepad. Seeing each scene from three different perspectives at different times does not make the film any better, just the story shorter. No suspense, no action, no acting, no nothing. Photography is decent, but it's not Private Ryan or Band of brothers. Honestly don't bother, watch it on freeview in 2 years you'll be equally disappointed.
1.0~Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen pmorris-37048 Sign in Permalink Absurdly sentimental, jingoistic, factually inaccurate claptrap. Truly cringeworthy.
5.0~Nolan misses the Slam-Dunk(irk) on this one uprashanthnayak Sign in Permalink With his newest release 'Dunkirk' , high-profile director Christopher Nolan ensures that I've seen more duds from him rather than successes. In fact, if I hadn't known Nolan directed 'Dunkirk', I'd never have suspected it after the movie , aside from soon forgetting the film anyway. Here's a fabulous example of how to spend a big fortune on a war movie, with all the sound and swooping visuals, and yet ultimately leave the viewer with precious little to hang on to after it's all over. Pic is based on the eventual evacuation of more than 330,000 British and allied troops from France's Dunkerque coast where they were trapped after the Germans pushed them there in 1940 in WWII. The Nazi's bizarre decision not to advance full-throttle on these cornered troops is perhaps not relevant to the movie but Nolan commits other glaring omissions - afraid perhaps of upsetting his current-day German pals, he uses the non-specific word 'enemy' instead of Germans ; more disturbing is the fact that he refuses to show even passing footage of how in real life more than 30,000 French soldiers gallantly assisted British evacuation while themselves having to surrender to the Nazis. Forgetful that he's directing a movie and not a mute show-'n'-read- out picture show, the movie's preamble informs us of the above background in print instead of having characters tell the situation to us with simple dialogue. Nolan seems to have held his background-score composer to rifle- point and warned him of impending strafing if he ever stops the music - the result is non-stop keening from the foreboding cellos. The relentless background music, even if it is not that loud, ensures that there is barely any moment of reflection, perspective or poise in this hectic collage. I often accuse Indian mainstream film-makers of BGM overkill - Nolan here seems to tell them 'Don't worry, I'm with you'. The lens refuses to dwell on any given situation or character at length ; resultantly very few scenes pack emotional gravitas and I will be genuinely stunned if you remember in later months the sentimental impact of any character from this movie. A character comes to an unfortunate end unrelated to the direct strike of war but the story-teller here is unable to extract wrenching impact from that turn. Emotional force and even poignant throb was indubitably present in Nolan's genius 'Memento' and the monumental 'The Dark Knight' but the same conceptual somersaults hamstrung by an inadequate emotional core which afflicted his 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' are on unfortunate evidence here. Caught up in large-scale logistics again, the director fails to present an adequate supply of absorbing dramatic scenes as if to imply that the bare-bones appeal of elemental theater do no interest him. But this is a war movie with a lot of action which is more important - some might say. Sure why not, I greatly appreciated the no-hold- barred carnage exploding in 'Saving Private Ryan' but that focus is missing here. The soldiers on the beach and wharf taking a pounding from the overhead planes is initially impressive but soon that is frittered away in shifty scene planning. Point of View shots from the fighter pilot's plane admirably show us how difficult it is to aim at the constantly moving enemy planes in contrast to easy video games, but that vicarious whiz-'n'-danger of those zooming fighter planes is not fully realized, with the editing of those aerial scenes not generating any thrilling continuity either.The ending is quite anti-climactic - I barely cared who lived and who did not. When you spend $150 million on a movie, such things should matter, I think. By UPN/EarnesTaster
3.0~Overrated, no content, boring ehsanelite Sign in Permalink This movie is a 3 at best, one of the worst movies i watched this year, what the hell was that? I felt nothing, the soundtrack tried so hard to make scenes cool but it failed miserably Battlefield 1 campaign had so much better storytelling than a christopher nolan movie so much better soundtrack than hans zimmers work and gave me so much more feelings than this excuse of a movie and it was from EA Games, those scumbags make better stuff than this...
1.0~Boring and bad joeduran Sign in Permalink This movie is beyond bad: 1. Annoying music: permanent background music that tries to convey dramatic moments for all the scenes, even undramatic scenes. I was annoyed 15 minutes into the film. 2 Hours later, was wondering why I didn't walk out of the film earlier. I counted at least 10 people walking out and not coming back. 2. Bad editing. The story unfolds from three different perspectives, which makes the scenes repetitive and adding nothing. 3. Boring. Nothing really happens. 4. Unrealistic. Without giving any spoiler, the movie does not represent at all the sheer magnitude of what happened in Dunkirk. Please don't waste your time watching this, not even on Netflix or TV.
1.0~Worst warm film I have seen in years mx-420 Sign in Permalink I can't think of a war movie worse, even if I try hard, wouldn't even watch this if it was on TV. The soundtrack left me with a headache after leaving the movie theater. Storyline goes absolutely nowhere. This film is supposed to be about a horrific war tragedy, but actually leaves you stranded with 8 planes 4 boats and 200 soldiers standing on a beach. The scenery was very bad, the movie only switches between three: (sea, sky and beach.) If Cristopher Nolan's intention was to leave you stranded on a beach with a shell shock headache and no look on the horizon he did a great job, otherwise this film is absolute nonsense.
6.0~So Much Missed Opportunity - Another Movie Is Needed!! SeattleDeanr Sign in Permalink Went and saw Dunkirk last night. If you plan on seeing it, STOP reading - my short review will likely spoil it. Not a typical war movie, not at all actually. Was feeling like the Director missed a great opportunity to tell more about the amazing history. There was a lot of great filming, but the three stories within the overall story with how they switched back and forth was so complicated, it was hard to keep up on what was going on. It did make you feel like you were IN the scenes though - which was the best part of the movie. The biggest flaw as so many others have stated - very little character development that resulted in my not having much empathy on a personal level. As another reviewer put it, there was no difference in the sense of loss between a main character getting killed any of the extra's getting killed. Nothing at all like the character development that occurred in Saving Private Ryan and other great war films. The second flaw (also mentioned numerous times by others), the background music was non-stop and got to be quite noticeable and annoying. I got bored and started looking at my watch about 3/4 of the way wondering when it was going to end. Overall, a disappointment - won't ever watch it again. I hope someday another Director will take another shot at focusing more on how the miracle happened at Dunkirk, both from the Allied's and Germany's perspective (like how they did in The Longest Day, Patton and Tora Tora Tora). Seeing exactly HOW so many of the small boats got organized for the rescue would have been good. Watching some scenes of German commanders making decisions to not go in for the kill would have been also good. And then seeing their eventual surprise when they realized that they let 300,000 troops escape through their fingers - would had made an excellent scene. And then finally, a voice recording of Churchill's inspiring speech at the end, rather than mere words on the screen would have been much better and satisfying. The biggest mystery to me is why this movie is being rated so high. Guess the difference in style is what is being praised mostly? As of this writing, the IMDb rating is at 8.7 - way too high of a score, needs to be down in the 6-7 range.
7.0~A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters. criticadelcinema Sign in Permalink Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no. The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend. Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan. This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle. And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection. While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given. I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed. If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic. This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet.
4.0~A well made, disguised propaganda movie frederico-klein Sign in Permalink THIS REVIEW DOES NOT REALLY CONTAINS SPOILERS. I ADDED THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO CLUE HOW MUCH OF PLOT ELEMENTS YOU CAN SHARE FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER. From beginning to the end, Dunkirk is gorgeous. The scenes look real and lifelike and that can have a strong impression. It's photography is so stunning (I assume shot in location), and the scenes so well composed that you really have the impression you are in the middle of a war zone. That was the only thing I liked about this movie. I mean, don't get me wrong, most people will likely find this movie amazing. I believe I have a perhaps more strict requirements from movies than most, to name a few that weren't met (maybe some people will feel like this is a spoiler, because it will make them enjoy less the movie, since well, it's crap, but the haven't realized yet): there is no story. Nothing happens. I like movies where things happen. This movie is funny that way, nothing really goes on. it's some propaganda BS. like really: the time when some rich aristocrat came to rescue soldiers with his yacht. it almost makes me laugh. I keep thinking about the uselessness of yachts and how much it costs to keep one, about an aristocratic Englishman voting laws to keep immigrants away and going around in his yacht, maybe feeling bad about starving kids in Africa and how he just voted a law that makes sure none of those will never enter English soil, and maybe he feels a little bit bad about his yacht and how much diesel it uses. Maybe he thinks about climate change or how he spent in one hour 120 pounds in diesel alone on making his way to Belgium, and how much he would spend in total, not that he cares that much about money as he has plenty. He cares about the public opinion, he himself knows a yacht IS an useful thing, a necessity, if you will. And also he didn't even buy this yacht, he inherited it, so was it really his fault? But now, after Dunkirk, he is relieved. He will be seen sailing as the hero he believes he is. Rescuing people, letting strangers into his boat and taking them to safety. Not that he would let anyone into his boat and help them to England - Hell no! If the were English soldiers, in distress, in time of war, then yes, but other cases, of course not. do I really need to bash it more? Okay, so the characters are not developed. There is no depth to them. I cannot even tell if the actors did a good or a bad job, because we learn nothing about no one. Maybe that's the genius (GENIUS BEGINS), keeping the mystery. OR it is lazy writing and poor storytelling. WHO knows? One sided AF. We see no German soldiers - maybe that's the genius (THE DARK GENIUS) - or maybe it is a one sided propaganda crap, as the victor tells the story kinda thing. I mean, have you seen a story book saying that the rapist, thieving bigoted man that destroyed the land and were insane and horrible actually won something? In short, the whole thing was mind numbing. I was expecting some sort of introspective drama, maybe even some new insight into war or something deeper, OMG, an 8.4 on IMDb, right. But I think this score is fabricated, this movie is mediocre at best - although beautiful. Huge disappointment, don't spend your money, wait for it to come in Netflix and then, I will congratulate you if you watch it until the end. 2 hours of my life I will never see again and money they took from me to watch a freaking English yacht aristocrat save the day by going into war when he wasn't even drafted. Like really, it pisses me off so much thinking about it I would like to challenge the director to a fist fight. And have him give me my cinema money back.
2.0~Horrible movie meverly-22986 Sign in Permalink Do not waste your time. This senseless movie is annoying at best. Countless flashbacks makes it impossible to follow and the worst score I've ever heard.
1.0~Do NOT allow the Movie Rating to fool you! nimano Sign in Permalink I ONLY watched this movie because of the Movie Rating here on IMDb. Let me save you if you have not watched it yet: Watching this movie was torture. Do NOT watch this movie and do NOT let the rating fool you. The movie is unbelievably boring, no main character and no connection between the actors. There was just no feels in this movie. The movie is disgustingly slow, underwhelming and horrible as a whole. This movie robbed my time. I will never let IMDb Movie Rating fool me ever again, if possible. Save yourself and shove the thought of watching this movie away completely.
3.0~Boring belomestnykh Sign in Permalink One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Every time Tom Hardy is on the screen, you can have a bathroom break or refill your popcorn, as there is nothing that will happen that you might miss. Not that pretty,not that deep, not that good. The similar ending of a movie 'Boat that Rocks' has much more feel to it than this one.
7.0~Worth seeing, but not Nolans Masterpiece bwh-44688 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk review spoiler free unless you know how history turns out lol. First impressions: sound effects are loud, makes me feel like I'm in a war, music from Zimmer is great and at times I felt like it sounded very Similar to interstellar soundtrack. The pacing is pretty quick through the whole movie and it does jump back in forth between characters (air, sea, beach, civilian boat). You get a blend of thriller/war feel as each character life is constantly put in danger. This is NOT saving private Ryan or band of brothers. The violence as intense at all; their are lots of explosions, bombs, dog fights, sinking ships, and chaotic swimming; but you won't see men bleeding out on the beach or picking up body parts. This movie is very much focused on the navy and air aspect of the Battle of Dunkirk. Hardly any land gunfights at all. You won't see men storming bunkers or fighting house to house. Favorite character was the old man boat captain. Hardy does well but has a face mask on most of the time (doesn't sound like Bane think god). Harry Stiles actually did well and is placed as a Everyman character that just wants to get home. Interstellar, The Dark Knight and Inception are better movies than this one IMO but you can definitely tell this has Nolans fingerprints all over it. Overall 7/10
1.0~I walked out. curtisbidgood Sign in Permalink In the opening seen we see soldiers all gunned down trying to jump a wooden gate, wouldn't they have turned the corner at the building they passed to escape gun fire? Then the 1 guy who gets over the gate leans his back up against it while bullets fly through the wood, wouldn't he jump behind the stone wall holding the gate up? And when did airplanes start burning more fuel when they went higher? I love some of Mr. Nolan's movies, Inception and Interstellar are fantastic, but maybe it would be better if he stuck to fiction.
10.0~Tea and Jam Sandwiches - The Dunkirk Spirit kriscgis Sign in Permalink I am Dunkirk crazy. I have seen it twice, including the world premier release at 7:15am, where I got a free Dunkirk t-shirt as a first showing promotion for IMAX. The first two viewings were due to booking a later showing which had a relatively poorer seat near the front, so I booked the early morning one with a better seat as I was d e s p e r a t e to see it ASAP. I now have tickets to see it twice more, again on IMAX 70 I just love it so much. So thrilling, so visceral. I was crying, cheering, proud, anxious, relieved: the whole gamut of emotions. I needed oxygen. The splendid soundtrack was almost Metallica on speed with a syncopy similar to a heart rate beating faster and faster. My pulse was off the stratosphere. I did feel a bit nauseous at the hand-held camera jogging along with the guys running across the beach, and although I dare say it is a clever technique and quite deliberate, some of the out-of-focus shots of background forces personnel were annoying. Harry Styles cuts a convincing figure as a young soldier although Fionn Whitehead (pronounced: 'Finn', apparently) steals the show with his serious expression and the guy in the boat in the red jumper, Peter, 'the Captain's son', played by Tom Glynn- Carney, is just so polite, handsome and British, I wanted to hug him - I have a crush! - and his dad, a stubborn irascible Welshman is brilliant with his quiet deadpan determination. It's amazing to discover that this is a 'first movie' for Fionn Whitehead and Tom Glynn-Carney, as well as Harry Styles. What great casting. Fionn comes across as a young glowering Tom Courtney, Harry, a rebellious James Dean/Mick Jagger type and Tom an affable Cliff Richard (as in Summer Holiday). The upper-class airman on the boat sounds like an American trying to put on a posh British accent. It is, in fact, Cillian Murphy, who I found out later, hails from Ireland. It was the way he said, 'Yacht', that gave it away. It was obvious Harry Styles is not RADA trained as his diction is poor and I struggled to understand what he was saying, although I got it (well, almost all of it) the second time round. He over-acted as well, but being a good actor comes with time. The soundtrack goes right through you, you really have to see it at volume 11 with the screen in your face. It is worth the extra five pounds or so to see it on IMAX, so I urge you to see it before it's too late and all you have is the DVD download or the edited TV film with commercial breaks. Take an afternoon or morning off work - the evening sessions are all sold out - and just go see. Even if you have to sit in the front row at the end, beg steal or borrow and see it well. I love this film with all my heart. It is the best film EVER. made. Despite my minor moans above, I would still have given it an eleven, given half a chance. At both showings, people spontaneously applauded at the end.
3.0~Dreadfully slow and unrealistic with unnecessary side plots ttessaro-46626 Sign in Permalink For at least the first hour this movie was painfully slow, the dialogue was terrible to non-existent and many of the shots were unrealistic - the civilian rescue boats are shown several times with no wakes, sitting still in the water, highly unlikely for a rescue action. The film diverged into unnecessary subplots when the precious screen time could have been used to develop characters and background details.
5.0~Complexity for nothing maddalollo Sign in Permalink Let's begin stating that I love Nolan and all his movies that I've seen so far, so I tried very hard to like this one. I'm not going to repeat what many other reviews already pointed out, but my critique is that the complicated time-line was not needed if not for adding complexity and reducing clarity in the plot. In every one of his movies, the use of flashbacks and non linear storytelling is somewhat related to the characters or has the effect of making a plot twist much more powerful, but in this case I think it was used only to mask an otherwise bad narrative.
3.0~Sorry this is not Oscar caliber! mandoz Sign in Permalink The acting was good, noting against the actors. The scenes seemed to drag on for ever. I had to replay some of the scenes to understand what they were saying. It really needed subtitles! This is NOT of the caliber of "Saving Private Ryan" no where no way!
5.0~Tedious And Lacking lbenot Sign in Permalink While the true story and heroic efforts of the Dunkirk Evacuation deserve a 10, this movie does not. The worst of it was the droning, somber monotony of the musical soundtrack, particularly in the first portion of the movie, which has to be the most tediously overwrought score in history; followed by another heavy handed long section of a repetitively monotonous 4 or 5 note ascending minor scale, all of which was a serious and unfortunate detraction from the action on screen. One of the historically unique facts of this evacuation was the civilian fleet of nearly 400 small craft (Wikipedia) which heroically volunteered for this amazing feat, which I think was under-depicted. By the movie's end, it confirmed the senseless stupidity of geo-political wars and conflicts caused by governmental leaders, and the resulting senseless personal loss at the battle front. But faced with this senselessness, it also celebrated individual acts of bravery and sacrifice. Conspicuously and sadly absent was a written narrative at the end which summarized and brought into focus the huge scope of this historic evacuation, along with actual photographs.
4.0~I don't understand the rave reviews Gareth-UK Sign in Permalink My Uncle Frank died on Dunkirk beach. I was hoping to see a film that portrayed the horror of war - as means to deter others. What I saw was over-hyped, uncritical nonsense. From what I know from relatives, the evacuation was utter carnage. Yes soldiers escaped - but many (at least as many as escaped) were mown down via aerial attacks. The film showed very few aircraft which was stupid (also not very many soldiers). Very few ships and aeroplanes now survive but I'd have thought the CGI budget would have covered that.The lack of planes, boats and people seemed very very strange. Where were the Germans? We saw two German helmets when a pilot was captured. That was it! Did the film have German financial backing or something? Also for a reportedly costly film - the shots were full of modern artefacts. Garbage. Hype. Do yourself a favour and watch something else.
2.0~Christopher Nolan make a big mistake opret Sign in Permalink From all "Christopher Nolan" movies I have never seen like this movie before. Bad story, there is no creativity in this movie, I thought at first moment it's going to be the most beautiful movie I have ever seen because it's from Christopher Nolan and it's a war movie but I disappointed I like the cinematography I like the music and the songs but the story was so bad I didn't like the story and most of the people didn't like it.
4.0~Dunkirk is confused and I am sure it is not a MOVIE. aazamparvez_itmb Sign in Permalink Okay so I just returned home after watching Dunkirk and I have I was so wrong,Hahn Don't know how to say this but billions of blue blistering barnacles what the F@@K did I just saw. This is not a Christopher Nolan movie it had nothing of him in this movie in fact I am not even sure if it was a movie at best it's a WW2 situation shown on a high budget History channel world war episode. I am not swayed by anyone's review so I am going to give my Unbiased Spoiler free review of DUNKIRK. Okay the opening scene is awesome and it gets you the background score is getting chilling and you are now in Christopher Nolan Zone and then 15 minutes goes by and music is still building on and before it reaches the climax there is suddenly change of scene!! Why?? And the same things go on in a loop throughout the movie. Its just starts to get frustrating. Just for everyone benefits Dunkirk is bit like Memento which tells the same episode through different character eyes in a Time lapse/ Wrap mode and this time it is not executive well. You have to pay attention to starting 10 minutes to get what's going to happen the incidents will be shown through 3 different angels – Soldiers on land, pilots in the sky and sailors on the boat and by far the best shots are from the sky and no one gives damn about soldiers and of course since it's a sea movie you have lots of ships and one very irritating rescue boat. Now here is the most confusing part of this movie, you see many big ships sinking yet you start to realize no damn it, it's the same ship sinking over and over again!! I mean the same episode is being shown by three different group of people. in Dunkirk defense it has some truly state of the Art Dog fight scene in the sky and they are shot Gorgeously well and its the only saving grace of the movie and yet in the end of the movie that moments are also taken away from you. Dunkirk is not a movie it's a episode at best there are no characters and the best one never shows his face and I have no idea if Christopher Nolan does not like Tom Hardy Face but he refuse to give him face time on on the screen, he is always in some kind of mask. I Think even if every Englishman write brave reviews about Dunkirk it will still not save this huge high budget ship from sinking , it has Titanic written all over it. I am not sure if CN directed this movie or some one from his assistant team did it. The film has some very serious editing issues and narration is all over the place. The Music has same tone in every seen and hence we will never have "No time to Caution" moment in this movie. For me this movie has failed in all levels, even Hacksaw ridge is far better war movie than this one but the problem is Hacksaw understand it is a movie Dunkirk is confused and I am sure it is NOT.
8.0~The least thing can be said (a film makes you love mercy) yaho-86776 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a drama film rather than a war movie. I admire all the high meaning of the film from fear, pride and love to help and describe the situation in which they are and in an innovative way that makes you feel all the meaning of Christfr Nolan. Thank you for this effort.
1.0~Nothing what you expect seeing the trailer hiravparekh Sign in Permalink The movie is so slow. Watching the trailer you would expect action scenes in the movie but there is almost none. Its all one side is attaching and the other is defending. You almost feel in the beginning the director is setting up the movie nice for some nice action to follow but midway through the movie you realize that nothing has happened and apparently nothing is going to happen. The movie never picks up. It just fails.
2.0~How on earth is this considered a good movie? naamiokostaja Sign in Permalink I must have seen another movie. The plot had huge holes, the linearity of the movie was VERY confusing. Could they not have edited out the modern houses at the beach? Yes, some could fit the timeline, but steel and glass balconies were not all the rage in those days. The aerial combat was a joke, as well as the complete lack of airplanes at the beach.
3.0~Did not do the Real Story justice. ratari Sign in Permalink The Story of Dunkirk was an EPIC event, a key event of WW2. This film, in my opinion just did not make it as far as getting the idea across that this was a miraculous. mammoth undertaking. This film has some good points but it floundered. You get the feeling there are only a handful of boats and planes involved. I just did not feel the SCOPE of this undertaking.
4.0~A decent budget wasted in a horrendous way sakram Sign in Permalink I can't give this movie above 4. The 4 Stars would go to Good acting and good visuals, 2 stars for the heroes who died in war. Anything else ? This movie failed us. I won't complain about the soundtrack because it only becomes plain and obvious when the crowd's attention isn't fully sunken into the movie. There were no scenes at all to absorb that attention, so, our attention turned to the soundtrack, visuals, and whatnots. I couldn't find any depth in the characters, but it's fine, it was a war movie with not so much to do with the characters. But well ? Where is the Action ? Where is the suspense ? And there are a lot of ridiculous plotholes cited by other reviewers. This is not like Christopher Nolan, who absolutely disappointed me. When the movie ended, I didn't feel anything, or actually I did, I felt disappointment and non-contentment. Last thing I would say, This is VASTLY overrated. Save your money for something else. 4/10
2.0~No Transgenders...no thank you. baldhobbit Sign in Permalink I loved the movie but wished that Christopher Nolan had showed more heroic transgender soldiers...a missed opportunity really. He showed the heroic soldiers, the heroic captains, and even the heroic citizens. What about the transgenders. They are people too! I also have a bone to pick with Spielberg and that mediocre flick he made about the Private Ryan fellow.
9.0~Anonymity of principal cast honors anonymous heroes lotekguy-1 Sign in Permalink The story of this massive evacuation of British and French troops back across the English Channel in 1940 has been depicted several times before, but never so intriguingly or compellingly. Writer/director Christopher Nolan pulled off what seems to be oxymoronic in crafting a powerfully understated presentation of such a famous event. The preceding military action in France was a disaster, but rescuing most of the 400,000 soldiers pinned down by all branches of the German forces allowed England to keep Hitler on the Continent until the rest of the Allies would become fully armed and engaged. Most war films focus on one or more heroes, played by stars and familiar character actors, with relatively predictable story arcs. The 1958 account of this historic achievement starred John Mills and Richard Attenborough; in 2004, Benedict Cumberbatch and Timothy Dalton headlined. This time, Kenneth Branagh is the biggest "name", but his role is marginal. Instead, we switch among several story lines of anonymous soldiers, sailors, pilots and civilians, with few of them even being given names. We also see their fears, moments of cowardice or selfishness along with their heroism. By not knowing who is who (and, typically, who we figure will either save the day, die tragically, or both, based on decades of cinematic convention) we feel the utter randomness of which imperiled character will live or die, and whether it will happen on shore or during evacuation. British pride over the event comes largely from the way innumerable civilian boat owners, with vessels of all types and sizes, bravely responded to the call to help its over-matched Navy by crossing the channel to carry as many lads back as they could hold... if they survived the threats from enemy U-boats, bombers and fighter jets. For the troops, reaching one of the boats proved to be far from an assurance of safe passage. Nolan delivers all the sound and fury of being among their ranks, sustaining nearly two hours of the intense fear, chaos and frustrations that the actual figures must have experienced. It's among the closest approximations I can recall of the masterful D-Day landing sequence at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan. We see many fatalities from many causes, but without the explicit display of bloodshed that an R- rated production would have contained. We didn't need it to get the layers of emotional impact in that ordeal from all perspectives. The jumps from one mini-arena to another, and even repeating certain sequences from different character perspectives adds to that sense of no one in position to deduce what action or location will be safest for themselves or their comrades. The experience is grueling for the audience, and honors the soldiers most by putting us in their actual, not idealized or glorified, boots. This Dunkirk marks quite an achievement for all its creators and cast.
3.0~Waste of resources and opportunity. I_should_be_reading_a_book Sign in Permalink I'm not going to label this film the worst war film I've ever seen but it certainly disappointed me, seriously! With such a great story to tell factually, it throws all away in favor of whast seems to me like laziness on the part of producers and probably budget cuts. A few period yatches, a pityful of extras, mock Spitfire replicas (c´mon! there was available even the real Geoffrey Stephenson Mk1 Spitfire completely restored and made airworthy by Guy Martin). Where are the true actors of the drama? Cmdr Geoffrey Stephenson & Mr. Charles Lightoller for the sample buttons. Action scenes are barely a notch or two above ground level and the story telling is rambling, disconnected and completely misses the point. I was very enthusiastic about this movie but after having watched it, I'm very pissed.
6.0~Could have been great .... over rated by the Nolan lovers bridgeg57 Sign in Permalink I've now spoken with 4 other people who saw this movie and all of them felt the same way. I know how much of a darling Christopher Nolan is to the film critics. That said, without going into a long detailed account of this movie I'll just say this. This is a movie that could have been a great movie but wasn't. At the end of this movie you will not remember one character's name. (It's hard to remember what you never knew to begin with.) You will not know how many civilian boats came to the rescue of the trapped soldiers. You will not know how many civilians lost their lives trying to save the soldiers. You will not really know why or how the trapped soldiers ended up on the beach to begin with. You basically will have seen a few action scenes that take place on or near the beach at Dunkirk. That's it. REALLY! No story was told. No emotions get stirred or are touched. It would have been better if they had included information prior to the end credits. It would have helped if they had shown actual photos or video from the actual rescue, maybe include real survivors ... and on and on. Another frustration was the difficulty understanding the limited amount of dialogue, due to the never ending loud music. At the beginning I was wishing for subtitles. Then I realized that whatever they were saying was inconsequential. If this movie had been silent, I'd have left feeling the same way. This is a shallow, visually entertaining snippet of what could have been a good movie. Whereas with Quenton Tarantino, you wish his films were edited to remove an hour from them, with this movie it's just the opposite. You wish the director had told the story of Dunkirk rather than show a few action scenes of what it might have been like to have been there.
1.0~You will be very sorry you went to see this. You've been warned. contactcaptamerica Sign in Permalink Two hours I'll never get back. Simply the worst film I can remember. The IMAX experience couldn't even save this stinker. I'm not entirely sure what I just watched. This film did a terrible job in its plot delivery. There was no character development at all. Nolan tried desperately and gambled in taking an eclectic approach to a war movie which ends up leaving the audience in a state of mass confusion. I hated it. I couldn't wait until the credits rolled so I could officially depart from the dumpster fire that this movie was. If you are expecting your typical heroes and villains war movie with cool battles and testosterone laden machismo, this is far from it. Dunkirk is a 2 hour expose of the mundane depressive state of war as if you were in it. Few action scenes. Little dialogue. Scattered confusing plot. Not sure how Nolan pitched the idea of having a de facto silent film World War II movie with no action or emotionally driven sub plot. You will be very sorry you went to see this. You've been warned.
4.0~A Mish-mash of a film, disappointing jpdhadfield Sign in Permalink This film was filmed amazingly, but that's where my praise end. SPOILER ALERT> From the first scene it showed no character depth whatsoever, we had no idea who they were, nothing, they all get killed,by running down an open street, one gets away, our so called main character,he forgets his comrades instantly and moves on, the whole film is like this. None of the soldiers smoked, not one, nobody swore, no banter nothing, they were like robots. The highlights, the spitfire pilots the small boat crew, they saved the film for me. On that day 300,000 troops were on the beach, where were they, a few hundred didn't give the right atmosphere, they could have used CGI i wouldn't have minded,it didn't feel epic, and it is an epic story many of the other review on here, seem to either be written by people involved in the making of the film or just people writing about the actual Dunkirk story. but this website is for film reviews, not history reviews. If you didn't know the story, and went to see this film, you would be non the wiser at the end. So now there will be thousands of teenagers with a very strange view of Dunkirk and the British military. I'd like to know where were the sergeants barking orders, corporals where were they, no just sullen silent privates, It was filmed very well, especially the spitfire dog fights , and tom hardy was great as usual, as were the other pilots, If you want to see a good film about Dunkirk ,watch the 1950's film,
5.0~extremely boring. Felt asleep. palawan19 Sign in Permalink I don't understand the good reviews. Expected mutch, was very boring.
4.0~Not the best war movie ritika_jajodia Sign in Permalink Honestly I refrain from writing bad reviews about a film because I know how much effort goes into making one but this was so disappointing specially coming from Nolan. The film script seemed biased and more of paid publicity for British army. It doesn't make you feel anything in fact it was really hard to concentrate, after every 10 minutes I was literally waiting for something wow to come up which obviously didn't happened. It nowhere shows a genius escape or struggles of a war, just some men swaying from one place to another.The actors lacked intensity, no characters were established it seemed like the writer didn't have any focus or vision for the film. The only thing we can appreciate is the technicality of cinema specially aerial cinematography other than that the story or the presentation doesn't touch any chords. Not the best war movie. Much hyped.
1.0~Drowning, drowning, cliche, drowning, cliche, cliche... TheSuccessorOfTheReaper Sign in Permalink It's been long time that I haven't felt that I should write a review here, but this movie triggered me so hard that I was speechless from the very beginning. Let me tell you what you are going to get. Drowning people, some cliche drama, drowning, drowning, cliche, drowning, cliche, cliche and the end. At the end, I was looking for a movie and of course the time I wasted on it. I was very patient to see any improvement but it was getting worse and worse after every minute. The movie is sinking as much as the characters he plotted. I haven't watched such a pointless and terrible war movie in my life span so far. Looks like he couldnt find a book to rip off the story, pardon me, inspired! So that is why I am beggin you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! You might ask if rating 1 star is fair, I would say of course not. That would be a solid 5 if other reviewers(Nolan fangirls) were honest with their ratings.
5.0~Technically impressive, but what a soulless film. A thin story and dull character starcrusader Sign in Permalink The film is beautifully made, and I award much kudos to the DoP for the work here. Sadly the photography islet down by a dull survival story of an uninteresting character, padded out with two minor points of view to flesh out the film. The entire episode feels small and insignificant, and of no importance. The characters were interchangeable, and I had no interest in who loved or died. With a half decent script and some actual music this could have been a historical piece of the ages. Instead it is just an attempt by Nolan to look serious, when in fact him film is slow, plodding and thin. The film and its many fans remind me of the vapid nonsense known as Gravity. A film with nothing more than visuals to recommend it. Very disappointing.
7.0~With a lack of character development Nolan manages to make the cinematography the star secretzfan Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a great filmmaker that is undoubtable to me. He had accomplished many amazing feats and this film is no different than those. However what his past films did have that this one lacks is a really care for the characters involved and what was going on in it. This film is lacking in that aspect and instead the camera angles and the overall feel of the film is what makes you care more than the characters themselves do. I came out this film feeling a intense claustrophobic feeling throughout. There are many small areas that characters are in and the action feels so intense and it does this without any blood or gore. Instead it is all about the camera movement that makes you want to puke,tense up, and get scared for sheer life. Nolan uses the characters to put you inside the action and make you feel like you are there even if your not. It is a amazing work of art and powerful as well. Dunkirk truly succeeds in every way of what it tries to accomplish.
1.0~Should be renamed Dumb Crock doogal-68850 Sign in Permalink I love Christopher Nolan's films. So unusual and most have great depth. He is terrific at using a creative imagination. I feel he should not have come within coo-ee of a true War story. It is not his genre. I am stunned - although I guess I should not be - at the high ratings from so-called experts. Were they facing the screen when this was on. Why do Americans have to spell everything out for us? A plane makes a massive thud into the ocean as it is shot down and one of the men says "It's down". Thanks for letting us know. Then you see 30 men swimming towards a boat and I think the same guy says "There are man in the water". Really? I thought they were dolphins. Do we really need Cellos and Horns to try and build tension. I do understand the war was tense. We don't need bloody Cellos to inform us. I missed most of the dialogue. I felt sorry for the Cello players. They are probably in hospital right now with some repetitive injury. The actors looked so disengaged. The older dude in the small boat got emotional once and it looked weird. Kenneth Brannagh looked like he was on Prozac. He probably teared up towards the end because it was possibly the worst movie ever made. Tom Hardy wore a mask through the whole movie until the last minute. One of the finest British actors and you cannot see his expression nor hear him over stupid Cellos. There was flitting between time lines without explanation. Cillian Murphy suddenly appears on a boat refusing to let some men on. Like huh? A boy gets killed for no reason and nobody really cares. The son of the captain starts to care and then he suddenly stops caring for some reason. There is mention of 300,000 men on the beach. Were they in crab-holes? Lastly with all the budget on this movie why do war scenes in other movies make these look dull?
2.0~A wasted opportunity Beakyboy Sign in Permalink We had been waiting with anticipation to see this film. It had received mixed reviews but we kept open minds. I'm afraid the bad reviews are correct, the film is wasted opportunities. There is a far better Dunkirk made in 1958 starring John Mills and Richard Attenborough which stands head and shoulders above this latest attempt. Or the BBC 2004 TV film starring Timothy Dalton and Benjamin Cumberbatch which explains how the rescue was planned and implemented. Both had more realism and drama and made you understand the incredible feat that Dunkirk was. The Dunkirk story is as much about the little ships but little was made of these, they just started across the channel with much of the film taken up by one of them. There should have been nearly 2000 vessels of all sizes involved in the rescue but all we saw were a handful at best. Similarly the RAF flew nearly 5000 missions over Dunkirk, not the three or four planes shown. The weather in 1940 was also inclement over France for nearly a week which prevented the Luftwaffe from taking off. The film shows a beautiful blue sky. On the French beaches, there wasn't enough actors or CGI to make it look like hundreds of thousands of men waiting for rescue, more like a couple of hundred at best. The French soldiers were indicated by half a dozen actors and there was no Indian or other Colonial troops represented, just queues of caucasians. Meanwhile Branagh stands woodenly, gurning at something for most of the film. Rylance might as well have been the BFG as there was no difference in his acting. The worst part was Tom Hardy as a Spitfire pilot (probably more accurate to have given him a Hurricane which out numbered Spitfires and were tasked with attacking bombers). The end of his role was just unbelievably silly. As was scenes of downed aircraft floating as if they were made of wood and polystyrene. I would like to see a Peter Jackson version of Dunkirk. Nolan's 2017 attempt is a weak script and weak directing, both of which are his responsibility.
1.0~Dull, slow and unbearably boring. maxipayne Sign in Permalink I just watched this movie and I feel like I had just seen the most boring movie ever . This movie was bad, truly bad. I do not know where they get all these good ratings . Horrible depiction of a true piece of history. No characters, no dialogue, hardly understandable English and surprisingly just mediocre cinematography. Remember the part when the soldier walked in the sea presumably committing suicide by drowning? How can someone auto-drown? Why would someone commit suicidal in such way? He had guns, use them and go painlessly. There is no such death as a voluntary drowning! It's the most painful way to go. That and burned by fire. Would someone just walk into the flames? You seen that? Ever? No no no! It's ridiculous. And if you think you can compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan.. You're wrong so wrong. Nolan is not Spielberg not even in his dreams. Save your money and save your precious time don't give them to Nolan. Please trust me on this.
1.0~Best start to a Nolan Movie EVER!!! jamie-moroney Sign in Permalink As a follower of Christopher Nolan, like many others, I was extremely excited about this Movie. The first 1 to 2 minutes did not disappoint. With the tense music and quick pace in taking the movie to Dunkirk beach I knew I was in for a real treat. After around 2 minutes I was confused and trying not to lose focus. About half way through I thought I had missed bits. By the end I knew I didn't get the treat I expected and like most reviewers I cannot understand how it got rated so highly. For me, definitely Nolan's worse film by a long way.
1.0~Worst film reviewed by awful critics sorello Sign in Permalink Having watched most of this historic film, I have come to the conclusion that not only was it a disastrous attempt by an incompetent director, but that Hollywood and the mainstream media critics, are equally inept at their job. It's a shame IMDb has fallen into this category, as I have used the website as a useful guide to which films I should watch or avoid. Several strange behavioural anomalies occurred inside the first 10 minutes, which gave a clue to the complete amateurish script and direction by Anthony Nolan, related to the Nolan sisters perhaps. 1. The nasty, evil, German interrogator SNIFFS the cocktail of drugs on the syringe he is about to inject into the hapless captive. 2. When punched repeatedly in the face, the captive does not move his hands in front of his face defensively as one should, even though he is not tied up. 3. Everyone talks one at a time, like a badly written script by Mr.Nolan. 4. When they find the French female spy, they debate whether to hand her over the the Nazis, because the evil, smirking, sadistic, method-actor German officer offered them passage if they handed her over. Both British and Germans were fully armed. They debate one at a time as per Nolan's pathetic style of writing. 5. When the Nazi soldiers open fire on the building, they are standing in a line in the open, shooting planks. No troops would have lasted very long standing in the open firing at other armed soldiers who were under cover, like a badly-made western. Everyone in the film behaves unnaturally, to when the British officer rebukes a soldier, to the soldier stupid reaction to stand to attention without being told. I was so much hoping for a good rendition of such an important chapter in the second World War, being British myself, and because 90% of the critics say so, it will go down as such, but the same "analysts" loved La, La Land, a place they strictly belong. Dunkirk is a turkey of the worst with dozens of badly written scenes too many to mention, the only surprise is the almost universal acclaim it received from people paid to review movies. It shows what a terrible state the film industry is in, and Hollywood's deference to shoddy workmanship on a grand scale!
1.0~I wanted to like it. NYCostumer Sign in Permalink Given the compelling subject matter it is amazing that Nolan failed to make a decent film. I saw an interview with one of the Producers who claimed it to be "an art house film in the form of a major motion picture." Sorry, but many art house pictures are far more interesting. If you're not going to have a decent script then why did you miss so many opportunities to use visuals to tell your story? Not worth the time it takes to watch it.
10.0~An exquisite film. Sleepin_Dragon Sign in Permalink Awards will follow. How often can any of us say that a film lives with us for days, I've not been able to add that tag to anything I've seen in years. Within the first few moments of this film I knew this was going to be such a film. Most of us will know the incredible Dunkirk story, the fear many would have had I think would have been that the story was sensationalised, or lacking the real essence. All you can say is Christopher Nolan has once again shown his genius, this film is a masterpiece. You have no choice but to feel raw emotion as you watch, feelings of despair, hope, anger, fear, terror, you will feel exhausted having watched this film. The acting is impeccable, every single member of the cast performs to an incredible standard (maybe Harry Styles's character will irritate one or two,) Mark Rylance is utterly sensational, as is Kenneth Branagh, the scene where his character looks up and sees the fishing boats arrive is one of the most moving in the film The camera-work is astonishing, as is the music, which for me was one of the most powerful elements of the film, it built tension to enormous degrees. There is a realism in this film which I find quite incredible, at times it's so difficult to watch, it brought elements to life I hadn't even thought of. I can see this being used in history lessons of the future. The only real question is how many awards will this win. See this film, it's utterly incredible.
9.0~Why hasn't anyone else made a movie like this? tye1138 Sign in Permalink There has never been anything like this made in the history of cinema. War movies can't really depict war because they always feel obligated to tell stories. Nolan threw the whole story thing out the window. It's literally one big action scene that lasts 1 hour and 40 some odd minutes. It's a brilliant idea because it really gives you the essence of war; it's relentless and it simply doesn't stop. Even the great war films like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Patton', have quiet moments in between the battles, but not Dunkirk. Quiet is a brief dialog scene where the actors try to figure out how the F to survive the next 10 seconds. Then the filmmakers tear down all the walls and watch as the characters try to survive the next few moments. To say it's intense is an understatement, your eyes are pegged to the screen, your senses are on high alert. You are in the spitfire as it attacks the German plane. You're in the ship as it's torpedoed and floods in real time. You're on the beach as it's bombed and peoples bodies fly into the sky. It's the best 3rd act to a war movie that I've ever seen, only... there aren't a 1st and 2nd act. So this is where I was SLIGHTLY disappointed. The movie focuses on the "action" and doesn't let the audience soak it in. It also doesn't give you any emotional attachment to the characters or even the situation, you never "feel" for anyone. Thus, it left me not really caring what I saw on screen. Like a video game, it just fed me constant stimulus until it was over, but I felt there could have been some moments to draw the audience into the people, rather then JUST the event as a whole. Even though some people didn't like Interstellar, (Nolan's last movie) I loved it because I could relate to the characters and there was an emotional thread I could cling onto. Even ten minutes of character development spread throughout the movie, would have been really good, but as I sit here writing this, having just seen it, I feel a lack of emotion that was very much present after watching Interstellar. With that said, what I saw was pretty damn awesome and technically it was so well made, I feel like the bar has been risen 3 levels. This maybe the last "great" war film ever made. We may never see anything like this again because NOBODY will spend the time and effort it takes to get it all in camera, the right way. It worked so well in 70mm, it looked fantastic, it sounded awesome. The music was spot on and honestly slightly unmemorable because the movie moved so fast, it was hard to focus on any single thing. I was very much impressed with everything I saw and frankly, I think everyone should stop what they're doing and see Dunkirk in 70mm IMAX if they can find a theater near them. It's an experience that may never come around again and once it's gone from the theaters, your chance is over. Like so many great movies, this is one to be seen in the theater, the small screen will never do it justice. Score grade: A Score percentage 95%
1.0~Oppressively annoying constant suspense music, unrealistic acting, storyless. xaxazak Sign in Permalink Music designed to add suspense is usually only played during a suspenseful scene. Here, almost the entire movie has repetitive suspense sounds (music?) in the background regardless of what's actually happening. There's also an unreal feeling about it. Large groups of people that would be talking (or yelling) and doing stuff in reality are somehow often silent and immobile. A lot of the communication is calm tones even though it's a war - urgent, hugely scary, life-threatening. There isn't much story - although I'm not sure if that was the intent. Instead it just jumps between a handful of totally separate characters pretty much randomly, and it jumps way too frequently for any sense of continuity. And then there's quite a few inconsistencies. Can't list here without declaring this a spoiler, though. The aesthetics / atmosphere does seem suitable for what's going on, though. Unless you're into weirdly produced arty movies that are all atmosphere, this shouldn't really appeal.
8.0~POWERFUL KeremUlucay Sign in Permalink No doubt, Dunkirk is Nolan's best cinematographic movie of all time. Colour palette and harmony are just amazing. IMAX shots assert it selves. Especially plane scenes are admirable. Also, movie looks so real. Great decor, real places, real bombs,planes, ships... Such a wonderful production. Musics are so intense and fit with visuality. Hans Zimmer of course! On the other hand, story is a bit complicated. Sometimes it feels so empty but sometimes it feels so intense too. I cannot say so much about characters and actors because Dunkirk goes a really different way about these and it doesn't even try to show us backgrounds of characters. Honestly I was waiting a little different things from Nolan on it. Even so, it is a great -real story- war and historical film.
2.0~How is it an 8 @ IMDB? pawel-meus Sign in Permalink Honestly. I had high hopes & expectations for this movie (which, I agree, might bias my rating) but it turned out to be bleach and boring. The plane part? Whoever thought watching a spitfire chase a bomber for half a movie will be a captivating experience was wrong (IMO). The beach part? Empty sand and lines of soliders, no military equipment on the beach (Allies left around 85.000 vehicles and 450 tanks behind while evacutaing, 100+ planes were destroyed), no action. Everyone just waits in line and then disembarks within 30 seconds since the civil vessels arrive. The boat part? Why this boy was killed?! To show how mature the other young lad is (especially when he says to the pilot that the boy will be fine)? To show what shock can do to a man (pilot)? It's unrealistic and fake to me. And then, after they finally reach Dunkirk, they take some soliders on-board and dip out as soon as the oil on the water starts to burn. You can even see that the boat is half full, there are still people in water (not in the fire!) and they just dip! And when soldiers finally come back home, expecting hate from the people for "disappoiting" them, it all ends well with a bottle of beer handed to a soldier on one of the train stations and one of them reads a famous Winton's speach. Of course he did. It's cringy sometimes, it is soul-less and brings nothing - even fails to show the terror that those soldiers most likely felt. Constant bombings, buring oil bringing the black clouds of smoke over the beaches, scale of operation (200 out of 800 ship vessels taking part in Dynamo operation was destroyed), chaos on the beach which required to abandon everything in order to survive.
1.0~Ruined by its soundtrack. CBallmail Sign in Permalink What a disappointment! The worst part was the tooth rattling and incessant background bass beat that seemed only loosely related to the equally deafening and incessant score. More intrusive even then the ridiculous soundtrack in Gravity during the destruction of the space station in airless space, the beat and the score in Dunkirk drowned out what limited dialogue and atmosphere was present in every scene of the movie, even trespassing a bit on the hammy and over-extended scenes with Kenneth Branagh (no real loss there, I guess). When you can't hear the Merlin engine of a Spitfire from the cockpit, then you know there's a problem. Speaking of which, what can you say about Spitfire whose fuel and ammunition lasted forever, and whose terminal glide seemed even longer than that, and yet somehow apparently ended in the timely destruction of a Stuka mid-dive bombing? I cannot fathom the positive reviews this film received. It wasn't even that impressive as a spectacle. Where were the masses of abandoned equipment and materiel? Some stacked crates right at the start, and a single anti-aircraft gun? The opening scenes on the beach of Saving Private Ryan left an impression 100 times stronger than this entire film.
5.0~Nolan over his head. Lost between Saving Private Ryan and Memento filmnmovie Sign in Permalink The movie has so much potential in the first 10 minutes but then it falls apart. While Nolan is trying to decide if the movie wants to be Saving Private Ryan or another Memento, he forgets to build any characters or narrative that anyone can care about. What a shame given the cast he had at his hand. He was just unable to direct them or bring together anything redeeming or with any level of depth. Aside from the first 10 minutes, there are some beautiful cinematography. However, the scenes are shot on different days. One sunny and the other overcast. So the beautiful visuals are unable to sustain any type of mood across the length of the movie. At the end, it's clear the story was too ambitious for Nolan and he was just unable to put it together.
7.0~A good film - but a few scenes missing for a classic banknik Sign in Permalink What Nolan has done with Dunkirk is create an outstanding piece of cinematography, with an interesting concept that works well (the three balanced time-lines taking place at a different pace, a week, a day and an hour). However, there are just a few things missing that prevent this from being a masterpiece. The first is a simple graphical introduction with maps. I know the assumption is that most people know about Dunkirk (and being a British history teacher, obviously I know the story too), however for global audiences, there simply isn't the knowledge there to understand what is going on. For example, what year is this? What has happened in the war already (the invasion of Poland)? Why is the situation so desperate (because Germany has surrounded the allied forces and overrun the French defenses by going through the Ardennes forest in Belgium)? The USA has not yet entered the war (for American audiences), and nether have the Soviets. The French are about to surrender to Germany, leaving Britian alone to face the Germans. Dunkirks location in relation to England. All of this could have been explained with a short graphical introduction (like in enemy at the gates) of less than 2 minutes long. It wasn't, and therefore it simply looks like the British are running away without any explanation. The second thing that is missing is the desperation of Dunkirk. By all accounts, the evacuation was generally pretty orderly. However, after the initial introductory scene, there is none of this on the beach in the second half of the film. When things should be getting more desperate (and there were many thousands of British soldiers who got left behind) during the second half, it seems like the Germans stop attacking the beach (except for one lone aircraft that gets shot down by Tom Hardy). This isn't true, and in the end Hitler does order his troops to move in when the air-force fails. Not to mention, the fact that many of the small boats get sunk too - it was an evacuation under fire, this is missing from the end of the movie when the boats turn up. It gives the impression that the evacuation was somehow fine once the boats turned up and does a disservice to the heroes on those boats and the whole first half of the movie (set on the mole - ignoring the parts at sea). This could have all been improved with a bit more artillery and plane attacks at the end of the movie. The final scene which could have been included was Murphey's story - just a few scenes of his own evacuation from the beach - during the second third of the movie (increasing the fact that the mole was a week - whereas at the moment it seems it is two days, not a week), and then how he ended up being the sole survivor on his ship to be rescued - explaining why he is suffering PTSD would justify his earlier attack on the young boy. This would increase the length of the movie to about 2 hours and a bit - which is how long this movie should be. At the moment it is simply too short, and that prevents it being a masterpiece. Shame, because apart from that Nolan did a great job.
6.0~The British soldiers who fought their way out of France deserve a better movie than this one -- Not Recommended costellorp Sign in Permalink Twenty excellent movies could have been made about Dunkirk in WWII. This movie, however, is not excellent; it's not even very good. Two major reasons why: (1) For the important roles of British soldiers, men who in reality fought their way out of France, sacrificing many in combat and enduring tremendous privation, injury, terror, and hardship, the director chose to focus on soldiers who think only of their own survival--certainly there were some men like that in WWII, but it is simply a waste of wonderful and compelling raw material to produce this movie out of all the possible scenarios the director could have chosen. (2) This movie skimped terribly on sets. It was embarrassing to watch a few hundred men on the beach, one or two Royal Navy ships in the water, two British planes in the air, and a handful of civilian boats. This movie does not give an accurate picture of the beaches or the mole. This movie simply does not do justice to the hell on earth that was Dunkirk. I have to wonder why they bothered. I had looked forward to this movie and was very disappointed.
1.0~I also love Nolan, but I refuse to let that be a factor in my decision alexander_sca Sign in Permalink The movie started like a good movie could've started. Very slow paced and didn't really give much. I really like beginnings like that though as it adds tension and mystique. But throughout the second half of the movie I thought I was seriously being pranked. I could only come to the conclusion that the cinema, the director or God (I'm an atheist) was pointing a camera at me and filming my facial reactions as the movie progressed to later laugh at it. When you watch a movie made from Christopher Nolan, that has a stellar reputation of directing top 250 IMDb movies, you expect nothing less from Dunkirk. Instead Nolan took a 180 turn from what he has previously done, what he in my opinion is best at, and made this emotionless, insanely expensive and straight out lame movie, that I just was begging to end. But the real and only reason I am writing this (went on to recover my password to write my first and only review) is because of all you guys calling this a "masterpiece". I just can't understand how this is happening again. First it was Gravity, and now Dunkirk. It's like you fail to grasp the concept of a movie which, yes, is a great plus if made realistic, but it must contain some kind of PLOT. This movie had nothing remotely close to a plot, much less a twist, which naturally makes the movie dull, empty and simply not a movie but a documentary at best. I'm guessing the next over-hyped movie will be filming a guy for a week doing absolutely nothing special, that barely talks and then let's also pointlessly mix up the time-line to make it extra confusing so you call it a masterpiece because it represents reality? It's tiring guys. Firstly because you made me waste money, and also because you simply cannot move your a**es to look out the window if you now crave reality in it's purest form so much. 1/10 because of the hype 4/10 movie (for the effort and time it must have taken and because Nolan somehow managed to get this out into the public) Jeez.
9.0~The Race Against Time my-name-is-ns Sign in Permalink What can be better than returning Home? Nothing..I suppose! Hans Zimmer probably delivered the most riveting and immersive sound experience of his career which essentially keeps the urgency of the matter Alive and Kicking until the closing second. Nolan retorts to his unusual story telling delicately knitting the different horizons between Land, Water and Air which unfolds at their own pace eventually culminating at the goal. DUNKIRK has it's script limited to the secluded evacuation of Allied forces from the clutches of a dreadful and merciless German army. It's the sheer brilliance of a terrific screenplay and direction combined with a captivating background score which testifies the horrific sequences which the Allied forces would have battled through the intermittent Nazi strikes. The other beauty of the movie lies in the nano aspects taken care of throughout the 107 minutes of visual excellence resulting from a genius Cinematography. One such would be the sequence involving Spitfire pilot Collins to escape his defunct jet somewhere in the English Channel while the water gushes in leaving a dead drop silence throughout the theater. Farrier and Mr Dawson get their share of heroism to display which was essentially a race against time as the enemy was round the corner. DUNKIRK is probably, in fact, the best IMAX movie which you can enjoy in a 2D atmosphere till date. A movie which essentially demonstrates the emphatic usage of time and resources to represent the cause vividly. A war has it's own emotions associated, returning home is altogether special! Kudos DUNKIRK team, both the real and the reel! 8.5/10
2.0~Hype train that hits the buffers timdinchhammonds Sign in Permalink It's hard to imagine where the $100million budgeted for this film was actually spent. Perhaps on the stellar cast, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy to name a few. All superb actors but in this, are completely muted and devoid of impact. I couldn't tell one floppy haired actor from another. To be fair, it wasn't their fault as the script was basically a lazy copy and paste from everything that has come before, just that it was the abridged version. Whilst the scenes aboard ships were tightly packed with personnel, when the camera panned , the beaches were clear from horizon to horizon, interspersed with some burning oil drums to give the timid illusion of a war zone rather than Margate in November. Though some subscribe to the idea that less is more, in this instance, less is less. Compared to the BBC's 2004 three part series Dunkirk, this fails in every quarter. Like wine, sometimes it's crap even if you paid £80 for the bottle, despite how much you want it to be good.
7.0~Disjointed Movie: robertguttman Sign in Permalink The story of Dunkirk is one of the most dramatic episodes of WW-II. However, as presented here it is disjointed, difficult to follow. Worse still, there are too few individual characters that the viewer gets to know well enough to care about very much. The movie is presented in such a disjointed manner that the viewer is completely disoriented as to time and place. One scene is at night, the next is in broad, sunny daylight. In one scene the sea is calm, and in the next the wind is blowing a force 7 gale. Worse still, apparently the same scenes are presented over and over again from different perspectives. I'm sure I will be told that this was done deliberately, and that I simply do not understand the new style of filming. One of the most annoying aspects was the inaccuracy of some of the things that went on. For example, the filmmakers laid a great deal of stress on one scene in which a fighter ditches in the sea, and the struggle the pilot goes through to get out through the canopy, which is stuck closed. I only mention this sequence because it is one which the filmmakers deliberately chose to dramatize by showing it over and over again, in great detail. The point is that one would think that it would have been part of basic RAF pilot training to open the canopy BEFORE ditching in the sea. That is the sort of thing one would think that an RAF pilot would have been trained to do, and would do instinctively. In other words, there is more than enough real drama in the story of Dunkirk without coming up with phony material such as that. Incidentally, this business of showing the same scene over and over again may be the "new way" in filming, but all it indicated to me was that the director was padding his movie. In other words, it seems to me that the movie could have been half, or even a third as long, and still told the same story without leaving anything out. In fact, while watching Dunkirk I could not help thinking of Noel Coward's film, "In Which We Serve", part of which also recounted the story of Dunkirk. Somehow Noel Coward managed to say everything that needed to be said about Dunkirk - and he did it in about seven minutes.
10.0~excellent jsharma Sign in Permalink The movie directed by Christopher Nolan and produced by his wife Emma Thomas is extremely well directed. Dunkirk is all about WW2 between may and June , 1940. Excellent Cinematography. Thousands and thousands of soldiers on land, boat at sea and airplanes in air are fascinating to watch. It is amazing how camera-work was perfect . All actors did their part well. All the land events details took place in a week , the ones at sea in a day and all aircraft details in an hour. The scene where aircraft lands on water and is on fire is exquisite. Definite Oscar worthy for Cinematography. Very appropriate dialog and script is fit for soldiers, Navy, AirForce. Superb. Great direction. Good editing. excellent music. 1hr 46 minutes on big screen . Perfect.
3.0~Oh no :( darkjedi-56080 Sign in Permalink Let me say I really wanted to like this film. I avoided seeing the previews or any reviews so I could go in unbiased which is how I like to see all of my movies. I don't like to rubbish the hard work that people put into their films because I enjoy really well made films. But in short I really wish someone told me to avoid this one. I'm not one to follow the flow and praise something that is clearly so very bad. The bad: The music\noise\soundtrack...whatever you want to call it was terrible. Just random esculations of horned instruments that build up and up and up to nothing. It was way too distracting and completely failed to build the suspense. I found myself looking around the cinema at the speakers wondering when the projectionist was going to realise he had accidentally turned the sound up too loud for the movie. There is zero character analysis. Everyone looks the same and you cant distinguish anyone from anyone else throughout the film. It doesn't matter anyway because you don't have any reason to care about anyone in particular because there is no back story of anyone. The plot is flat dry and boring. Don't get me wrong it was based on an important event in history but this film does this no justice at all. My biggest gripe is the lack of dialogue throughout the film. Was Nolan trying something new here? Probably but please don't do it again. There are shots of what are meant to be hundreds of thousands of soldiers all standing in lines on the beach all deathly quiet staring out to the ocean in most scenes. Even the terribly injured lying on stretchers are mutes. So many scenes don't add any value and don't make any sense. The stupidity of trying to force a single 60kg soldier off a sinking ship to reduce the overall weight of a boat stuck on the sand? I mean really...who writes this stuff. The boat is taking on hundreds of litres of water and you want us to believe that one person will magically raise the boat off the beach? It's a head shaking moment that just makes no sense at all. The whole thing is a b grade made for TV matinée crossed with the overly long 50 yard stares reminisce of a bad episode of the days our lives. The Dad in the boat couldn't care less that his son dies. He almost seems content. The plane scenes are slow and boring. They show little tactics and make us believe the entire German airforce was fought off by 3 spitfires. And don't get me started on the spitfire that somehow manages to linger in the air long after its engine has stopped for what seems like an eternity. Some say that Spitfire is still flying around without any fuel to this day. As my mate said, he didn't have to land on the beach, he could have flown all the way back to London. I heard the budget was 150 million. That's got to be a joke. There is just no way. Either that or the majority of the scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. You certainly didn't have to pay your actors for speaking roles. It's such a shame. This movie has so little going for it. Maybe the editor was coming down off a week long coke bender when he put this together because I have no doubt I could have done better with the raw footage and a PC version of Adode Premier. Wait for DVD release and a night when you are not really into watching a movie to pop this one in. You wont miss the atmosphere of a cinema for this movie because there is none to talk of. I apologise for being so harsh but I would prefer an apology from the director for killing my expectations. 3/10 is very generous indeed.
10.0~One of the most complete, well-crafted films ever created. ljrobertson-90784 Sign in Permalink There was not a second of this film that seemed unnecessary or out of place. I have no idea how Christopher Nolan has managed to create such a seamless film, but in my eyes "Dunkirk" is cinematic perfection. In watching "Dunkirk", you experience the hopelessness of being one of the hundreds of thousands of British soldiers trapped on the wrong side of the Channel. The cinematography is the best of any Nolan film; the colours are vivid yet muted, and the shots are packed with emotion. This is a phrase tossed around often, but Nolan does a superb job of humanizing war; "Dunkirk" is filled with unimaginable acts of heroism, yet there is not a moment that feels detached from reality. In perhaps his greatest triumph, the horror of the Second World War is meaningfully illustrated without the crutches of gore and excessive brutality. Just see this film. I believe every human alive should.
10.0~A masterpiece of our generation. karanrajbaruah Sign in Permalink War is not something we should celebrate. It brings out the worst in humans. Dunkirk shows us a small part of war where humans were pushed to the absolute maximum and it was something which changed people for the rest of their lives. When watching a war movie, most of us have a "expectation" of how a movie should be. We expect lots of shooting, lots of man to man combat and lots of gore. But with Dunkirk this is different. This movie is such a masterpiece in a way it tells the story of war very differently. It looks to tell the feelings of a person less by dialogues and more by pure emotion. The way the movie is set up, there is nothing but pure tension all throughout the 100 or so minutes of its play time. Also, a special kudos for the brilliant score for this movie. I'd go as far as saying that 50% of the movie was really carried by the score. Some of the scores that start slow and rise slowly to its full tempo and volume really add to the whole mood of the film. This is arguably one of the best scores Hans Zimmer has done till date. Not only the score, but the sound of Spitfires and explosions at various points of the film feel different than most movies of the past. The muffled sounds of explosion in different scenes really hit hard. This movie is really best enjoyed on the big screen. It just wouldn't be the same on the small screen and wouldn't be as immersive.
1.0~The Most Boring War Film Of All Time adrian-m-miller Sign in Permalink Just really want the time i spent watching this dull, no character depth, waste back. The story skips so frequently, amongst beach/air/sea, and amongst many fragmented characters (none of whom you will care about) that its torturous. Its like its challenging you to make it all the way through..... Not even the odd random appearance of Kenneth Branagh looking wistfully on as ships get sunk, or peering through his eyeglasses towards the end will make me give this higher than a single star Truly the most terrible film I've seen in some time, and easily the worst war film ever made. The genre should have stopped at Saving Private Ryan Truly, truly fricking awful
1.0~Its official. Movies are no longer about telling a story. jaymcr Sign in Permalink I am sure that the critics that write the reviews are paid shills because anyone who considers that movie to be a masterpiece has either never seen a war movie or is just taking money to lie to the public. Dunkirk was more spectacular than 7 or so boats, 3 planes and less than 300 men in a line on a beach. And whose idea was it to pay Tom Hardy a ridiculous sum of the budget to once again hide his face and never actually do what he is paid to do which last I checked was acting? It's obvious he was used in this movie to give it some credibility just like they did with the Mad Max debacle where he spent 3 quarters of the movie with a face covering on preventing him from speaking. The noise was awful and apparently some of that noise was considered to be music! Dull bass throbbing in every scene. Story? Lets not even go there. I can sum up the Story in one paragraph although you cannot really consider it a spoiler because there's nothing in this to spoil. "Trapped on a beach awaiting rescue but the ships keep getting destroyed by dive bombers with only 3 planes to protect those ships. Ends with Hardy finally revealing his face when he is captured after landing his plane which has run out of fuel." That's it. Everything else in between is just noise. To the people who consider themselves to be critics I say this: If you want the movie industry to become like the gaming industry where the main goal is most profit in shortest time regardless of the content then keep spouting the BS otherwise you need to start telling the truth for once. Two hours of noise and it cost them $100 million to make? It's obvious where that money went because these so called movie creators couldn't even be bothered to use CGI to expand the number of men, ships and planes to really set the scene. There was nothing in this movie and Tom Hardy was thick or corrupt enough to be used as the marketing tool. Don't waste your money.
1.0~Nope support-43713 Sign in Permalink Too loud, too disjointed, too much Kenneth Branagh staring meaningfully into the distance. There seemed to be many scenes that would not be reasonable, starting with two soldiers encountering each other in an isolated location: they would not silently go about their business without confirming each other's identity. I thought I saw a spitfire that had run out of fuel first fly right-to-left, then left-to-right to land on a beach in front of the Germans, descending in daylight and landing in darkness. There was so much confusion as to what was being shown, and such loud "music" that it was difficult to follow the story. The critics seem to love this movie. I don't know why.
5.0~Far from decent even.. thedutchman-05617 Sign in Permalink Let me think,was there anything exciting about this movie? Oh yeah,the music till the point where it became annoying,that about sums it up! If you manage to make a massive evacuation look like a walk in the park,you completely overshot your goal,bad directing in my opinion,i waited the whole movie for a moment that would grab me by the chest,there were none..
8.0~"Dunkirk" is an innovative, well-crafted, engrossing and enjoyable film. dave-mcclain Sign in Permalink The World War II battle and evacuation portrayed in director Christopher Nolan's "Dunkirk" (PG-13, 1:46) involved no American troops, but had a big impact on the U.S. role – a full year and a half before it (officially) joined the fight. As the Nazi blitzkrieg swept through France, Belgium and the Netherlands in May of 1940, the armies of those countries, and their ally Great Britain, were pushed westward until they were trapped in the area around Dunkirk, France (near the Belgian border), with nowhere to go but into the English Channel. Nearly 400,000 of them. Nolan's trademark creativity led him to write and direct this film as a triptych, telling three related stories which took different periods of time to unfold, but showing them running concurrently throughout the film. A slate on the screen introduces each narrative (and the amount of time that it represents) from the first shot of each: "1. The Mole | One Week" (a mole being a pier-like, but solid breakwater built out from the beach); "2. The Sea | One Day"; "3. The Air | One Hour". Once each of those printed designations fades from the screen, the movie moves back and forth between stories. On the beach, close to 400,000 men awaited their fate, whether it be rescue or annihilation. The German Army (which is barely shown and referred to only as "the enemy") has the British, French, Belgian and Dutch troops surrounded on three sides, with the channel blocking their escape on the fourth. The Germans seem content, at least for the moment, to keep the troops bottled up on the beach and pick them off from the air with strafing missions and bomb the ships and boats attempting rescue. Among those struggling to survive on the beach are Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a British soldier who barely escapes unseen German rifles to make it to the mole, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), a mysterious soldier with whom Tommy teams up and Alex (Harry Styles), another soldier whom they end up saving from a sinking ship and with whom they explore various opportunities to save themselves. When one of their plans goes awry, they end up overhearing a conversation in which a British naval commander (a composite character played by Kenneth Branagh) discusses with other officers how dire the situation is. On the sea, the British ships aren't up to the task of a rescue operation under these conditions. The Admiralty is unwilling to send over more than one large ship at a time for fear of losing ships that may be desperately needed for a last-ditch defense of the British Isles against an expected German invasion. Many of the smaller ships and boats that do arrive to assist with the rescue find themselves unable to navigate the shallow waters at Dunkirk, and only a few of them can even get close enough to load men who have walked out onto the mole. The attempted solution is for British naval officers on the English side of the channel to commandeer just about anything that floats to make the crossing to either bring soldiers back or ferry them from the shore out to the larger ships. Some boat owners take up the challenge personally out of a sense of duty and compassion. One of those is a mariner named Dawson (Oscar winner Mark Rylance), who brings along his teenage son (Tom Glynn-Carney) and his son's friend, George (Barry Keoghan). Their first encounter with someone who needs rescuing is a downed pilot (Cillian Murphy) who is on the verge of an emotional breakdown and becomes a danger to the mission. In the air, a squadron of three RAF pilots (including Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) patrol the skies for Luftwaffe planes and, when they find them, try to shoot them down to keep them from shooting the soldiers on the beach or bombing the ships and boats trying to rescue them. They doggedly and heroically pursue their mission, in spite of the unpredictability and danger of the Luftwaffe planes, very limited (dwindling) fuel supplies and the loss of comrades. As this and the other two narratives develop, the movie interweaves all three stories and brings each to logical, but fairly unpredictable conclusions. "Dunkirk" is an innovative, well-crafted and enjoyable film. Nolan (best known for his "Dark Knight" trilogy, "Inception" and "Interstellar") effectively joins his three differently-paced narratives (although the back-and-forth between day and night in the beach scenes can be a little disorienting). His script contains a relatively small amount of dialog, instead building suspense by concentrating on the details of what's happening and showing all of it through the eyes of his actors. He chose to cast (mostly) unknown actors in order to focus on the characters' personal stories and he conducted an exhaustive casting process to make sure his approach would bear fruit. (And it did, even with the casting of One Direction singer Harry Styles in his first film role.) Nolan also shot using creative and evocative camera angles, he favored practical effects (rather than an overuse of green-screen technology) for his crowd scenes and action sequences and put a lot of effort into shooting with authentic period planes, ships and boats, some of which participated in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. Oh, and Hans Zimmer's original score (complete with a synthesized version of Nolan's own pocket watch ticking away the time) stands out. In short, Christopher Nolan has dramatized a vital, but under-appreciated chapter of World War II history in a style that is all his own and has made a film that should appeal to Movie Fans of all styles. The little that it lacks in excitement, back story and narrative cohesion as compared to more traditional war films, it mostly makes up for in artistic and entertainment value. "A-"
1.0~Slow and Heavy Handed lvzee-697-249607 Sign in Permalink Hard to understand why so many people like this film. Slow, lacking in suspense, and extremely heavy handed. Hint for all beginning screenwriters and directors, audiences aren't stupid. If a pilot will run out of fuel late in the movie, you shouldn't have multiple discussions between the pilots discussing fuel supplies-one is plenty, we'd get it. Hint for all cinematographers and directors-when you are showing scenes of squalor, unhappiness or unpleasantness, the photography should not make it look like a travel poster advertising a great vacation spot. (Terrence Malick never got this, nor did the makers of the Revenant.) This movie demonstrates how to take an exciting situation and suck all the life and suspense out of it.
2.0~Boring and very shallow acting massivedark Sign in Permalink I was so eager to watch Dunkirk as i'm a WW2 fanatic! 20 min in to the movie and I knew it was going to be a boring ride. War movies should make the audience feel and sense the suffering of the soldiers, it should go under your skin, but this one was completely no feeling show. Silly dog fights, very artificial smoke, actually one of the BF109 got hit on the right wing and smoke blasted from the left one! What a waste!! I only gave it 2 stars for the boat scene where the Germans were practicing shooting their weapons. Other than that, a big ZERO.
4.0~A boring war movie tobbens-89118 Sign in Permalink This is a movie you will soon forget. There is no personal story that will make you emotionally involved. The acting is limited to listening to officers discuss the facts: 400 000 men stranded with little hope to return to Britain alive. If you like watching bombs falling and men dying, this is the film for you. Else, avoid it.
5.0~An Absolute Failure CryptoGuy Sign in Permalink I've been disappointed with films before, but Dunkirk will top that list for a while. The movie is boring. Apart from a few spitfire scenes that are well done, this movie lacks any real imagination. The most glaring problem with the film is the story. Nolan fails to truly capture anything worth telling. Instead pulling the audience in with character development, he relies on the history of the moment. You won't care one bit about a single character. Either we're to believe that the English have the stiffest of upper lips in times of great harm, or these duds would't realize true danger even if it set them on fire first. There are many great moments in Dunkirk history Nolan could have built a story around. But he chose to try to tell everything about Dunkirk in a discombobulated manner, filled with pensive staring, unintelligible dialogue, and a roaring soundtrack. And even for the passive WWII history reader, this will stink of mistakes and inaccuracies. I cannot recommend this film. Wait for the DVD or prime cable viewing.
8.0~Nolan simply made an epic film about survival... AlsExGal Sign in Permalink ... and it worked! At least for me. Now for a few words about that Nolan style in this film. Christopher Nolan wants to have his cake and eat it too, and he's been successful enough that he's one of the very few directors who gets the opportunity to do so anymore, in a franchise world where the auteur theory is dead and producers are way more important than directors (witness Kathleen Kennedy firing the Lord brothers from the Han Solo movie because they were actually attempting to impose a personal vision upon it, something the Star Wars franchise will never allow any director to do ever). Nolan wants to work in super-mainstream genres: super-heroes, war, science fiction. But he wants his product also to be very self-consciously and in-your-face artistic. He sets up little rules for each movie and he plays by them, and it's up to the viewers to figure them out. There are three main story lines in Dunkirk, and each one unspools over a different frame of time. So, the Harry Styles story line covers one week of time, the Mark Rylance story line covers one day, and the Tom Hardy story line covers only one hour! This information is provided to us at the beginning of the movie. There is a title card that reads "1. The Mole: One Week". This is supposed to tell us that this particular story line in the movie is going to cover one week. But I spent 15 seconds thinking, "One week? What does that mean?" before there was so much shooting I got caught up in the action on-screen and didn't think about the title card for the rest of the movie. It wasn't until later that I was enlightened as to Nolan's intent. I am accustomed to movies tinkering with time concepts, yet I didn't get that this movie was playing around with time for the entirety of the time that I watched it. I was like, man, Tom Hardy has been in that plane for a really unrealistic amount of time! I'm just arrogant enough to think that if I didn't get the time tricks, then I'm guessing most of the viewers of Dunkirk didn't get, or didn't even notice, all this jumping around in time. Doesn't really distract from one's enjoyment of the movie, unless you stop to think about Tom Hardy still being in that plane ... Other extremely self-consciously artistic Nolan choices: no German soldier's face is ever seen clearly in the entire movie. Also, the violence is very self-consciously bloodless and sanitary. Nolan has said he wanted the movie to be about rescue and heroism; not war and violence. There's also a ticking stopwatch motif playing on the soundtrack virtually the entire movie. Nolan's call or Hans Zimmer's, I don't know. The stopwatch features very prominently in the trailers, but I didn't know it was also going to run for the duration of the movie, as well. If everything I have written seems like I didn't like the film, let me say that is not true. I get that Nolan could have made a conventional war movie, but he took a home run swing and went with something much more experimental, and I thought his reasoning for this was pretty clear by the end: this is NOT a classic "hero's plot arc" story. It just doesn't fit that mold. You could see in the conclusion that most of the fighters felt like cowards and failures. To paraphrase Churchill, you don't win wars by retreating. And, yet, there was a humble, understated glory in this moment. This was a movie about duty above all else - just many small people doing the small things asked of them.
6.0~Masterful cinematography joness00 Sign in Permalink Nolan's craftsmanship is outstanding. However, movie lacks captivating story and connection with characters. There are only few moments. Other wise, it just seemed like most expensive reenactment for documentary movie. It certainly wasn't what I am looking in fictional movies (you all do understand that this was fiction? Based on true story, yet fictional. Dunkirk happened, yet not like in this movie. It was a lot more messier and bloodier. In the end this seemed like big budget fan film for one WW2 battle). Tom Hardy's performance was very Bane-ish (after watching the movie you'll know what I mean), so if he wasn't pushed on by studio, just because movie needed big name to be in this big budget movie, then Nolan made mistake by casting him. Would be better with someone with no name (at least no name at the moment). Must admit that even I didn't like movie story wise, I admired cinematography. All shots and effects were outstanding, I wish there would be more movies like this every year. It was so nice to enjoy those practical effects. If there was CGI (there definitely was CGI in the movie), it wasn't obvious. Overall, movie felt original and fresh. It was great attempt from Nolan. Can't wait for his next movie.
4.0~Over-hyped and terribly loud and annoying soundtrack steve-downerhouse Sign in Permalink I don't write reviews very often but feel compelled to do so on this occasion. I was really looking forward to seeing this film after all the rave reviews. But to say I am disappointed is an understatement. This has to be one of the most over-hyped films of recent times, with little storyline, depth and narrow focus of such a significant event in WW2. In addition, the soundtrack in the film has this constant VERY LOUD screeching music and effects that frankly just got on my nerves, totally spoiling the little enjoyment I would otherwise have got. Save your money and avoid.
4.0~Not a great movie. jeneve-06408 Sign in Permalink As a truly great war film goes it is most certainly not up there with the best, watchable yes but quite slow and ponderous, there has to be good stories within the main evacuation story and this is where it fell short, without being emotionally drawn to any one character the film falls very flat. The cinematography i have to say is superb but the action failed to ignite any real reaction in me, This could have been up there alongside Saving private Ryan and The longest day which i am happy to watch many times over,I am surprised at some of the rave reviews but sadly i couldn't sit through another screening of Dunkirk.
10.0~A great movie gurdeeppandher Sign in Permalink I watched Dunkirk in Whitehorse, Yukon. As soon as the movie opened its first scene, it took me to the pages of history. World War II created lots of stories and this one was one of the epic ones. Dunkirk presented in a wonderful way. The whole story-line, cast, and movie- making is great. The cast present the heroism, emotionalism, suffering, joy, and everything is a professional way.
1.0~If I could go less than a 0 rating, I would hallfamily-04537 Sign in Permalink One of only a handful of movies I have ever walked out on, or stopped in the middle. This movie lasted about 30 minutes and I could not take it. Weird music, awkward flow, and really boring.
1.0~Dunkirk Should be a Flop If There is Any Justice in This World trescia-1 Sign in Permalink I really liked Inception. I think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. But his latest film, Dunkirk, is a turkey. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm not just saying that because I sat there and nit-picked the military hardware and special effects and found them lacking. I'm saying it because the movie was just plain bad. I will point out that I'm glad that some of my favorite actors got some work and were paid "big picture" money to work on this. It's nice to see some really fine actors get paid. That's the only good thing I can think of to say. So let's get started on the bad stuff. Historical accuracy? Yeah, I'm a war nerd (tm) and I study war. I did notice a few "errors" here and there but WHO CARES? The errors in historical baloney such as ships or planes or whatever just fade into nothingness compared to colossal error of making a movie about Dunkirk in which the blitzkrieg is missing. Blitzkrieg may have been real, or may have been some kind of historical fallacy, but it's a thing. It has to be in a movie about flippin' Dunkirk or nobody knows what's going on. This movie desperately needed a tiny touch of something to explain how all those soldiers ended up on the beach. A hint. Something. You just don't show "lots of guys on the beach" and not expect somebody to ask "what's this?" The blitzkrieg was missing. So were the Germans. No Germans. Just "the enemy" said in such a "suitable for television" manner as to cause anyone's ears to prick up. "What did they not say? They censored the word 'Germans?' What??" Yes. Dunkirk is a movie that fails to identify "the enemy" as The Third Reich. I'm calling bullshit on that. This is just embarrassing. No mention of Germans or Huns or Jerries or Heinies or Boche. No nothing. The word is "stupid." It gets worse. The film opens with a stunning display of poor soldiering by a British Tommy. He comes under fire so he stands up in a hot environment and then, failing to get rightfully shot, he throws down his rifle and runs for the rear. I wanted to shoot him myself but the realities of modern cinema make shooting characters on the screen pointless. We are then treated to some of the worst aerial footage in memory. Spitfires and Messerschmitts shoot each other. There is a discussion about saving ships and planes for The Battle of Britain. It's a short discussion. There is another short discussion about The Battle of France. Nobody cares, especially the people on screen. It's all very abstract, cold and meaningless. But never fear, we're treated to the inevitable result of shooting and bombing and killing. A man is rescued from a sunken ship, then, in a fit of dementia, he kills a teenage boy. Obviously that's what happens in war. Men go mad and kill boys. Well, if you want to believe that--go ahead. Just don't expect me to join you. I'm sure that a few British soldiers behaved badly during the Dunkirk battle. But that's not the story here. The fact that the vast majority of them did not behave badly is the story. Get it straight. They made a good movie about Dunkirk. It was called Mrs. Miniver. Watch that instead. Maybe the British back then were just too stiff and proper to be believable to us now. But that's not something that was wrong with them then, it's a symptom of what's wrong with us now. Addendum: It took me a couple of days to find the movie that sounds like this one. Yes, I hated the score by Hans Zimmer almost as much as the movie itself, because it was so distracting to try to remember "where have I heard this before?" Well, I heard the music in the 1984 film "The Bounty" by Vangelis. THAT music sounds so much like the music in this film that if I were Vangelis, I'd lawyer up. So yes, even the music sucked (I can hardly believe it). Hans Zimmer let me down.
6.0~Visually stunning, but emotionally unsatisfying joeravioli Sign in Permalink At the risk of sounding like a fanatic, Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly the only one we can trust to save original, franchise- less cinema from extinction. His willingness to create wholly original spectacle, mayhem grounded in reality, crafted with skill, sensitivity, and a deep, but mellow Tarantino-esque affection for the freedom of the silver screen renders him the most admirable big- budget blockbuster director working today. Which is why it's such a goddam shame that his biggest films aren't that great. Dunkirk recounts the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, probably the most celebrated event of the entire second World War. Hundreds of thousands of British soldiers found themselves pushed back by German forces to the beaches of Dunkirk, so close to Britain that they could see it. Stranded between hell and high water, the British soldiers seemingly had no choice but to wait for the Nazis to pick them off, one by one. In desperation, the British military commandeered everything that could float, from fishing boats to pleasure yachts. And with these small boats, around three hundred thousand British soldiers were saved, at least until they returned to battle. It remains an impressive story even now, not as a military victory, but as a wonderful example of human action, much like the Berlin Airlift of 1948. It can't exactly be labelled as a humanitarian effort, but the fact that so many lives were saved makes it very tempting. The film tells this story through a tense narrative divided in three: land, sea, and sky. One narrative follows a young British soldier as he attempts to escape the beach, another follows one civilian's attempt to help evacuate, and the third follows an air force pilot as he battles the German airforce above the waves. While this division of narrative allows for more of a story to be told, it ultimately reduces the effect of the film. We are told all three stories at the same time, Nolan cutting from one to the other in a choppy manner, not giving any one story the opportunity to form any sort of emotional resonance or any one character enough screen time for us to develop sympathy for them. The result is a curiously thin experience, curious because each story is rousing enough, but together and at the same time, they become weak. While Interstellar wallowed in maudlin nonsense, Dunkirk finds itself on the opposite side of the spectrum: virtually devoid of feeling. All that being said, the film is nothing to sneer at. The plane scenes, while occasionally disorienting, are very thrilling, Hoytema more than pulling his weight in that department. The soundtrack, which ticks like a time bomb throughout the entire film, provides the film with a wonderful intensity that kept me engaged and excited. And whatever fears you may have about this PG-13 war film not accurately depicting war in all its horror and brutality, let them rest. Nolan doesn't shy away from the peril of the circumstances, one particularly frightening scene of soldiers burning to death in the middle of the ocean making this clear. However much Nolan was wooed away from the human side of storytelling by the technical aspect of the entire thing, it's always fun -- and terrifying -- to see a great director at work. As far as acting goes, Hardy and Murphy perform as expected. But of all people, Harry Styles brings it to the table with surprising gusto, outperforming veteran thespians like Branagh and almost even Rylance. It's worth noting that he has no formal training as an actor. However, the drawback of his performance is that he emerges as the only truly compelling character in the entire film. Everyone else, perhaps excluding Murphy's character, is boring, existing as only a ragdoll for all the spectacle and fury to toss about. Dunkirk isn't a bad film. It's a good, maybe even a great film, turned into somewhat of a mess by non-linearity. There are rousing bits, moments of peril, and a few that are undeniably beautiful. Watching the film and taking into account certain strokes of creative genius, you'll know that you're in the hands of a great director. However, you're not in the hands of a great writer, and that perhaps makes all the difference.
6.0~Could have been better shivendrasharma Sign in Permalink As other reviews here describe in great depth, Nolan has successfully implemented the best of visuals and sound effects. However, the hype created by trailers falls pretty short of describing a genuinely intense and desperate evacuation that took place during the whole battle. At first, the trailers looked as if the Commonwealth Army fought a desperate retreat to 'home'; however, what we see are repetitive scenes that of a handful of Stuka divers getting destroyed by a group of just three RAF fighters, only one of which keeps on the skies while the other two survive on the same escape boat. Its not the setting or the diversion of the director's traditional way of telling one of history's most important events as an all out war (like what one could remember from The Enemy at the Gates or Saving Private Ryan), but the lack of depth in showing the true nature of that hasty evacuation that took place when news had spread that German forces from all sides would be surrounding the allied landing within hours. What we see instead is anonymous soldiers simply changing boats from ships and vice versa, and finally reach 'home sweet home' without really showing much of the real blood that was spilled in order to protect those who were to be evacuated. So, although the movie launches off nicely, it goes monotone within 45 minutes. I wish Nolan had shown the French lines that there were holding their ground from the Germans and relate all that with the evacuation that was taking place. Its just too plain.
10.0~Unique, fantastic... MmdAsk Sign in Permalink Best movie of year, one of the best movies ever and best war movie ever. Timelines and time sections of movie was made and arranged unprecedentedly. The way that movie was shoot and showing us the story and events is amazing unique and unrivaled so everyone will be excited and Ill give 10/10 because THIS IS PERFECT and you can only rate it 10 and enjoy it.
1.0~Super boring milenkne Sign in Permalink What a disappointment! I went to the theatre with an expectation of seeing a spectacle in the class of Saving Private Ryan (SPR), but boy, was I in for a rude awakening! So, what is Dunkirk (2017)? It's a movie similar to SPR, but rid of ANY story and ANY character development. It's like a war documentary, but without any narration. We see the soldiers, the airplanes, torpedoes, ships, but there's no story that connects them and pulls you in. When I saw SPR, I was engrossed in the story immediately. Here, I walked out after about 30 min because the movie failed to engage me in any way. No matter what genre I watch, I am ticked off by unrealistic scenes (given the premise, of course. It is not unbelievable to watch Spiderman walk on the ceiling because you accept that the movie works on the premise that Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and thus developed some spider-like abilities. However, it would tick me off if Spiderman's hand turned into a rocket launcher or a plasma weapon - that's the premise for Terminator movies, not for Spiderman.) But I digress. So, the main character sees another soldier on the beach. He approaches him and says nothing. O-Kay.... He keeps looking at him, and the other soldier, also without saying anything, gives him water. The main character drinks, returns the bottle and leaves without a word. Ummm... A "Thank you, man" would be in order. You would think they have some telepathic abilities and are able to communicate with thoughts. But OK - I am thinking everybody's super stressed, so I let it go. But the next scene is what really kills me - enemy planes bomb the beach full of soldiers. After the planes flew away, the surviving soldiers get up from the ground. Some remain on the ground, presumably dead or wounded. Nobody approaches the soldiers on the ground to check if they're wounded, if somebody is still alive and needs help! Absolutely unrealistic! They looked like robots, not soldiers who cared about their fellow brothers in arms. The movie goes on skipping from story to story, all of them being boring and not connected to one other. No dialog, no character development, no story! Silent movies provide more dialog than this! Just when I thought our main character was mute and deaf, he finally opened his mouth some 25 min into the movie. At the moment when a torpedo hit the ship, I didn't see the soldiers who I connected with, struggling to survive - I saw actors dressed in uniforms shooting a movie. That's the moment when I got up and left -- while the actors were still acting they were under water hit by a torpedo...
8.0~Great film...but exceptional...I'm not sure! alexandermangoldt Sign in Permalink First of, I enjoyed (for lack of a better term) this movie. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat, but there was suspense and I wasn't bored one bit by what I was offered on screen. Having seen quite a few war movies (Platoon, Apocalypse now, Saving Privat Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, All quiet on the Western front, etc.) and having read a lot of war novels (The Naked and the Dead, The Thin Red Line, From Here to Eternity, etc.) I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as an anti-war movie or anti-war film. It is my contention that young men will continue to be easily lured into the military because it offers something they supposedly miss in their private life: action! I know, because when I was eighteen I signed up for an additional two months to my mandatory military service because I was keen on getting away from home and I had no idea what awaited me. Fortunately, I didn't stay long enough to be picked for IFOR or KFOR. Dunkirk will not keep young men from joining the army for certain aspects that I find in a lot of war films. For example, the protagonists are almost always good looking (Fionn Whitehead as Tommy) and they have always a great character (Tommy aka Whitehead protects the French soldier who poses as an Englishman). War also allegedly offers young men the chance to prove themselves, to grow and to turn into men (Tom Glynn-Carney as Peter - Mr. Dawson's son). Apart from that, you also have acts of bravery and heroism that appeal to young men (Tom Hardy as the heroic pilot who risks his own life to save that of others). And there are these moments of patriotic triumph that you find not so often in Dunkirk but which do exist and seemed to me typically Hollywoodish (not sure this word exists): the moment when the private boats arrive or the moment when Commander Bolton aka Kenneth Branagh sees the boats arriving and says "HOME". All in all, I don't see how an entertaining film like this is supposed to make young men consider war something dull and boring. An actual anti-war movie to me would be a man who refuses to pick up arms and kill other men and escapes to a place where there is no war and hides there until things blow over. I just don't see Christopher Nolan making a film about that and turning the protagonist into a hero. Be that as it may, I'd like to point out the things I liked about the movie: The fact that most of the film is about survival and not heroism, the fact that almost no CGI was used, the fact that the pictures are beautiful and impressive in every sense of these two words, the fact that it mostly spares us typical (American) patriotism and the fact that the German soldier remains almost completely invisible instead of being portrayed as evil as it happens in so many other war movies. But there are also things I had problems with: The score by Hans Zimmer. Don't get me wrong, I like the score, but I believe some scenes would have worked better if there had been silence. I perceived the music in this film as a tool intended to dictate my feelings, and I don't like it when music tries to tell me what to feel. Especially the boat arrival scene was a caesura to me, until that moment I had experienced the film as rather naturalistic in style and then in this scene it turned into Hollywood. Bottom line: This film is good and thought provoking, but other war movies have done that before, so I don't think Dunkirk stands out among the other war movies I have seen. It's different in parts, but it is also a very typical war movie in other parts.
5.0~a film with out grit markuk-14967 Sign in Permalink well i was so looking forward to this film but after the first 10 minutes of anticipation waiting for a great story to start it was like watching a long trailer not a patch on the original I've seen better school plays possibly the worst war film ever and I've seen a lot of war films
1.0~A Masterpiece (of Emotionless Boredom And Nolan Trickery) Cinnyaste Sign in Permalink Crow the critics are about Nolan's latest, "Dunkirk." A stunning masterpiece say many. Masterpiece my ass. Snookered by the hype and war film fandom, ducats were placed on counter, a ticket for admission passed back. Lights dimmed, anticipation mounted, and... nothing. Nothing. Save lurching between disparate, battle set pieces featuring people for whom little or no empathy exists. Lacking investment in the characters, what remains are merely adequate, bloodless war scenes easily outgunned by the recent "Fury" and, farther back, "Saving Private Ryan." For example, a young boy is killed but we know nothing of him, nothing of his motivation for climbing aboard a civilian, Dunkirk-bound boat at the last minute. We feel nothing for him because he's simply a cardboard cutout. As the actors barely register emotion, boredom set in and not to be shaken off. The characters move as wind-up toys. There are few actors who bare their soul like Cillian Murphy, here a shell-shocked survivor. As directed, he sleepwalks with the depth of an amateur in a high school production. He's not alone. All the actors turn in measured performances with identical blank looks and monotone deliveries. Particularly wasted is the actor's actor, Kenneth Branagh. Certainly the bravery and sacrifice of civilian and military in the Dunkirk evacuation is celebrated in "Dunkirk." Thank you. However, this historical action occurred in 1940. Films echo the zeitgeist of the time in which they're produced. It's an odd choice to make a large (bad) film about an evacuation three-quarters of a century past. There's a stink of political agenda afoot in "Dunkirk" that's intolerable. The enemy, unseen in "Dunkirk," lurks and kills from safety by air and ground. Surrounded with backs to the the Atlantic, the very survival of a way of life is in question, as portrayed in "Dunkirk." (Spoiler Alert: The Allies Won The War.) The enemy's attacks are isolated like terrorism. The result is "Dunkirk" weaves a cautionary allegory mirroring religious extremism bent on destroying all non-believers. Subtle propaganda is dangerous. "Dunkirk" fits that bill. Either that or Nolan is a complete idiot who hasn't a whit of sense. It's a toss-up based on a filmography including the lackluster borefest "Interstellar," and the beyond inane "Inception." Nolan remains static in his career with "Dunkirk." His films are half-baked, underwritten, detached, and emotion-free. "Dunkirk" plays like a rough cut by a bad director who expects the viewer to emotionally fill-in-the-blanks. "Dunkirk" even lacks the courage of its convictions in being bloodless - there are no graphic deaths. At least Spielberg had the courage to rub the viewer's nose in the stench of death in "Saving Private Ryan." The first half hour of that film is unprecedented in the depiction of carnage (one can almost taste the grit of raining sand from nearby mortar strikes). Nolan sanitizes-for-your-own-protection. Yet he chose a violent topic and punked out; a war movie detached from death is not a film about war. By design, war cannot include gratuitous violence, just insanity - an element also lacking in "Dunkirk." The wall-to-wall dramatic, but mixed low, score loses its effectiveness and becomes annoying. And, the constant, ham-handed crosscutting between stories further waters this already thin soup by stopping a scene's dramatic momentum. A short scene in "Mrs. Miniver" (1942) featuring civilian Walter Pidgeon returning from Dunkirk in his shot up runabout says more in the visuals and a few lines of dialogue about the evacuation than the entirety of "Dunkirk." As Trump might Tweet, "Sad!"
2.0~This is NOT a good movie. chrismagson-10437 Sign in Permalink Has everyone gone mad? This is a bad movie. A very bad movie. It borders on stupid in places. 'plug the holes'? What??? Was this scripted by a 10 year old? The story (what story) is too broken up. The dialog is so broken it is almost insignificant. Brits keep getting shot, every single ship gets sunk, but aside from a few German planes, not a single Jerry in site. And just about NO-ONE shooting back. The music (?) Is noisy and even irritating at times. This is a very bad movie.
1.0~What the hell did people see in this? mgglasby Sign in Permalink An unmitigated pile of crap! The most irritating music I have ever been subjected to in a movie and a lame plot that never gives people the chance to get to know any of the characters. Soulless and boring are two of the more positive things I can say about the movie. Shot on a minimal scale this does not do justice to what was an immense undertaking that saved the British army from complete annihilation. A waste of 106 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Do yourself a favour, don't bother with this piece of junk.
9.0~Rating: A msbreviews Sign in Permalink Some things are undeniable: the sky is blue, fire burns and Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors alive. His originality in the way he tells a story is always mind-blowing and very unconventional, which makes some critics' minds go against him simply because they just can't understand the brilliance of said director. Once again, Nolan directs the hell out of this movie! Not only his storytelling is very different, it actually fits perfectly into the film's line of events. Once you get it, it literally makes you go "Oooooohhhhh, so that's what you wanted me to understand. Cool!". The fact that he used 6000 extras plus real boats and planes from that era elevates the movie's realism. The real locations make the whole film look stunning and the cinematography is pure perfection. As for the story itself, I gotta emphasize on this: it's literally a WAR movie. From the very first shot, BUM! You're in it! This might be one of the best (if not THE best) pure war film in history: the dizzy air fights, the bombs constantly being dropped on the beach, the gunshots, everything feels and SOUNDS so real! Hans Zimmer's score proves that he's one of the best composers ever ... For the first time in my life, I honestly felt sick and uncomfortable watching some scenes on IMAX. Normally, this would be a negative, but not on a war film like this: it delivers the message it wants in the most REAL way possible. If I didn't feel well, seated on a chair, watching a war going down on a screen, I can't even imagine what it's like to actually experience it. The cast is great, especially Mark Rylance as Mr. Dawson who brings a needed level of emotion to the movie, Fionn Whitehead as Tommy who we follow throughout the major part of the runtime and also Harry Styles as Alex who surprised the hell out of me, the kid can actually act! Like I said above, this is a very unconventional film which portrays the war in its most horrible and fierce state. There's almost no dialogue during the whole runtime, there's no chat around a fire where the soldiers talk about their pasts and families, there's never a moment to rest. That, for me, it's perfect because it depicts the war as it probably was! I can't imagine people having dances and chats on the beach while bombs are being dropped, so this aspect of the film, for me, it's as real as it can get. However, this leads me to my only issue with this movie: its characters. Since there's no backstory to any of them, I can't really connect or get attached to a single character. I understand that that's exactly what Nolan wanted, but the truth is that I didn't feel scared for someone's imminent death or worried that someone might not make it to the rescue boats ... God, I needed to go to RottenTomatoes to check some of the characters' names because I couldn't remember them! They are nothing to me because I know nothing about them ... Still, I can only see this as a minor issue for me because I can understand what Nolan was going for, I truly can. Dunkirk is about the EVENT and not the people in it. The whole movie gives me that sense of danger and urgency with the thrilling air fights, with the soldiers' fear in their faces every time a plane goes by, as well as their hope every time they go away. The worry and sense of duty that the sailors show navigating into the war to save their fellow compatriots is emotional and captivating ... Every single one of these aspects elevates the film in such a way that I can't look at it and not see a perfect portrayal of WAR. In conclusion, Nolan does it again. His unconventional storytelling and beautiful cinematography, as well as Hans Zimmer's score, turn Dunkirk into one of the best war movies of all time! From the dizzy air fights to the bombs being dropped, everything feels incredibly real and scary, which makes this film probably the best portrayal of a war in its most fierce state. The cast is great, the characters not so much, but the story is about the event that happened and not about the people in it. So, go and (try to) enjoy a war through a screen without throwing up or leaving your seat: after all, you are safe ... They were not. MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)
1.0~Wastage of money and mind amitnkumar-93 Sign in Permalink I am really a big fan of Nolan sir, and this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, complete Boredoms, no climax no thrill, no war, just full of noisy sounds. Do not waste your time and money. Expected a lot from this movie, heard a lot of stories about Dunkirk. But is this the way of spoiling and that too by such a great director.
3.0~Not my favorite war movie qqqrossi Sign in Permalink I was expecting way more from the movie based on the ratings (9/10 or 90% on most rating sites) at the time. Saving Private Ryan, Fury and Hacksaw Ridge did not even get ratings this high. Maybe I expected something else, but this was a rather inaccurate war drama.
5.0~Fails to deliver overall mttuk Sign in Permalink I have been so looking forward to this movie. Having studied the evacuation of Dunkirk, many years ago and also having been to visit the beaches and also the wartime tunnels at Dover where much of the planning was conceived, my expectations was that this would be a movie to rival all WW2 movies before it. However, all the way through the movies I felt like it was skimming the surface of what happened and never really got going at any point. I left deeply disappointed. The movie itself is telling the story of the evacuation from several different viewpoints which are timed in with each other. This I felt was a really good concept, to get the views of civilians trying to help, soldiers, fliers and officers alike. Where it falls down in my opinion is that the film is almost totally devoid of script. The characters involved only have a few lines throughout the entire movie. It is hard to find any type of connection to them as there is no story about them. But perhaps the biggest let down of them all is that there is literally zero mention of the epic planning, call to arms and execution of the Dunkirk evacuation. There is hardly any mention of Bertram Ramsey, the man responsible for the entire evacuation. This was the largest evacuation of troops in British military history. There were hundreds of private trawlers used, hundreds of aircraft, dozens of royal navy ships. This film failed to capture any of this and instead focused on a few individuals, but failed to give them a script. Honestly I feel that if you didn't know the story of Dunkirk, before you went and saw this, you would leave still not really knowing, and this for me is the greatest let down by Nolan. This movie FAILS to actually tell the story of Dunkirk. The music score by Hans Zimmer is excellent, the effects in the movie are excellent. It fails in almost every other department.
6.0~A (too) quiet tale from WWII thor_linnet Sign in Permalink To cut to the chase, this movie is entirely forgettable. I feel that there's a huge bias towards loving Nolan's films among critics, as he's deemed the best of the best, and as such, reviewers will, subconsciously maybe, adapt their opinions to suit this fact. It has happened before: Which movie was best, The Dark knight, or the Dark knight Rises? Correct, The Dark Knight. Yet, when TDKR arrived, it was so hyped that an explosion of unfounded positive reviews spewed everywhere. It was definitely a good movie. But it was also NOT near as good as The Dark knight, a fact most have come to realize in the following years. I have loved basically all of Nolan's movies. This time though, a yawn too many escaped my mouth, and not from a lack of sleep. The movie has great acting, although it is quite simple to be fair. Not a lot of emotion or character development is present, so it would be hard to judge talent based on performances of this film. The thing that keeps the movie fairly enjoyable is it's awesome visuals and musical scores. You are not in doubt you are watching a Nolan film; the editing, lighting, and audio track is an art in itself. Unfortunately, these positive aspects are not able to compensate for the almost complete lack of storytelling and excitement throughout the movie. The brief scenes of suspense and action are quickly watered out by long sections of mundane actions by the characters. There is no palpable red line throughout, keeping the baseline interest in the movie at quite a low level. No real story is told, it's more of a depiction of a historical event. I believe the creation of this movie is an attempt to show how young, inexperienced, and human the soldiers of WWII really were. It wants to portray bravery and weakness of civilians and soldiers alike. It does succeed, but if only the movie was not so dull in doing so. Most of Nolan's movies I've watched at least two times, but I don't think I will revisit this one. People have compared this film to Saving Private Ryan and other WWII all-time greats, which in my mind is utter crazy talk. Watch Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan back to back, and if you still hold the same opinion, I promise you we will never agree on anything. This movie's IMDb score, along with the Dark Knight Rises', are, in my opinion, inflated to proportions that do not match their quality.
8.0~DUNKIRK is a Good Movie jfss-69191 Sign in Permalink For me the true focus of DUNKIRK ought to be about the English people who risked all to get their troops off the beach. The scared young soldiers seemed to dominate more than stories of their brave elders who rescued them. The flying scenes and British pilots were magnificent, and especially the courage and valor of the older man and his son to the rescue in their boat. A good movie!
3.0~Historical Blather kz917-1 Sign in Permalink Put me into a history coma. I really was excited to watch this, but it left me out in the cold and clueless. Unless you are really interested I would skip it.
3.0~That's a Hard No... rstuartftw Sign in Permalink I saw this recently and have to weigh in on the ridiculously high ratings everyone seems to be giving. The chopping and changing of scenes that overlap the timeline make the movie so damn confusing. Half the movie you're watching a plane drop out of the sky and you start to feel it's an Inception scene and you're screaming "would the van just hit the water already!!!" Whatever made them think this would work is beyond me. Not to mention the lame perspective they showed of an armada of civilian ships coming to the rescue. In reality the rescue operation was large and the fleet was massive. In the movie they show one fishing boat and a ferry. Whoop whoop! We're all saved!! Please.... Oh, and its bloody loud! And I dont mean enjoyably loud, I mean "grab your ear buds matey, or you'll be deaf by the credits!" No joke, good lucky watching this at home. Keep the remote close by to balance the sound for the entire movie. I was really looking forward to this, but found myself drowned in confusion. By all means watch it, simply so you can say "oh yeah, that guy had a point..."
2.0~Disappointing harrydog Sign in Permalink An important piece of history overshadowed by a thin script, overbearing score and either same old predictable or distracting 'all too pretty' cast. The expanse of beach and helmets left behind was touching but aside from that, a fairly bland and unengaging film. Even the trains looked too contemporary. A wasted opportunity.
1.0~why cann't i rate this zero? joesdad11 Sign in Permalink After reading wiki, i thought i watched a different movie. glad i came here as it seems everyone agrees with me, what a load of garbage. and i mean that literally as the first 10 minutes of the movie is of a guy trying to take a dump. first thing that struck me, tht the british were portrayed as cowards. the first group all get shot in the back as they run away from the enemy w/out firing a shot. all but one who seems not to know how to work his rifle, then throws it away. the french actualy come out better as they are manning the defenses and are being left behind by the british (did i mention cowards?) also, i assume it starts day one. if so, why were the germans so damb close to the beach? when he passed the french at the sandbags, he was three blocks from the beach, so the germans were what, 4 blocks? we have 4-7 more days to go here, and the germans are already close. i stopped watching the movie as i realize it wont get better. even he aireal combat was boring.
8.0~An immersive, visceral experience. Jesse_Ung Sign in Permalink Dunkirk plays almost like an old-fashioned disaster film. The film follows characters on land (Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles), on the sea (Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn- Carney) and in the sky (Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) - each with a very different role to play in the events that unfold. Director Christopher Nolan paints visual poetry with Dunkirk. Shooting on film in 70mm, IMAX-- the whole nine yards pays off with relish. The film is beautiful to look at and the carnage is jaw- dropping. I had the pleasure of being invited to an IMAX screening of the film and having the images truly fill your field of vision immerses you even further into the events on screen. Hans Zimmer's score sets the viewer on edge from the very beginning - a distinct ticking sound permeates most of the score. That, paired with the ear-ringing sounds of explosions and gunfire - which often occur without warning, establish a sense of dread and unease that an attack could happen at any moment, no matter how calm an on screen exchange may be. There is a certain level of emotional detachment throughout most of the film, albeit with certain moments that pop. I think this works in the film's favor in that we see that some soldiers will do whatever they must to survive - with one expressing that "survival isn't fair". This isn't a rousing war film with swelling strings and beautiful sunsets. Dunkirk is grimy and grim with death at every corner. There is a sense that the suffering of its characters do not end when the credits roll. If I were to note any caveats, the pacing is a little wobbly in its second act as the film bounces between characters, and some may take issue with the repetitive, prolonged nature of certain sequences of carnage. That being said, these caveats are minor. Nolan has crafted a beautifully tense and viscerally immersive spectacle that you should see on the biggest possible screen you can find. Dunkirk is an experience to behold.
8.0~Tensely gripping but hard on the ears dbogosian-1 Sign in Permalink There is much to like in this film, particularly if you like to be held in continuous tension for the better part of two hours. The screenplay interweaves 4-5 different story lines, all happening somewhat simultaneously but presented in not-always-chronological fashion. It's sometimes disconcerting, but there are many moments where you get to view an event from two or three different perspectives, which is very creative and adds interest. The narrative is of course harrowing, but you see it not so much through the eyes of a few individuals, but of the collective whole. In other words, the story doesn't dwell very much on any particular soldier or airman, and the ones depicted pretty soon all blur into one. The one exception is the Mark Rylance character, the boat owner who takes his sons into a war zone and thereby saves a couple dozen lives. His selfless courage and dedication to his mission is memorable, though I found his stoicism in the face of personal loss and tragedy almost too much to believe. The movie does an incredible job at immersing you in the battle scene, the confusion and madness and chaos. The air-to-air dogfights were easily the best I've ever seen; just the footage of the Spitfires, Bf-109s, and He 111 were worth the price of admission. However, there were some serious flaws. Most notably, one's ears are continually assaulted by super-loud noise. Perhaps this was an attempt to be realistic, but it went overboard. Every explosion, every round hitting a metal hull is over-amplified and painfully loud. Even scenes where ordnance is not being detonated come off as too loud, and I found that I could understand only a small fraction of the dialogue. Fortunately there isn't much dialogue and it's not very important, but it's still annoying. The story line is also fragmented and disjoint, with too many things going on at once. If they had stuck to fewer story lines, focused on a few of the men more closely, then I might have been more drawn to their fate. In the end, when the survivors reach England, I felt elation because of national pride and all that, but not because Private so-and-so made it home alive, since I knew nothing about him or what he was coming back to. Finally, I wish some aspects of the high-level strategic planning had been depicted. Who decided to requisition the little boats, when, how did they implement that plan, what sort of political dramas were played out among the Admiralty and the Government? This would have added historical depth and relevance. PS: upon a second viewing, the film got a WHOLE lot better. Definitely need to see this twice.
10.0~Amazing SatiraCiara Sign in Permalink I recently have seen this film on Thursday with a marine friend of mine and when I say that I loved every bit of this film. I love it! Amazing! I truly recommend everyone to see this film! Being a family member of the military I felt so many emotions through this film and learned a lot from it.
3.0~The story is the story ? sq8188-162-458059 Sign in Permalink Would have been good if there were any real story except maybe one about the RAF pilot what little there was. Director Nolan is trying to tell a story through a soldier's eyes. He tracks one young private with no name and gave him almost no dialog throughout the retreat. The soldier with no name wore the same shell-shock expression in the entire movie. Nothing he did was significant - so why are we following him? The pilot whom i was told was a great actor in UK but he had on a pilot's face mask the entire time, only at the end when he fueled out and stepped off his plane did he show his face. The pilot showed great skill in aerial combat. When his 2 other fly mates were shot down, he seemed to have stemmed the entire Nazi air force all by himself. At the end, the story suggests he chose to stay in the fight using up all his fuel than leaving the British ships undefended. Amazingling the ships nearly did nothing to defend themselves! I don't see any AA action. Nolan must be a one-sided believer in air power. I had to stretch my imagination to see what the pilot was up to. The beach at times look deserted. There were supposed to be 400,000 men stranded there. At least they could have CGI some of them in. Weird! The screen writer seems to want to say it's every man for himself out there. There were no order to it. Ken Branaugh was paid to look regal and just say his lines but seems detached to the men or even the war. After an hour of running around, occasional strafing from a couple of Luftwaffe planes and boats sinking it gets monotonous. Without any story building, at least the screen writer could have throw in some perspective from the German side. The only "german" seen were shadows of Nazi helmets descended on the pilot after he bailed out and torched his plane. About the boat sinking, director Nolan chose to show 4 maybe 5 boats sinking if you count the hospital ship in the beginning. The entire British destroyer loss in the operation was six. Nolan was obliged to show almost all of them sinking ? I thought the 1958 version of Dunkirk was boring, but this one bores just same, except some spectacular air crashes. Not enough to save anything. Not even close to "Private Ryan".
6.0~Overratted (what you are really going to see in Dunkirk) dudu277-1 Sign in Permalink Felt a big disappointment stepping out of the movie theater, the expectations were huge. I've been waiting and waiting for something to happen, to the narrative to go somewhere, and suddenly, its over. like a big prologue to a movie that will never happen. After the disappointment has cooled down, i can say this is a modest film about a certain tragic situation during war world II. there are no main characters that the viewer can relay to. a main character isn't the issue here, only the situation, and its stressful, horrifying and isolated, and all this hard emotions are well crafted and expressed using cinematic tools. i can conclude that this story is close to the heart of Mr. Nolan, and he wanted to make a movie out of it for a long time. Cheers. Score 6.5/10
1.0~A overwhelmingly irritating movie jkumarm-61948 Sign in Permalink If the events were true, I would like to brand the dumb spitfire pilot a real DUMBO. Even if you ran out of fuel, you could turn the plane towards the same people who were escaping and ditch the plane there. He thought it heroic to be a self sacrificial dick head to get caught by Nazi's instead. Real DUMB brit. And the other lot who were in the boat and were being shot at and refuse to come out, even when sinking. Jeezzz... SHOOT THE DIRECTOR of the film, I say!
8.0~Dunkirk movie review- Stylish (no pun intended) achyutaghosh Sign in Permalink To this day, people do not know why Adolf Hitler allowed the Dunkirk evacuation to happen. He has the entire British army pinned on a beach. He had them surrounded, and the Luftwaffe had air superiority in the sky. The U-boats made life hell in the seas, and the British were considering a conditional surrender at that point. But he stopped his advance, he let the British army escape, and the rest we know is history. "We shall go on to the end. We shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender." - Winston Churchill, after the Dunkirk evacuation History notwithstanding, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is not a war movie in the traditional sense. There are no sweeping armies, grand strategy at play, rousing speeches, intense drama or fierce combat. Instead, it establishes 3 interlinked perspectives, one each an exposition of the 3 essential asks of a soldier at war- resolve, courage and the will to survive. Mark Rylance leads the first theme, where he demonstrates impeccable resolve against the odds to do his bit in the civilian action in the evacuation. Tom Hardy is the courageous Spitfire pilot who selflessly tries to offer protection from the skies, even at the cost of his own freedom. Harry Styles leads a group of soldiers who are, well, just trying to survive. All the three threads play across different periods, in different theaters (land, sea, air) but all converge to one fateful moment. A good war movie is one that makes you hate war itself. Unlike traditional war epics which tries to do that by establishing good and evil sides, Dunkirk tries to achieve that by focusing on realism- the harrowing experience of the combatants. Dunkirk eschews dialogue in favor of visuals- George c scott's opening salvo in Patton might be longer than the entire script of Dunkirk. But Nolan's signature take is all encompassing here- an ominous score by Hans Zimmer engulfs the senses, wide 360-degree shots highlight expanse and impact, IMAX shooting tech makes you feel as if you are a part of the movie, and a mix of stalwarts and fresh faced actors bring in both innocence and class. In a way Dunkirk plays like an atmospheric horror movie. At the same time, the central theme that Nolan has explored in his Batman trilogy is touched upon here too- how do humans react in times of chaos. Is Dunkirk the best film of the year so far? Maybe for die-hard Nolan fans who like his "different" take on the war movie genre. But somehow it did not click for me the way I thought it would. Maybe because the movie ended just when it was getting engrossing. Maybe it was a bit too economical- run time, script, settings. Maybe because in India we just cannot experience IMAX tech in all its glory. Maybe because I prefer traditional war epics with dialogues and punch lines. Maybe because 19 years on, I am still not over Saving Private Ryan. Let that assessment take anything away from the immersive cinematic experience that Dunkirk is. Just don't look at it as a war movie.
3.0~Way too far from real facts silanliu Sign in Permalink The movie obviously wanted to impress audience with how dangerous the situation was. But it tried to do it by twisting the historical facts. You see destroyers after destroyers bombed to sink without firing a single anti-aircraft round. They must have all been manned by blind and deaf soldiers. We all know destroyers were designed to have two major tasks: anti submarine and anti aircraft for the fleet, protecting the aircraft carriers. In real life it would have put up a hell of anti aircraft lead against the approaching German bombers. They may have been sunk, but not without a hectic fight. For audience that have no knowledge on WWI topics, this is really impressive on how brave our ancestors had fought in how dangerous situations. But for anyone who knows a bit of history, you just laugh. It was like a grandpa bragging "I was alone tasked to defend the whole town and 25 Tigers and 5000 SS troopers attacked me and I defeated all of them..."
7.0~Even professional critics have been blinded pascal-charpentier81 Sign in Permalink We all know how good Christopher Nolan is, but this time he failed. How critics can overlook this is beyond me because it is not subjective. Objectively the film is missing essential tools of storytelling that are established for hundreds of years. Everyone who actually learned script writing would tell you the same. The movie is lacking two major things: 1. characters 2. conflict 1. The movie has NO characters. I don't mean thin ones I mean NO characters. We never even get names of the main protagonists. We get no backstory, no mannerisms, nothing. Another review said the film concentrates on the "event" Dunkirk rather than characters and on other filmmaking techniques. Even if that is the case and a conscious choice by Nolan you can't do that and expect people to be invested in your movie. It is like saying "a film needed no story, visuals where more important". You can't just ignore essential elements like story or characters. 2. The movie has no conflict. And I don't mean conflict as in allies against Germany which by the way is also not really there because you never really get to see the enemy in form of a person. I mean conflict in dialog. There is almost no dialog in the movie therefore no conflicting views that make interesting dialog which is mind boggling since Nolan is usually very good in exact that field. Since there are no characters in the movie just faces you never get invested. Nolan has been criticized in the past for his films being cold. This is the coldest one. That being said I am sure next time he will deliver again but I guarantee that in 10 years this is the movie from Nolan nobody will remember, because there is just nothing memorable in it. Even if you are that gifted you can't just ignore basic storytelling foundations.
1.0~An artsy film that missed the historically importance of the battle kyle41486 Sign in Permalink Felt like this movie was trying to win film awards then to tell a story. Horrible film if you think you are going to get a look at a very historically important battle. Have no idea why the filmmakers wanted to make up characters to tell a very small story of the events that happened.
2.0~Did I see a different movie to all of you? wazza2222-32-767437 Sign in Permalink I ended up fast forwarding a lot of this loud, dull, derivative movie. My 'suspension of disbelief' gland was exhausted. Utter garbage but I give it 2 stars for the cinematography alone.
3.0~Dunkirk: A movie without a plot based on a story well known.... mikejamesrusso Sign in Permalink When a movie is based on actual historical content, it's hard not to go into it without having certain expectations. From what I knew on the battle of Dunkirk, I was expecting a gripping story on the heroic effort and sacrifices made by the French Army on the defensive line to keep the Germans at bay long enough for hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops to escape; to live to fight another day and win the war. I was expecting to be awed by a true appreciation for the grand scale of evacuating hundreds of thousands of soldiers under enormous pressure. And while I understand going into a movie with high expectations isn't always a good idea, it's hard not to expect anything less than an impressive story, particularly when you know that story is true. Although the movie had initially appeared to be ready to deliver on these expectations, it didn't take me very long at all to realize that, sadly, Dunkirk would ultimately fail to deliver on any of it. There were no battles on the defensive line and air battles were portrayed in this film in a way that made German pilots seem like unworthy adversaries; easier to shoot down than ducks in an Atari video game. The film also fell disappointingly short on portraying the true scope of the operation. I've seen longer lines of people waiting to buy the new iPhone than the lines of soldiers portrayed on the beaches awaiting evacuation. I had found it disappointing that 20 minutes into the film I was still wondering what the plot was on a story I was already familiar with. The lack of dialog was also so obvious and overdone that I had started to grow annoyed by it. In the end, I was left wondering why this movie received so much hype and such high ratings. The only possible explanation I could provide is that there must be an awful lot of people out there who like to analyze movies scene by scene, in a DIY director's cut fashion, so that they can offer an interpretation on what they think the director is trying to portray though his artistic creativity, because these high ratings seem to have absolutely nothing to do with this actually being an entertaining movie. Director Christopher Nolan seemed too lazy and bothered to even halfheartedly attempt to deliver on anything that made the battle of Dunkirk so historically significant, choosing instead to focus far too much on creating some new kind of Tarantino/Pulp Fiction-esque piece of story telling that Hollywood elites and snobby critics can adore him for.
5.0~Overrated simon_c23 Sign in Permalink How this film is getting such rave reviews I'll never know. Technically and visually it's a stunning. After that it's pretty dull. It may be historically accurate, but I want to be entertained when I go see a film. I want a story. I want 3 dimensional characters. I want to engage with them. What I got was something that felt like tedious cut scenes in a computer game that never got to the fun part. I don't know if the lack of emotion in most characters was supposed to be stoicism, but when a young boy gets killed by accident they barely bat an eyelid. Just don't go expecting a blockbuster. Expect a big budget history channel reenactment.
10.0~If Stanley Kubrick Made A World War Two Film, It Would Be Dunkirk! Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 Sign in Permalink THIS is how you do practical filmmaking and still make it feel innovative in a digital age of media while making your film seem comparable to classics like Saving Private Ryan and FullMetal Jacket. Basically everything in Dunkirk is analogue, practical and it doesn't need to depend on overblown-CGI trickery whatsoever. Chris Nolan has given us a war movie that feels like it came from the mind of Stanley Kubrick; the scale, larger-than-life direction and impeccable cinematography all makes this film feel like it's the creative offspring of the great-late Kubrick himself. Chris Nolan has made another masterpiece for the ages and easily one of the best films of the 21st Centry just like he seamlessly achieved with Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and finally Dunkirk (as of this writing). Dunkirk tackles one of the most overlooked events of the Second World War (at least in cinema) and even in the first fifteen minutes of the movie it's instantaneously better and FAR more respectable than films like Pear Harbour. With Dunkirk, Nolan NEVER disrespects the tensions of the war and the horror it brought about, and there isn't a moment where he tries glorifying the terror. This is a war film without physical grit but PLENTY of psychological dilemmas that actually perfectly fits this kind of war-movie. Sometimes it's the emotion that's more impacting than seeing the entrails of characters going all over the place like in Saving Private Ryan (that film is still fantastic); the paranoia amongst the British and French soldiers in this film is its own form of horror. You start to wonder how the hell did the Allied forced win against the Nazis in the end? Well we did; and the events of Dunkirk changed the modern world forever. If you're a fan of Chris Nolan's work, please see this movie, be it on IMAX-70mm, regular 70mm or 35mm or digital; just see it at the movies regardless of the format. It's an ABSOLUTE MUST-SEE!
5.0~Decent, but not great chris-sopko Sign in Permalink Admittedly, telling a story of such magnitude must be difficult in approximately a two hour time frame, but for some reason this movie never quite got the emotional buy-in that I had been hoping for. I never felt the sense of doom and danger that certainly would have been present, and if this could have been conveyed it would have made the movie much more powerful and intense. I guess I wanted to try experience what they were going through, like we did in "Saving Private Ryan", but those feelings and the stress never really materializes in this movie. Unfortunately, other than the individual captain of a private boat we don't really get to know anything about the main characters of the film which does little to build the emotions and character involvement that would have made this a great film. Additionally, the true scope of what took place does not seem to be reflected in the visual nature of the film. I don't know if it was due to budgetary constraints, but it did not appear that there were over 300,000 stranded soldiers on the beaches desperately waiting to be rescued, nor did it seem like there were enough civilian boats available to make this transportation possible. The whole scale of things simply did not add up. The sheer amount of humanity must have created numerous real life issues and this was never addressed. Things were too orderly, controlled, and frankly, clean. Overall, it is a decent movie but I fail to see how it is being rated as high as 8.5.
3.0~Super boring and confusing emma_lilymay Sign in Permalink I was looking forward to this. Mainly because of Harry Styles. The movie itself is long and boring and confusing and I just make it to the end only because I wanted to see Harry. Characters have no name. You can't connect with any of them. That wee lad on the boat dies for nothing out of sheer stupidity and then later in the newspaper says war hero. The only thing that I took out of this movie is that human life is disposable and 30.000 deaths don't even make a dent in the grand scheme of things. World keeps on spinning. Truly dissapointing.
1.0~A shallow, pathetic attempt to depict a war scene thomhoanghmt Sign in Permalink This movie is so bad that we had to leave the cinema before it finished. It is merely a shallow attempt to depict the "moment" and nothing else. Content wise it offers no insight into the historic context, nothing. There's no dialogue, no story line whatsoever. If the intention of whoever made this movie is just to focus on the "moment", the state of being trapped of the soldiers then it also fails at that. For example, there were some efforts to portrait the mental state of the soldiers but dare I say it was an insult to those who fought in the war. What was being portrayed was mostly fear, the British soldiers depicted like a bunch of pathetic cowards, some was even tactically cheating to get on board, or accusing their fellow soldier of being a spy henceforth should get off the boat when it gets too heavy. Of course it's understandable to be desperate when you're in between life and death, but seriously what about other mentalities of the other hundred thousand soldiers? I cant help but thinking just play the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan on loop and you already have a much better result than this. Lookwise, it is so off putting. They said there were 400,000 soldiers trapped in Dunkirk but throughout the movie, you only saw a few boats and planes. Fair enough if they don't want to use screen effects to keep the realness, but then why alternate the colour of the whole movie to that omnipresent teal and orange look? It is too overused that some scenes don't even look real. The city in the opening scenes looks just fine and nowhere near like it's been at war, the high rank soldiers' uniform was flawless. The soldiers' faces look well fed and slept except some dirt on their face. In many scenes the composition of the frame is repeated in the same way: the camera was positioned below skyline so the frame was dominated by the sky and the beach, in the middle were silhouette of the soldiers, running across or. If this is the only way to portray the state a of being trapped then it shows a very very poor imagination. There's only so much left to criticize but I'll leave it here. For me this is the worst movie I've seen, also it's disrespectful to take such subject too lightly.
5.0~Dumbkirk blakepleasants Sign in Permalink I didn't enjoy it,,,visually it's nice to look at and the acting was good, however I had no knowledge of Dunkirk going into this and the plot was confusing to me- one moment it's daytime and the next it's night- the nonlinear time line left me perplexed. With what little dialogue there was I had a hard time understanding the most of the actors because of the accents. Overall a slow and plodding film with good suspenseful moments, but not enough character development for me to care anything about them
5.0~Did I see a different movie than everyone else that has raved about how good it is? PanheadAndy Sign in Permalink I was very disappointed with this movie. I have liked previous Nolan movies but this one left me feeling cheated that I had spent that much money to see it. It was boring and unrealistic.One scene had a ship getting hit with a bomb and immediately rolling on it's side then remaining afloat.At the end a plane runs out of fuel and seemingly defies the laws of physics by gliding forever and ever shooting down a plane before landing on the beach. They kept showing shots of the beach with lines of soldiers that nowhere approximated over 400,000 soldiers. Same with the amount of ships and boats and planes. The hype of this being one of the best war movies ever had me expecting something special. Instead it had me sitting there wondering when the fantastic movie was going to start. I waited in vain. Instead I left the show with a headache from the noise bombardment from the soundtrack.My biggest sense of wonder was that they had spent that much money making it. I wanted to like this movie but it never happened for me.
1.0~Some of the reviews on here are fake/paid for jchs Sign in Permalink Average Movie. Nolan has made a bore with interstellar and now this one. There is no story what so ever. Just soldiers on an island and soldiers in a plane. No plot or anything. Just two hours of soldiers on a beach. Since this movie is based on true events, how did the movie not have a plot? Instead of wasting your money on this go to google images and type in soldiers on a beach or soldiers in a plane. There I saved you 15 bucks. Loud and annoying music that wasn't needed. Hans Zimmer will try to use his music to have you thinking this movie will get intense but it never does. Another thing to note is most of the reviews on here for this movie are fake. I am constantly on this website and within the first 24 hours of the release of this movie there was already 100s of reviews posted. No other movie will have that many reviews that fast. Chistopher Nolan must of put some of the movie's budget into hiring people to write reviews. Planet of the apes came out a week before this and that only has 50,000 votes. This movie already has 115,000. Don't believe me? then check for yourself. Either half the audience had permission to watch the movie before anyone else or Nolan hired 100s of people for fake votes. Nolan is falling fast after his Batman Trilogy and he is an overrated director. 1/10.
6.0~Underdone-kirk Rob_Taylor Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a movie that will not be for all tastes. Certainly I found it a bit of a slog at times and, having grown up with a diet of almost constant war movies, I found it lacking in a number of departments. Firstly, though, what Dunkirk gets right. The visuals are well-done and the acting very decent from all concerned. There is no fault that you can point at in regards to cinematography or on-screen realism. Everything has been carefully shot to enhance the feeling of being there, at Dunkirk, during the evacuation. Sadly, however, that is where the film's greatest strengths lie... in its mechanical execution of the film-maker's craft. So what did I find wrong with this movie? Well, it has little in the way of heart and soul. For a film about one of the most memorable moments in World War 2, this lack of emotional core leaves you rather nonplussed. I have seen any number of docu-dramas of wartime events that had more life in them than Nolan's effort. It was so marked, that I suspect that is what Nolan was aiming for all along. Namely, he removed the emotion from the movie in the hope that the events would carry more weight with the viewer. If that was the case, then at least for me, he failed. For the most part, Dunkirk plods along with at first a rather boring and slow tempo, and then with a more urgent, but somehow equally dull, pace. At no time did I feel any kind of excitement or concern for any of the characters. In part this is because there is almost zero character development. There is also little dialogue which leaves the viewer scrabbling for visual clues as to the characters motives and goals. You don't ever end up rooting for any of the people you see on screen. If they live, or die, it doesn't matter. That, then, is Dunkirk's biggest failing. It has no soul. A moment in history where ordinary people stood up and "did their part" for the war effort is reduced to a dull, emotionless study of the event itself. For all the humanity on display, it might as well have been made by an alien with no understanding of our species. In addition to this soul-less aspect, the scale of the movie is also rather limited. Perhaps this was due to budgetary constraints, but you never see more than a couple of aircraft at once. There is no artillery shelling of the beaches. Although there is some strafing of the beach, it is only by one plane at a time. You rarely see many of the little ships and, at the end, when one of the survivors reads a paper that reveals over 300,000 have been evacuated, you are left thinking "How?" At no point do you get the feeling this was possible given what you see on screen. All in all, a rather disappointing movie that lacks any real emotional connection for the viewer to latch on to. Considering how loudly, and greatly, this movie has been praised, I expected more from it than it delivered. SUMMARY: Emotionless and rather dull. No character development, little dialogue and little real sense of danger. Nolan should stick to sci-fi.
8.0~A Nolan Masterpiece!! oazam Sign in Permalink Although Momento which starred Guy Pearce isn't Nolan's best film but Inception, Interstellar, and Dark Knight have done more justice to his filmography than the first film. Christopher Nolan is known to be a magician to Hollywood which starts from the commendable cinematography to the scintillating editing and to its labyrinth screenplay. Over the last decade, Nolan hasn't failed in any of these aspects and kept all his films on a consistent flow. Dunkirk was something I was looking forward to especially the beautiful IMAX trailer they put up together. So the movie is about what happens in WW2 in 1940 where Germany invades France trapping military troops on the Dunkirk beach. But with the help of British forces and French forces, how they manage to get more than 300,000 soldiers evacuated and back home is basically what this film is about. Quite frankly, this film was a phenomenon. How Nolan manages to present the Dunkirk evacuation in the film will keep you to the edge of your seat. The screenplay is very gripping and has that historical feel once you watch the film. The acting is your ticket to a good money spender. Fionn Whitehead's debut is everyone's treat. His role as the British pilot was fabulous and his nuanced performance is a must watch. Harry Styles acting quite surprised me. I always thought of him as a music lover by but he is getting better and better. He was so self-balanced that he is ready to hit it big in Hollywood. Cillian Murphy surely had that scarecrow mentality which is not bad thing but his role as the soldier was something similar and not different but he was good but could've minority been better. Hans Zimmer is a must when it comes to orchestrated composition. The ticking score was something perfect and how it was composed in the film. The score for the tide and how it was depicted during the evacuation was great. The cinematography was beautiful especially shooting it in an IMAX format which makes it more eye opening for the audience even surprisingly on how it was edited. Please watch this in IMAX!! 4.5/5- Nolan can only satisfy a good weekend!!
3.0~Felt like it told 2/3rds of the the story. amtbs62 Sign in Permalink I just got back from seeing Dunkirk. What I did like about the movie was the resourcefulness of the Brit & French soldiers who met on the beach. The cinematography was awesome, watching the dogfights from boat level. Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies) & son's journey was inspiring. As was dog-fighting on fumes by Hardy's character. I went to the show for the story and because Cillian Murphy & Tom Hardy were in it. I was disappointed that there was no backstory. This would have been a better movie at 2 1/2 hrs. Had expected Churchill & war room discussion/argument with the Naval Command. Very little in WW11 happened without the Commonwealth and as I understand it British India Forces were at Dunkirk and white outed out of the story. As was Cmr. Cloustons' massive contribution to the evacuation. I was disappointed that the movie was too short and didn't have the politics in it and the Commonwealth wasn't represented at all. I'll read books on Dunkirk but I wouldn't see the movie again.
3.0~So Disappointing bfm1952 Sign in Permalink I agree with all the low rated reviews with just one addition: the characters were so immature except for Alex (Harry Styles) who was TOO mature. I was annoyed watching this movie and ended up mad that I wasted rental fee of $5.99 plus my time. I truly don't understand the raves - nothing connected in the movie for me.
7.0~TIME-JUMPS MADE ME DIZZY joejanet Sign in Permalink OK, I understand, air took place over one or two hours, the boat over one or two days, the land plot, over a period of a week, all meeting at one point at the end of the movie. Excellent production values and cinematography, but it was like losing your place in a book while reading it, jumped around too much.
3.0~Awful lukewallace-94710 Sign in Permalink People got up and LEFT This was about the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life, it was painful, I learned absolutely nothing about the story except that there were men, boats, and planes. And all of those things are portrayed in the most boring possible fashion. This is one of the biggest wastes of time and resources in film that I've ever seen. People just got up and left watching this film, ranging from pretty young to older folks. I don't blame them, wish I had done the same.
9.0~A movie that's worthy of a great war movie. justin-fencsak Sign in Permalink After Interstellar came out to mixed reaction by the public, it was time for Nolan to direct a movie based on a real life rescue operation during World War II. The movie, called Dunkirk, is about that famous rescue of englishmen from the beaches of that town in France and the liberties it took for them to survive the ordeal. If you see this in the theater, be prepared to wear some earplugs if you're hard of hearing cause this film's sound mix is loud. Not only that, but the sheer aspect of this movie combined with the action scenes might give you seizures!!! There's hardly any acting in this movie just mostly lots of action scenes involving planes, ships, and ground attacks. The music is intense, and the visual effects are practical compared with CGI. If you see one war movie this year, then make it Dunkirk.
6.0~Has its moments but definately not worth an Oscar jackjack-2 Sign in Permalink Given all the fluff about the movie, it was disappointing. It has its virtues but not enough to win any awards, It shows only a very small portion of the battle for Dunkirk and it doesn't always get it right. The battle for Dunkirk is seared in my memory. As a boy, I first heard of Dunkirk on the radio news but when I saw the newsreel footage and the photos in Life magazine, it became indelibly impressed in my memory. While a professional military and battle experienced officer stationed in Europe, I spent a weekend in Dunkirk and the surrounding countryside studying the battle. If anyone wants to really learn about what happened at Dunkirk they should watch the PBS NOVA program "Great Escape at Dunkirk." In one hour, a viewer will learn far, far more about Dunkirk than depicted in the movie and have a much better understanding. Unfortunately, the movies shortchanges the viewers by not taking a few minutes to provide the setting. Inaccurate.y, the film begins with the French and British defending against the German attack only a few hundred yards from the beach when in fact, the German lines were still 20KM from the beach on May 27 which is about when the film begins and a 1,000 KM from the beach when the British and French surrendered on June 4. The story about the Spitfire crash landing on the beach is incorrect. To begin with, the pilot gliding his plane without fuel and shooting down a German bomber is nonsense. Then he crash lands his plane on the beach and burns the plane and surrenders to the Germans. In fact, a Spitfire did land on the beach but the pilot was not taken prisoner nor was the plane burned. In fact, it was eventually recovered long after the war and restored and it is flying today. What was bothersome, is that the story starts out by focusing on a Britsih deserter and follows him through the film. That does not do justice to the real heroes of Dunkirk, the soldiers in the rear guard to fought valiantly to hold back the German advance until the rest of the Army escaped, and then surrendered and were put in German prison camps for the remainder of the war. The ending doesn't tell the story. We find the British Admiral in charge of the evacuation saying he is staying for the French. In fact,123,000 French troops were evacuated. But the story is not clear when Commander Bolton at the end says "I'm staying. For the French." But most of the French had already been evacuated so what he probably was referring to over 26,000 French soldiers that were evacuated on the last day. The story was fuzzy at times, even confusing. That was in part due to poor editing which switched back and forth and scenes often were not in chronological order. Often switching back and forth between night and day and back again. Some like that style but I found it annoying. At times the story was not told well. Apparently, the reason the story focused on the deserter is because the story of how he survived was unique. He survives a shipwreck in the movie the significance of that incident is not clear - until I saw the NOVA version. A plus for the film was its realism. The scenes were real. The dialog was real. The acting was very good. It did not get maudlin. Nothing romantic. No gore and it could easily have been gory. It is the type of movie I don't mind children watching. But not it is not a history lesson.
1.0~Idiots guide to the history of Dunkirk dilsonbelper Sign in Permalink I gave this 1/10 due to the nonsensical 10/10 reviews given by previous reviewers, who obviously either worked on the production, have never seen Casablanca, or are completely stupid. A 3/10 for CGI effort and 2/10 for bothering so a real score of 5/10. Well, What can I say to this utter pop culture nonsense, well Sorry i APOLOGISE ! to all that were involved in this real-life mess, Dunkirk was a disaster in reality and after watching Nolans attempt, I feel only more pain and humbling to the real soldiers who were trapped and left to die, by the commanding forces of the Britsh allied Armies, who sent these poor men to what was pre-warned to be a disaster. Even if we compare the recent attempt to the 1958 Leslie Norman version we see that filmmaking despite the obvious technological advances has seriously gone backwards, Teacher states could do better, and as for Nolan don't give up the day job ...Tescos that is.
1.0~Hypnotized by Sound Effect varnium Sign in Permalink The story is actually very short, but the producers extend it into a near 2-hour movie. You'll see the struggle of many people trying to leave Dunkirk with very few interactions between the characters. The acting of each character is just average. There's no real star performances. Most importantly, the essence of the story is just plain and simple. Everything is just predictable and the action scenes are just average at best. I kind of felt very sleepy from the middle of the movie. The only thing that make people give this a high rating is because they are all hypnotized by the sound effect. Google it and find out that the sound effect they used, really does have a psychological effect on its viewers. It keeps them intense throughout the entire movie. So guys, it's NOT a good movie, but a proved fantastic hypnotizing mechanism.
7.0~so so movie frank380 Sign in Permalink I was disappointed. The cinematography and action sequences were excellent but it was almost like the movie consisted of a series of vignettes which were only connected by virtue of being part of the same movie. I understand that justice cannot be done to such a monumental event in a little under 2 hours but if one were to enter the movie knowing absolutely nothing about the events in the movie and the potential impact on the world, they would not leave the movie with a greater knowledge of the events. There are many aspects of how the battle of Dunkirk was conducted. One of the major aspects was the influence London and Churchill had on the battle. This was pretty much overlooked in the movie which made it feel very disjointed.
3.0~A Spielberg, Kubrick or Stone, Nolan is not. lerxstwannabe Sign in Permalink The last truly bad WWII film I ever saw was The Thin Red Line. Dunkirk seems to want to compete for that spot, but still comes in slightly ahead. I like Nolan, I really do. Interstellar was one of my favorite movies, Inception was great and I loved his recreation of Batman. I also love WWII movies, Band of Brothers being one of the best stories ever to grace the screen, in my opinion. The entire time watching this movie, though, there was one nagging question I had: What if Spielberg directed this? Chris Nolan really isn't suited to take on a film like this. Dunkirk is a historical drama, about one of the greatest feats in WWII. This has two strikes against Nolan; one is that it's a historical drama, unlike the rest of his portfolio. The second is that WWII is, by its very nature an "R" rated period (so to speak) and Nolan seems to thrive in semi-tame PG-13 violence. "War is Hell"... yet nowhere in this movie do we ever sense that. There's a huge difference between gratuitous violence and realism, mind you and I am not promoting the former. Steven Spielberg is the master of understanding this. Some of his movies are rather violent, yet they use that to drive home the plot and atmosphere of the film. Chris Nolan really, really, desperately needs to take some notes from Spielberg in this area if he wants to be a true master of his art. The desire to stick to this catch-all, watered down PG-13 cash- cow rating, almost seems forced, considering the time period and the topic covered. Realistic "R" rating aside, the tedium of the movie sets in rather quickly. Had I not paid money to see it, and waited for its TV release, I would have changed the channel about 15 minutes in. This story sets itself up for about half of the film. It takes that long just to understand the characters, their motivations, their situations even their names. Once that's done, the movie starts to show us some promise and hopes to drops us into action, but ends up easing us down gently. Critics may commend Nolan for keeping an even momentum, not letting one part overpower the next - unfortunately it carries the momentum of a brick wall. The history of Dunkirk is a fine example of human will and strength, it just doesn't make for a gripping story. The events that this movie cover, can be summed up in about 2 pages of a text book, not an entire novel nevermind a 2 hour movie! A book editor once told me that you should always focus on telling the most interesting moment of a character's life. While the evacuation is interesting, in this movie, it seems the most interesting moments took place just before the events it covers. How did 400,000 soldiers end up getting pushed back to the sea? What battles were fought that drove them so far? What tactics failed so catastrophically? Dunkirk tells half a story, with the more interesting half taking place before the movie starts. The two hours of this movie could have easily been compressed into 1 hour, with another 2 hours telling the larger story of how the events transpired that led to this point. Acting wise it's hard to tell. Mark Rylance almost revisits his role as the Russian spy, Rudolf Able in (a much better film) Bridge of Spies. It works. His calm demeanor, yet screen presence is felt and you do make some connection with his character. Of course, that may also be because his character has one of the larger speaking roles throughout the entire film. The rest of the actors are wasted, especially Kenneth Branagh, who has proved himself, time and time again, to be an "actor's actor", but has been almost sidelined for the duration of this movie. I would recommend waiting for this film to reach a cable channel before you fork out the $12+ for a ticket if I would recommend this movie at all. As it stands, do yourself a favor and binge watch Band of Brothers in order to get a much more rewarding WWII experience.
7.0~Good movie but lacks grandiosity bill-14329 Sign in Permalink I have been transfixed with the story of Dunkirk since I was a young adult. More than a third of a million soldiers were stuck on a beach. What will happen to them? This movie tells the story in vignettes. What it is lacking is that it does not show the grandiosity of what was on the beaches. There was over a third of a million men, not a battalion or two. That is like the entire population of New Orleans being on one beach at one time. The immensity of the task at hand is what makes the real Dunkirk story so compelling. Christopher Nolan missed it. It was still a good movie, but that flaw was a disappointment.
1.0~If you have seen the Trailer, you have seen the movie. Spoiler Alert donsuereth Sign in Permalink I have anticipated the release of Dunkirk since the trailer was shown months ago. Yesterday, I finally saw it. What a disappointment! It started with a group of British soldiers walking through a town. You never find out what they are doing there. Nothing at all is told of why there are only French and British troops in Dunkirk. The troops are constantly strafed by the Germans, but only by 1 or 2 fighters at a time. I'm guessing that's all the movie budget could afford. During the real battle, the Germans stopped all attack of the troops. There is no mention of why that happened, nor is it presented adequately in the movie. The movie should have explained why the British were fighting the Germans at that time. Why Hitler let the forces be rescued. Why the Germans stopped the strafing, which by the way was a bit more than one or two Messerschmitt's at a time. There was absolutely no personal connection to any of the characters. The plot was lacking in every possibly way. When such a movie is released, those at the top usually say something like the movie was never meant to be a documentary. OK, lets say this wasn't a documentary, it still was a terrible waste of time to see.
7.0~Simple ingredients. Better movie. kbveggies Sign in Permalink What Dunkirk lacks in a complex story, it makes up for in its elegance and sophistication, as well as in its realism and engaging nature. You do not know the characters well by the end of it, but you still feel for them and hope for their survival throughout. The film interlocks three different stories beautifully, and while you know when it switches between them, it's edited very well and is not intrusive. I enjoy non-linear narratives very much, as I did in films like Pulp Fiction. The film does not feature many well-known actors, which helps keep viewers immersed in the film. It does feature Harry Styles, but I couldn't really tell it was him, and he gives a good performance so it doesn't really matter. In fact, I don't believe there were any bad performances in the film. I recommend seeing this one in the theater, it makes the experience even more worthwhile.
5.0~A little too much of the Nimrod carlquistharris Sign in Permalink I've never been in combat but I can well believe it's like this. You're all on your own surrounded by chaos and things you don't understand ( a book nerd like me is reminded of Fabrice at Waterloo ). On the other hand, you always know when a lip is about to go stiff; Nimrod steals into the soundtrack. I learned a lot about Spitfires.
2.0~The worst is the music tomberlin55 Sign in Permalink I am in minute 46 and can't wait for it to be over. Boring as boring can be. No story, no action, bad filiming. But again, the sound is the worst. I know they try to compensate a bad plot with anyoing sound, but i was only used to that in cheap tv-series and soap operas. Terrible waste of time. I think about stopping and deleting it...
4.0~Terribly overrated in my opinion galvez_patrick Sign in Permalink Lets's start by the 500 goofs right at the start of the movie, houses from the eighties , apartments from the 60's and 70's, street lamps of the 2000's , the concrete bench on the beach , the PVC windows of the buildings, the aluminum railings in the balconies of certain buildings, are you telling me that with a 100.000.000 budget they couldn't CGI those ? Enough of that, the rest of the movie is about 3 different parts of the battle, that actually fail to tie up the tale as intended, pretty much British soldiers getting their ass kicked for 2 hrs until civilian boats give them a hand, and that is even not correctly depicted, seems like 50 ships came to the rescue while in fact was between 700-800 of them, saving 300.000 soldiers, that was the true heroism of the evacuation of Dunkirk, also known as the miracle of Dunkirk Disappointing movie and a missed chance to actually show how much people are willing to sacrifice when their brothers are in need
3.0~Are you kidding? What a joke of a movie. Ripped off by the hype again. gregscott416 Sign in Permalink Ripped off by the hype again. After being completely misled and ripped off at the theater and online purchases by over hyped trash movies like the atrocious "The Great Wall" and now the dishonestly titled "Dunkirk" I felt forced to create my IMDb account to review this movie myself so to warn others of the nonsense "intellectual" hype surrounding this movie. This movie depicts cowards and Biggles like air adventures. To Nolan I say - "If you want to make a Biggles cartoon/sensitive new age pretty boy movie be inventive don't steal the true story of Dunkirk 1940". The true Dunkirk event is not depicted instead replaced with a simplistic immature nonsense fantasy. As another reviewer wrote if the Allied soldiers had acted as cowardly and undisciplined as the soldiers depicted in this movie the war would be lost forever. Thankfully for the free world the men that were at Dunkirk acted in the tough professional manner they were accustomed to not like the sulky brooding cowards depicted in this movie. If you know the real history of Dunkirk 1940 you will leave the theater furious with what Nolan has done to the memory of those that served and the professional British Servicemen. The men in the British Expeditionary Force that were evacuated from Dunkirk were experienced, highly trained career soldiers. They weren't a pack of girly 18 year old cowards running around without their rifle, pack and helmet. Be warned. And good day to you all.
1.0~Terrible, I have almost lost my hearing dnicoliniprivato Sign in Permalink Nolan is one of my favorite directors and I was waiting for this movie to come out and finally it did. For the first time in my life I had to literally escape the theater because the volume was unbelievably high. There were so many high frequency sounds that I couldn't stand listening to the soundtrack. I play in a rock band and I am used to loud sounds and yet I had to exit the cinema. It took me nearly 2 hours to fully recover. Some of the people had their hands covering the hears for most of the scenes. The movie is amazing but I think it's totally useless if you can't enjoy it. Would you still like a beautiful sunset next to a worker operating a huge drill? I will wait for the DVD to be able to lower the volume and watch the ending. I read an article where Nolan replied to similar complaints saying: "That's the way I like it". Well Chris, I hope you like this review too.
1.0~This is up there with the most disappointing movies of all time, don't believe the hype! wabbitslayer85 Sign in Permalink What a mind numbing boring excuse of a movie! I have nothing more to say than what movie did the critics see, because this was terrible, art is always the excuse when a movie has no substance!
3.0~Bad, Bad, Movie gkhege Sign in Permalink As a combat veteran and a watcher of dozens of historical based war films, I must be brutally honest. This is a boring and very slowly presented film. As all historical based films are, we already know the ending, which automatically takes away one third of our viewing interests. The film simply shows thousands of soldiers and sailors, standing on a beach or dock ,waiting to be bombed or shot at by German Aircraft. Several people in the theater got up and walked out. Based on my respect for the poor souls of the actual Dunkirk, I remained to the end. I really had to stretch my forgiveness, to give it a three.
3.0~Worst war film ever made parky_16-1 Sign in Permalink I'm getting sick of these paid reviews. I feel too defeated to even write this review. What a waste of £17. This is right up there as one of the worst war films I've ever seen. You know it's bad when multiple people in the audience shout out "That was s**t" at the end. There just isn't a story line, a beginning, middle or end. There's no point to it. It had so much potential as the picture and cinematography are so realistic. That's pretty much all it has going for it. Not to mention that Tom Hardy is in about 5 scenes and says all of about 5 words. Massive disappointment.
6.0~An epic for the small screen? ThurstonHunger Sign in Permalink My short comment here might fly in the face of others; at least from what I've read on F'book. First I liked Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, and felt its volume (and drone power) were excellent. Also in (contrarian) hindsight, I would say wait and watch this on your small screen. Of course, with headphones that is. So many scenes herein stressed a sense of claustrophobia. Shot in dogfight cockpit battles, or caught up in the hell of water-bound hulls....even aboard the mighty Minnow, er I mean, Moonstone...that's tight quarters. Big faces don't necessarily mean the big screen for me. That being said, Mark Rylance was excellent by the way, and that's not just my AARP card talking. More of his level of noble honor in the most savage of situations would be welcome in fact and fiction. Took my boys and some friends to the film, one of whom is quite the WWII "enthusiast" (well there may be a better word than that, but I remember kids like that when I was young and there is a degree of enthusiasm that strikes me in hearing them discuss authenticity and strategies.) For folks like that of any age, well you've already seen this film. For others, perhaps wait on renting after this film gets its Oscar nomination but before it fails to win Best Picture?? Also a fun fact, apparently the Germans were the enemy. (Yes I'm sure it was Nolan's intent, but I haven't read yet why, and honestly I'm not all that interested in the rationale behind his choice.)
1.0~Very Very Disappointed Pete_merritt Sign in Permalink I was so spectacularly disappointed with this film and found so many areas of its story just so badly executed. Its so sad to see how films like this create an almost placebo like effect with movie goers falling over themselves to describe them as being the most breathtaking cinematic events they have ever seen when in reality they are just simply passable. Why am I saying this? I feel that Christopher Nolan failed in an almost epic scale to show the true scale of men, machines and vessels that were on those beaches during the evacuation. At no time did It feel that there were anymore than 500 men on the beaches and this itself was so poor and ineptly executed. If this film had been made 30 years ago by a seasoned director then there would have literally been 4000 extras used to create the atmosphere and cinematography required, and yet this film just relied on some CGI of a few hundred? There were several scenes that seriously made absolutely no sense for example hundreds of men all lined up on the jetty in possession of their rifles ( 303 Lee Enfields ) and when the inevitable German Stuka bomber made its way towards them on a bombing run all of them (apart from one bloke) instead of aiming their hundreds of rifles towards the air and at least giving something back to the enemy before their fates were sealed, they all just decided to duck and hold their tin hats? It was just stupid and not a human response in conflict. There were no rudimentary light machine gun positions with Bren guns to provide any form of token anti-aircraft screen and it was just really really poor. Im not looking for the film to be some gung ho war film but it deserved to be realistic and it wasn't. Kenneth Brannaghs role in the film felt was under whelming and just didn't work. I found his acting his usual one dimensional self when playing an historical British figure although the one he played in this was just a fictional character. Again Nolan invented parts of the story as at no point did any Sea Lord or Admiral set foot on the beaches to either orchestrate or pass on instructions or messages, this again showed just how weak the story-telling was. I found the idea that there were only three Spitfires available on that given day just stupid and again resembled nothing like what actually happened. The way the story jumped around and Cillian Murphys slight back story ( one scene from when he was picked up ) was again poorly handled and just didn't work. Again the director spectacularly failed to impress upon us the true scale of what it was like to be there and also at the end the actual number of small crafts that were involved. The scene where Mark Rylance looks across the horizon at a gaggle of no more than 30 boats was just totally underwhelming. The scenes where the soldiers go onto the beached trawler was quite frankly non-sensical, were the British soldiers practicing their marksmanship and if so why??? Bearing in mind the last thing any troops who had just been in combat for the past few weeks would be needing to do whilst sat on a beach waiting for rescue was to worry about re-zeroing their weapons?? Or was it the advancing Germans? Again why would German troops be looking at practicing their marksmanship skills when they were already in contact and about to re-engage with the enemy? The whole trawler thing was just so inept especially when the troops only decided to get out of it when it was literally submerged? For anyone who even in passing studied the Dunkirk evacuation this film was an utter mess but even worse it really failed to honour the story and the lives of those involved. There is a terrible lack of talent in film making these days, people don't dare question such films and like sheep just follow the hype....
1.0~Its official. Movies are no longer about telling a story. mk1705 Sign in Permalink While I found this movie visually great, it really has no story. It is a typical survival-story seen a thousand times before. No story + no interesting characters = boring. And only the visual is not enough (for me). People who are rating this movie with 10 stars, are either been dumbed down by studios in the last 20 yrs ... or the reviews have been bought by the studios for marketing reasons. It seems to me like Nolan wants to be a 'serious' film director now, and wants to get noticed by the academy. The superficial heroism of military and war by all these movies are really annoying and stupid. Seemed like Nolan got inspired by Mel Gibson, here. Good for Tom Hardy tough. I also would like to get a few million Dollars for watching left and right. Im disappointed on so many levels.
10.0~Breathtaking danijelamaritini Sign in Permalink The time spent in the cinema flew by in a second. I really did not expect much, and honestly went to see the movie because I wanted to learn more about that event. But....as I said, it was breathtaking. The event itself is horrible and shocking....but the way Nolan saw it gave me chills. The camera, the sounds, music, great performance from actors...and not made in the shape of Hollywood blockbuster is the reason why I recommend it to all who want to see a great movie.
8.0~I'm sure it'll win prizes. Only "Film of the year" would be a bit far fetched. peterp-450-298716 Sign in Permalink "Wars are not won by evacuation." I'm sure there are already as many reviews about Christopher Nolan's last movie about the battle of Dunkirk, as there were British soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk waiting for their evacuation. An awful lot. Although it wasn't a battle in the strict sense of the word, but rather a massive logistical operation to get the English army back on British soil. Whether this operation had any influence on the course of the 2nd WO, is something for military strategists and analysts to determine. In my opinion, there was an incomprehensible blunder made by the German commanders. Fortunately, because sauerkraut isn't really my favorite dish. It's not a chapter in this terrible world war, with heroic battles taking place. A bold choice, but nevertheless, it was a breathtaking spectacle. To call it "Film of the Year" is a bridge too far (you can call that flick a masterpiece). But Nolan succeeded in creating an energetic and exciting film that intertwines three different story lines in a non-chronological way. Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) is the key figure who must save his own skin from the beginning on, so he won't be mowed down by German bullets. It seemed like the only thing he did the whole movie was surviving one life-threatening situation after the other. Then there's Farrier (Tom Hardy), one of three Spitfire pilots who try to safeguard the crossing of their troops and hunt down fierce German fighter planes and bombers which are trying to sink as many ships as possible. And finally there's Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) who's crossing the canal in a simple yacht together with his sons Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan) to help with the rescue of soldiers. In this way Nolan incorporates three different chapters, each taking place in another territory. By land, at sea and in the air. The very first thing you'll notice is the largely wordless acting. Particularly Tommy whose lips seem to be sealed almost throughout the complete movie. It is as if in this war every conversation seems useless and body language speaks volumes. The majority of dialogues are at the expense of pilots and commanders. Unfortunately, the conversation between Spitfire pilots is sometimes unclear and restricted to indistinct mumbling. Partly due to deafening noise effects (and when you are watching this movie in a Slovenian cinema where it's hard to read the subtitles as well, this is a slight disadvantage). And that brings us to the soundtrack. It's omnipresent and, in my opinion, of decisive importance. Hans Zimmer's music seems to be constantly present and bolsters the entire film. At moments unobtrusive in the background after which it swells out into a climax. Let's say that this is the very first time the musical setting demands my attention and impresses me. The same goes for the deafening noise effects, which sometimes make it seem like you're in the midst of the war. The down diving Stuka's and the deadly cargo they drop on the beach with that terrifying, screaming noise. Sometimes I had the urge to crawl deeper into my chair. The way everything is portrayed is also phenomenal. The dogfights are in my eyes the highlights in this impressive film. The vast shots of the beach where thousands of Allies are crammed as sardines in a barrel. You can feel the threat of dead. The claustrophobic and precarious situations that'll make you feel as if you're trapped yourself. The despair flows off the screen. Thousands of Allies can, as it were, practically see their safe home but they realize that getting there is an impossible matter. This is, just like "Saving Private Ryan", an epic war story. Only the first one was more brutal and showed the horror of WWII in a terrible way. That's why I still can picture some scenes from this Spielberg spectacle. I'm afraid that won't be the case when it comes to "Dunkirk". The fact that it was a defeat that led to a victory afterwards is an indisputably fact. And yet, I had this "that's-it?" feeling afterwards. Without a doubt, it was a traumatic experience for the thousands of Allies, but the compulsory cheering moment as apotheosis was a bit too predictable. And I'm still wondering why Farrier made that decision in the end. As reasoned as his previous actions were, so stupid I found this final decision. Obviously, "Dunkirk" will win prizes at the major film festivals, but I'm afraid the main prizes will be awarded to others. I hope they'll release films the next six months that deserve the title "Film of the Year". More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc
5.0~Put Down the Kool-Aid Better_Sith_Than_Sorry Sign in Permalink Given the outright gushing of critics in praising this film, I was quite surprised to discover Dunkirk to be not only not deserving of such praise, but even worse, to be a cacophony of minimalist nonsense, topped off by one of the most ridiculous film climaxes in recent memory (more on that later). "Possibly the best war film of all time?" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin... First I do not understand where the $150 million budget was spent. The actual story of the Dunkirk evacuation involved - literally - hundreds of thousands of men, and hundreds of boats and planes. In this film, we see....a few hundred men? 30 boats? Something like six planes? Where is the grand scale that a story like Dunkirk deserves, or really, demands? There was no grand scale. That is a heinous omission and oversight and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told. And if you don't want to use CGI to achieve that scale, that's fine, but then either expand the real numbers of extras and props so it replicates what Dunkirk was actually like, or, don't do the film. A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. Ludicrous. Similarly, we see a few boats here and there, and a few planes. This does not come close to approximating the flotilla of ships, boats and other watercraft used - in reality over 800. It's hard to appreciate what a tremendous achievement the Dunkirk evacuation was - ultimately, the aim of this film I suspect - when we never actually see that achievement occur. We see a few boats and few planes. Literally a drop in the bucket of what Dunkirk was. Yet at the conclusion, as the men are disembarking, back safe in England, we are supposed to be swept up in a swelling feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very bizarre. The soundtrack, if you can call it that, was an escalating collection of random and intrusive blaring instruments that can be best described as 'noise.' I have no idea what the goal was there. Perhaps it was an attempt to convey what one might feel, the intense experience one might have, if he or she was in a war-time situation like this. Perhaps. A professional critic called it 'bombastic' and that's probably being generous. I am not lying when I tell you I had to take an Advil when I got back from the theater, thanks to the crazily escalating noise that overwhelms the latter part of the film. Yikes. As for the climax, the scene of a Spitfire seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is bereft of all logic, and was such an eye-rolling piece of nonsense, no amount of criticism on my part can do it justice. Let's just say planes cannot keep flying indefinitely, much less maneuver and successfully engage other aircraft, when that plane has run out of fuel. The film deserves to be panned for this ridiculous scene alone. This is not a great war film, it's not even a good war film. It is not typical or traditional story-telling, I will give it that. There are stretches of this film that lack dialogue and there is zero character development. While different, that's hardly unique (it's been done before). Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not. Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, "Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix." True that, bro. 5/10.
9.0~Visually Stunning david-sarkies Sign in Permalink Well, Nolan has certainly left his mark on modern cinema, and in a way what he seems to have done is merged independent cinema with that of the big blockbuster. The reason that I mention this is because at times this film actually felt as if it was more of an art house production that anything else, particularly when the hero, who doesn't seem to have a name, emerges onto the beach to see lines and lines of soldiers standing there waiting to be picked up, and then looking for a way in which to cut to the front of the lines. The other thing is that the dialogue is quite minimal – it seems as if he is simply letting the visuals tell us the story than anything else. To say that this film has been heavily promoted is an understatement – it's as if the producers and the film company are going out of their way to make this film the film of 2017, and are probably also angling for an academy award, but then again most serious film makers have that as a goal, even though it tends to be much more political that actually having any real merit for creative, artistic, and acting ability. Yet this film is incredible in the way that it just drags you into the action and the desperation that the British troops must have felt while standing on that beach with the Germans closing in on them. I'm sure we all know about Dunkirk, and if you don't then all I can say is 'Google it'. However, the film is constructed through three intervening time lines. At first it seems a little confusing, particularly since in one part it seems to be day, but they then cut to another scene and it is night. However it then clicked that at the beginning of the film, when he is introducing the three stories – that of the soldier's on the beach, the boats crossing the channel, and the two planes flying over, that the times are different. This is one of Nolan's specialities, that he is able to merge three different times into a single thread, and then have them all come together. At first we see things that appear to be disconnected but as the film progresses it suddenly all starts to make sense. In a way what we have here is a memorial to the battle, or more so the evacuation, that helped Britian and the allies win the war, even though it was only in its initial stages. The evacuation of three-hundred thousand troops, while under fire, using only small boats, is something to be remembered. The thing is that the Russians attempted a similar thing at Kerch when the Germans invaded the Crimea, and they failed, but then I guess the Germans had learned from Dunkirk by that time. In a way it is about how a whole nation came together to work together to fight off a common enemy. There are a couple of things to note though, because despite all of this we are still confronted with the selfishness of some of the soldiers, who are attempting to spare their own lives, and in doing so we note that innocent people die. However, despite these lone wolves, for want of a better word, the operation was still a success. The other thing that Nolan draws out is the feeling of hopelessness and betrayal that the soldier's felt – they had lost the battle and it seemed like the war, however when they finally arrived home they came home to a heroes welcome. It was in fact quite a moving part of the film. However, it seemed that despite everything, I was a little surprised to find that there were so few planes in the air – I thought maybe there would be much, much more over Dunkirk at the time, but then again that was a minor issue with an otherwise outstanding film.
10.0~Worthy Every minute of your time irraju Sign in Permalink Story telling: This movie is one original and unique experiment on how best an ordinary story can be told in a very very intriguing non linear way. It is the same known story from the history books, told from three different points of view, spread across three different time duration, moving at a three different paces on three different elements , intervening with other time lines finally converging to one breathtaking climax. First is from the POV of the soldiers, on the ground, spread across a week, gloomy dull sky, with constant fear on their faces. Second is from the POV of the civilians with boats, on the water, spread across a day, with sacrifice for home as the emotion. Third is from the POV of the royal air force, in the air , spread across an hour, blue sky and bravery against all odds. All the major incidents in the story line are shown from all three perspectives and edited in such a brilliant way that one has to put their brains to work on to know if they have already seen that from a different perspective. Every time, something is assumed, Nolan comes back with a surprise in a different time line only to remind you that this is his movie! How is it different? It is not a conventional story. It does not start with an innocent young lad, volunteering, bidding adieu to worried family and loved ones, fighting in the combat zone, coming back victorious with head held high to the fluttering flag. Its not about damn characters and there are none(spoiler: there is no Batman and Robin too). Its just about the war. Its just about the action. No god damn lines to put on your bedroom posters. Overall - worthy of the money you spend on expensive ticket at IMAX with Dolby Atmos surround sound. Only boring part is when they paused in the middle to sell popcorn.
2.0~Mind-numbing, repetitive and pointless HenryBaker Sign in Permalink My wife and I left about 80 minutes into the movie. The first 10 minutes shows a pair of soldiers trying to get off the beach on to a boat to England by any way possible, fair or foul. It shows planes flying in formation, breaking off formation, a pilot's eye view of a hard turn, a close up of the pilot, and some gunfire from a plane. It shows the goings-on aboard a small civilian boat heading to Dunkirk to rescue trapped soldiers. It shows a military boat sinking from a bomb or a torpedo, men jumping overboard, and others struggling not to drown. The next ten minutes shows the same thing, as does the next ten minutes, the ten minutes after that, and ... you get the idea. After about our fourth round of "we've seen this already, and this is going nowhere", we left. The "trapped underwater" scenes are very disturbing even if deaths are avoided or not shown. The beach, sea and aerial scenes are on different timelines that I assume converge at the end, but it can be very disorienting to jump from day to night and back again between scenes not knowing where the three timelines are relative to one another. There were a few instances of coming into a scene knowing exactly what was about to happen because you had already seen it on another timeline. I've seen 60-second commercials with more dialog and character development than this movie had 80 minutes in. What a waste of time and money.
6.0~Interesting approach but hard to sit through kluseba Sign in Permalink Dunkirk was a disappointment and is easily Christopher Nolan's weakest movie to date. There were many issues I had with that movie: confusing overlapping story lines, exchangeable characters without any depth, mostly faceless acting performances, a constantly numbing, overtly dramatic and repetitive soundtrack and lots of headache-inducing shaky camera passages, even in parts of the movie when nobody is getting attacked. Those who call this movie one of the greatest war movies of all times clearly haven't watched many films of that kind. Over the past twenty years, films such as Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War, My Way and Battle for Incheon: Operation Chromite all had intriguing characters, gripping tension, memorable scenes, moving soundtracks and spectacular special effects. Before you voice your opinion about Dunkirk or any of its reviews, you should be familiar with movies like these. However, there were still a few elements that I liked about Dunkirk that made the movie entertaining and overall slightly above average. First of all, the storytelling is an interesting experiment, as it follows the Dunkirk evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea and air. The land perspective is the most gripping one and follows the epic odyssey of a young British Private. The sea perspective has its strengths when a tragic accident happens on the boat of a courageous civilian who wants to support the Royal Navy but the characters could have been a little bit more fleshed out. The air perspective is the weakest one in my book despite an epic finale because the fight sequences always exactly look the same and it's at times hard to follow what happened to whose plane. A strong element of the movie is its historic accuracy despite a few fictionalized characters here and there. The settings look authentic and especially the uniforms and planes look realistic. It must also be added that stories about the war shall not be forgotten as history tends to repeat itself and as it's important to honour those who fought for the freedom of the future generations. In the end, Dunkirk has its merits and doesn't go the easy way with heroic characters, stunning special effects and traditional plots. However, the numerous overlapping plots are at times confusing, the characters are mostly redundant and the omnipresent score doesn't add to the movie as it was intended by the makers. If you are interested in the Second World War and have watched numerous war movies already, you might be interested in giving Dunkirk a shot as well. However, if you are less familiar with war movies, you might easily get bored with this film and should watch the movies I have mentioned in my introduction first.
4.0~okay film landa803 Sign in Permalink A bit boring. Acting was pretty good and the music was nice. Although the movie as a whole just dragged and not much really happened throughout the entirety of the movie. Not Christopher Nolans best movie and it seems it's been hyped up quite a lot but the critics and viewers alike. No doubt the majority of those giving this film flawless scores and praise are British people, whom are the main focus of this movie. Don't listen to the hype. It's not a bad movie but in no way is it fantastic as many Brits are making it out to be. ZZzzz..
2.0~Boring ducon4 Sign in Permalink Boring. People boarding boats and drowning for 106 min. On top of that the sound is awful and irritating. I don't know what Nolan did but the movie is too loud and the effects sound totally fake. There is no character development, it is just the beach, boats and the sea. Very disappointed.
3.0~Boring, confusing, only vaguely historical, couldn't wait for it to be over. kdthawkins Sign in Permalink I so looked forward to seeing this film and was disappointed. The acting was great but the confusing time line and holes in unrealistic story line were terrible and the background synthetic New age noise was depressing and boring. If I were British or French I would be offended at the portrayal of my countryman as pathetic and cowardly. This was the worst war movie with none of the emotions of a war movie about a real event with real heroes. Don't waste your money on this movie.
10.0~A near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of wartime chaos MrDHWong Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a war film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige). Based on the real-life Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, the film further proves that Nolan is one of the best living directors and cements his legacy as a brilliant, unique filmmaker. In 1940, over 400,000 allied British and French troops stationed on the beaches of Dunkirk in France find themselves surrounded by German troops. With the enemy closing in fast, the allied troops desperately try to find ways to escape across the English Channel to the safety of the British mainland. Despite its limited dialogue, the film offers a near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of the wartime chaos. Not since Saving Private Ryan has a film so effectively pulled this off. The unnaturally loud and piercing sound of bullets and gunfire evoke feelings of fear and panic in the viewer, giving off the impression that they too are on the battlefield. The audience is given real sense of a race against time (time being a recurring theme in several Christopher Nolan's films) thanks in part to Hans Zimmer's fantastic, yet, minimalist score. There's not a single moment in this film that does not elicit suspense or tension in the viewer. Christopher Nolan's creative use of cinematography perfectly showcases the desperation of the soldiers in their need to escape. Overall, I consider Dunkirk not only among the director's all time best films, but one of the best war films period. I rate it a very high 9.5/10
2.0~Save yourself the time: Just watch the trailer. elsephen Sign in Permalink *Please understand my rating is to compensate for the absurd amount of high ratings this film has gotten based on what I suppose is mere hype and anticipation. Because nothing in the film is more interesting than a silent WWII Documentary. I'm a huge fan of Nolan's work. I was excited to see his latest in Dunkirk. It may be the worst film he's made. And I think- if you place any director with half the notoriety on the bill... this movie gets a 7.0 rating at best. But. With Nolan's name attached, people decide it's a masterpiece before viewing it- and they wouldn't change their opinion after. There's no story. There's no character worth noting or caring about. There's no way to know what exactly is happening in many of the scenes due to the choppy editing... and every character seeming to be from the same clone-machine. (seriously- how many dark-haired guys with the same haircut can you squeeze into a single casting?) It's monotone, it's repetitive, it's essentially the same scene for 2 hours... and that'd be fine if something notable happens- but it never does. There's never a moment where you care. Never a moment that hits you in the form of empathy, suspense, etc. It's essentially like Nolan wanted to play with a few boats, planes, and do it at the beach... and he filmed it. It's been a long time since I've ever looked away from a screen and twiddled my thumbs wondering if something was going to happen or if it would just end if not... but I caught myself looking around the theater often. If I had a watch, I would have checked it. Spoilers: About the only notable moment that SHOULD draw some sort of reaction from audience members, is an extremely odd scuffle on board where a boy falls what looks to be 5ft to the floor below... and somehow loses his eyesight, somehow seems on his deathbed, and then dies... None of it makes sense, and the execution seems lazy and forced at the same time. The dad doesn't care. The guy responsible doesn't really care. The brother seems to care... for about 10 seconds. This part could have been cut from the film completely and wouldn't change anything. Much like a lot of the film. The film is essentially the trailer... over... and over.... and over again. Even Hans Zimmer, who is usually brilliant, completely misses the mark on this one. He's trying to force suspenseful sounds and noise where the film simply doesn't match up with action. How do you show the harshness of war while basically showing no one in pain? The closest thing we get to that is a few people drowning- but is flooding the real nightmare of war? You'd think so. It's truly the only fearful antagonist in this film. Water. And how many times can we watch soldiers stacked in bundles stare up at the sky, seemingly as bored as I was watching them, only to have a few water-balloon efficient bombs fall around them? The editing was all over the place. Continuity issues everywhere. Daylight one second- dawn the next, back to daylight... the cuts would randomly shift to another area of soldiers that look exactly like the previous... sometimes in repeat scenes (which wasn't consistent enough to read), sometimes in time shifts... and none of it is really justified other than Nolan stroking himself to the millions he suckered everyone for here. Possibly the most boring film I've seen in years. Incredibly disappointing effort by Nolan. OH! Positive: It's pretty. For about 30 minutes. Then you're pretty tired of watching the monotone screensaver'esque takes that never seem to vary, with no contrast.
8.0~Wars do not win by evacuation, but in this very salvation there is a victory © Dunkirk BiiivAL Sign in Permalink A talented boy named Christopher was not indifferent to cinema since childhood. His first "home-movie" he tried to shoot, barely ten years old, armed with his father's 8-millimeter camera. The main roles in the first "movies" of a small fan of the "Star Wars" were played by the toy soldiers donated by the father (unfortunately, the permanent companion of Christopher's film career, Michael Kane, at that time was "intercepted" by Richard Attenborough for filming in another war movie). Almost 30 years of persistent directorial work. 9 full-length films, each of which is not familiar with the rental fiasco. Total fees of more than $ 4 billion for all work and a "loud" name. In the age of glory sin can not remember youth? And so, in the jubilee project, "Dunkirk" - Christopher Nolan returns to his first "director's" experience - military history. Only "soldiers" this time - not a toy. Taking your favorite 70-millimeter film, a lot of natural scenery (minimum digital recording and green screens, gentlemen, only old school), loyal comrades (Zimmer, Van Hiteim, Crowley, Smith), and got several working "Spitfires" and "Messerschmitt", Christopher says: "I want to shoot a visually beautiful movie." And in Dunkirk he did it in his corporate style - with the inherent color effects a la "The Dark Knight", the epic scenes of air battles, the sinking of ships and the endless "bombing" that look no less qualitative than the fall of Cooper in Gargantua or a scene with a wave in Interstellar. But this was clearly not enough. And Christopher Nolan proclaimed: "More realism!". Operator Hoyte Van Hoytem should not be repeated twice. He unhooked a 100-kilogram IMAX 3D camera from a suspended tripod and, in an old-fashioned way, took off all the "ground" scenes from his shoulder. Voila, "Dunkirk" becomes the first film where IMAX shooting was done "by hand" - the work received a lot of realistic scenes from the face of desperate British troops, filled with panic, Nolan confirmed the title of "experimental film-maker", and Van Hoite moderately missed the gym . Ideally. "Dunkirk" is a screen reproduction of the famous in the history of Great Britain operation "Dynamo". In 1940, nearly 400,000 discouraged allies (mostly British) were pushed back by the German army to the small French port city of Dunkirk, on the English Channel. In conditions of total economy of military resources, involving civil courts, Great Britain begins the largest rescue operation. Christopher Nolan offers us his vision of these events and gives us a chance to look at them from three angles. Firstly, from the air - on behalf of the pilots of the Royal Air Force, at all times seeking through the strait to help their associates. Secondly, from the sea - on behalf of the crew of a small civilian ship, which is also sent to Dunkirk to assist in the evacuation of the British corps. And, thirdly, on behalf of desperate soldiers, who are eager to survive and get home, at any cost. Christopher Nolan, in spite of his fears, was inspired not by the Spielberg story of the salvation of Private Ryan and not even by Stoun's "Platoon", but (!) "Nonstop action" - "Speed" and "Unmanaged." The genre of "Dunkirk" smoothly balances between the "vigorous" thriller and worthy "war-movie", and the suspense - just off scale. In addition, the director immerses us in a non-linear narrative, saturated with flashbacks and endless action in the spirit of the film "Remember." We can observe the picture of the bombing of the shore from the land, and in a few minutes - the same scene, but already from the fuselage of the Spitfire. A few words about music. Oh, the seventh was scorching. Hans Zimmer, are you human? From the very first minutes, the soundtrack began, which did not end at all until the final credits, alternating only its tempo. Due to this, "Dunkirk" looks in one breath, in the truest sense of the word. I do not want to go into a detailed description of the impressions - I just wait for Zimmer's music to be called the classics of the 21st century. But fans of the deep "Nolan" story are waiting for the sad news. In "Dunkirk" the director, not wishing to go beyond the historical framework, relied on reliability and coverage. There is a minimum of metaphoricality, a minimum of a unique fantasy, a minimum of understatement with respect to the plot and a maximum of understatement with respect to the characters. Calling the main character (Finn Whitehead) by the name "Tommy" (if we collectively called the Germans "Fritzes", the Germans generally called the British "Tommies"), Nolan seems to seek to "generalize" and project on his fate and feelings the experiences of all who was in this situation - to create the effect of an impersonal mass. All this reminded me madly Remarque and his "On the Western Front without Change" - a real war, without "superheroes" (and was it not for this that the "eminent" cast was slightly overshadowed?), Impregnated with despair, a thirst for survival and whistling bullets from an invisible enemy. Caesar could simultaneously read one text and dictate another. Walter White - at the same time teach chemistry and "cook meth." Well, and Christopher Nolan damn well knows how to combine the position of a talented screenwriter and an unrivaled director. And, perhaps, he once again proved it. "Dunkirk" is the tenth, anniversary work of Christopher Nolan. "Powerful" historical film with an invigorating suspense and dizzying visualization. A minimum of digital effects, a maximum of material props and "cardboard" decorations - a balm for the soul for all fans of the "old school" of cinema. Unfortunately (or not), the "genius" of the play played to the detriment of the "uniqueness" of the script - the fans of "Beginning", "Prestige" and "Interstellar" will definitely wait for some disappointment. In all other respects, the signature handwriting of the master of a large-scale movie is felt in every minute of the time-keeping. You will like this movie, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured. Enjoy watching!
10.0~Mr. Nolan? Thank You! boatsfra Sign in Permalink Dunkirk. I have never heard of the events of those fateful days during WWII. Thank you Mr. Nolan for bringing this incredible human story to life. And you pulled it off by peeling back the fluff most movies have nowadays to keep us focused. No obvious special effects (if there were, I didn't catch them), no over-the-top explosions or a silly love story to pull our heart strings. No, you managed to keep me enthralled for 106 minutes by keeping things simple, and transporting me to the Port of Dunkirk. In your typical style, you did get me to the edge of my seat. I genuinely, on an emotional level, felt what our protagonists were going through. I was cold, thirsty and feared for my life every time I heard those engines. Thank you Mr. Nolan, for showing me that heroes have always existed, there is hope for humanity, and good will always conquer evil.
4.0~A Different Kind of War Movie hdoscripts Sign in Permalink Dunkirk starts out with a bang, but goes downhill very quickly. It's confusing for a while trying to figure out who every one is and you really find yourself not caring about any of them. One reason it's confusing at first is due to it not being filmed chronologically; but honestly, after a little while, that is one of the unique and saving parts of the film. The movie follows three separate sets of people with different missions, but the same goal. The unique part is, that they show several of the scenes from all three points of view. Overall, it's OK at best, but nothing to get excited about.
9.0~Tight and rich cinematic experience rgsfilmmaker Sign in Permalink If I look at it in story perspective may not be the best of Nolan's filmography. There are other movies like Inception and Dark Knight series. If I look at it in war films - it is not the best of war films. Still I prefer other movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now and others. Dunkirk is a cinema that needs to be experienced like your have never before. Spectacular Sound Design, Amazing music by Hans Zimmer (I am his fan for Inception's Time Soundtrack), Tom Hardy's brilliance that you can see in his eyes, you can't see editing - that's how good Lee Smith is.. that's what I experienced watching Dunkirk. Less duration with rich visuals is a huge advantage to keep the audience hooked till the last shot. But still I am moving towards the sound of this film. Right from the time you hear the first gun shot - till the end of the movie it's mainly based on sound design. Comes down to one thing - brilliant screenplay by Christopher Nolan.
2.0~Boring war movie martinsplads Sign in Permalink I am falling a sleep. This movie is so boring. I cant belive that a movie with this High budget Can be so bad. So just skip is not worth any off your time, its just trash not Worth watching at all.
10.0~A Visual Masterpiece with a Timely Topic about British Pride rannynm Sign in Permalink Dunkirk offers the most intense, beach set cinematic experience since the iconic film Jaws. In this new adaptation of such a strong battle, Christopher Nolan's talent as director and writer shines through, creating a visual masterpiece that leaves you mesmerized. The battle of Dunkirk was a short one, May 26 to June 4, 1940. Despite its minimal timeframe, it was deadly. WWII Allied soldiers were hiding, surrounded on all sides by the German Army and had to be evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, by way of an operation famously known as Operation Dynamo. On the ground, British Army Privates Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and Alex (Harry Styles) are two of the men desperately fighting and struggling to remain alive and safely evacuate the beach, by whatever means available. Across the ocean, local sailors Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Toms Carney) had been recruited by the Navy to help with the evacuation. From yet another perspective, members of the Royal Air Force including Farrier (Tom Hardy) attempt to shoot down the German bombers, in order to help the stranded troops evacuate the beach and ocean safely. Let's talk about the production of the film. The cinematography, as expected from talented director and writer Christopher Nolan, is groundbreaking. Congratulations to Hoyte van Hoyterman for creating a visual masterpiece. Everything looks incredibly realistic and breathtaking, keeping you on your toes throughout the film. The scene that is the most memorable to me, is when one of the Air Force pilots soar through the sunset sky as the troops cheer in victory. I assure you that it will give you goosebumps and make you teary-eyed. The sound effects and the music by Hans Zimmer make the movie that much more tangible. The bombing begins from the very start of the film, preparing you for an emotional roller-coaster. They are so loud that it sounds as if they're coming from the back of the theater. If you listen closely, there's a ticking clock throughout the entire film, (minus the ending, which I will keep under wraps for you to discover) hidden within each song, creating increased tension and suspense. By the end of the film, I was already down to the nub of my fingertips, so prepare to be antsy! Harry Styles' performance is quite impressive, particularly since he is a known as a singer, not an actor. It is refreshing to see his excellent performance her, as he is the one with the most lines and delivers them eloquently, equal to an experienced actor. Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy also delivered remarkable performances. Dunkirk relies heavily on emotions since it barely has any dialogue, so it is important to have the story delivered by the visuals and the acting, which they achieved flawlessly. Dunkirk is rated PG-13 for intense war experiences and some language. Because of the stunning cinematography and story line, I rate Dunkirk 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Go check it out, whether you are a history buff or not, this film will remind you how history affects us. Reviewed by Michelle C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.
5.0~Standard action scenes predominate over character development as Nolan views rescue at Dunkirk as more tragic than uplifting Turfseer Sign in Permalink I haven't seen the original "Dunkirk" film which came out in 1958, but of what I know of that plot the main focus is on a British troop's battle against the Germans before they arrive at Dunkirk, with the rescue at the beach as the stirring climax. Christopher Nolan rejected that whole approach and decided that all the action should be centered around the events that occurred at Dunkirk proper—hence, we never see one German during the entire film. I am forced to argue that Nolan's approach is wrong-headed and despite his signature visual acumen, Dunkirk (2017) ultimately lacks punch. What happened at Dunkirk simply doesn't lend itself to much drama. Since the British were stranded on the beach and were unable to take any pro-active steps against the encroaching enemy, they basically played the role of "sitting ducks" until their miracle deliverance. Nolan's best scenes involve the British troops, unable to take cover on the beach, or lined up like sardines on the "mole" as they're unmercifully cut down by Luftwaffe pilots. The sense of fear is truly palpable as the defenseless men have nowhere to go. It's the attendant fear, masterfully conveyed by Nolan, that grips us in the early part of the picture. But soon the scenes of dive bombing destruction give way to more conventional war action tropes, involving the sinking of various boats (the scenes of drowning victims are reminiscent of scenes from Titanic). In the middle of the action is one of the protagonists, Tommy, a British private, who survives two sinkings of boats intended to ferry the soldiers across the Channel—one boat is destroyed from the air and the other torpedoed. Soon Nolan has Tommy along with a number of his confederates hook up with some Scottish soldiers who find a grounded fishing trawler in what I'm told (by Wikipedia) is the "intertidal zone outside of the Allied perimeter." Would soldiers have actually left the perimeter and put themselves at risk, with the unlikely hope of being able to get the trawler to float? And where do those unseen Germans come from who end up taking target practice? Somehow the soldiers inside the trawler miraculously escape being killed by machine gun fire. The trawler sinks too but not before Gibson, a French soldier masquerading as British, gets tangled in some chains inside the trawler, and drowns. Nolan is determined to continually reiterate his "wall is hell" theme and serves up one additional destruction of a boat—this time Tommy and fellow soldier Alex surviving the destruction of a minesweeper —only to be rescued by a pleasure craft manned by its civilian captain Davidson, along with his teenage son Peter, and Peter's friend, George. Davidson's saga forms the second in a triptych of stories, this time focusing on one of the hundreds of pleasure crafts conscripted by the British to sail across the Channel and save the beleaguered troops. In this tale, Davidson picks up a shell-shocked RAF pilot who's just been shot down by the Germans and wouldn't you know it, he can't handle the idea that they're headed right back into harm's way at the beaches of Dunkirk. Basically the pilot freaks out, hits poor George in the head while Davidson and son are trying to calm him down, and the poor kid sustains a severe head injury and ends up (as later reported in the local press) a "casualty of war." All of this unlikely turn of events seems rather heavy-handed or forced if you will, but Nolan is determined again to remind us that Dunkirk was more tragic than something to celebrate about. The third story is told from the perspective of three RAF pilots who do battle with their Luftwaffe counterparts out above the open sea. It's noteworthy that the action takes place far from where the troops are stranded, none of whom who are able to appreciate the sacrifices the pilots make. (Since the pilots couldn't be in all places at once, they were unable to stop some of the dive bombers responsible for the all the carnage we see at the beginning of the film.) Hence, a familiar query was sounded after the battle with the troops asking the pilots, "where were you?" Nolan's attention to detail is evident in the battle scenes in the air. But after a while, it feels a bit perfunctory and one longs for some character development in place of one plane being shot down after another. Nolan continues to commit himself to a non-glamorous view of war—when the last pilot runs out of fuel and sets his plane down—he ends up burning it so it won't fall into the hands of the enemy. And the pilot ultimately is taken prisoner (again no heroics). In addition to lack of character development, Dunkirk suffers from the lack of a visible antagonist. Instead of the Germans, war itself becomes the antagonist and the film becomes more a generic anti-war film than a film rooted in history. If there were real heroes here, Nolan ignores them. Those would be the French troops who fought the Germans inland, to give the British time to put their rescue mission into action. If you like seeing ships being bombed or torpedoed, scenes of men drowning, the unlikely death of a civilian at the hands of a shell-shocked soldier as well as a series of somewhat repetitious aerial battles, all presented on a non-linear time line, Dunkirk might be for you. Ultimately I understand what Nolan is driving at—that in the larger context, the rescue at Dunkirk was still part of the overall tragedy of war. All well and good but the tragedy is conveyed through a series of standard war scenes without character development, so necessary for compelling drama.
1.0~Boring rob-lentini Sign in Permalink This movie is supposed to be a masterpiece, I had high expectations. Half way in and I was bored out of my mind. It's hard to follow and there are no real characters that engage you. What a stinker.
3.0~Disjointed and Fragmented bcooknycnj Sign in Permalink Disappointing. After seeing it recently, I am surprised by all the positive reviews for 'Dunkirk'. A Major Historical event but the film did not build a coherent plot around it . Poor story-telling. In an early scene, soldiers are fired upon, but who are they and who is shooting at them? Is it 'friendly fire'? It is unclear. And, where are the enemy ground forces, how close are they to Dunkirk, are the enemy armies advancing or standing still? We are not shown that. Also, I expected some portrayal of the reaction by the British command in London. How was the leadership deaing with the very possible loss of 300,000 soldiers, (and of the war!). Nope, not portrayed. And I don't recall seeing any of Dunkirk's civilian population in this drama, surely they must have had concerns that could have been demonstrated. Or did Dunkirk's civilians manage to flee earlier? What of the men, women and children who lived there? Surely that is part of the story. An artistic, creative film that derives its substance from a real event needs to have respect for historical accuracy & background. And for the interest of the audience in such context. Otherwise, just make a totally fictional movie & call it 'Donburp', 'Seatown Retreat' or something else. The music was loud, mediocre and somewhat annoying. The photography was good but the enduring images are of lines of fully uniformed soldiers standing knee deep in the sea (Engish Channel) waiting for their ships to come in. (I hope the extras were paid well; It has been reported that the film had at least $100+ million financing). Dunkirk is the story of a crisis that had, incredibly, an unexpected positive outcome. It deserved better treatment.
5.0~If you watched the trailer, there is nothing much more to offer except the IMAX coverage asb_deutsch Sign in Permalink I got disappointed while watching Dunkirk as it is more or less like a tick-tock version of Saving Private Ryan. The background score is so much emphasized that you can barely hear the dialogues between the characters. I recall that there was a similar problem in Inception where the old Japanese's dialogue was in a mutely tone. The surprising thing also is that there is any hardly any character development in the script, which many viewers may disagree with me as Nolan has smartly justified in Inception. If you love war movies, go ahead. But don't indulge yourself much. Because it is the same scenes you have seen before. My Significant digit score: 5.5/10
10.0~A WWII depiction of verisimilitude pdmajumder Sign in Permalink Has Christopher Nolan struck gold again? Yes he has. Where do I start with this one? I am putty in the hands of films. They can very easily manipulate me emotionally and linger on in my mind for days and even months. But of late, despite this certain weakness, I wasn't being able to spot films of such caliber that could leave a long-lasting impression on me even though I really have been watching some great movies. But now, finally, that spell has been broken. Dunkirk has taken me on a ride, plunged me into the cold depths of the English Channel, made me scramble for life aboard a sinking ship and pray to dear God for a miracle. It is exactly that, which we witness on screen. With not much of a particularly intricate story to tell, it is simply a raw and immersive visual feast of the horrors of war. Right from scene 1, you're thrown into action. The film lives and breathes in the moment, just like the characters who're trying to escape fate and have hardly any time on their hands for anything else. There is not a single scene that is wasted and due to its tight run-time, the film feels perfectly measured. Every frame brings with it a sense of uneasiness and an overbearing feeling of a portentous, if not ominous, immediate future. In classic Nolan style, we see perfectly color-graded shots,frequent angled viewpoints and a non-linear narrative consisting of three separate timelines occurring very close to one another which eventually merge in the end. The cinematography is flawless and the use of real locations and props (including even the planes and boats) only add to the authenticity. Hans Zimmer's background score is haunting and forms an interdependent relationship with the visual proceedings of the film, elevating our experience to the stirring heights of amazement. The crescendo of the tense, shrill sounds of strings with the arrival of an enemy plane or just the tick-tick- tick of a clock, signifying the race against time, laying low in the background of momentarily silent scenes can give anyone the shivers. The characters we see are not allowed to sit with us and tell us the stories of their past lives. We don't know if some young man left a fiancé at home or grew up with only one parent. No one person receives special focus and our attention is never drawn away from the war. In spite of this, just the spanning theme of agony and fear makes us root for every single one of them, even the ones we see for only a few seconds. We palpitate and draw sharp breaths every time a rescue attempt is thwarted mercilessly by the Germans or someone is fighting for life in a dire situation. "Survival isn't fair" is very rightly said by one soldier in the movie. Especially when circumstances are so trying that the basic thread of hope that binds humanity together is being stretched to its limit, one should not be expected to think of anyone but one's own self. However, every now and then, when we see a ray of compassion breaking through the rock solid layer of desperation and the ugliness it can lead to, we're reminded of the power of our hearts. When a mass of civilian boats appear on the horizon to save the soldiers or when a fighter pilot makes sure to destroy an enemy plane even when he's about to fall, we are made to realize that empathy is really all that defines us. No one was born of special mettle but built it up in themselves and let it out even when it was hardest for them to do so. It renews the belief that maybe we too have such potential within us. While I do think watching the movie in IMAX will make it even more extraordinary than it already is (and I heavily regret not being able to do that), Dunkirk will be marvelous irrespective of the format it's viewed in. This is a story of something true that definitely took place in the past. People went through living hell and survived. But watching this film, it was jarring to accept this blatant yet almost unbelievable fact. While we may never come close to knowing what it must really have been like to exist even for a second in the reality of that sort of terror, we can try beginning to fathom it by finding out how, by just being a mere spectator of a fictitious recording of the same events, we can be so severely moved. P.S. If this doesn't win an Oscar, I don't know what will.
5.0~A war vehicle running low on fuel bob-the-movie-man Sign in Permalink The words "Christopher Nolan" and "disappointment" are not words I would naturally associate but for me, they apply where "Dunkirk" is concerned. It promised so much from the trailer: a historical event of epic proportions; Kenneth Branagh; Tom Hardy; Mark Rylance; Hans Zimmer on the keys; the director of such classics as "The Dark Knight"; "Inception" and "Interstellar" : what could go wrong? But it just doesn't work and I've spent the last 24 hours trying to unpick why. A key problem for me was the depiction of the beach itself. The film eschews CGI effects (which I would normally commend) in favour of the use of "practical effects" and the involvement of "thousands of extras" (as the rather glutinously positive Wiki entry declares). Unfortunately for the movie, there were some 400,000 troops marooned in this last patch of civilisation ahead of the Nazi hoard, and all of the shots refuse to acknowledge this scale of potential human tragedy. Yes, there are individual scenes of horror, such as the soldier walking into the sea against the impassive stares of the young heroes. But nothing of scale. At times I thought I'd seen more people on the beach on a winter's day in Bournemouth. My disquiet at this deepened when we got to the sharp end of the rescue by the "small boats". In my mind (and I'm NOT quite old enough to remember this!) I imagine a sea full of them. A sight to truly merit Branagh's awed gaze. But no. They might have been "original" vessels. but there was only about half a dozen of them. A mental vision dashed. The film attempts to tell the story from three perspectives: from the land; from the sea and from the air. The sea though gets the lion's share of the film, and there is much drowning that occurs that (I am aware) was distressing for some in the audience. Nolan also pushes his quirky "timeline" manipulation too far for an audience that largely expects a linear telling of a classic tale. It's day; it's night; the minesweeper's sailing; then sunk; then sailing again; a Spitfire crashes, then crashes again from a different perspective. I know many in the audience just didn't 'get' that: leaving them presumably very confused! That being said, the film is not a write off, and has its moments of brilliance. Kenneth Branagh ("Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit", "Valkyrie"), although having a range of Nolan's cheesy lines to say, is impressive as the commanding officer. Mark Rylance ("Bridge of Spies", "The BFG") also shines as the captain of the "Moonstone": one of the small boats out of Weymouth. And Tom Hardy ("The Revenant", "Legend"), although having limited opportunity to act with anything other than his eyes, is impressive as RAF pilot Farrier. His final scene of stoic heroism is memorable. Fionn Whitehead is also impressive in his movie debut, and even Harry Styles ("This is Us") equips himself well. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema ("Interstellar") is stunning with some memorable shots: a burning plane on a beach being a high spot for me. And Hans Zimmer's score is Oscar-worthy, generating enormous tension with a reverberating score, albeit sometimes let down by unsuitable cutaways (for example, to scenes of boat loading). Elsewhere in the sound department though I had major issues, with a decent percentage of the dialogue being completely inaudible in the sound mix. I really wanted this to be a "Battle of Britain". Or a "Bridge Too Far". Or even a "Saving Private Ryan". Unfortunately, for me it was none of these, and this goes down as one of my movie disappointments of the year so far.

10.0~10/10 chamoui Sign in Permalink This isn't your typical war film, and I love it. I really felt like I was in the war with them. Christopher Nolan, yet again, made another amazing movie. He picked the perfect cast to help execute his vision. I felt every single emotion they went through. Their fear, vulnerability, and passion to get home not mater what. I've never seen a war movie like this. The cast couldn't have been more perfect for this movie. Every single member, from Tom hardy and Kenneth Branagh to the extras, they all delivered and executed their roles perfectly. A must seen movie.
4.0~Disappointing steve-539-765594 Sign in Permalink After the hype I expected to be amazed at this historical event. I was left feeling disappointed. Inaccuracies and unrealistic plot events left me wondering if this was meant to represent the events or was a spin from the director. Over powering soundtrack being used too much spoiled the real drama when needed in my opinion.
5.0~Nolan's weakest work am-39702 Sign in Permalink This movie is just not that good. It starts out very promising, the first 15min of the movie make you excited for what is about to come next. But as the movies goes on, you realize that the dialogue (the little that was in this movies) is not good. The plot is scattered all around the place. The characters have no story, some of them don't even have names. The timeline trick was really not that clever. And the emotional connection was non existent due to all of the aforementioned reasons. Never once did i feel, while watching this movie, the epic magnitude of the situation. When Branagh's character stated how many soldiers where saved i almost choked on my popcorn, because the beach looked like it had max. a few hundred men waiting in line. Nolan should have used cgi, at least on the beach scenes. There were few things that were silly and felt rushed. A young boy accidentally suffers a fatal wound, and the old man responsible for him doesn't even bat an eye. The boy ends up being dead, and the old man still couldn't care less. Tom hardy's character flies on an aircraft out of gas for what seems to be an eternity. Then lands the plane nice and neat on the enemy shore, when he could have landed it anywhere safe. Nolan should get help when writing scripts. Action alone do not make a movie.
5.0~It Was Off to a Good Start, then... jnswick Sign in Permalink Possibly the film was over-hyped and my expectations were much too high, but I can only express great disappointment in 'Dunkirk'. Three failures come to mind, of which none existed in 'Private Ryan' or some of the other great WWII films. The camera placement on both the French and English coastlines was inconsistent, thus very difficult to realize where we were at times during the film. Short of having small titles to tell the audience of where were were in some of the scenes, they should have had each coastline (France & England) on one side of the screen or the other. For example, we went from the 'White cliffs of Dover' immediately to the French coast line with both beaches on the right side of the screen. I think that type of thing was a huge error in making the film. As a pilot I found it interesting that the Spitfire pilot, with plenty of time to prepare for ditching and was not injured, did not have his canopy in the rear position prior to hitting the water, a very basic safety measure even in a Cessna with the door released prior to impact. I felt the story line was very disjointed and part of that could be the fact that I'm American and it was difficult to understand all of the lines in the Queen's English. For this movie the popcorn was the best part.
10.0~Masterpiece! snowiwant Sign in Permalink It is sad that so many people lack the ability to appreciate and enjoy this innovative cinematographic gem. Boring?! Needs CGI and better score?! We are truly a society of pathetic consumers...
5.0~Visuals are not enough stroggoi Sign in Permalink This movie...this is not a good movie. Oddly edited, with the same scenes shown over and over again, for no apparent reason. Poor characters, not really likable except the older dude. Bad action, the dogfight was OK the first time, but Black Sheep Squadron was better in the 70's.
10.0~Real WW II vintage fighter planes in aerial combat, and abject fear etched on every face faithfully deliver the film's sole premise: War Is Hell. Rsacto Sign in Permalink As a pilot myself, the gobsmacking POV aerial dog-fighting sequences alone were worth the price of admission. Director Chris Nolan used actual World War II vintage fighter planes instead of CGI, cartoon-like substitutes. Real pilots flying real fighters, chasing the enemy planes through the clouds and skimming over the surface of the English Chanel. Punctuated by the visceral growl of twelve-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines powering the British Spitfires overflying the bedlam on the beaches below. Wow. Before I saw pic (at an IMAX in 70mm, the only way to fully appreciate pic), I read a scathing review by Rex Reed, usually a reliable and fair critic. Reed's review scolded Nolan for having the music pot out much of the dialogue in pic. Incredibly, Reed totally missed the point of pic, which is an almost total reliance on visuals, with the music track and voice tracks in distant secondary and tertiary roles respectively. Pic is a quintessential motion picture, meaning it is meant to be seen and actually felt by the audience, not heard like a play. In this regard, Nolan succeeds exceptionally well. Pic is clearly reminiscent of many of the silent films of yore, which relied more on visuals than the talkies that eventually succeeded them. Yet Nolan avoids the often hammy performances found with most silent film actors, instead relying on the bowel-stirring fear etched on the faces of soldiers either trapped in a sinking ship or helplessly being shot at by an unseen enemy. In short, Nolan understands, and, most importantly, executes the most basic premise of motion pictures: show us, don't tell us. Some reviewers have complained that actors of some stature, like Kenneth Branagh, were relegated to embarrassingly minor roles, and the meaty roles were given to unknowns. Well, this historical event is about 400,000 British soldiers trapped on the French beach at Dunkirk. There was no Patten, MacArthur, or Montgomery involved. It was a rescue effort thrown together and run by whomever was available. There will be no nominations for Best Actor. There is no place for such an upstaging role when juxtaposed against this colossal cinematic tableau of an entire army facing either rescue or utter defeat. Reviewers who have complained about the lack of character development simply fail to understand exactly what, and not who, the real star and the premise of pic are: War itself, and that War Is Hell. The absence of the standard-Hollywood, predictable, three-act American Narrative format is a refreshing change indeed, yet many have complained about the "lack of story." There are four hundred-thousand men trying to escape annihilation facing a cold, empty sea, getting shot to pieces with the Germans at their backs. No story? Are you kidding?! That's 400,000 stories, and we get to see a handful of them registered in extreme closeups of their faces. You feel like you were really there, within the claustrophobic confines of a ship full of soldiers desperate to escape the slaughter, or the dizzying POV shots of aerial combat filmed from real fighter planes in real flight. As for music and the shattering sound of bombs and ordnance exploding covering up dialogue, it gave pic a verisimilitude that most war pics lack. War is noisy. Really noisy.
1.0~Horrible! cycleman-1 Sign in Permalink We had high hopes for this movie but it was all over the place. A waste of almost 2 hours.....not sure what the hell other people were watching.
2.0~How could this movie be positively reviewed so often? S-Schoeningh Sign in Permalink I really don't know what the critics saw or if they maybe received some bribing but what the hell??? I really couldn't wait to see this movie finally and it definitely has some nice elements, like that you don't see the Germans the whole movie except of the last scene, but there were sooooo many unrealistic scenes and sorry in a movie like this I want to have full realism. So what the hell is going on with the ammunition of the Spitfires, they would have been out of ammo right after the first fight and here they fight forever, also how long can this Spitfire glide in the final scene and WHAT THE HELL, why is he landing the Spitfire to then burn it and to be captured when he could have easily bailed above the evacuation zone. And what kind of ship is this, which can still swim even it is filled with holes, water and lots of humans and boy all the flight scenes, in one scene the Heinkels are already even too close to bomb and we still see several minutes flying of the Spitfires until they are in the right position and the Heinkel probably just hovered on the same position. There are sooo many unrealistic and stupid things going on in the movie I really don't get how anyone could give it a positive rating. Also the whole story around the boy who died....are you kidding me? He dies from the fall? I mean of course there are stupid ways how this could happen, but what are the chances and then the newspaper? How did he rescue them when he was dead? I can't take it....How this movie got so many academy award nominations shows that something is really going wrong in this business!
3.0~A truly boring and tedious movie. hel-89571 Sign in Permalink As a regular movie goer I was naturally looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about in regards to "Dunkirk". Well I was sorely disappointed, and came away frustrated at what the director could have done with such a large budget, instead of the tedious film he gave us. Within the first 10 minutes we find ourselves on the beach, together with lines and lines of soldiers facing the water, waiting for the boats to collect them. Never mind the fact, that the boats had not even left England yet! Needless to say, the soldiers were completely unprotected in the open, and made for great target practice for the German planes above them. I found the lack of character building to be an enormous let down. Whilst there were three mini plots, the soldiers being evacuated, the trio of Spitfires, and the one small boat with the man and his son, there was little or no interaction between the actors in these mini plots. I call them actors as we were never able to get to know them by name as such, and hence there were no characters in this movie per se. Kenneth Branagh spent the entire moving walking up and down the wharf trying to get the soldiers into whatever boats appeared. The supposed armada that was dispatched from the other side of the channel, never looked more than a bunch of mates out for an afternoon cruise. There were many scenes with little or no dialogue, which depicted what it was really like for mainly those on the beach, or in an unused trawler a group of them came across. Whilst these may have been realistic, we had no idea who the characters involved were, as we had no opportunity to engage with them throughout the film. There were many times when we switched from a night time scene to daytime one, and then back to night time, when supposedly all the action was taking place at the the same time. In my humble opinion, Dunkirk could have, and should have been an epic movie, but I'm afraid to say that I found it boring, tedious, and without character. I am well aware that I am in the minority with this opinion, but it really could have been so much better. Cheers, Hans
10.0~Nolan's masterpiece!!! crissialfs Sign in Permalink This is truly a masterpiece from Nolan! The score is amazing, the cinematography is amazing, the cast is amazing (Harry, Fionn, Tom, Mark... outstanding performances)! Brilliant, brilliant movie - it grips you from the beginning to the end! I've watched it two times and I can't wait to watch it again!
7.0~A visual feast and amazing film. anubindtiwari-310-820214 Sign in Permalink This is a Nolan film and like every other Nolan film it is different and unique in its own way for other Nolan films and all the other films as a matter of fact. First of all let me make this clear – This is a survival story and not a War film. Story is rather simple but the story-telling is extraordinary. Movie starts with a solider running away from the enemy towards last defense line of British & French army on the beach of Dunkirk and the story basically revolves around him. The film also tells the story of the efforts of the British Navy & the RAF is the evacuation Operation Dynamo over the period of one week. The film has three time-line and it is parallel in nature, covering contribution of all the all three Army-Land, Navy-Water & RAF- Air. As I said earlier the story is simple but the way it is resented is amazing, the non-linear structure is the USP of the film and it is the only thing that binds the audience. Although people knew how the movie was going to end, the faith of the characters is something that we want to see. The premise of the film was completed in first 20 minutes of the film and from there the movie really takes you on a thrill ride. There are characters are associated with each time-line and just like the premise setup the character development is also completed within 20 minutes, this is something that only an experienced director can do who knows the story he is telling. Each character have got very less on screen time, mainly because there are so many characters but each of them are defined perfectly and have their unique identity and have proved their valor in their own way the film which was very important when you are telling the story is brave soldiers fighting a lost battle. All the cast members have done a tremendous job, I knew about Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Kenneth Branagh but Harry Style & Fionn Whitehead amazed me. The visuals are literally feast for eyes and the wide angle shots of the sea and the dogfight are incredible. There are only a few directors who can pull-of such a scene. Apart from the aerial shots there are also some scenes like the drowning of the anti-mining vessel and the scenes where the solders are drowning in the merchant ship. BGM is one Hans Zimmer's best; the scores were perfectly in sync with what was going on in the screen. The high and low notes with the rise of the thrill were perfect, music could not have been any better. The script was excellent, there are very few dialogues but that was not required as the BSM and the stunning visuals were enough to fill in the silence. All in all the movie was great not the best Nolan film but still a great film watch it for the visual and the BGM and also if you are history buff or you like War films. Do not watch if you are expecting long action sequences or something grand like Inception or Interstellar. IMDb Rating: 9/10, My Rating: 7.5/10
6.0~A good watch but not true to Dunkirk aaronstewart-23952 Sign in Permalink After many great reviews I decided I would go and watch this on the big screen for the atmosphere and in that at lease I have to say it was great. But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest. I am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story. The characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together. My rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.
3.0~Good War Movie. But Not A Good Movie. DakotaTheGamer Sign in Permalink This movie was not that good of a movie the acting was bad you could barley know what they were saying i mean i knew what they were saying but my friend couldn't but this movie i didn't like it it was upsetting the only reason i give it a 3/10 instead of lower is cause it was a good war movie but not a good movie in general i mean i wouldn't pay for this movie when it comes out it was really displeasing to me i saw it in imax and it sounded great for a war kind of movie but the acting and the story was really bad so it wasn't that good at all i kinda wanted to see it at first but after seeing it i don't want to watch it again and it wasn't worth what i paid i didn't want to do a review for how bad it was but i thought i should cause i saw it but i don't recommend seeing it unless you just want to see war and no good story or characters just war.
4.0~In 2017, over 330.000 film viewers were stuck in a cinema, surrounded by boredom, can they be rescued? Martin010 Sign in Permalink It's hard to understand critic ratings of 10/10 while this movie undeniably lacks quality on some very important aspects. Let me start off with some positive notes: IMAX: The impact of the bullets and bombs felt as if you were really there. The entire movie is shot in a very realistic way. Opening scene: The suspense, music and cinematography all came together very well in the opening scene, which really made me excited for the scenes to come. Acting: Poor acting can easily distract the audience from their experience of being in a certain time/place. But there was not a single moment in which an actor did something out of character. All expressions were very believable. Great acting! But there were some major aspects I had issues with: Characters: The characters did not have any background story and there's hardly any dialogue to give some insight. The main characters are therefore replaceable for any other random soldier on that beach. I do not expect an elaborate introduction of every character, certainly not in a historical war movie, but the downside is that the audience cannot empathize with the main characters. I really didn't care for one of them to die. I've seen hundreds of soldiers die in earlier scenes of the movie, why would one or two more (just as hollow and unknown as any other soldier) bother me a bit? It's no must to focus on character development, as long as the other aspects of the movie make up for the lack of it. In Dunkirk that sadly was not the case. Editing: Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I find this non-linear storytelling and continuity breaks unnecessary and poorly executed. Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Especially the flight scenes did not add much to the story. Instead I rather would've seen some scenes at the front-line with troops actually defending the beach instead of just a bunch of scared, helpless troops waiting for the next plane to fly over and bomb the shite out of them. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes. Music: Usually I enjoy Zimmer's score. But in this movie there was no moment of silence, not a moment to break the suspense. Especially in IMAX, my ears were buzzing hours after I left the cinema. Was this intentional? Was it supposed to feel like one big action scene without any breaks, to get the same feeling of those soldiers, trapped between battles unable to take a break, constantly in stress of a nearing attack? Well, than Nolan did succeed. But I found it very annoying. Overall I believe this movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics blindly hopping on the hype-train. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals. Rescue yourself from boredom and don't watch this movie!
8.0~Christopher Nolan created an impressive blockbuster on World War 2, with the focus on survival. Danielpotato Sign in Permalink The most important lesson in the history of our humanity, surpassed in genre, religion among other moral aspects, is simply the survival of the species or a human being in question. Our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. One scene, caught my attention when a group of Allied soldiers were surrounded in a ship and this same ship was being attacked on all sides by the German troops. One of the characters was being forced out of the ship to see if the tide sea was rising or not. Out of fear, this character did not want to leave the ship, it was when an English soldier replied: for the others to survive, one person has to die. The theme of this film is survival, especially surviving in a difficult situation, is in itself a great victory Nothing is better expressed in this film and executed in a way with as much talent as Nolan achieved in making with this film. Not only by itself, the message is passed to the audience in a clear and perfect way as is demonstrated in small scenes that help convey this message and build a fitting end to the film itself. The film goes straight to the narrative and action of the movie without losing in passing with interesting monologues, unlike Inception, a film in which Nolan himself created a character with the sole purpose of explaining the rules of this universe for the audience, this is the apex of Nolan as a Film director and he performs his work in a simple and exemplary way. So Dunkirk is his smaller commercial movie, but with the bonus without unnecessary scenes that could crumble the experience of the film. The performances are excellent and accompany the director's talents (the direction of the film itself) and the script in a cohesive, simple and direct way, highlighting Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance and of course the very competent Kenneth Branagh. These excellent actors help immerse the audience in the cinematographic aspect of the movie itself to make the experience as real and emotional as possible. Again, congratulations to Nolan for choosing actors relatively unknown to the general public, but outstanding in their work of acting. Instead of trying to choose famous actors (whose private lives are always in the mouths of the people and the magazines), these people are celebrities and not actors. For this reason I never managed to pass the first act of Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg made a mistake filling his film with the most popular Hollywood All Star cast of famous actors at that time (their lives were so exposed that it was hard to see those people as soldiers or survivors of WWII). At this point, Nolan fared better than Spielberg. By completing this great experience, special and sound effects are applied in an exemplary way and these same technologies make almost perfect use of the IMAX screen. The technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget (105 millions). The cinematography is very good (almost perfect, like in most of Nolan movies) and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful. See the aerial combat of the characters of Tom Hardy (Farrier) and Jack Lowden (Collins) in aerial planes that looked with great and amazing beauty in fighting against the planes of the Germans. A technical amazing work of Nolan and his production team. Amazing, no doubt. Especially on the IMAX screen, where the film shows all its beauty, and if there is a movie that deserves to be seen in IMAX, it is one, this new work of Christopher Nolan, no doubt. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Making the storytelling move to viewers in three different locations (The Mole, The Sea and The Air). In a cohesive, precise and confusing way. This film shows a great talent of Nolan, and it reaches his talent to create sequences in parallel assembly the characters of the film in a brilliant way. The soundtrack composed by the veteran Hans Zimmer is amazing, Hans in turn creates a memorable theme for the theme of World War II. Fantastic and great. The great and only problem I see that disturbs the experience of the film is limited by the PG-13 and thus limit the blood and violence, for God's sake, it is a film about a war blood and violence are common. At times it seemed like I was looking at some scenes and these same scenes seemed so artificial and displaced from the film itself, like the scene of the soldiers corpses coming to the beach, or the English troops being smashed by the sinking ship (two clear examples that PG-13 influenced negatively the movie). One problem that some people go through seeing this movie is the lack of depth in some characters, however there are characters with depth, but not the kind of depth shown through dialogues or exposition. Nolan wanted to show something bigger. And I think Nolan did it. Nolan created in this movie to show the question of survival and its consequences in the lives of the people close to war and the soldiers who were fighting in that war. He wanted to show us how and survival define us, and I think he got the message very well across this movie. Even for this, he sacrificed some dramatic depth. Depth for certain characters, however Nolan passed a larger message, which surpasses any dramatically deep element. Nolan wanted to get something bigger. And in my opinion he did it.
5.0~Bland, Boring, Revisionist Take on Dunkirk sunraider Sign in Permalink As a WWII buff (listening to "The Longest Day: Music From The Classic War Films" as I type), I had expected to be first in line when this film came out but I hesitated after reading initial reviews. While extremely positive, many reviews commented on aspects of the film, from the non-linear narrative structure to the choice of characters focused on, that left me feeling that I would not enjoy the movie. I finally broke down and saw it because of its continued box office performance but found it as lackluster as I'd feared. Present-day WWII movies just don't hold a candle to the classics (All Quiet on the Western Front, The Longest Day, Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and my all-time favorite film, The Great Escape), nor even big-budget mediocre fare from relatively recent times like A Bridge Too Far or The Battle of Britain. There's way too much pretentious nonsense in modern war movies. Every filmmaker these days has to make a "statement" about the horrors of war, as if intelligent viewers weren't already aware of that fact. Therefore, instead of a good story with appealing and memorable characters we get one that focuses on "the coward," because in the modern-day mindset, anyone who acts in war with dignity and courage and self-sacrifice is seen as unrealistic and somehow a dupe of the evil powers that be. None of those characters was remotely interesting or appealing and the time shifts were totally unnecessary. In addition, the omnipresent music was a total turn-off. There was never any chance to actually hear the real sounds of war, which includes silence and the banter of soldiers trying to make the best of a bad situation. All told, this is the most-overrated movie I've seen in years. Thank God I have the classics on VHS and DVD.
5.0~boring overrated romanabdullaiev Sign in Permalink I watched it almost an hour and was really bored, I like this genre but this movie was bad. Actors doesn't feel alive, they act not real, everything has blue colored atmosphere. Don't want to waste my time
4.0~OK but would have preferred more historical context wheelmanimdb Sign in Permalink Really from a pure entertainment standpoint I didn't care for it. It did not educate me as to why the army was at Dunkirk in the first place and really I didn't care much for any of the characters. It was like being dropped into the chase scene of a Fast and Furious with out any explanation of how you got there. I agree it is a fine piece of work with some good performances sprinkled throughout but was somehow lacking even there. It was even hard to accept given the visuals that there were enough boats to extract 10000 instead of the actual 300000 that were alluded to. Can't say I would recommend it to any of my friends as an entertainment experience, only maybe as a interesting example of technical film making.
10.0~Astounding timothylockwood Sign in Permalink It's not often that I leave the cinema with my hands literally shaking but I will argue that Dunkirk is one of the best films I have ever experienced. The feeling of anxiety and agonising tension throughout the film creates the most electric atmosphere of being completely absorbed in the events of the film. This is however, a film that won't work at a home viewing. The IMAX experience is amazing and this is a film so obviously created with the cinematic experience and it shines through making difficult to recreate the same feeling in the average living room. This aside, I feel that Dunkirk is possibly one of the best cinematic experiences of all time.
7.0~Focussing on the event, not on the characters, with a couple of problems dierregi Sign in Permalink We get to see the Dunkirk evacuation from land, air and sea, without getting too attached to any of the characters, which worked fine for me. A WEEK: The land guys are a bunch of soldiers trying repeatedly to get on a boat to England, but ending in worst trouble every time. Some claustrophobic moments in sinking ships are quite uncomfortable. The evacuation lasted a week so we get the feeling of a long wait. ONE DAY: On the sea, we follow the story of one of the many civilians who helped carrying soldiers back to England with their own boats. The two-way journey lasted one day, so the experience was different. ONE HOUR: The RAF pilots add more seasickness opportunities, with their daring manoeuvres to protect their stranded comrades. Their tanks could support one hour of flight, and this is the third, different view point. For the above mentioned reasons, the plot is not edited in chronological order, which was slightly annoying, but there was enough tension to keep the story going without a dull moment. If you like character-driven stories you will not like this, but I appreciated the lack of personal stories and the focus on the general, dismal feeling of defeat. Two small problems: the beach was too quiet, with relatively few soldiers waiting for a ride home. Over 300.000 soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, but we see at most a few hundreds waiting on the beach. Finally, the soundtrack was overbearing. It is clear it was a dramatic event without the need to have it hammered home with the hyper- dramatic, anxiety-inducing music. PS I know Nolan did not want to use CGI, but in this case some extra men on the beach would have added realism, rather than the opposite...
1.0~A step back not only from Private Ryan but even from Pear Harbour lruella Sign in Permalink The facts: No emotional attachment to any of the shallow characters. What are the names of the various protagonists? Dunno. -The scale of this historical event, which should be comparable to D- Day is terribly depicted. The entire operation is run by 3 (three) airplanes, a handful of small boats and some hundred men on the beach. Three insignificant and repetitive story lines: let's escape from the beach, dogfight, sunk ship, crashed airplane, repeat until you reach 2 hours of movie. In the whole movie there is barely a drop of blood. Not a wound, not a bleeding, not a severed limb despite the soldiers being bombarded several times on an open field. Ridiculous. The graphic revolution started with Private Ryan is forgotten. The bombing scenes are less captivating and tense than Pearl Harbour. A disappointing movie in terms of script, acting and technical filming. One more demonstration that online ratings in 2017 are utterly useless.
5.0~The importance of sound. ericbouron Sign in Permalink I won't judge the film based on the cinematography nor the editing nor the scenario. I actually learned a lot with this movie about the importance of sound. In cinema, and for those who know know how the production of movies works out there, we know that the sound department is a class apart. The first ready to shoot, the least important department during the shooting because anyways, in post-production it will be resolved, right? This is where Nolan missed it badly and sunk the movie like one of the ships. I sincerely have no idea how the producers let Cristopher Nolan get away with this. Usually the Nolan's movies are so weird in a way that catches people''s attention that they don't pay attention to the plot holes because the atmosphere that are created are so immersive that we don't care. Dunkirk is not one of his usual movies where the story itself is an unknown with surprises that keeps you on the edge of the seat. Dunkirk is more of a trying to be contemplative like Malick's war movie, and stressful like a Spielberg's war movie. He tried to stay in between the two keeping his overwhelming sound that literally turns off the immersion. He tries so hard to create an atmosphere, that you begin to wonder if he even trust the images he is filming. The amount of sound in every moment of the film tries so hard to keep you there, that you ask yourself if why not a simple moment of silence could not do the job. Nolan's team of sound design and mix failed to create an immersive experience (I saw it on IMAX) that made me always stay away of the movie and made me realize the lack of depth in the movie. It's not a "war movie", it's a "survival movie" and the bad sound editing and mixing makes it none of both. There are some many specific moments that we could discuss (the soldiers in the boat for example) but the main idea is this: I will listen to all movie that are nominated to the Oscars in best sound editing and sound mixing. Nolan and his team failed so bad that we should take a moment to appreciate how hard is the job of the sound department and how precious is a moment of silence.
7.0~Dunkirk for Millennials aa56 Sign in Permalink In screen writing, a shot is an image captured by the camera. A scene is a meaningful dramatic movement within the story. A sequence is a collection of scenes with a unified dramatic purpose, usually between 10 to 20 minutes long. Millennials like their shots and scenes fast like the commercials that show images for a couple hundred milliseconds maximum, and Christopher Nolan made this movie just for them. There is no classic character or story development; it seems to be just a collection of quick scenes cut and mingled from what should be different sequences. I doubt there is a proper sequence in it. Nolan described it as "his most experimental film," and that truly is what this movie is, but I give it a 7 for technical work.
10.0~Visual and sound masterpiece richardchen-85622 Sign in Permalink For the naysayers on the depth of the story, the whole point of the movie is so that you can have an immersed experience in the battle scenes told from multiple perspectives. This movie is truly a visual and sound combination masterpiece. In short, it is a masterpiece that brings out the experience. The movie doesn't contain a lot of the dialogues but shows you scenes of realistic battle experiences which allows the movie-goers to taste the experience of the Dunkirk Evacuation. Furthermore, because of Nolan's usage of real world objects such as the real Dunkirk beach, real destroyers, real boats, and real planes, the movie is second to none in terms of its graph effects. Nothing like those cheap CGI-generated movies. In addition, with the combination of sharp sound of planes accentuated by the dark and ominous music composed by Zimmer, this movie is a master piece that shifts one from situation to situation, watching events unfold from multiple perspectives. In addition, without the dialogue, the movie also doesn't lend itself to propaganda. Nothing like the intertwined love story of the Pearl Harbor. In addition, even though it was told from the British side and even though the cast and the movie producers are all British and Irish, the movie is surprisingly unbiased depicting the competency of both German and British soldiers of the time. Due to these reasons, I'd strongly recommend anyone to watch the movie.
6.0~Another war movie jakacbatko Sign in Permalink The whole movie is ok to spend a day on a couch. But at the end you still can hear that voice in your head: Is that is? In the very beginning I've noticed how clean the streets of France are. It's a bloody war. War is a mess. And there is not a single paper, rock, or any kind of garbage on the street. So details are definitely off in this movie. Second thing I've notice was that every plane that gets hit starts to leave a trail of smoke. It's like in a American movies where every car is ticking bomb. There is also guy who is in the movie just to say 3 words and nod his head and another guy who has been there only to get hit in the head. Do you really need to expose these people? I see this movie more like video presentation of the war for school purpose so the kids get the idea what happened during the war, but it's not like documentary or at least movie with a great story. Except if you are a veteran who likes to go back in the good old days when they were young.
1.0~Could not hear the dialouge musichead2468 Sign in Permalink I hated the movie. Reason being, I could not hear the dialogue. A lot of the movie was me trying as hard as I could to understand the dialogue. I could not understand 97% of it. I will never see another Chris Nolan movie again. I had trouble hearing due to the loud soundtrack over the dialogue, as well as the sound effects, and the accents. In the theater, I was wondering if it was just me. But googled it after the movie and see others had the issue too.
1.0~I have been robbed marwanelshemy Sign in Permalink This was boring, unrealistic and a total waste of money
6.0~well made, b minus flmovie Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is being compared to the best war movies ever. It is not in that class it is a solid movie that has very good cinematography. The acting is decent but the story is not that great. Best thing that the film does is make you believe war is hell. The characters will quickly be forgotten.
6.0~Gripping or silly !! I can't decide amandazz100 Sign in Permalink I cannot make up my mind on this one. I loved the complexity of the three time strands. I liked the pacing and the use of music to create the threatening atmosphere. In principle the idea is neat - there are so many men on the beach that giving a few of them a starring role and back story serves to understate the sheer mass of human suffering and terror being experienced during Dunkirk by everyone there, so the ensemble cast idea is a good one. In reality though everyone has a back story and the film tradition of picking one or two of those out and providing more rounded characters works well in those circumstances because the audience can empathise, as it is, here we have an ensemble caste with a couple of not very well picked out individual characters that is hard to care too much about. The film is a kind of half way house - a bit of a war movie, with a few superheros. You can tell it is made by someone more used to the fantasy figure genre. The characters that have been picked out behaving like comic book heroes in terms of the scrapes they get into and how they get out of them, with true Hollywood cliff hanging moments. The movie is also curiously "unviolent" as it made for audience under 12. the beach scenes severely understate the brutality of the situation and the horror of war. The explosions were rather anodyne - Bodies being blown up on beaches but no discernible injuries afterwards. I also thought the scenes on the beach looked rather sparse - for what was supposed to be 300,000 men. Showing this from the perspective of the men on the beach without actually seeing the enemy works well but the actual terror of being on the beach does not come across that well especially when the beaches are both so empty and so orderly. The ending is weak and very "Hollywood " unrealistic and happens abruptly - almost as if the money ran out There are a few " laugh out loud " moments from a British sceptic - where someone gets saved at the final moment - true typical Hollywood super hero stuff - not really fitting for a war movie - where such moments probably didn't happen- people just died. The story ark in the boat probably works best, but that is because it reverts to the tradition of finding characters one can empathise with, though even here rather too comic book for my tastes. Overall I enjoyed the movie and I found it absorbing, but I don't think its a war masterpiece.
2.0~Mediocre Is The Best Word awih-90185 Sign in Permalink This movie was stunning, stunning in its disappointment. It totally fails to describe what Dunkirk was all about. It completely missed the scope of the operation. Long boring scenes that were senseless. Minutes upon end of air battles between 3 British and 3 German planes. A long stupid scene aboard a beached fishing boat. A RAF pilot who managed to shoot down a German plane after he had run out of gas (unbelievable nonsense). A few hundred men strung in rows upon the beach, a couple of boats in the water, a few broken down trucks. In fact, this operation involved hundreds of thousands of men, and thousands of boats of every shape and size imaginable , and hundreds of planes, tanks, and trucks. There was almost nothing of the what the Officers in command were faced with, or the agonizing decisions they had to make, having too little of everything they needed. Just some lonely Navy Commander staring wistfully out to sea repeatedly.Where were all the Germans? Yes Germans. Were they all whitewashed out for PC reasons ? Who then was doing all the shooting at the guys trapped on the beaches. Unforgivable BS. There was almost nothing to show the scale of the operation to send the hundreds and hundreds of small private boats that set out from every port on the south coast of England. If I were a young person who knew nothing about Dunkirk, I would have left the cinema none the wiser. Frankly, that is a tragedy, a $150 million tragedy. The sound track was awful, the noise made it difficult to hear anything that was actually said, although that was not much. I was not deaf when I entered the cinema, but I was when I came out. An absolute waste of time IMHO. The producers should be ashamed of themselves.
2.0~Send in the Writers! rustystpete Sign in Permalink Obviously a lot was left out of this story: dialogue, plot, women, and dead fish. I could attempt to justify my opinion but by now you've seen the film. The story could have been valiantly told a million different ways with millions of different story lines; this is not a valiant effort. I kept wondering when a magic voice would make sense of the action and what the Hell it had to do with anything. Sorry, no 'out of the blue' explanation for most of the disjointed visual sequences. Usually I would welcome a Director's cut but in this movie's case ..... Great special effects though. Give the CGI group a standing ovation.
7.0~Not as good as the critics say aaronbondy Sign in Permalink Caution minor spoilers ahead!!!! It was not a bad movie but it was disappointing considering all of the positive reviews. Me and my mother had a hard time understanding what the characters were saying due to their thick accents. Also their was less violence than I expected. Though this is forgivable due to the pg13 rating of the film. I also had a hard time building a connection with the characters due to the soap opera style of story telling (meaning the many different intertwined plot lines, not quality of story) this may have also been because of the criminally short run time (for a war movie). Their was a positive in this movie and that was that it had a good story. One that will hopefully get Nolan his first Oscar win (fingers crossed). It was not his best film but not his worst in fact far from it. the films good story just evens out it's flaws. And this movies flaws aren't necessarily Nolans fault. It may get better with time but as of now it's not as good as it could have been or should have been
1.0~Awfulness a_naismith Sign in Permalink Have directors forgotten how to make a great movie? There is no empathy for any of the characters because they do not take time to develop any of them. I gave it 40 minutes and walk away.
2.0~Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! garrvanorden-378-358098 Sign in Permalink I have no idea why this movie received good reviews. Let me start with the good. This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max, and I saw this movie on $5 Tuesday. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died or anything. Mark Rylance's (the BFG) character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He seemed utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about "Home" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring and repetitive, only to predictably save the day in the end. Because this movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to his friend and almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets his friend while he is taking a dump. This is not a joke. So the main character doesn't poop. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And the guy doesn't poop the whole movie. And him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non-stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, "I don't care. This movie didn't make me care." As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the timeline without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the timeline in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, "Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for." You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support.
1.0~Over Hyped movie alloffers Sign in Permalink Someone has to say it. Yes, its an an absolutely over rated movie. Only music by Han Zimmer is excellent. Cinematography is good that's it. Yes you do feel bad for people who is died in the war, hence people feel guilty criticizing a movie like this. To be honest movie has no soul whatsoever.
5.0~VIEWS ON FILM review of Dunkirk burlesonjesse5 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan, a period piece, and a warfare movie. It's an interesting amalgamation. What did I think? Eh, meager disappointment at best. My latest review is Nolan's 2017 release, Dunkirk. The story of Dunkirk is a true one. It's not handled faithfully and it has big Chris achingly trying to reinvent the combat wheel, Nolan style! It's about a rather large evacuation in World War II. Allied soldiers were taken from the beaches and harbor of Dunkirk via the summer of 1940. And in case you are wondering, Dunkirk is a medium-sized commune in northern France. Frustrating, overly thought-provoking, icy and at times clunky, Nolan's film is told through the eyes of three different groups of WWII servicemen. Yeah its running time is 106 minutes but Dunkirk feels like it's two and a half hours long. Heck, about an hour in, I was almost "done" with Dunkirk. Natch. Anyway, Christopher Nolan as a director, gives Dunkirk a sterile look, a large canvas, a few nimble wide shots, and a numbing sense of being. These are the traits I like about him. However, when Christopher's style fails to correlate with the proper subject matter (forgone battle in the trenches), it almost appears like amateur hour on screen. Nolan mind you, has never been a supreme storyteller, a user-friendly filmmaker, or an expert at staging action. This is where his Dunkirk ultimately fails. For a movie under two hours, Dunkirk feels slight of hand at being a silent film. It still has a ton of scenes that don't find a rhythm and can't sustain any kind of payoff. Battle sequences involving planes, boats, and land infantry are quick, lack minimal gore (that explains the PG-13 rating), and are virtually non-coherent. Also, the actors mumble their lines and Nolan's favorite troupers from his other flicks (Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy), feel underused while not having a lot of script material to bounce off of. All in all, my biggest fault with Dunkirk has to be the editing by Australian Lee Smith. He shapes a vehicle that substitutes wartime ADHD and spoon-fed art for tone and entertainment value. Nothing in frame is truly held long enough for the viewer to process. Basically it's the movie equivalent of someone constantly changing channels with their state-of-the-art remote. So yeah, Dunkirk has a couple of meaningful moments with a provided musical score that's equal parts stirring, absorbingly loud, and annoying. Still, Smith's edits are very choppy and very fleet. They zap Dunkirk of having any lengthy intrigue or sense of epic tranquility. Bottom line: War pics shouldn't make you miffed at trying to fit all the events together as the closing credits come up. That only works with stuff like The Thin Red Line. My rating: 2 stars.
2.0~What an absolute Turkey ! jameskfaulkner Sign in Permalink Normally I love this kind of wartime historic movie but it was absolutely terrible, just a total Turkey. Dunkirk is a infamous piece of British history, it was a disaster like the film ! The filming itself is reasonably good, but the biggest thing that lets it down is the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer should be fired ! It is constant relentless noisy drone through literally every single scene, that adds nothing and which totally ruins it. When it switches from one scene to another the same drone continues ! It is doesn't feel in any way 1940s, and neither does it feel British or French apart from the very last scene, but by then I was glad to get out. At the very least the entire soundtrack should be changed. There is almost no speaking or chit chat at all by any of the characters so you know nothing about them not even their names. Again not natural. Even in the very first scene when he arrives on the beach and takes a drink from another soldier. They don't even speak which isn't natural and just not what British people do. Strange stuff also happens in that the young lad seems ill and then dies on the boat but there is no clue why ? Has he been shot ? You don't see anyone German at all other than another bomber or another Stuka. The film could have been so good in that the scenes themselves look okay(ish) but it just doesn't work as a film. When all the little ships arrive together this was quite nice, and one of the main legends of Dunkirk but they don't make enough of this. In conclusion save your money and watch it on TV instead but only if you are a real WW2 buff. If you want to see a real genuine movie about how it was flying Spitfires etc then watch the Battle of Britain film, hint they don't fly until they run out of fuel, It is literally about 5 minutes for a Spitfire to fly back across the English channel to refuel.
1.0~my time is too precious to waste on a crap film like this m_white Sign in Permalink I'll be honest. I watched less than an hour of this before bailing out. Whatever good may have happened after I turned off the TV, it could not possibly outweigh the absolute crap I'd seen up until that point. It's an insult to the men who risked and lost their lives to misrepresent such a pivotal event in the 20th century. Really, all the dramatic freight you need for a fantastic movie is there in Dunkirk. All you have to do is tell the story and you'd have a great film. Instead, there is this mish-mash of whatever random blah blah yuk stupidity. Yes, that is exactly as much sense as it makes, any of it. I was not just disappointed, I was insulted. A generation of young people will grow up with a very badly mistaken impression about Dunkirk, and that is the worst possible outcome of a bad movie about a historical event. Shame on all the people responsible for this completely crap movie.
1.0~Do not waste your time with this crap theromanempire-1 Sign in Permalink I went to see this movie thinking it was a great world war 2 story filled with action story and suspense and with lead actors in the shape of similar world war movies like Hitler the rise of the evil, valkyria , the downfall the red thin line and so many others. Unfortunately I was wrong. there were no main lead actors no particular story and action and the only thing the movie had was how those soldiers were trying to escape from the enemy using planes, boats etcetera. After an hour or something I fell asleep bored and left the theater wanting my money back as this was more like a docudrama than a real movie. problem was not so much that the movie was bad as it was B-O-R-I-N-G showing the same thing all the time. GRADE F avoid it at all costs
2.0~Disappointing traynor-angela Sign in Permalink Did not care for this movie. Scenes were very jumpy, one to the next, with no explanation of timeline. Not nearly enough story line...just a jumbled together patchwork of scenes. Also, excruciatingly loud. I sat with my fingers plugging my ears for all but a few minutes of the movie.
9.0~Nolan's War Epic roykfrapp Sign in Permalink War is Hell! That infamous phrase isn't necessarily the first thing you think when watching Chris Nolan's masterful World War 2 epic Dunkirk. Nolan isn't really interested here in the gratuitous and awful nature of war( Hacksaw Ridge take note) but instead relies on cinematic, visual storytelling in its purest form to bring home a more melancholic, elegiac tone. It still has shocks and suspense and although minimalist in certain scenes(the faceless enemy, the stripped back approach to explosions) its scale is huge. Nolan is almost a contradiction...he seems to blend an artistic, philosophical approach with a more bombastic and populist edge to wonderful fruition. The characters in this movie are vaguely drawn but much like Mad Max Fury Road its all about the mannerisms, the looks that people give each other to convey emotions. Everyone is superb in this, even dare I say it, that young upstart from One Direction(that's one hell of an agent) but its Tom Hardy's spitfire pilot that bears the brunt of the emotional heft and has, by the last few scenes, become an integral part of the story( giving away no major spoilers). And this is an actor who's wearing a mask for almost the entirety of the movie. Nolan has often been accused of a cold, clinical approach that disrupts the flow of his technical achievements to become something greater. Personally its far from the truth..Inception and Interstellar both contained father issues that were touching and tender and stayed the right side of tender and sentimental and even Insomnia had a very poetic underpinning with that mournful bittersweet ending. Although Dunkirk does perhaps tip near to that theory ironically, its within its last half hour that theory can be well and truly put to bed. Its simply stunning cinema thematically and structurally bringing about Nolans fetish for fiddling with time periods melding together cohesively. There may well be the whiff of commercialism especially regarding the 12a certificate but this is more like those war films from the 50s and 60s that were not very violent and were more about grace and determination and spirit of soldiers in a seemingly hopeless scenario. Nolan knows how to create cinematic magic in a world which has become obsessed with cgi and over the top action set pieces and that in itself deserves recognition. The mainstream crowd are not all stupid.(take note Bay) Dunkirk is intimate and tense with another superb Zimmer score(only once is it too overbearing) and many may want their War films dished up with blood n guts and profanity attached. But Dunkirk isn't about War or a particular genre..its a showcase for Nolan and how he now has a legacy behind him that the likes of Spielberg and Kubrick once knew. In Nolan we trust.
10.0~Dunkirk is a five star triumph mnmbruce Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan delivers a monumental, stunning war movie, full of suspense and quiet performances. The best war movies in history, including Saving Private Ryan and Hacksaw Ridge, have also placed viewers in the centre of battle. Nolan has not reinvented that immersive approach, but he comes close to perfecting it. It's a frightening, thrilling opening, but the thing that strikes you is the sound. At certain points, the musical noise engulfs everything, even the dialogue. The opening scenes visually invite us, the viewers, into the movie. Several soldiers, their backs to the camera, walk down an empty street in the French town of Dunkirk. Nolan leaves a space between them where we, the viewers, can fit, as if we're following them along the street. Seeing the film on a large screen makes it especially easy to glide into its world. Nolan's film focuses initially on one young man running from a flurry of bullets through the deserted streets at the beginning of the film. Running from sudden gunfire, the young soldier, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), arrives at the beach, which is crowded with troops waiting to climb onto too-few ships. From there, Nolan quickly establishes three different story lines and timeframes that are gracefully interspersed throughout the movie. Tommy, innocent and fearful, meets a French soldier, and they desperately carry an injured man on a stretcher toward the shore. Theirs is not a noble act. They are pretending to be medics in the hope of getting on a ship and saving themselves, which instantly sets Dunkirk apart from simpler, hero-driven war movies. Mark Rylance is the very heart of Christopher Nolan's brilliantly directed war movie, Dunkirk. Rylance plays a civilian who navigates his small boat across the Channel, hoping to ferry stranded British soldiers back home. Rylance's character, Mr Dawson, is part of the day- long sea action, in which hundreds of small boats are called on to help.
3.0~disappointed and at times bored jjluc Sign in Permalink I was so looking forward to seeing this film. While I can appreciate a different approach at this genre, I just didn't get it. The first half of the film was at times utterly boring. I struggled to stay awake. Things do get a bit better as the film progresses. At the end of the film I had such an empty feeling. After seeing classics such as Saving Private Ryan, the Pianist, Enemy at the Gates, etc. Dunkirk pales in comparison. Dunkirk reminds me a bit of the Blair Witch Project which was a new approach at the horror genre which was a total failure. At least the cinematography was good.
10.0~Too perfect omarh92 Sign in Permalink Fun fact, when Nolan said he'll make a virtual reality movie, but without the goggles, he wasn't kidding with Dunkirk, its too real. 2D, 3D, or IMAX (highly recommend IMAX for this movie), you will feel like you are in the battlefield itself, this is a technical achievement, the sounds and visuals are so realistic you will feel you are in the movie itself. This is the most realistic war film ever. The movie is INTENSE, the sudden noises can scare you, the incoming danger of bombers will worry you, Chris Nolan captured the horrors of war so well, you will feel sad and bad for each soldier who dies, this film is a beautiful experience of the true horrors of war. Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy well done. Harry Styles, best debut ever, you will love him here, he can act. All the cast were superb, I mean everyone. Michael Caine cameo is also there, just his voice. The film does not have so much dialogues, but the story is told so well through cameras, sound, and actors' movement, which just increases the intensity. Its more of a survival film then war action like Saving Private Ryan (no comparison), but the action again is phenomenal. The film is also just under 2 hours, but because of pace, and uneasy yet amazing OST by Han Zimmer (his new top work), this will be the slow but amazing almost 2 hour film.
7.0~Good movie, but wasted opportunity Apalerwuss Sign in Permalink I had high hopes for this movie, but was ultimately left a little disappointed. Everyone knows the Dunkirk story, and how the steely determination of a nation helped rescue hundreds of thousands of stranded soldiers from the beaches of France. As Churchill noted, it was a miraculous escape, but wars aren't won with evacuations. Anyhow, the movie was well acted, and well-enough made, but it felt as though they didn't really convey the true scale of the evacuation. Some 800 boats were used to transfer more than 300,000 soldiers from France to the U.K., so surely the English Channel should've been filled with boats. The movie just seemed to focus on a few boats, and a few soldiers, and it didn't do a particularly great job of illustrating the true scale of the evacuation. It was almost as though they were trying to save money by not having to recreate the scene. One thing I did like though was that there didn't seem to be a "star" of the movie. There were many well-known faces, including Kenneth Branagh, Cilian Murphy, Harry Styles (who was actually not bad) and others. But they all had relatively small parts, and clearly weren't brought in to "Hollywood-ize" the movie, which was a good thing. It wanted to focus on the story rather than the famous names playing the roles. Ultimately though, the story was a little disjointed, and it could've been told much better. I can't quite fathom why this has an 8+ rating on IMDB, it's more of a 6.8 IMHO.
1.0~Hyped up war movie that fails on many levels. tanyaian Sign in Permalink First I would like to rate this movie Directing; Camera direction good/ shots in focus 4/10 Script: Could of been written by a two year old. Comprised of about 10 simple sentences. 1/10 Music: I can only sum this up as painfully annoying to the point it began to override what was happening on screen. Kind of a depressing post apocalyptic vibe. 0/10 Acting: Average had almost a cloned look to a of of the characters had black hair. 3/10 Story: No, definitely lacked one, apart from some events that were taking place. basic story - 1. boat rescue father and two sons 2.soldiers on beach waiting to be rescued- 3. pilots flying around. 1/10 Emotional connect - None was made because characters never developed, saying a few sentences. Scenes started at Dunkirk war bit no pre Dunkirk character development. 0/10 This is an overrated movie along the same lines as Mad max fury road. No plot very little story big budget. There are some great war movies out there like the Imitation Game, and Unbroken but sadly this is not one them.
10.0~Oscar Worthy Period. HalJorda Sign in Permalink At this point, Nolan can make a Smurfs movie, and people are gonna still buy tickets and watch it. I'm not really into war movies, but I have seen war movies before like Saving Private Ryan and Hurt Locker. But no other movie in the world packs this much intensity. You know nothing about a character, you have no reason to like him, but you would still want him to survive. That's Nolan's magic. Previously Nolan set a benchmark for the Superhero movies, Mind benders, Sci-fi and now for War movies. Nolan and Zimmer worked in tandem to deliver a masterpiece that will set a standard for future war movies. This is probably the best cinematic experience I have ever experienced since Avatar. You will cry you will laugh, and you will awe every shot by Nolan. I hope Nolan and Zimmer will win Golden Globes and Oscar for this movie. I don't think anyone even deserves it more than these two do for this year.
6.0~A Strange Mixture of Emotion and Noise ruth44 Sign in Permalink As the daughter of a man who fought in WW2, together with all other male relatives in our family, I was anxious to see this film which should have been both an emotional and educational experience. Sadly for us it was a disappointment and left us wondering exactly why the film is called "Dunkirk". There are good performances and some emotional scenes, particularly at the beginning of the film. But the time line was so confusing and the beach was so empty considering that there were well over 300,000 men awaiting evacuation. And where were the 800+ small boats which sailed back and forward over a period of 8 days and, together with the larger British destroyers and merchant ships, saved almost 340,000 soldiers. We saw endless air battles which were beautifully filmed but weren't exciting or effective. Finally the music - Hans Zimmer is a wonderful composer of film music and his creation for this film was effective. But why so loud and so much? It was almost impossible to hear some of the text and I'm astonished that a director of the caliber of Nolan thought that this would add to the tension. Sometimes silence says far more than the constant background of very loud music. I presume that many of these things won't bother a younger audience but I believe that the story of Dunkirk deserved to be more accurate. The most annoying thing was the fact that in the brief introduction to the film, where there is an explanation as to the situation of the trapped soldiers, the enemy surrounding the soldiers is not named - they are just 'the enemy'. What happened to naming them as the German Army or the Nazi Army?
6.0~Excellent survival scenes, but nothing more kaspertm Sign in Permalink This movie is a technical triumph, you feel the soldiers' fight for survival as if you were there yourself. Trying to get out of downed plane, escaping a sinking ship, etc. The music with it's time ticking, edge of your seat sounds together with the pictures gives a repetitive feeling. Every scene sounds like a nerve-wrecking, pulse-pounding climax. The problem for me is that there is no coherent story and you don't really get to know the main characters. Maybe I was disappointed because I read all these excellent reviews, if not I might have given this 7 out of 10.
10.0~Great cinematography calvinchinthaka Sign in Permalink Great cinematography and casting. Its so for one of the best productions I have ever seen. Like all great war films, it's every bit as transfixing up close: at the wheels of the civilian boats scudding across the Channel, inside the cockpits of the fighter planes tearing overhead, and most of all on the beach, with those uniformed boys barely out of their teens, wrestling with the strange notion of defeat with honour even as they fight for their lives.
6.0~"We shall never surrender." classicsoncall Sign in Permalink I'm not going to go into a long winded review of why I didn't care for this movie because a lot of others have said it a lot better than I can. I will however, mention the comment of another patron of the theater I was at while walking out after the end of the film. When I asked him if he followed what was going on in the story, he stated that it was "not what I expected". A very diplomatic way of putting it. Because he was with his wife, and the couple was elderly, is probably the reason why he didn't say it sucked. What I got out of the picture was this - it was about soldiers drowning, near drowning, about to be drowned or already drowned. What I had anticipated going in, much as the aforementioned fellow movie goer probably did, was something that presented the sheer immensity of the evacuation effort that was the real Dunkirk. There's nothing in the film that approaches that size or scope, leaving one to wonder what made the events of Dunkirk so memorable. The topper for all of this for me was a newspaper headline near the end of the picture that declared the character George (Barry Keoghan) a 'hero of Dunkirk'. His claim to heroism - the teenager was killed by a soldier who declared his cowardice and didn't want to go back to the front lines. I don't mean to disparage the kid, he was just doing his job the best way he knew how. Regarding that scene which took place on a private boat in a rescue effort of evacuating soldiers, George's father came to that shell shocked soldier's defense before the event that resulted in George's death, stating to his other son that "He may never be himself again". Unfortunately, that's the way I felt leaving the theater.
1.0~Poor acting, bad plot budssubscriptions Sign in Permalink I heard good things, friends said best movie they've seen, it even won awards. It was rubbish. Slow. Plot was thin. I was really excited too watch it as well.
9.0~Wow danielschneider1 Sign in Permalink A miraculous story of English brotherhood which utilized real scenery and a ticking clock to create a sense of authentic urgency. It is more of a thriller than a war film because it's not bloody
3.0~A movie that wears the Emperor's new clothes. thinkMovies Sign in Permalink I marked my review as containing spoilers so let's get the major spoilers out of the way first: This movie has no plot, the editing utilized the concept of sticking random time-segments together, the characters have no motivation and no depth. The brilliant vestments critics assigned to this movie are the Emperor's new clothes. He is wearing nothing. So, let's cut through to the chase: If you want to see a better movie about Dunkirk, with (apparently) more extras, real characters, real story and an explanation of what it is you are watching and why, then, watch the 1958 Ealing Studios production with Richard Attenborough and John Mills. I must confess that when I was watching the few hundred people on the beaches, and the single boat coming from England, I was sure I'd see Matthew McConaughy looking for Jessica Chastain --so powerful was the connection to Interstellar created by the maddening, unnerving wall of sound that is the repetitive constant senseless soundtrack which is becoming a Nolan trademark. Finally, the single boat (OK, there was one scene with a few dozen boats that lasted a few seconds), well, when it makes its way back to England we learn that they came from and returned to Dorset. The Historical list of 750 or so boats does not include a single one from Dorset. The real boats left from Ramsgate, 39 nautical miles from Dunkirk. Dorset is 180 nautical miles from Dunkirk. Dunkirk was a great victory in defeat, with nearly 400,000 men saved and even in the 1958 English production it was true to life and proportions, where Nolan's 2017 production failed miserably and completely. I was so looking forward to watching Mr. Nolan's film and I must confess I am now quite upset at young Christopher for wasting my time and making such a mess of history. PS. At Google, the two more frequently asked questions about Dunkirk are 1) Is the battle of Dunkirk the same as D Day? and 2) Where was the evacuation of Dunkirk? Well! I guess the people who asked these questions are this movie's audience. Sorry! Really!
10.0~A Masterpiece of Epic Minimalism williampsamuel Sign in Permalink I wouldn't have thought you could make a minimalist epic. But that's exactly what Christopher Nolan did. I never would have thought it possible to make a suspense thriller out of events that everyone already knows the ending of. But he did that too. He's stripped away every unnecessary element; every subplot and war movie cliché until all that remains is the desperate men on and above the beach and an ever growing sense of tension. And it is magnificent. It begins with brief narration, then volleys of gunfire from unseen assailants at frightened men running through the streets. This will set the tone for what's to come. Although dogfights and scenes of bombing and shelling are frequent, we rarely see more than a glimpse of the Germans. Instead we're given a growing and almost palpable feeling of dread; the knowledge that the enemy is massed just beyond the horizon and that time is running out. With every near miss, and with each ship sunk or plane shot down the suspense grows. And no sooner is one disaster averted than another threat looms. We know from history class that most of the army will get home alive, but we don't know if the men we're following will be among them. The effect is almost like High Noon or Gravity in that the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of their seat, awaiting what comes next. Though we see thousands of men and dozens of ships in some shots, most of the movie is almost intimate in its focus. Most scenes follow handfuls of men on the beach, a trio of fighter pilots circling over Dunkirk, and the crew of small civilian boat. We share their desperation and determination, their hope and fear. We see the bravery and sacrifice of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances, and the cowardice and paranoia of men who have been through too much. Though we never learn their backstories or -with one exception- their names, their actions and their expressions tell us enough. The film's visual aesthetic is as minimalist as its narrative. Long shots of sea, sky, and beach abound, with a single boat or airplane to remind us there's a war going on. Even when the camera takes in the whole port and the thousands waiting on the beach, it only reinforces how stranded and exposed they are. Even the explosions are fairly restrained. The editing deftly adds to the suspense with frequent cuts between groups of protagonists during their tensest moments. There's even a bit of nonlinear storytelling, a la Tarantino. At times the film jumps back and forth between day and night scenes, and certain events are seen from characters' points of view half an hour or more apart. It can get a bit confusing at times, but it keeps things interesting and reminds us that the different actors are experiencing the same events in very different ways. Though very different from the grandeur of Saving Private Ryan or the sweeping scale of Patton, Dunkirk easily belongs in the same class as those masterpieces. It's another hit in Nolan's unbroken string of home runs, and proof that you really can do more with less.
1.0~Poor robcoxon Sign in Permalink One of the poorest quality movies I've seen in years hard to watch disjointed. Poorly directed and badly composed hardly any linear continuity I had trouble finishing the whole film. Why people praise this is beyond me when there have been so many better wartime dramas Just two examples say - compared to films like The Train with Burt Lancaster or Saving Private Ryan this film would put audiences to sleep.
3.0~A case of the emperor's new clothes pjmaguire-58402 Sign in Permalink I think about all the wonderful movies currently scoring around 7.9 on IMDb and I think about the end of Cinema Paradiso when the older Toto looks back on the all censored clips from the local cinema and I realise that movies, for me, are about understanding the human experience in all its shapes and sizes and emotions. Dunkirk would perhaps score highly as an avant garde documentary but for me it's a very disappointing movie in its genre and in absolute terms. I've watched Priv Ryan, 4th July, Apoc Now, Lawrence of A, Patton, In Which We Serve, ran, Das Boot, The deer hunter all multiple times but I cannot bring myself to watch this movie one more time. It's self indulgent and emotionally vacant and I could not care two hoots about any of the characters which is table stakes for any decent movie. Good cinematography alone does not maketh a good movie.
1.0~When did WAR movies become Comedy! scaryoutcome1 Sign in Permalink Exactly what the title suggests. This Movie, if you can call it that is an absolute joke. A film that literally fills your head with zzzzz's as you slowly embrace the bad acting, the emotionless characters and the most boring War action that you will ever see from any War movie. Sometimes I wonder who actually rates Films on IMDb 8.3 Comon at- least start being honest with viewers. It makes me wonder whether MR. Nolan knew that the script to this film was bad so he decided to throw in Tom Hardy for Eye Candy, Harry Styles for teens and Cilian Murphy {who did nothing} for credibility. I personally have never been a massive fan of MR. Nolan's work from the on-set as most of his productions have been over-rated hype. However this has to be his worst. Each character has a dialog of 10 words in each scene, MR. Hardy and above say as little as 10 words in the whole movie. The first hour was just noise from loud music continuously playing through-out the dead silence scenes. I am hoping someone will explain what happened after MR. Hardy was captured. I am wondering if it's a thing where you can sue companies for wasting 2 hours of my life.
5.0~Critics must've been paid big time... Giant disappointment BryGuySaysHi Sign in Permalink I have no idea why critics seem to enjoy this movie and I have no clue how this has an 8.5/10 (at the time of writing) on IMDb. I hope this is eventually corrected upon DVD release. This movie did have fantastic visuals and amazing sound, but I don't go to movies just for that. I need some sort of character development, which this movie offered none. The characters also looked very similar, so you tend to get confused at times. They try to get you to care if someone dies, but you just aren't attached to them so you won't care if they do die. They also talk about grand scale, but there is no grand scale here. Now, I know very little about Dunkirk, but I'm pretty sure there were hundreds of thousands of people. This film seems so small compared to that number. I get that the film maker wanted to put you at the center of the action to appreciate the grand scale, but it doesn't seem to work here. You may as well play a WWII video game instead of watching this movie. Honestly, this would've been better if it were a History Documentary instead. At least in that case, you would've learned a lot more with awesome visuals. Joking aside, I've actually never been so close to walking out halfway through a movie before. You will leave underwhelmed, or in my case, I was angry that I got duped by the critics.
3.0~Disjointed and lacking in a coherent theme alan_parkes Sign in Permalink Lots of good action scenes but severely lacking as a film into which you become engrossed. Some very strange occurences - a battle scarred soldier kills a young fellow on the boat, but the young chap's friends seem to to be indifferent to their friend's death. A Spitfire pilot with a limited amount of fuel seems to be flying around for the entire film. We go from scene to scene with no apparent link. All in all a very flawed film - I appreciate that we're all entitled to our opinion, but how on earth people can score this load of dross 10/10 is quite beyond me.
4.0~Lacked a true villain and gives little reason to support protagonists ParkingtonLane Sign in Permalink With great expectations for Dunkirk as Nolan has an incredible resume, I was extremely disappointed with Dunkirk. He does a time shift for the three POV's which gives an interesting layering of storytelling; however, what was the benefits to telling to story in this way? In Memento, there is a clear purpose to how Nolan uses time, but in Dunkirk it just seems trivial. Furthermore, there is no villain, Nolan just relies on "The Germans" as an excuse for us to undoubtedly support the British soldiers without ever showing an evil thing that the Germans do besides bomb the soldiers, which is what the British were presumably doing to the Germans. That being said, I had no real reason to support the protagonists. Moreover, Nolan appears to rely on the audiences knowledge of Dunkirk from school and such, but as an American I had no emotional connection to the battle as I had never heard of Dunkirk before. The Soundtrack seems to be just a lot of noise and doesn't build to anything, especially with the three POV's clashing at points. Also, the British accent can be hard to understand at points as an American. In conclusion, I feel Nolan did little to establish an emotional connection between the audience and the characters. There was no battle scene, which was disappointing. I left the theater feeling disappointed and unimpressed.
4.0~Not about Dunkirk and certainly not an epic movie. medicricci Sign in Permalink Possible spoiler for content: I went to see the movie full of hope it might be another epic movie living up to its title ala "Bridge Too Far" or "The Longest Day," but this movie was not about the evacuation of Dunkirk. It wasn't even a war movie, and anyone watching it would not know anything useful about the actual battle (that wasn't even an actual battle). First, the good: The graphics were well done, exceptional in fact. The pilot's eye view and shooting engagements were very good. The naval scenes when ships were hit, including interior scenes, were pretty well done as well. The larger vistas of the beaches were pretty good and copied from readily available historical footage. The movie's converging story lines of the three soldiers was well done, with the eavesdropping part giving a good entry for the general situation (aimed at audience members who don't know anything about the relevant history). A Ju-87 dive bombing attack at the beginning was pretty cool in giving audience members a chance to hear the notorious Stuka's siren. The bad: There was no real "air to air" per se--the German ME109s just flew in a nearly straight line acting like training drones for the British fighter pilots to shoot down. Inexplicably, instead of flying like fighters, i.e. at higher altitudes to maintain situational awareness and tactical superiority, everyone flew at sea level. German fighter bombers simply droned alone with escorts that apparently did nothing but get shot down for a chance to show the very good perspective shots. The occasional attacks on the beach were more for a look at an attacking plane, but really nothing else. The damage and effects of damage on people were superficial and not even close to reality, and there was no impression of the tremendous amount of equipment held by the British. Troops stood by the water in company sized lines waiting for ships that were not even visible, and no attempt was made to prepare for anti-aircraft response with rifles or shore batteries. Several scenes of the evacuation showed (or you heard) the impact of incoming artillery fire, but not one ship fired counter battery fire. The actors were all very pretty boy-models, except in one pretty lame subplot where the "bad guy" Brit had a slightly meaner set of eyebrows. In this scene, a squad of soldiers abandoned their unit and hid in a beached boat without the slightest sense of tactical or situational awareness, and hid. While hiding in the hull of the boat and awaiting the tide, during which time no one set up a guard or made any preparations to use the craft, some rifle/machine gun fire began hitting the boat's hull, creating holes that began allowing water to leak into the boat. Somehow, despite hitting the metal hull of the boat and not exiting, none of these rounds ricocheted or hurt anyone. The undisciplined group panics and begins to wonder how to lighten the boat so it won't sink. During this part, the "ugly" guy threatens to off a disguised French soldier so that his riddance would make the boat somehow more sea worthy. In short, this was not a movie about Dunkirk, but a drama centered about a few soldiers, a couple of pilots--all of runway good looks, and a civilian boat owner with a veneer of early WWII and a backdrop of Dunkirk that would only fool or engage someone knowing little to nothing about the actual history of crisis. It certainly wasn't a thriller or realistic, and it was nowhere near "epic." But the excellent CGI, coupled with a real story ala "Bridge Too Far" construct, could have contributed to an outstanding movie.
3.0~I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't good. michaelmccasland Sign in Permalink I'm a huge WWII buff, and really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't bring myself to. The cinematics in the areal scenes were great, and the sounds of the Stuka dive-bombers seemed pretty on point. That said, everything beyond that was disjointed, or dumbed down from the reality. This felt like a Disney does Dunkirk; very disjointed, and nerfed violent scenes. There were probably only ~8 aircraft, maybe 40 boats, very limited ground vehicles, and at most 200 troops in the movie. If you've ever seen photos of the real retreat, they left just about everything on shore. Bottom line, it's just not that great a film.
1.0~Nolan fanboys are ruining reviews muralidon924 Sign in Permalink This movie has no character development at all people are just dying and you don't feel anything heck i don't even remember the main characters name and i saw the movie yesterday. People are just overreacting over a Nolan movie i started sleeping in the end. showing different perspective of characters was unnecessary and i saw the same scene again and again and sometimes knew what was going to happen to the character
3.0~Potential, but it didn't deliver gamefreak548 Sign in Permalink As someone who's very much interested in history, watching this movie was a nobrainer. The trailer looked promising and got me pretty hyped up. That being said however, the trailer is the only thing good about this movie. 30 minutes into the movie and I was barely paying any attention to it anymore. It even got as bad as me starting a conversation with my neighbour who shared my opinion about this movie being a snoozefest. Turns out me and my neighbour shared the same holiday destination every year. Oh Right, the movie... even the action scenes were boring. It didn't even try to convey the desperation of the evacuation; just drop a bomb now and then and make the soldiers faceplant the beach when it happens. No sorry the movie completely missed the boat... ha ha ha...ha.. get it? Because dunkirk?
6.0~Nolans' Dunkirk, clambers wounded over the dune ameliericketts Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan directed a different kind of war movie with Dunkirk (2017): it is styled as a slower-paced psychological and emotional approach to the events set in Dunkirk when the English attempted to save as many men as possible as the German army surrounded the Allied Forces. If anyone remembers Atonement, it is this very same beach that the sisters lover ended up dying upon after contracting pneumonia. Many films have been produced about WWII, with quite a few consisting of the Dunkirk moment. The hopelessness in waiting whilst the Germans picked off ships and planes in the English armies attempt to escape is portrayed exceptionally by Nolan. Nolan tells the multiple stories at once, in an attempt to relay various versions and possibilities of experiences from men at Dunkirk. Cillian Murphy also has a story-line which appears out of nowhere. At first the viewer does not notice he forces the boys trying to escape the beach and tells them to go back and find another way. Then, we next see him alone, boat overturned and suffering from PTSD. And at this point, it is like 'where did he come from? did we see him before?' This is where the issues begin to present themselves. Where Nolan's Dunkirk tries to scramble across into the unnecessary is when the multiple story lines have cliffhanger moments which intersect and the viewer is unsure of who is going to survive the latest threat to the main characters lives. The cliffhanger moments are more something out of a Midsummer Murders (which I enjoy on a Saturday afternoon) and really present themselves as out-of-place in the slower- paced psychological trauma that is unfolding. Perhaps Nolan felt the audience would not stay for a non-action war movie and felt the need to plop such moments into the film. The most awkward part of the cliffhangers is Tom Hardy's character, Farrier, has his time re-arranged to be able to intersect with the other two story lines of civilian boatmen and boys on the beach. But this is not the oddest part of the Farrier time-line. What is a peculiar move on Nolan's part is having Farrier being the character who really drives and connects the other two stories. Yet, it is this narrative which causes the most confusion. Unfortunately, whilst it is great to see the trauma and the pressure- cooker situations of war in Dunkirk have been brought to life by Nolan and the actors all superb, with so many story lines occurring at once there is not enough time to flesh out each character. But perhaps that is exactly the point? How many men were able to get to intimately know the personalities of each men they fought with in a rough situation where men died every day? One aspect that must be commended, beyond the actors conveying the emotional and mental turmoil of Dunkirk's escape is the English forces abandoning their French allies for the sake of themselves. This is perhaps something not oft-spoken about and was good to see the injection of this aspect of the war politics into Nolan's movie.
2.0~very boring sohibmk Sign in Permalink There is no story in this film or they just made it look like it ! its a bad boring movie ! if i didnt know that nolan is the directer i would never think he did this rubbish
2.0~Not good vic-22965 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is not a good film, Christopher Nolan has tried to create a a classic and has failed, he concentrated more on Flying, and the Sea instead of the real battle on the beaches. There were no character development, no real story, and he messed with history, there were lines of soldiers and the rest of the beaches were clear, only a small part of the film were given over to the 100'a of small boats who helped take of the troops. I look forward to seeing the new Gary Oldman film about Churchill, who was never mentioned in this film, how can you make a film about Dunkirk and not have Churchill in it, my advice is to watch the 1957 film of the same name, far better with a story, a middle and an ending.
3.0~Where was everyone? iansephton Sign in Permalink The scale of the mass evacuation of the British forces in retreat, surrounded by the overwhelming Nazi forces, and rescued by hundreds of heroic small vessels never built to cross the English Channel should have been an amazing sight to watch unfold in this film. Instead, we were shown a number of vignettes which in isolation should have shown microcosms of the personal experiences of those involved in this unique drama. I wondered if the grand scale would be addressed by even more impressive CGI than seen to date, or, with the reported £100m budget, would we see hundreds of living extras? I would be disappointed on both options. The original film footage of the evacuation showed hundreds of men along miles of beach being dived bombed by Stukas, shelled by the opposing artillery moving ever closer, and dozens of boats and ships doing their best to avoid being sunk whilst pulling dozens of men from the sea to safety. Christopher Nolan engages his usual favourite actors (Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy better know in the UK for starring in "Peaky Blinders") but the result was disappointing. The storyline was rather comic book in the end with a far fetched conclusion. This was not the film I expected, but that means a much better film can yet be made of one of military history's most amazing defeats.
5.0~Boring, flat elmonkeymagico Sign in Permalink Nolan intentionally eschews traditional storytelling in favour of having no characters. As a result, I felt cold and uninterested. Visually a masterpiece. Is that enough? No I nearly fell asleep.
1.0~Please judithh-19657 Sign in Permalink Here we have a film that does not bother to put a couple of sentences about what Dunkirk was all about. Don't know it already? Don't worry, the film is so chaotic and noisy and violent that it is about chaos, noise and violence and it doesn't matter what the underlying story is. There is virtually no dialog, what there is is nearly incomprehensible. The music - praised to the skies by other reviewers - is not original at all, it is very much like the Jaws score. Intense, 'sposed to make you realize the danger afoot. Loud, relentless. The story of the soldiers being evacuated from Dunkirk beach, and helped by a flotilla of British folks bringing 'round their yachts and other boats, is told from the standpoint of what the soldiers endured before the rescue. One thing they endured was bombing by certain aircraft. These planes had camouflage and big red circles on them; I thought they were Japanese! Very confusing!! When I see big red dots on planes I don't think Germany, do you? This film is not entertaining and it is not educational. It was chaotic, noisy, violent and boring.
4.0~It has been a very big disappointment and I think it could be the worst Nolan movie ... sinancemtemiz Sign in Permalink The shortcomings of the script and the story are: The scenario used in the film has a lot of gaps and is full of bullshit ... The film has a split screenplay but nobody tells you the name in the film and you do not understand who you are like in the form of actors and all the complexity ... There is no proper dialogue ... There's a lot of time shifts in the film ... The film goes in 3 days ... On the first day, we come from the street and try to board the ship as a fugitive. The next day the ships departed and evacuated. Arrival by train on the third and last day. They find Cillian Murphy, who sits on a sinking destroyer, by chance, who is killing someone on the boat, no one says to the man "What are you doing?" (I do not understand how it happened ... the child pushed down 3 steps and died.) However, the incident is so complicated and incoherent that I could not make any sense that these 3 days would always show the scene of the landing of the helicopter in each other ... There are 450 thousand soldiers waiting on the beach. Why are you confusing this story ... Are 450 thousand people waiting behind the beach for the enemy? It is not ridiculous! There was no resistance in the place where we were talking about the last sandy hill, and the Germans did not even bother to attack it, just bombarded it with a bunch of tank firepower and so on. (Because the German army has waited for 48 hours in reality but nobody tells it in the film, you are watching like an idiot.) ... But the German troops are firing occasionally ... According to your head, I can not decide what to do. This film, in the meantime they shoot firing in their heads ... because in that last scene they hold their dry cargo ship to the fire, or in the first scene ... He stayed in the air for almost 5-6 hours with the plane running out of fuel ... In the place where he could turn the plane like a friend and bring it down to the sea (next to the evacuation ships), the plane is lowering it in the enemy positions ... Shortly after the plane comes down two enemy soldiers come and arrest this man No opposing fire is opened when we go down to enemy positions ... There is this unfinished American masturbation event ... The British and the French have escaped but they have come to say that we have come to destroy them ... A very simple result was the end of the movie with the linking part, 30 boats arrived and dozens of soldiers took out the soldiers they could not get out and went ... 330 thousand people, 30 boats and they went and they did not tell anyone that the air crafts of the German aircraft do not ... The submarines were pert and there was no plane left ... Even if the submarine floated to the water surface and hit the boats, even killing 100 thousand people ... The child seemed to be tricked ... Okay, here we are, we are gone, If you are shooting a war movie like I said, you can not tell this story according to your head on the same front line because it is contrary to the topic you are talking about, because it is against the war because everyone is doing the same job ... There is no such thing as an enemy anymore. The film was ruined ... This story could be explained much better ... In other words, the story of a manga soldier could be more clearly understood and more beautiful than a story of a manga soldier. Divide it with lines ... Come on to shooting problems: I do not know if 2d den can be caused but it seems to me that the images are terrible ... The whole world does not have to watch this film in imax, but this technology exists in very few places ... 2d scenes are sometimes clear, sometimes fuzzy, sometimes (primary person ) ... There was a lot of incomprehensibility in there, and there was always a continuous event that jumped up there, so there was no clear event, and the continuous events are intermingling ... Nolan's ambiguity continued here as well. He did not always use the same method of shooting. For example, while looking at a person's eyes, the camera is constantly trembling, shaking according to the man ... For example, when the torpedo is in the camera the camera of the stimulant is not shaken, The same problems exist in many scenes in the cinema or in the divine view ... Especially in the jet scenes, while the camera is swaying with the vibration of someone's plane, there is no such problem on the other ... The biggest minus in terms of cinema is that the film starts with a narration and ends in the face of a flat-faced man who has to explain what it is at the end that this unacceptable is a mistake that these mistakes ruins the film ... How do you not tell them what happened or how many died or how many destroyers sink ... Scandal a mistake ...
1.0~Shallow and historically inaccurate remindeer Sign in Permalink Yet another shallow hollywood product, devoid of any real history. The props and budget are great, but thats about it. Anyone with any knowledge about the war, or even half a brain would struggle to watch this one. Avoid this garbage.
1.0~Don't waste your time and money klanglotz Sign in Permalink I'm 66 and have heard about about the actual Dunkirk throughout my life. I heard nothing but good to excellent reviews and went to see it yesterday with high anticipation. I was 1 of only 3 people in the theater. As I watched I kept waiting for excitement and story to develop. - It never did. Throughout I felt like leaving but kept thinking soon the real entertainment would begin. - It never did. This movie barely resembled anything I ever read or saw concerning the evacuation of Dunkirk. The person I went with gave it a (-2). The movie had confusing characters and scenes. If you want to see a good representation of Dunkirk see "World At War" - episode 4 - ALONE.
9.0~Dunkirk - Nolan's Memento to Cherish fahycolm Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is the blockbuster director with the Midas touch – but it is not all about the money. Behind a powerhouse visual style, lies a writer of substance, a skilled craftsman who knows how to build a film from its beginning, middle and end and stuff it with tortured souls, each on his or her hero's journey, with labyrinthine twists and decoys enough to put an audience of Black Watch renegades through their paces. He has managed to take dollar-raking staples like Batman, and convince change averse nervous twitching studio heads that the Dark Knight needs to be dark and the fumbling penguin needs to be the tortured soul the subject of all our affections even if he is a mass murdering git. He did it and the coffers inflated like popcorn – who knew that inverting the norm could be attractive? But doing all that with the futuristic effects bloated blockbusters like Man of Steel or Interstellar is one thing - taking on the gritty and emotionally delicate subject of a war event that is as critical to British history and identity as the tower of London is another. Yet, once again Nolan has proved that no holy grail is holy enough to remain immune from his dismemberment. But, if something has to be torn asunder and reconstructed – then Nolan has quite firmly established himself as the man of the moment and with the visually stunning and narrative hall-marked DUNKIRK, we have another Nolan game changer. Jettisoning standard linear narrative ritual in favor of the iconic leaping and rebounding story line of his classic Memento, Nolan goes even one further abandoning the venerated three act play. In a most astounding narrative leap Nolan's Dunkirk casts off the 'WHY?'. It is an act of pure cinematic genius whose absence plays startlingly into his denouement of the infamous British forces rescue from the beaches of Northern France in the last week of May 1940. Many recent reviewers and critics have lamented the absence of a historical explanation as to why the events that were taking place were not fully extrapolated. But they have missed the point entirely. Nolan's approach was clearly to use his visual genius to saturate the viewer in the experience – the central character of the film is in fact the event – viscerally portrayed in vibrant immersive 70mm. The why of the event is not developed because the purpose of the exposition is to leave the viewer with a much bigger why they themselves most formulate having being fed into the action – it is not why Dunkirk – but why war? Nolan has managed to do what few great war films - despite their aspirations - have failed to do – he has succeed in documenting an event that crushes the viewer with the irrationality, the savagery and inhumanity of it all and yet plants the seed of a hope that humanity is moving in the right direction – all without any character for the viewer to cling to. Even "Tommy", a representative "Tommy" played by Fionn Whitehead – is underdeveloped so as to avoid the audience pinning its affections too tightly on any one role – that was never the intention. Where Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, the Thin Red Line, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July all railed against the savagery of war, the hook for the viewer was being dragged into a deep personal emotional attachment to a character whose fate punched the audience. Not so DUNKIRK. It is incidents within the event which hurt and the cumulative emotional response is much broader and much more impactful. For this reason alone it is hard not to begin to consider DUNKIRK as one of the very all-time war films. But there are other reasons. Recounted through three perspectives, air, land and sea, unfolding across different time perspectives, with each one ultimately narrowing down to a single colliding event, Nolan ties the viewer into an authentic confusion of time, space , event and order – hallmarks of a conflict experience in which the semblance of command structures is subverted by the urgency of the predicament. It is only the representatives of the homeland – personified by the brilliant Mark Rylance in the company of Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney – sailing with clear instructions and purpose, who represent the calm of normality – even when hit by tragedy. Outside that small oasis of hope, the desperation and claustrophobia of conflict is most brilliantly exposed through the cockpit firefights between the Spitfire squadrons and the Henkel escorted Luftwaffe attacks – making for some of the best aerial war sequences in decades. And although at times, the visuals are the stuff of small boys war stories – there is nothing trivial or scout in Nolan's treatment. In two very particular sequences he exposes us to the delicacy of heroism and the sometimes heroism in ordinariness. The aerial combat scenes stake on a particular significance when one realises the intensity and precarious nature of those sorties – a microcosm of the tremendous hazards of conflict, where the enemy is not just the enemy but the way circumstance leans. DUNKIRK inspires a reflection on the immense courage that all those men and women showed, not just in that event – but in the wider war which raged on for years after - at incredible human cost but, in the end, for a prize that many of us have, all too sadly, forgotten. We need to be grateful to great artists like Christopher Nolan for treating this subject with the respect and brilliance it merited. We need to be reminded of the huge victory that was ultimately the prize of Dunkirk and what that means today. We need to be mindful of the men and women who fought that war, those who have passed on - but also those who are with us yet.
1.0~Boring and historically inaccurate.. suley-uzan Sign in Permalink As the title said.. it's one of the most boring movies ove EVER seen. How did this get all this praise and all these awards? It's an absolutely terrible movie. I Iove ww2 movies, but I literally had to force myself to keep watching and stop.myself from falling asleep. Not to mention its incredibly historically inaccurate.. there are like 2 or 3 boats and 2 or 3 planes in the sky.. what the hell? Did the people who made this movie read or watch anything about what actually happened at dunkirk? This review contains no spoilers because there SERIOUSLY is nothing to spoil in this waste of time of a high budget video clip. You want to watch something about dunkirk?Watch a good documentary. Read a history book.. I mean seriously read wikipedia because even that is 1000x as interesting
3.0~Instagram movie for an Instagram generation Fraviesu Sign in Permalink A hipster looking at the horizon, light at sunset on the face... What a perfect picture to share with friends. This is "Dunkirk". What a soulless film, what a lack of epicness. What a lack of war actually, because this is a parody of war. Don't look for the intense feelings that warfare trigger in men, neither try to find here a good actorship, or script. Just sit and watch war according to your last smartphone pictures, that's it, and that's enough for most of them. Maybe I'm becoming too old...
6.0~Dunkirk: While in one place all hope might seem lost, in another place someone is making sure hope remains intact. damatu Sign in Permalink Dunkirk: While in one place all hope might seem lost, in another place someone is making sure hope remains intact. Dunkirk, is the life story, shown in land, air and sea, of 400,000 brave soldiers who couldn't make it home and are readily waiting by the French beach for the British military to come pick them up. Both, British troops and Nazi troops give a start to this movie. The British army finds it stuck on the beach and with their enemy's threat roaming them. On one side, the Spitfires offer their help on the skies by taking out the enemy's planes. On the other side, ships filled with soldiers and civilians are sailing towards Dunkirk, in order to rescue the troops that remain alive. The movie occurs in several places simultaneously; The pier: For one week, the things happening in the beach of Dunkirk in France start a week prior to the zone's evacuation by the military personnel. The sea: One day prior to the troops' retreat, civilian and military boats are summoned to the rescue of the troops stuck on the French beach. The skies: One hour prior to the military retreat, the aerial battle between the British and the Nazis. It's important to highlight that in every place the movie takes you to; a specific character gives that moment its life and relevance. In the pier, Tommy, a British soldier is stuck on the beach alongside thousands of French and British troops. While on the beach, Tommy finds another soldier burying a body. This soldier, later on reveals his true French identity and it's named Gibson by the British peloton. Tommy and Gibson enter the first ship, the one that hits the pier, with a wounded soldier on a stretcher and save the third soldier of the crew, Alex. Tommy, Gibson and Alex enter a second boat which ends up being torpedoed by Nazis. However, Gibson refused to enter into the dining hall because he couldn't afford to raise any suspicion by the fact that he was a French soldier passing as a British one. Gibson ends up saving Tommy and Alex's lives after the torpedo hit, which ends up saving Gibson's own life. It's time to analyse now what's going on in British waters, where the most influential character is the ethical Mr. Dawson, owner of a fleet of boats for entertainment purposes, comes into play. He's a former navy member and father of two kids, one whom is already killed by the war. His helper, a young boy, ends up going with him and sadly being killed after an altercation with a mentally ill soldier they rescued in the waters. Mr. Dawson is a guy who is as ethical as they come, for him; the first thing is to do what's right. He does not only care about his business or being safe, his ethics do not allow him to do that, he feels the need to help others and use his stance of privilege to do so first and foremost. He is socially aware before anything else. The third place where things occur is in the skies, The British send 3 pilots, two of them who die rather soon and Farrier, played by Tom Hardy who becomes the biggest hero. Their mission is to prevent Germans to attack the beach so people can evacuate successfully and safely. Farrier ends up taking most German air crafts by him and ends up clearing the beach from aerial threats all by his lonesome after his mates end up dying. Another ethical character, his duty before anything else, including his life. To conclude with, Dunkirk is about accepting, it's about honor. It's about being grateful, there's honor in surviving, even though you don't come off as victorious from a battle and are forced to retreat, your bravery is enough to be deemed as a hero. And on the other side, being a hero does not guarantee your survival. Both concepts, of heroism are related in plenty and multiple ways.
7.0~Good but could have been better coolantic Sign in Permalink Went to see this yesterday, since my uncle was at Dunkirk and there is an apocryphal story about him and a bike which I hoped might just be featured (it wasn't of course). Unfortunately, being the age I am, I will automatically compare this film with the 1958 version, rightly or wrongly. That version of course has character story lines whereas the 2017 version doesn't. I was impressed by Nolan's use of extras rather than cgi, but I have to say that the beach looks more crowded and chaotic in the earlier film which of course would also be using extras. It has been mentioned ad nauseum that the differing time windows for the three parts of the story cause confusion and this has to be admitted. I lost count of the number of aircraft shot down, only to realise belatedly, I was watching the same scene in a different time slot. Regarding the aircraft, again commendable that Nolan used real planes, and everybody loves to see a Spitfire in the air but, we needed more of them. Couldn't he have pinched some footage from the Battle of Britain, or even resorted to the dreaded cgi? Having said that, Tom Hardy helped us all realise just how difficult it was to get an enemy aircraft in your sights and then how much effort it took to actually shoot it down. However, the explosive sound effects were awesome. When the Stuka bombs hit the beach, I felt the explosions coming towards me rattling the rows of cinema seats. Similarly, the firing of the anti-aircraft gun from the ship made me feel as if I was next to it on deck! I also felt in the initial scenes on The Mole, the soldiers looked too clean and not like they'd just been chased halfway across France but, this was rectified in the end when they were boarding ships looking like scarecrows. Others have mentioned that the Nazis are not mentioned. A shot of a couple of German panzers and troop-carrying lorries advancing down a French country lane would surely have added to the air of menace and desperation. But, in the end, I'll admit to having an enjoyable afternoon watching this film; and my eyes did prickle a bit when the little boats appeared on the horizon. I thought they'd banned smoking in cinemas!
3.0~Underwhelming gordonmilligan-72371 Sign in Permalink I found the movie to be confusing, boring and very disappointing. The original was far better.
1.0~Bleak and hopeless. John K.-2 Sign in Permalink If you enjoyed the last twenty minutes of Titanic, then this film is for you. If you liked the bleak vision of humanity that Christopher Nolan portrayed in The Dark Knight Rises, you might like the atmosphere of this film. If you want a generic war-is-hell and survival is matter of chance film, you may well appreciate this. If you remember Dunkirk as a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat; as a near-miracle when for a full day a storm grounded the German air force in Flankers while the Channel was as calm as a millpond; as a day when sixty German planes attacked four hundred men on the beach and inflicted no casualties; as a time when men were buried hastily but with military honours rather than being allowed to lie dead on the beach; then this film does a huge disservice to the truth. Finally a note on accuracy. The film may look right but it is missing almost any detail that might bring hope into the situation. The images may be accurate; the atmosphere is more appropriate for a film about a concentration camp.
1.0~A Masterpiece of Emotionless Boredom elvispresley-65674 Sign in Permalink First of all, this is my first review on IMDb, and this movie made to do it. I've watched it couple of hours ago, and all I can say is don't go watch this mastersh*t. It's indescribably boring, and worst of all, there is no story whatsoever. People were leaving cinema during movie, while I was hoping something will eventually happen, but it didn't. I am so disappointed, can't believe this movie has so high rating. Probably in top 5 personal worst movies ever seen.
5.0~Review from a Nolan fan. Dunkirk is an experimental waste. iyergokul_9 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is a rather strange film. You may ask, is it a war film? Or is it a rescue tale based on a true story? Whatever the answer may be, Dunkirk fails to assert a response. The story falls flat and is covered by incomplete counter perspectives. There is no character development, the film lacks an overall essence of a war-torn environment. Now this may be a deliberate move, as the film progresses it sets a criterion to not represent an emotional war drama but to realize a genuine feel of a scenario of soldiers trapped, rescue undertakings and aerial assaults. Albeit the result is a hot mess with a non-linear but deranged narrative progression that takes the film nowhere. There isn't a titular character in Dunkirk. The film revolves around a conceivably three different viewpoints; The Mole, The Seas and The Air as depicted as. The Mole, stocked with allied soldiers from England, France and Belgium. Or as the movie explains it to us as. There is less to no introduction to any of the characters. We get stuck with a certain teen who is an English soldier trying to flee the German invasions. That's literally it, there is no one else other than Fionn Whitehead that the movie even tries to explore into, and the one we get to watch isn't as impressive either. He has very little dialogue, a fairly major involvement into the situation yet cast aside when required to. Oh and did I mention the French and the Belgians were included too? Too bad because the French involvement is minute and the Belgian almost non-existent. The next we move into the seas, where a band of three men, one too old for war and two youngsters head on a voyage to the place the target of the German forces, Dunkirk. "You're weekend sailors not the bloody navy." is as accurate a quote that the movie has managed to come to its assigned category. If I were to sympathize with a character it has to be Cillian Murphy who was harshly bereaved of his talents as a leading soldier to some jet fighter pilot who was cheaply stripped of his duties to mix in with the so indeed weekend sailors. And if he was to be the second-in to another main actor assigned to the aerial duties, which also brings us to The Air, Tom Hardy; then its another major setback as the bloody main guy assigned to save the grace of the soldiers, has less than ten minutes in his entire screen time. Hans Zimmer is the legendary figure once again working with Christopher Nolan behind Dunkirk, assigned to create the music, and he does again so masterfully. Zimmer's cold and monotonous "ticking" soundtrack is constant for the entire 1 hour 46 minutes the movie runs for. His score is nothing less than perfection, with suitable chords that sync with the scenes of unrest and horror portrayed throughout the film. With all that's told, the one fact I want to be bring up is that the background music is remembered or brought up because of two factors; Either the story line and plot adjust so well the score that it creates an unforgettable piece of art (something that the duo of Nolan and Zimmer have done so often in the past.) and gives us something to remember for a lifetime. On the other hand its the only piece of saving grace in the entire film. Dunkirk resorts to the latter, but I will also add that it conjures up very little that it results to the outstanding piece of music is the only thing that is noted for in the entire movie. Picture this. A war drama based on historical events of monumental status with the brains of a certain Christopher Nolan behind it. A sane man would have all rights to believe Dunkirk to be a tour de force of nature, but instead we get an experimental wastage that lingers around only with the use of an incessant soundtrack and some beautifully captured cinematography. Dunkirk is alas a non-visceral realization but an exempt from a supposed War Drama.
10.0~All war films should aim for such intensity jasonpetersettlen Sign in Permalink I am a Chris Nolan fan as his movies are always, gripping, far reaching and personal. This was no exception. An instant classic, absolutely absorbing and superb, riddled with plenty of suspenseful moments, multiple aspects, multiple stories and multiple times lines all connecting and impacting in a great tale of historical significance. The use of sight, sound and soundtrack are so well mixed it puts you on the edge of your seat. Stunning cinematography, amazing score and acting. Very touching and moving to watch. It needs to be seen in theaters for the full impact.
7.0~I wanted more ryanlaurencecole Sign in Permalink I really wanted to like this more. I find the story itself fascinating. Evacuating hundreds of thousands using practically anything that would float across the english channel is pretty remarkable. What was less remarkable was the movie itself. I didn't find myself becoming attached to the main characters. I felt myself wishing the focus would switch to some of the background characters who looked like they had more interesting stories to tell.
10.0~Live the Experience of a Real War... oh so human ro-150-237357 Sign in Permalink What has to be considered as one of the greatest films of all time, and a must see. Oh so human, running the whole gamut of human frailties, strengths and weaknesses, with great acting throughout, and Nolan as the new David Lean? This is a must at Oscar time, especially for the cinematography. A genuinely real experience and snapshot of nine days, not just British. Where 192,226 British and 139,000 French soldiers – 331,226 in all – were rescued by the 700 little ships (British, Dutch and Belgium) and around 220 warships. On a personal note pity Nolan did not get hold of the PS Medway Queen. Which my father was evacuated from Dunkirk on, he would never talk about his Dunkirk experience. Minor continuity error, the scene with Harry Stiles (good acting by the way) and others sitting on the beach. Nice shot of quayside container cranes in the background. Historical note; the first quayside container crane was not built until 1959!
10.0~An absolutely outstanding depiction of a truly horrific event. liam_robertson Sign in Permalink I am always relatively confident that I'll enjoy the work of Christopher Nolan based off his pretty decent track record, however this gripping re-imagining of one of the darkest moments of World War II stands as not only some of Nolan's greatest work but one of the greatest war films I have ever experienced. Dunkirk does not necessarily tell the story of any one particular character, but rather adopts the event itself as the films vehicle, resulting in an experience which uses its characters to portray the event rather than the event to portray its characters. This is presented through scenes taking place at different stages of the evacuation across the land, air and sea, creating a distinctive setting for each, but culminating in the same final conclusion. This being said despite Dunkirk's focus not necessarily being its characters, I did not find a single character performance in this film lacking or inconsistent with the tone or setting presented technically. In particular Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and debut actor Fionn Whitehead gave especially memorable performances consistent with the striking spectacle Nolan presents. As is expected with Christopher Nolan's films the visual presentation in Dunkirk has few rivals, the set pieces are outstanding with the use of breathtaking establishing shots to highlight the true historical scale of the real life evacuation. Action is presented in a smooth focused manner utilizing a few precise shots rather than an explosion of two second jump cuts we have come to expect in modern day action movies. There are multiple sequences which portray the pure fear, claustrophobia and disorder present in those final weeks of the evacuation and it is this ever present tension that will keep you engaged for the entirety of the run-time. However it is the sound design which truly made this production a masterpiece for me, delivering one of the most realistic representations of the terrifying sounds of War. Gunfire had a distinctly different tone to other films, being delivered with sharp crack, explosions where accompanied by a deep base and the famous 'Jericho Trumpet' made by the Stuka's presence be constantly reminded and portrayed the sense of helplessness present at Dunkirk perfectly. This is only enhanced by Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack embedded across the entirety of the film. Alongside Inception, Dunkirk showcases the exceptional talent Nolan & Zimmer have for combining meaningful score with striking imagery to create a distinctive emotional response from their audience. Through the skillful incorporation of an ever presenting droning base, screeching guitar strings and ticking timepiece the continual sense of urgency and dread felt by those both on land and sea is enforced across the entire film by this excellent soundscape. As a result I highly recommend that should you be given the chance you experience Dunkirk for the first time on the big screen, as the combination of a cinema screen and encapsulating surround sound will leave you with a truly memorable experience. Even though this is a film a majority will go into undoubtedly knowing the final conclusion, Dunkirk is an experience I highly recommend everyone consider, presenting a defining moment of modern history in one of the most technically accomplished and memorably striking ways, Dunkirk will undoubtedly go down as a hallmark in film-making for many years to come.
6.0~An OK movie but far from a great movie. goodtime-336-74081 Sign in Permalink Hard to understand the hype attached to this movie. As usual Director Christopher Nolan's penchant for the non-linear method of direction makes the usual shambles of the story line. Given the promotion for this movie I expected more and waited, unrewarded unfortunately, for the seminal moment that would lift the movie above the average to the epic magnitude of the actual event. The movie lacked .... scale. For example the RAF lost well over 100 aircraft during the evacuation but Nolon would have you believe only 3 RAF aircraft showed up. The Germans also lost well over 100 aircraft, some say closer to 200+. Same with the loss of equipment. Left on the beach at Dunkirk were enough weapons and equipment to equip 8-10 Divisions, and included 800+ field guns, 500 anti-aircraft guns, tanks, trucks etc etc None of that scale was represented. In fact the long lines of troops waiting on the beach in the opening scenes soon disappeared and the beaches were left empty in many scenes long before the movie reached its peak. The Seminal Moment in the actual event was that some 700+ small boats left England to help rescue the stranded troops. Nolan managed a "fleet" of about 10 or 12. Again, no sense of scale. Many are claiming this is one of the best war films ever. I don't think so. I felt short changed to be honest because it lacked the scale of, for argument sake, the opening scenes from Saving Private Ryan.
2.0~Boooo! TeaWithHoney Sign in Permalink I honestly believe that if I had started a shouting "boo" at the end of this movie, I'd have had a large chorus in support. What the heck? Three different time lines of differing duration, where we are forcibly jumped back and forth without warning? It's daytime! No, wait, it's night. Oops! It's day again...hang on to the popcorn Martha, it's night again. Hey, wait a second... didn't that boat just sink? Whatever genius Nolan has inserted into this film is lost in the mishmash. I left not caring for a single character. I was wondering just how long a spitfire out of gas can glide? Apparently it's far longer on screen than might be the case otherwise. The good? A very promising opening. The bad... everything else, including the music.
1.0~The Worst Movie I Ever Saw, I Demand a Refund tonyferrari-31022 Sign in Permalink 2 hours of nothingness. No characters, no story line. Just some planes flying in the sky, a some ships, and boats with occasionally scattered dialogue and a few bombs here and there. I actually feel the soldiers who served in Dunkirk was done a disservice by this film. It was truly that bad. I went because I saw it was a 9/10. This literally was the worst movie I ever saw. I could not wait to leave. I never write reviews but this film was deplorable in every sense. Did I expect it to be great? No. Good? Sorta. Fair. Definitely. Worst movie I ever saw? I didn't see that one coming. Not sure how you screw up a WW2 action movie about a cool battle but this Nolan cat apparently screwed the pooch on this one. Reviews must have been fake news / fake reviews lol. Omg. So terrible. Please folks save your money. As a matter of fact just give me half your money for the ticket and I'd be helping you out! Terrible, terrible, terrible.
4.0~Violent, Noisy, and Perplexing Waste of Time bizedsolutions Sign in Permalink The real subject of this movie is a true and beautiful story of how the citizens of England rescued over 300,000 troops trapped on a French beach in 1940. Unfortunately, instead of focusing on what really happened there, and telling the audience the story, the movie's producers chose to make essentially an overly noisy, violent study of how horribly soldiers can die when they are aboard torpedoed ships or standing in the open when the enemy is strafing them from the air and torpedoing them on the water. It's really unfortunate that movie producers today believe that, in order to get audiences into theaters, they have to focus on special effects and violent horror and, at the same time, can leave an audience to figure out a story on their own. I would bet that at least 90 percent of the audience at the theater I went to to see this stinker had no idea what 'Dunkirk'was really about when they left the theater. Any veteran should be really upset that a piece of real history was essentially glossed over in favor of emphasizing the horrors of war and special effects. I'm amazed that there isn't a 3-D version of this movie - or maybe there is??
7.0~Very compelling movie joosewavaneck Sign in Permalink Before I watched the movie, I thought that this would be another boring history movie. That was what I expected. What I got, was a movie that showed me what the Allied Forces were actually up against; how difficult the war was; what they went through. This movie was made so intricately, that it made me feel what the soldiers felt; the fear; the joy; the sorrow. Though my review differs from others, I do not care. This movie was excellent and I would recommend it to everyone I know.
7.0~Well told, dramatic and moving, if abstracted, story of a key WWII moment. HillstreetBunz Sign in Permalink The beginning of this obviously genuine and heartfelt version of an emblematic story of the broader British narrative within WWII seemed confused and out of time (I even wondered at the scenes of Dunkirk seafront which seemed to look as it does today, full of late 20c buildings)! Such distinct lack of context early on seemed deliberate (those who don't know this part of WWII history may take a while to be hooked) there was no mention of the Nazi war machine, or even the Germans, the ill defined and absent of menace foe was only briefly referred to, and then just by that almost passive verb 'enemy'. Sensitivity to our own time perhaps robbed the early narrative of immediate tension, and subsequently required a much longer build towards any real emotional involvement.The device of weaving the three services into a single set of events was an effective and engaging one, although director Nolans ever present commitment to convoluted story telling sometimes led to this viewer playing catch-up with which protagonist was where and at what point in the time line of the story. As one would expect from a director with his credentials, Nolans delivery and handling of action scenes was always impressive, but as the story unfolded and we started to gather some more intimate knowledge of the characters, and the complexity of the reality of the individual protagonists stories, as well as the moral fudging that is of necessity a part of war, this became an appropriately dramatic film and an ultimately satisfying version of one of the defining moments of the conflict, with enough emotional wallop to bring a tear or two to the eye. Rylance channelling the late and much missed Sir John Mills brought an Everyman integrity to the role that most reflected the story of the 'little fleet' that we know represented the best spirit of the British home front. All in all a very good film prevented from greatness only by an apparent unwillingness to fix the story fully in its time and place.
10.0~I cried... alexm-64443 Sign in Permalink Touching and scary movie. Almost no dialogue but manages to be very emotional. Some hairy scenes that may be stomach turners to some but well worth watching. The movie does credit to one western civilizations finest hours.
2.0~A Spectacle in Search of a Story jam-iii-1 Sign in Permalink The most remarkable about Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is that he entirely missed the whole story of Dunkirk which was about these tiny private boats, thousands of them, piloted by citizen-sailors rescuing hundreds of thousands of cornered British troops. This became a huge rallying point for the Brits before the Blitz when ordinary Britons actually saved 270,000 men. For most of Nolan's Dunkirk he focuses on Mark Rylance who appears to be out in the middle of the English Channel all by himself. In reality, the private fleet was a massive flotilla. If you live on the west coast of the US, imagine every private boat in LA Harbor, Long Beach and Newport emptied into the Catalina Channel. That's what Dunkirk was like. Where are all those CG effects when you really need them? Instead, Nolan seems more interested in effects that show troop transport ships being torpedoed and breached which is NOT the real story of Dunkirk. And that's not saying anything about Cillan Murphy's pointless flashbacks or Tom Hardy's silly Hollywood RAF pilot who shoots down German fighters without fuel or an engine. If you judge a film by the actual events that inspired it this is not inspired work - just another bloated CG spectacle with an over-mixed soundtrack, a much advertised 70mm picture, and in selected theaters, vibrating seats. Seriously. In that sense, Dunkirk is not a bad IMAX film - if only it were an hour shorter. If you want to see a good Dunkirk film, dig up the Dunkirk from 1958 with John Mills. A far superior piece of cinema.
4.0~Amazing historical fiction turned into a overblown art project. tjwalklett Sign in Permalink The subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating true life tale of heroism and patriotism which should present the perfect canvas for a filmmaker. However, this film falls flat. Instead of a glorious landscape that puts the audience into the battle itself, we are left with an impressionist piece in which the audience must provide their own dialogue, character depth, and epic size. As other reviewers have stated what did they spend $150 million on? Dunkirk essentially presents a couple thousand men standing on the beach waiting for a ride, with a couple of planes flying around. Not exactly "Epic." If you walk into this film expecting Saving Private Ryan, you will simply be bored and left unsatisfied as I was.
10.0~Dare I say it? Better than SPR cruxiaer-vance Sign in Permalink Most war movie follows a protagonist or a few "hero" characters which is the norm for Hollywood action movies. In my opinion, Dunkirk had little to no action. It is about the soldier, the human emotion and the morality. Some complained about the movie having too little dialogue to tell the story but I disagree. The use of sparing dialogue is used to further strengthen the display of human emotion when under extreme stress and threat. For a historical war film such as this, I suspect Nolan didn't even care about telling the history side of the story too much because he'd expect you have already read a little on the subject. This is a very different take, refreshing and intimate, than other "hero" war films. The fact that Nolan achieved a war film with no hero characters, minimal dialogue and hardly any action is amazing. To people who complain about those, you simply have no sense in cinematic values or you find it hard to comprehend the story of what Nolan is trying to convey. The story is not Dunkirk, the story is the people at Dunkirk.
6.0~Probably well filmed but a messy film to follow and take in Robert_duder Sign in Permalink War films are similar to Westerns, we just don't see many of them anymore. While I do believe Christopher Nolan did some incredible films, I felt like after the Batman franchise his ego overtook talent and now he thinks everything he makes is gold. I thought Dunkirk would just be a solid, potentially moving film about an important battle in World War 2 history. Some reviews seem to indicate that is what some people saw. To me, it was a story with good cinematography, impressive practical effects, a rousing score but empty characters, a non-sensical and pointless chaotic chronological plot and a slow pace. I get that the point is to focus on all the men and the event as a whole and that works but in order to get truly invested as a movie goer, I think you need some character development and hero or heroes that you care about and I couldn't even tell you a single name in the film. The performances are all perfectly fine but the script is non-existent. They are just faces on a battlefield and it's very hard to connect with the incident. Towards the end of the film there is a big moving moment when the civilian boats arrive and there are tears in the eyes of the soldiers and I felt nothing. It was like watching a documentary but even less connecting. There is a lot of newcomers on the cast, done on purpose by Nolan to get fresh faces, and then a few names. Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance, Tom Glynn-Carney, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Harry Styles (Yep that Harry Styles) and Jack Lowden are the main cast. Mark Rylance probably gives the best most memorable performance. He might be the only one you really get a back story on or something to actually understand him from. Everyone else gets plenty of screen time and some good scenes of fear and emotion but the lack of dialog and climactic scenes leaves you confused about whose who. I knew Tom Hardy was in the film but barely realized it was him until the end. Kenneth Branagh gives a very small, woefully underused part but has solid emotion to it. Harry Styles does a great job in his role as well. The film teases a few twists to the characters but it's so painfully forced down your throat that finding out otherwise is almost expected. Christopher Nolan has done some of the biggest films of our generation. He also did some of the most brilliant (Inception, Memento) but as he continues to make films he goes bigger and bolder and uses elaborate pontificating tricks to make his films seem so great. The reality to the movie going public of 70mm film or whatever it is being important is pretty low I think. I do really respect him for practical effects because I think CGI and Digital is way overused. The scope of the battlefield and the air fights and the ships on the water are all really well done. The claustrophobic feel of some of the scenes really is good. It's just lacking the connect that draws you into the battle. You won't find yourself invested in any of the characters period. I'm surprised this wasn't a November release for awards season though we will likely see it in the technical awards. 6/10
4.0~Ehh...OK trips-82608 Sign in Permalink It was OK. Not great like I hoped. Movie failed to present this in proper scale to me. I would have liked to know characters rank and title and what their responsibly is. This event was much more violent than told here. Tom Hardy is an awesome actor. Could we not have seen more of him?
2.0~Snoozefest DollyLeia Sign in Permalink This movie was all over the place and extremely boring. Lots of overly dramatic build up and then it sputters out like one of the Spitfire's landing in the sea. There really were no leading characters, just different story lines that merge together in the end. I did not feel the fear or suspense of the retreating soldiers like some of the positive reviews have said. I understand that not every war movie needs to be gratuitously violent and rather tell a story, but the characters really had nothing that can excite or interest a viewer. Most of the characters are extremely boring and show little to no emotion. The one shell-shocked soldier portrayed seems almost forced. I never really cared about anyone because they were all severely undeveloped characters. I don't even know any of their names because they were so forgettable. Lacks in action and story. I am sure that their is a great story to tell about Dunkirk, but this movie didn't deliver.
2.0~Unbalanced and Missing major points. Ric44-239-690423 Sign in Permalink Disappointed. I honestly was expecting a better movie. Plenty of aerial combat outweighing repeat scenes of men dying on the beaches, and drowning. I found the story line sadly lacking as from my memory of the story and history I thought much more emphasis should have been put on the civilian armada that went to their rescue. Why Dunkirk stood out among all the battles and atrocities of WWII? Yes, they had one boat with father, son and a friend who was hardly necessary to story line, but in history there were hundreds of vessels of all sorts that floated. I remember having a real sense of pride in how we British non-combatants went to the rescue of not only our sons, fathers, brothers, but anyone on the beaches.This was not conveyed at all.
9.0~Not a movie, but an experience bhumitra Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has a unique style of story telling. Right from the first scene of the movie you are engaged for a complete almost 2 hours. This is a must watch in IMAX to experience it better.The movie is shown from Army Airforce & Navy perspective where all 3 forces came together to rescue 400,000 members.Dunkirk will be compared from other WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan but then too this is a unique drama war scene intense thriller. 90% of movie has a very intense background score (Another brilliant work from Hans Zimmer).The movie is too loud. Whenever Christopher Nolan & Hans Zimmer comes together they make sure to make some intense background which is engaging & at the same time its thrilling.Be it Dark Knight or Intersteller. The film shows technically a defeat but this film doesn't include any heroism of a single character also. This is a story of survival.This is a story of evacuation.The film is neither too short nor too long but it just gives you a perfect dose of a intensity,drama,& war.A very mature cinema.
5.0~Dunkirk is more of a Video Game than an appealing movie gijreb Sign in Permalink I was disappointed on seeing the movie Dunkirk, which was given a 4/5 rating. 1- Too much of the movie is made of very realistic computer generated motion pictures. It appeared to me that all of the airplane dogfight scenes were completely computer generated. There simply is too much computer generated graphics. 2- You need to know the history of this event to be able to make sense of the movie. Very little background info is given. If you do not notice the different types of helmets worn by the soldiers, you will not understand the movie. There is no background history given. 3- The soundtrack is a bit repetitive and when it becomes noticeable, it means that it hast lost its effectiveness. 4- During normal speaking volume, the background music is far too loud and makes it impossible to understand what is being spoken. 5- Last but not least, the audience cannot identify with any person in the story, and thus the movie has very little emotional impact on the audience. It leaves one cold and un-involved and hardly interested in the outcome. Do not expect a story that pulls you in and grips you with sympathy for any one or more characters. There are just too many scenes of dying soldiers whom the audience has not come to know in any meaningful way. The actors all look very similar, and it is hard to distinguish which one has just died and which one is still living. This movie is a wannabe documentary with little historical context and no emotional appeal.
1.0~A completely disastrous and inexplicable missed opportunity Chazza_Bath Sign in Permalink What a disappointing, totally unconvincing and bizarre film. A tragic missed opportunity to tell one of the most dramatic stories in history - the escape of an entire army with only hours to spare from one of the most brutal and frightening enemies of all time. Anyone with even the most basic knowledge of Dunkirk will see that the scenes in the film bear very little resemblance to the real events. In this film Dunkirk town appears without damage, the evacuating army is miniscule and the German air attacks laughable. Just look at any of the real film or photos of the Dunkirk operation on the internet and you will see the contrast. For that matter look at any of the combat scenes in, say, Band of Brothers, to see the contrast also. I was left totally disinterested in what was going on and was skipping forward through the film to get to the end. I would recommend that you watch the 1958 film of the same name with John Mills if you want to see a tense and realistic portrayal of the evacuation.
2.0~Save your money and just watch all the trailers, the movie doesn't offer much more. visitor-13 Sign in Permalink I don't know why this movie got ANY user reviews above 5 ... There was absolutely no plot development and very little character development. The score (shepard scale) was a droning never ending headache inducing annoying noise. To compare this film with Saving Private Ryan is beyond ridiculous. The story of what actually happened at Dunkirk during WWII is not told in this piece. So much more could have been told. l would venture to say that a majority of those born after 1950 have NO IDEA of the scope of the Dunkirk Rescue and the events leading up to it. This picture does a DISSERVICE to those who lost their lives during this failed operation. In closing I can only say that I do not know which was the greater disaster, the actual event, or the film depicting it!
1.0~Poorly acted and Poorly written jravot-20587 Sign in Permalink This was such a bad movie that i had to write my first review ever. this is a movie that could and should have been a lot better. Iv'e loved every war movie i have ever seen until now. I couldn't care less what happened to the characters as the parts were so badly written.I have a $5k Dolby Atmos home theater system and the sound was beyond bad. The visuals were very good hence the reason it got 1 star (also I couldn't give it a 0). Christopher Nolan completely wrecked the story and made the Spitfire pilots look like idiots as they all chose to crash instead of ejecting.) One pilot even managed to shoot down German fighters while gliding as he was out of fuel, he could have ejected over the beach among the British soldiers but chose to land and burn the plane and get captured instead. This movie made me hope that the real soldiers weren't so stupid. I sincerely hope no veterans watch this as it paints a lot of the soldiers in a bad light. This movie shouldn't have been made.
1.0~Pure propaganda sirallistercollins Sign in Permalink The war should have been over in 1940 due to this massive error by the allies culminating in Dunkirk -- but the German High Command (Hitler) was told by those who pull the strings on war, to let them escape, which subsequently occurred without a whole lot of drama. As such, can't really depict the "brave" allies fighting the ruthless Germans, can we? Nope, nor can we make this movie very dramatic. Although some small groups of Nazis may have caused a few skirmishes in Dunkirk (out of confusion that such a ludicrous order would be given to let the Allies escape), it was nothing even remotely close to what they faced on the D-day beaches years later. In fact, there was more drama among the Germans (Panzer divisions, particularly) who were seriously contemplating disobeying orders from High Command and moving in to decimate and then capture Allied troops. All war is a racket (phony) -- General Smedley Butler. And the Dunkirk debacle is one of the best instances of any major war that the top leaders on both sides are always in the pockets of those who control the purse strings and stand to make the most money from tragedy. But here we have the Hollywood spin masters flipping the script and telling us otherwise. Pure propaganda.
7.0~Great movie justanotheruser752 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS ALERT When I was told that Dunkirk was directed by Christopher Nolan, I was immediately drawn to it, and I knew I had to watch it. Needless to say, I had very high expectations, for I am a huge fan of Nolan's work. Once the movie ended, I was left feeling empty. There wasn't a major plot twist. Instead there was an attempt to make the audience feel slightly better. Let me clarify: from the very beginning, the movie is clear – this movie is about war, death and survival at its finest. Soldiers die and if they want to survive, they must not look back and continue to run until they've reached a safe – or better yet, less dangerous, - place. The story line develops and we become aware that there are about 400.000 British soldiers (plus French and Belgium ones) trapped on a beach in Dunkirk. The goal is to get at least 30.000 of them. How? By the ocean, obviously, but this is a very hard task, for the enemy is constantly attacking, making it nearly impossible to escape. The movie doesn't focus on many characters. On the contrary, actually. Truth is, even though the screen time isn't split by many soldiers, we still don't get to know the name of some of them. Or their background, for that matters. Some people might feel like that's the movie Achilles' heel, because it created a lack of emotional connection to the characters, but I am forced to disagree. I felt incredibly sick since the very first moment. There's no need to know much about the characters – the situation they're encountered in is the emotional connection to the audience. They know that they are most likely to die, because not all of them will be able to leave the beach. And it was impossible for me not to feel deeply for all of them. Certain philosophical themes are, too, explored: there's a scene in which the soldiers get into a heated argument because some of them try to force a French soldier to leave a boat (that they all found and were planning on using it to escape, before they were under attack) and one British soldier strongly stands up for him, for is it really fair to stop valuing someone's life to save our owns? Is it ethical to throw someone into the wolves (quite literally) for the sake of other people's lives? Due to the situation they're in, is it justifiable to value certain lives over others'? In the end, they are able to save many British soldiers (over 300.000) and yet, the captain (?) chooses to stay to help the French soldiers get home – I couldn't help but think what would've happened if that number was far lower. But afar from the plot itself, Dunkirk has another trick up its sleeve: the cinematography. It's a beautifully shot movie. The colors are cold: a lot of grey and pastel colors are seen throughout the film to enhance the fact that there are no really happy endings in war. Once they soldiers are back home, they are seen on a train passing a warm green field, but even after that, the audience doesn't really feel any better – but I think Nolan wanted us too. The soldiers are worried they will be portrayed as weak and a waste of space, since everyone went through so much trouble to save them and the war isn't even over yet. However, the soldiers are welcomed into warm embraces. But, we cannot feel better, because the truth is many of them are dead, and the ones who aren't will always have the horrifying memories of what happened and of what they were forced to become.
9.0~A new masterpiece esteban_dm2 Sign in Permalink You did it again Cristopher, What a movie! Since the very beginning we feel intimidated, surrounded, stalked, lurked by an invisible enemy (have you noticed that this is the first 2º WW movie which does not show the Nazis, only a few planes); a powerful discomfort increased by this new brilliant Zimmer Score, that stings deep into us, while the beautiful photography depicts a very desperate scenario where you can almost feel the need to be rescued and get the hell out of DUNKERKE. A different type of war movie, not violent, not visceral, but provocative all the same. "We shall not surrender". 9/10.
8.0~Superior craft jonathan-harris17 Sign in Permalink Not your average war film, there's not much on dialogue, narrative or heroics to be found here but what I did find was a portrayal of endurance, and one hell of a well crafted piece of cinema. Rarely do I believe in the 'needs to be seen on the big screen' espousal thrown at many big budget efforts, but in this case I really wish I'd seen this on IMAX rather than the small screen. The only real script note in play here is the intentionally mind-fuddling overlapping time narratives, a bit Inception-like and not, where the 3 main areas of interest: the initial group of soldiers from the beach, Tom Hardy in the skies, and Mark Rylance in his little boat, slowly conflate together in their own little time bubbles, it is I suppose meant to parallel how confused that event really was even if it could be described as a little too on the nose. The technical aspects here, the scale and practical effects are sheer wonderment. How anyone could find this 'dull' with that pulsating score keeping the tension up whenever it wants (more often than not) kept my attention. Superior film-making.
9.0~This movie could have waited for Red Box wendyluhardy Sign in Permalink I had been waiting to see "Dunkirk" for months & planned on seeing it on 21 July, the opening night. Rarely does Hollywood put out a movie that I'm willing to see right away, but "Dunkirk" looked like a fantastic movie. What a letdown; I was so disappointed. The trailers made it look so exciting. I mean, how could it be otherwise? The Battle of Dunkirk was perfect movie material: in the spring of 1940, over 300,000 British & French soldiers were trapped on the beaches around Dunkirk, making them sitting ducks for the Germans. The British military called for civilians w/boats to sail across the English Channel to Dunkirk to pick up as many men as possible & bring them to larger ships, as the larger ships could not make it to the beach- -and they succeeded. Surely an event worthy of a movie on a grand scale. Unfortunately, the trailers showed the best parts of the movie; everything else was a letdown. Not a lot of dialogue (which could barely be heard above the background noise) and little to no character development, which I consider essential to any movie. I swear Kenneth Branagh--one of the best actors in the world--did not have more than a few lines. Neither did Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, both great actors. Only Mark Rylance had a decent speaking part. There was not an opportunity to get to know the characters in the movie, what kind of men they were or personalities they had, what they might be thinking or feeling in their horrendous situation. Nolan never gives you a chance because it's the focus of the movie seems to be everything but the characters themselves. And the film was disjointed & lacked continuity. Of course all aspects of the battle had to be shown: from the air, from the sea, from the land, so jumping from Mark Rylance in his boat to Tom Hardy in his fighter/bomber and Fionn Whitehead on the beach was necessary. BUT you couldn't always tell when anything was happening. At one point it was nighttime at Dunkirk; you could see the fires & the lights on the beach. Then you'd see Tom Hardy in his plane or Mark Rylance on his boat--in broad daylight. Why? What time of the day was it? I thought it was night. If it's nighttime on Dunkirk then it's nighttime in the air & on the Channel, but we never see that. The events seemed out of order. Chris Nolan is a good director, but he could have done so much more. There should have been more character development so you could get to know these men better & empathize w/them & their situation, thereby becoming more involved in the movie. But he did not do that. My mom had wanted to see this movie (she's almost 80 & hasn't been to a movie in years). I told her to wait until it comes to Red Box and watch it. I mean, it's not a bad movie; just not as good as it should have been. It's not so much a war movie as it is Chris Nolan's version of a war movie.
6.0~Batman Soundtrack in a WWII Film? bmco-247-721025 Sign in Permalink After seeing previews showing authentic WWII aircraft, I thought "Wow," and couldn't wait to see this in our IMAX. While the visuals were indeed superb, I found the "Batman" like dramatic soundtrack intended to ramp up the viewers anxiety levels during intense battle scenes overwhelming. This effect was used throughout the movie and in my opinion was completely unnecessary and became progressively annoying as the movie played on. Frankly, I think the action sequences were sufficiently thrilling alone, where including an instrumental soundtrack only served to distract the viewer from any sense of the realism portrayed on screen. It's unfortunate that Christopher Nolan choose to portray this event in a "Batman" like dramatic setting. I did feel the movie was entertaining, but not nearly the caliber of a "Saving Private Ryan" quality as I was hoping for. There are several stories playing out, leaving insufficient time for character development to the extent needed to make you really care about anyone in particular. There were also a couple of action sequences that strained credibility if you are a WWII realist, but fortunately not so many that it came off as a "Rambo" type film. I think most will enjoy it as an above average WWII offering with great visuals. With a few tweaks, it could have been much better though.
1.0~Boring leagal99 Sign in Permalink No idea who the characters are or what's really going on. Just scene after scene without focus.
6.0~A visual wonder that lacks depth ferped Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a visual genius: this film is just stunning to look at. From the bullets flying near soldier's head to gorgeous explosions, it transports you right into the war zone within the first 10 minutes of the screening. Furthermore, it is an accurate description of the "Miracle of Dunkirk". This is where the movie nails it. However, apart from that, I've had a couple of issues with it. The film is told from three perspectives: Air, Mole and Sea. This is where the movie falls a bit short. The editing at some points feels lazy and not very consistent: it cuts from a dramatic scene or intense action scene very quickly. The film is told in a non-linear way: this makes us watch certain scenes twice through different perspectives. Although this could've been done in a very interesting way, it's very difficult to keep track of whose perspective we're watching at times. Even when certain semi-important (I'll get back to this later) soldiers die, it took me a while to realise this happened. This is where my third and final problem come into question: the characters lack depth. You don't care about the main character, nor any of the other soldiers that are dying. If I'm watching a film about war, I like to bond with the characters I'm seeing on screen. If none of them show any real emotion, the viewer won't as well. All in all, Dunkirk could've been amazing. I personally don't understand why it has such a high rating besides being directed by a very well-known director / starring famous actors (including infamous Harry Styles) / being a war biography. Disappointing.
2.0~Another disappointment simon-186-303310 Sign in Permalink What can I say about this film that doesn't slate it too much, everything. What a load of boring drivel, all the adverts saying it's a masterpiece, best acting ever, pffft. We are basically shown in this film that our ships were made of paper, one torpedo and they were sunk in 2 minutes, the fighter pilot has no aim whatsoever, he rarely speaks and then instead of landing his plane on a safe part of the beach or in the sea he decides to land miles away from anywhere but right in front of the Germans, which by the way is pretty much the only time you see one. In another part some soldiers are trying desperately to sail a boat full of bullet holes by sticking their fingers in them, like that's going to help. Now don't get me wrong, I totally understand how awful it must have been for the soldiers standing their waiting and the pain and suffering they had to endure, but this film did not really portray that at all, what a shame that all the radio and TVs hype yet another movie just to make money, there were so many other random scenes in this film almost as if someone picked up lots of bits from the cutting room and stuck them all together. Sorry but this film is a no no.
5.0~Does NOT live up to the hype joeyesthatsme Sign in Permalink I remember when Dunkirk came out, there was a lot of hype and rave reviews. Watching it now, a year after release, I'm disappointed. I'll start with what I liked: the costumes looked authentic, if not a bit too clean considering they are on a beach running for their lives. I thoroughly enjoyed the dogfights, mainly due to the cinematography. In fact, the dog fights are the only parts of the film that I thought had decent camera work. The rest of the film had shots that felt too cramped, dark or confusing. British officers mentioned there were 400,000 men on the beach but you never see more than a few thousand. Some shots of the British merchant fleet lingered for way too long. The sound was clearly designed for the IMAX experience, so I couldn't get the full feeling out of my meagre 5.1 system at home, and therefore I won't comment on the sound effects. However the music was straight up horrible. Is anyone else getting tired of Hans Zimmer and his atmospheric beats? They serve the same purpose as those cheap videos you find on Facebook where the music makes something seem to have emotion. If you turn off the music, you are left with an emotionless husk of an advertisement. Well I felt like it was similar in this movie. Way too forced, exaggerated and always in the background. Finally, the timeline was just plain confusing. Some sequences felt like they were supposed to be happening simultaneously, except one location was in night time and the other in day. Sometimes I felt like the characters were in the middle of the channel when in reality they were a couple of hundred metres from the shoreline. And some of the soldiers that the movie follows look almost exactly the same, further confusing who you're supposed to be looking at. All in all, some individual scenes had great action, tension and authenticity to it. But these were few and far between. The modern port cranes at Dunkirk, the rows of soldiers in clean uniforms, forced music and overall confusion all served to take me out of the movie.
9.0~The agonizing war of Nolan eagandersongil Sign in Permalink Agonizing, claustrophobic, oppressive, sweeping and sonorous, these are the verbs we can use to compose Nolan's new film, which this time stands out by the technique and not by the script, "dunkirk" is a film that invites the viewer to Sit in the armchair and sodomy in the best sense of the word, because you suffer, drown and fight along with the characters, "dunkirk" is a survival film, barely have hand-to-hand or shots, or even dialogues, That we have here is the purest survival instinct alienated to a setting and a wonderful sound mixing and editing. We have a script that is characterized by three nuclei that unite around a goal, rescue and assist the French and English soldiers trapped in Dunkirk beach, the script contains few dialogues and little character construction, and leaves the viewer more distracted completely Lost, but those who pay attention will be amazed by the almost orchestral narrative that Nolan builds. The script tells the story of the rescue of the British and French soldiers following three points, by the sea, where tells the story of a civilian who provides his boat to help rescue, in an area, where tells the story of three pilots responsible To give air protection to the soldiers trapped on the beach, and by land, where it shows the anguish of the young soldiers struggling to survive. "Dunkirk" does not soften, and makes the viewer feel the horror of war in its strongest fullness, we have no moral lesson or a message to convey, we have only horror and despair. Raríssimas times a film stands out for its mix and sound editing, but Dunkirk is a film that shouts "ME WATCH IN A CINEMA, AND OF PREFERENCE, IN THE IMAX" because its sound quality is something inexplicable, extremely terrifying, of jumping in the chair And bite your nails, to bend down along with the soldiers and hold your breath to keep from drowning, aligned to that we have a dizzying trail, we have a trail that draws attention and is always present, and a more fleeting that dictates the rhythm of Film, we have a "TIC, TIC, ICT, TIC" all the time, that sound, it is our heartbeats, that tightens and loosens according to the tension of the scene, this is wonderful and a great intelligence, To this sound and he dictates not only the film as our anguish, it was a play of master the introduction of this simple element that can go unnoticed by many, we also have to mention the great assembly of the film, which alienates the three nuclei perfectly The bluish photograph that shows us an extremely tropical and beautiful climate, as opposed to the terror shown on the scene, and last, but not least, the art direction, which performs its role with mastery, showing all the details, clothes , Accessories, boats, airplanes, is beautiful to see. Nolan has a giant budget for his films, and could bring practically the actors he wanted, since it was the money, he still has a name, but no, we have not one actor in the movie to put on the giant poster, our biggest name here is Mark Rylance, winner of an Oscar for best supporting actor, and of course, Fionn Whitehead, better known by his band than as an actor, nonetheless, all the actors are well in the movie and they fulfill their parents, and that goes yet another idea of As the war was made by anonymous in the midst of the multitude. Nolan is one of the most talked about names in the industry in the last few years, some love him, others hate him, I particularly think he's overrated, but I like all his movies, especially "Dunkirk". Even complex time, makes quality films that arrive and are recognized by the great public, so if the only options are to love or hate it, I get to love, but with reservations. "Dunkirk" is an interesting film that is sure to take a lot of editing and sound mixing and maybe a few more technical Oscars, but it's not going to happen, it's still a great movie that's worth the ticket.
5.0~Ultimately a bit 'clean' axw-07505 Sign in Permalink ...and ultimately just a bit dull. Having seen many of the reviews on here I am a bit surprised. To say I was looking forward to this (as was my 14 year old son) is an understatement but just spent 2 hours watching troops waiting on a clean beach to be picked up by boats while a Spitfire saved the world - a bit of a 'meh' let down. When bombed there were no casualties screaming and bleeding, they were just gone. There was no real feeling of the pain - just a cut and dried living or dead feel you can only achieve in a 12A. I liked the tying in together of the seemingly disparate threads of story but the realism was massively missing and made it feel a bit 'Disney does war'. Altogheter it made for an unreal experience where everything was alright in the end and it neglected the people that sacrificed and suffered so much. It get the feeling it really wasn't that easy an endeavor and that the suffering was so much more than was depicted. Ultimately just too clean and sterile and the Germans apparently were hardly involved.
1.0~This movie is not about Dunkirk Humphreywashere Sign in Permalink If you are interested in or have knowledge of World War II history, don't go to see this movie. If you have family in the armed forces, and/ or like 'saving private Ryan', similarly avoid this movie. It will annoy you, infuriate you, bore you. It does not inform or shape your understanding of what happened at Dunkirk. It is gratuitous labelling. The story is about something else, something I can't be bothered considering, something 'arty', something glorifying cowardice when there are soldiers of caliber all around. I went to see a movie about the astonishing evacuation at Dunkirk. I got something else that was cheap and nasty and insulting.
3.0~Upset my tummy mga-10 Sign in Permalink This movie gave me seasickness that lasted an hour afterwards! And no, I wasn't sitting in one of the Cineplex immersive "D-BOX" moving seats, just in a surround-sound "UltraAVX" theatre. I should have closed my eyes for periods of the camera movement. The rotation among scenes was a game attempt to make up for a skimpy script. Much of the dialogue and acting was realistic - leaving quite a lot that wasn't. Also, some technical details were puzzling, such as scenes in which one might expect the characters, boats and ships to be hurrying, yet instead they seemed to be dawdling, perhaps to fill the film out; and ships appeared to be at anchor in the middle of battle. Not sure why anyone would want to watch this movie, even though a lot of money obviously went into making it. Need convincing that we should avoid war? As a companion said, "If this had been on television, I would have turned it off."
1.0~Couldn't stay awake........ bbabertino Sign in Permalink One review mentioned micro over macro - that was an under statement. One of the worst WWII movies I have ever seen. Boring and about a AWAL cowards.
5.0~Humdrum World War II Heroics zardoz-13 Sign in Permalink Traditional armchair generals should know that director Christopher Nolan's World War II epic "Dunkirk" has little to do with the battle of Dunkirk. You won't see German Panzer Corps careening through Belgium and bulldozing into France. In fact, the only Germans in "Dunkirk" are either flying planes or show up as foot soldiers from undetermined units. Basically, "Dunkirk" breaks the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces (B.E.F.) up into three sections: one on land that covers one week, one on sea that covers one day, and one in the air that covers one hour. Of course, much, much, more occurred at Dunkirk than just the massive evacuation. Presumably, the "Dark Knight" filmmaker did not want to overextend himself a standard-issue battle extravaganza. "Dunkirk" was produced for $100-million, with probably millions more for simply publicity. So, if you're looking for something like "The Longest Day" (1962), "Battle of the Bulge" (1965), "Anzio" (1968), "A Bridge Too Far" (1977), "Saving Private Ryan" (1998), and "Hacksaw Ridge" (2016), prepare to be disappointed. "Dunkirk" doesn't recreate historic battlefield firefights, not even the infamous Wormhoudt Massacre where Waffen-SS soldiers of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler slaughtered as many as 80 British soldiers along with some French POWs. The SS crowded their prisoners into a stable, tossed in stick-grenades, and then finished them off with bursts of machine gun fire. Something like this might have given "Dunkirk" greater dramatic gravity. Instead, we see neither German tanks nor troops storming through France and Belgium like devils. This 107-minute movie boils down to a series of survival episodes that occurred strictly at Dunkirk. Notably, the RAF preferred to confine their resources largely to the island in preparation for the inevitable Battle of Britain, later made into the exemplary film the "Battle of Britain" (1969). Aside from the RAF, the Royal Navy and the Small Boat Owners are the heroes who rescued the BEF waiting impatiently on the beach. "Dunkirk" opens with several British infantrymen wandering down a road inside the Dunkirk city limits as the Luftwaffe drops propaganda leaflets. No sooner have they had a moment to glance these surrender summons than gunfire breaks out from an unknown source. As they scramble for cover, unseen shooters kill all except Tommy (newcomer Fionn Whitehead), who crosses a street and comes under fire from French troops. They wave him toward their lines, and later he saunters onto the beaches. As far as he can see, queues of troops are standing on the beach awaiting transport. "Spectre" lenser Hoyte Van Hoytema's atmospheric cinematography shows these soldiers in their brown uniforms standing like sitting ducks in a row on white beaches. These scenes resemble something out of "Lawrence of Arabia" in all their sprawling immensity. Indeed, Van Hoytema's cinematography adds to the spectacle. Not long afterward, as Tommy tours the beach, screaming Stuka dive-bombers plunge from the skies like murderous seagulls on a beach teeming with baby turtles and do similar damage on a grand scale. The worst death in "Dunkirk" happens when bombs create marching explosions that blast a British soldier to smithereens as he shoots at the plane. Tommy meets another soldier under mysterious circumstances on the beach. Might he be a German saboteur? Without challenging him about his odd behavior, Tommy pitches in to help. They become fast friends who try to break the rules and the lines so they can get aboard a transport. Cheekily, they seize a stretcher case awaiting transport and scramble to an embarkation station. They reach the ship at the last minute, but they are denied access because they were Red Cross personnel. Nolan has these two heading off to find passage elsewhere by other means. Their exploits turn into shenanigans as they confront one setback after another, even after they get aboard a ship. Although the RAF lost fewer planes than the Luftwaffe: 145 to 156, "Dunkirk" shows no more than six Spitfire fighters cruising the English Channel in search of prey. Again, budgetary concerns may explain the aircraft shortages. Also, Nolan doesn't go for too much CGI, so he resorted to cardboard cutouts of troops on the beach. Nevertheless, we get one hour's worth of the RAF giving the Luftwaffe literal Hell. Predictably, one pilot perishes in a crash, another ditches in the sea, but the third is far more fortunate. RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy of "Mad Max: Fury Road") shoots up the Luftwaffe in "Dunkirk's" most exciting scenes. Christopher Nolan does a decent job of staging several tense scenes of soldiers confronting catastrophe. Unfortunately, aside from Tom Hardy's RAF pilot, Kenneth Branagh's Naval officer (who never endangered), Mark Rylance as a civilian sailor, and Cillian Murphy as the shell-shocked soldier, no celebrity movie stars of prominence. Indeed, most of the actors are unknown, except perhaps for "One-Direction" singer Harry Styles. Suspense works best when a character is conspicuous enough either as an actor or a character for us to care about. Everybody is virtually a nobody in "Dunkirk." Meantime, evoking sympathy for soldiers so desperate that they take refuge in a beached ship and become targets seems like the province of a horror chiller. Quoting the cliché, they die like fish in a barrel during target practice. Indeed, two soldiers trapped in the boat are the same who have tried to board transports. Oscar winning actor Mark Rylance has one of the better roles as a small boat owner who has already lost a son in the RAF. The episode with the shell-shocked soldier involving the inconsequential treatment of a civilian teen is the least savory scene. Nevertheless, Rylance's character is never in jeopardy. Often wearing an aviator's oxygen mask, Tom Hardy looks like the villainous Bane from Nolan's "The Dark Knight Rises," but he comes closest to being a blood and guts hero. Ultimately, despite its heartfelt tribute to British resiliency in the face of annihilation, "Dunkirk" qualifies as a routine war movie.
2.0~Extremely boring raytherealamerican Sign in Permalink I'm not kidding, this is the most boring movie I've seen in my entire life. Watching paint dry is just as fun as this bland boring movie
5.0~Dunkirk is war itself, long periods of boredom interrupted by periods of intense activity. roysach Sign in Permalink For some reason, given this films antecedent director / cast / crew history, I expected Dunkirk to be a bit of a Marmite, and I wasn't disappointed. Or rather, I was. The story of Dunkirk must surely demand a massive canvas, within which the myriad of individual characters stories can and must be be drawn, but for me only the latter were played out to a backdrop of something of a day at the seaside with occasional bits of chaotic interference provided by an anonymous foe. There's no cast of Hundreds and Thousands in this confection. That said, those incidents of conflict are exactly what I would expect from a director of Nolans pedigree, up close, multi faceted, slamming, highly personal, and rammed home by thumping sound effects that are the perfect foil to Zimmers delicate and uplifting score, but for me the sum of these parts most certainly do not exceed the whole. Then, Integrity is all when handling history at its best. Modern floppy hairstyles and a mooring line clearly attached to a Royal Navy ship foundering "at sea" made me gasp for all the wrong reasons, that and the protracted flight of the superb Tom Hardys Phoenix that must surely rival the "magic bullet' for historical incredulity. Dunkirks cast is a brave mix of old and new. The twain only rarely meet, with little screen crossover between the youngsters headed by the competent Harry Styles, and the old guard stoically represented by a committee of leading men who seem to deliberately underplay their roles in the manner of the one and only Mark Rylance but are devoid of his presence and depth. I'm sorry, but without all the 'little boats' (such as they were) this film could have been anywhere. Over the years I have come to accept that occasionally history will not be allowed to get in the way of a good story, but this has neither. For me, this version of one of the most pivotal and chaotic engagements in our history has completely failed to engage.
8.0~A love letter to the UK zch-crstnsn Sign in Permalink Nolan is a master of his craft. He really flexes his thematic muscles on every project. Amazing imagery and always has an impressive nack for telling a story. Stunning cinematography and A+ acting, easily one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. The more I recount it tho the more I am sure it was a love letter to the UK, which is a pretty charming sentiment. It seemed like a showcase of Brit grit in the face of overwhelming odds. Honestly at some points I felt I was watching a visual representation of a history textbook. Not really what I was hoping for but immensely entertaining. A very vague plot if one at all, just a series of truly jaw dropping events and character reaction. But maybe that's the point? Colorful examples of bravery and cowardice in the face of monumental situations; with unfortunately predictable reactions. But what are we to expect from a director who has mastered the alternative mind-bending fiction which has won our hearts for years? A director who's toes are just barely wet in the ocean of nonfiction narrative? He dives full confidence into the alien realm and newcomer Nolan scores an 8/10. A noble mark for my favorite filmmaker, credited with creating some of the best fiction ever written and displayed.
2.0~Vastly overrated buddyluv-27132 Sign in Permalink So after seeing the trailers and reading user reviews I was super excited about going to see this film. I read reviews like"best film of the year" "another Private Ryan" "Christopher Nolan at his finest" I should have known it was a bomb after reading rave reviews from critics they are always wrong. What a bunch of b.s. This movie doesn't belong in the same sentence as Saving Private Ryan. That movie was a classic all time best. Dunkirk is dull, boring and the soundtrack made me want to admit myself into a sanitarium. There are hardly any real battle scenes unlike Pvt Ryan. What an overrated mess. Save yourself time and money and wait for the DVD.
3.0~quite poor michaeloulton Sign in Permalink I find it hard not to agree with one or two of the reviewers, to describe this as a movie masterpiece is a bit of a joke, if you think that the 1958 John Mills version would scare the wits out of you, apart from a handful of real actors doing their best to save it and one or two fairly good scenes this was a rather dull, slow moving low budget version of what happened. Dunkirk was a big event, over 300,000 troops, hundreds of aircraft and ships were fighting and saving lifes, what do you see here, a 100 or so extras in tin hats looking sad, only 3 spitfires, no hurricanes of which there many involved, 2 me109s and a handful of bombers, and last but not least a 1960/70 french destroyer which we were suppose to imagine looked like a 1930s british destroyer, not even close, this was more like a bad day trip for a few soldiers than the war ending disaster it could have been if not for the heroes who saved them
1.0~Pile of artistic modern pile of shit cudiedgar Sign in Permalink No real content, just 2 hours of somewhat decent picture. Only thing was couple of known actors, but that even didnt give this blant tasteless movie a thing to watch it.
10.0~Nolan delivers yet again joshbarton15 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is a director who doesn't really do things by halves, so when it was announced that his latest film would be a war film, the levels of anticipation I had for it went through the roof. He's directed some of my favourite films so to see Nolan make a war film for the first time, particularly about something like Dunkirk, was always going to be one of my most anticipated films of the year. As 400,000 men wait to be evacuated from Dunkirk beach with the enemy closing in, Dunkirk follows the efforts of men on land, at sea and in the air who fought so bravely to make it possible for them to return home to Britain. Desperation runs rife during war and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk doesn't waste any of its runtime is depicting just how desperate a situation it was as men waited to be taken home, not knowing when the enemy would strike next. Nolan's boldest decision in Dunkirk is to not show one German soldier throughout and it really adds to the film's intensity, the fear of the men trapped on the beach fully embedding itself in the audience's mind as a result. The narrative choice was one that surprised me but, while it took me a few minutes to work out exactly how it was panning out, it's a choice that makes Dunkirk unlike any war film I've ever seen. The three narrative threads the film follows take place over different time periods however, Nolan ensures they come together rather magnificently, intercutting between each narrative seamlessly thanks to Lee Smith's sharp editing. Nolan has formed some incredible collaborative partnerships throughout his career, most notably with Hans Zimmer who has scored a number of his films. Zimmer really feels as if he tries to outdo his previous works each and every time, which is only a good thing for us, and his work on Dunkirk is up there with his finest to date. The inclusion of the ticking clock superbly fitting in with the theme of time and emphasising the desperation of the situation. A relatively shorter collaborative partnership in comparison is that between Nolan cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who first worked with Nolan on Interstellar. Just like Interstellar, van Hoytema's breathtaking visuals fit with Nolan's narrative superbly well, accentuating the scale of the operation at Dunkirk even in such a close-knit narrative. Coming to the performances, Nolan's Dunkirk features an ensemble cast who all impress despite having to work with very little character development. People may find it hard to connect with the film as a result however, I felt for these characters as much as I have in films with well-rounded characters so the lack of character development didn't really hinder my experience. It was a real pleasure to watch actors like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh bring their usual qualities to a film but it was even better to see acting newcomers in Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles, yes Harry Styles, make their mark in Nolan's film. Myself and other film fans may sound like broken records when describing each new Nolan film as a masterpiece however, when the man keeps on making the films he does, it's certainly justified. More so because Dunkirk is exactly that, a masterpiece.
6.0~Dunkirk is Okay but Underwhelming mitchell5954 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is the latest film by Christopher Nolan. As usual people are praising his film as a masterpiece. I'm a fan of Nolan so I wanted to love this film like everyone else. However, I have to be honest; this is one of his weaker films, in my opinion. I'm not the biggest fan of war movies, so that doesn't help either. I would put this over The Prestige and The Dark Knight Rises, but every other film he's made I think is better. I would even put Interstellar over this. I'm not the biggest fan of war films, so that doesn't help either. Though, this is certainly not the best war movie I've seen either. The film isn't bad, but it's painfully average. The plot is very simple. The Germans have pushed the British and the French back to the beaches of Dunkirk. Military vessels and plains are in short supply so civilian boats are mobilized to rescue the stranded troops on the beach. The rest of the film is the soldiers surviving on the beach as the civilian vessels make their way there. The film does some things well. From a technical aspect Dunkirk is amazing. The film looks great, and the effects are amazing, as one would expect from a Nolan film. It has the typical gray, bleak look to it, like in most Nolan movies, but it fit the tone of the film and gave it a good atmosphere. The music also fit very well. The action scenes are alright for what they are. This is not action-heavy war movie, but a survival war picture. Do not expect wall-to-wall action in that sense. I also like how the Germans are never seen throughout the flick, but there presence is still heavily felt. The few fight scenes we do get are okay at best. Some of the action gets confusion, and becomes difficult to tell who is fighting who. The issue with this movie is that it gets dull. This is one of Nolan's shorter films, at two hours, yet you can still feel the length at times. Some scenes feel unnecessary or are dragged out for too long. The characters are also dull. That's the film's main problem is that all of the characters are boring. The acting is fine, but the characters they are not that interesting; none of them. Cillian Murphy, a great actor, is wasted in this role. It's not that I hated any of the characters, but I wasn't invested in any of them either. That's a problem, because characters are essential getting invested in a story. If you have good characters the viewers are on that journey with them and feel what they feel. Since I wasn't invested in the characters the film did not hit nearly as hard with me as it should have. The message of Dunkirk is the same as any war film. It wants to convey to the audience how terrible war is. However, there are so many war movies that do this better because they have a better cast that resonates with you. Overall, Dunkirk is a mixed bag. It's an okay movie that's worth one watch. However, there are better war films, and certainly better Christopher Nolan movies, out there.
2.0~Bad doe-20806 Sign in Permalink You know this movie is really really boring I advice to just save you 10 box and 2 hours of your life. Rather watch paint dry because then you can at least understand the story of a paints life going from wet to dry. Time is can't be reversed so don't waist it on this movie!!!! I advice to just read a book about Dunkirk because then maybe you well be able to understand it better. Hope this helped you. Also the UK don't know how to make military movies at all at least the Americans make it interesting
1.0~Noise level is dangerously loud - take hearing protection mqh-27583 Sign in Permalink The soundtrack on this film is so loud that it is physically painful. People with me said that their chairs were rocking at certain points. I put my fingers in my ears and after I left the theatre, my ears were ringing. I happen to carry a sound meter with me and it constantly was registering 90+ decibels -- that is power tool level. As someone else commented, an aircraft cannot fly without fly, the one in this film glided around during daylight and ended landing in the dark -- ridiculous. This is not a film that is anything other than painfully noisy. Don't waste your money.
5.0~Save your money dynamitefunk Sign in Permalink Seriously boring. Zero story line. Maybe 4 bits that are worth a "meh". Looks great though. Subplots that lack depth. Why was One Direction in it? Save your money, go watch something better than a thing that fanboys give a 10 out of 10 for a movie that's worth a high 4. I honestly would've preferred sticking chopsticks into my eyes than sit through this. Unfortunately I didn't have any chopsticks in the cinema.
8.0~Good but far from the greatest rishi_is_here-1 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is just over 150 kilometers from where I live. After watching the movie I would surely one day go visit the place, after all it is where the history was re-written by the brave attempts of hundreds of small boat owners to save 300,000 men trapped by enemies. Coming back to the movie, it is a visual and audio feast limited by character development and compelling script. Though far from qualities of the longest day or saving private Ryan, this is still a very watchable movie to be must seen at theaters at big screens. I wish Christopher Nolan has put some more focus on the character development and elaborate story telling, after all he had some of the best contemporary actors and second WW as background.
3.0~Disjointed and boring lrread-1 Sign in Permalink I found this film to be very disappointing. There was little if any plot and the film just dragged on. There was no attempt to provide a good strong story line. The little boats were barely mentioned (except for the one where some of the action took place) and it wasn't until near the end of the film that they all suddenly turned up. Also, the beach looked like they had a few hundred men not the over 400,000 we were being told were there. I had an uncle who was at Dunkirk. I feel this film really lets them down.
1.0~Not really a movie about Dunkirk michaelscai Sign in Permalink ******* this review may contain spoilers *************** If you are like me, a WWII history buff, and excited to see a new movie about the battle of Dunkirk, you will be totally disappointed. It feels like a low budget movie, you don't see any German soldiers for the whole movie. What?? how do you have a war movie where hundreds of thousands people fought and you don't show what's going on the other side? It would have been better named as 'some side stories during the battle of Dunkirk', because that's what it is. The title is misleading, it's called Dunkirk so people would see it. There is this endless air battle between couple of airplanes that's like half the movie, totally unnecessary. Nobody need that much detail about a fight between couple of fighter planes. The other half the movie is about a little fishing ship going to Dunkirk to carry some troops back, I don't really care about that either. I feel like I wasted my $12.
10.0~Dunkirk may be the best, most enthralling war movie ever filmed, and might be Nolan's best film magnigames Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is one of the best films I've ever seen, and is probably the best war movie ever filmed. Historically accurate, gripping, entertaining and dark throughout the entire movie, Christopher Nolan was able to showcase one of the most uplifting and inspiring events in modern history as the bleak event it truly was, and in turn comes off as a realistic movie that isn't overburdened with an excess of patriotism.
5.0~Good Attempt But Lacks Impact roland-rockerfella Sign in Permalink This was a good try to be sure, but in truth I felt underwhelmed when I left the studio. The film is technically near perfect but it fails to show the true scale of the evacuation or the civilian and military fleet that pulled it off. Also it totally failed to show the heroic defense by the French who held the Germans back for those vital few days and allowed the British to escape. Early on Kenneth Branagh's character states that there are over 400.000 men on this beach yet we fail to see any more than 200 or so in any shot, the rest of the time the beach feels near deserted. Now I understand that hiring 400.000 extras for a film would be financially and logistically impossible yet without this kind of scale or even some clever CGI work this film feels like a few dozen guys running about on a beach being rescued by a handful of boats. Anyway, it was still a good try and the aerial dogfights with the Spitfires was magical, that alone made it almost worth watching, almost.
2.0~Turkeys aren't only for Christmas. jamesgdorrian Sign in Permalink I think there must be a syndrome whereby the impact and quality of a movie (or other artistic creation) can be given something of a critical 'free ride' simply because of the reputations of those associated with its production. To put this another way, were I - with absolutely no artistic talent - to pick up a handful of mud and throw it at a canvas, the resulting mess would certainly qualify as vandalism. If, however, an artist with a significant reputation was to do the same thing, I'm quite certain 'appreciators of art' would soon be queuing up to buy the resulting masterpiece. And so it is with Nolan, whose bleak and soulless take on Dunkirk seems to work best the less you actually know about the evacuation; and certainly the more the viewer reads into the film what he/she believes were Nolan's motivations and messages. Some of the reviews given by critics are deferential to a degree approaching fawning. Bearing in mind that this purports to be the story of a major wartime event, the lack of attention to historical detail is frankly unforgivable, especially considering the movie's huge cost. If you are interested in finding out about what actually happened at Dunkirk, this vague and depressing (on so many levels) take on history should never grace your list of source material. Thank God my 8th Army uncle, who was on the Dunkirk beach until the last day, was not around to see his story so debased.
1.0~So boring badhairday_69 Sign in Permalink Would rather spend 3 hours scrolling though Facebook than watching this. Wait that's what I am doing. What a boring movie.
5.0~Noisy and flat Lukas-Ondra Sign in Permalink Well, I believe that Nolan should have done better. This movie is very noisy, emotionally flat, historically not so good. As a standard these days it uses beautiful effects and stunning imagery, but the story is lost in the very loud gunfire and explosion and engines roars and other loud sounds. My opinion is that Director Nolan has used the sound to remind us of war. It was for me personally a battle to sit and watch this movie.
5.0~Seriously Disappointing DKosty123 Sign in Permalink Considering that Christopher Nolan wrote Inception and that was a technical masterpiece and an intelligent script, this film is a major let down from that movie. I like the concept of retelling one of the most major rescues in the history of civilization, but it could have been much better than this one. There are a few problems with the film I saw, and some of them are major technical flaws. I liked the telling of he same events from different eyes. What I did not care for was the sudden jolts from daytime scenes to night scenes which did not make any sense in telling the story that happened during the first 3/4's of the film. Somehow, day should have been day and night should have been night. Take that and the going from Spitfires in the air in daylight straight to night sequences, and the continuity of the film becomes wrecked for me as a viewer. Then there is the sequence of the men getting into the beached ship to wait for the tide to come in. There is almost no logic in this one. Hiding inside a ship waiting like sitting ducks is just not logical. When the ship starts getting used for target practice and they just stay in the boat like sitting ducks is just plain stupid. The sequence is even less logical than the long sequence inside the tank in the WW2 film FURY done a few short years ago. There is little story in this as the director (Nolan) has very little dialogue in the first half of the film. While the film as a whole does make the history clear of the desperation of the situation, and the rescue, it could have been done much more spectacularly with the advent of CGI. The number of private ships actually shown coming into Dunkirk to rescue 300,000 troops is much too small. Without CGI, The Longest Day many years ago did a better job of creating an armada on screen than this film does. The air combat scenes are great, but I am kind of curious why prop planes, Spitfire pilots, needed to wear oxygen masks on their faces? Most of the time these planes did not fly as high as jet fighters where such masks would be needed. Maybe it is to help the film maker here not allow the audience to get attached to any cast member. That goal this film certainly accomplishes. There are few women in the cast though Miranda Nolan, Christopher Nolans Cousin does make another appearance in his work, her 10th film role, as a nurse. The main emotion displayed throughout the film is the patriotic cheering of people on the ground who seem to be able to see what is going on better than the film viewers. There is a lot of cheering for an army withdrawal of defeated soldiers just desperate to escape. With the exception of the opening sequence, most of the battle scenes are on the ocean. The Nazi Germans are almost invisible the entire film except for the German fighter and bomber planes in the air. There is a lot of action drama here, and at the end the rescued are riding on a train and reading Churchill's most famous speech in the newspaper. "We shall never surrender." Considering the genius Nolan has shown in his other films, this one does not measure up on all the levels I have pointed out and more. Even the true Historian should be let down on how this one was told. The film has many technical flaws and needed to have a consultant to get the technical stuff right, but now that World War 2 is more than 70 years in our rear-view mirror, nearly 75 years since Dunkirk, those kind of people just are not around anymore. I wish this film would have matched the advertising and hype, but if this truly the best film this summer, Hollywood is not having a good year at all. The emotions this film try to stir come up hollow.
8.0~Another Great Nolan Film. Rendanlovell Sign in Permalink If there is one thing that Christopher Nolan does better than any other director working right now it's that he puts butts in seats. Every single movie he has made since 'Batman Begins' has featured people swarming in droves to their nearest theater. I would wager that 90% of people that go see this film will not know anything about the subject matter. Which is sort of what makes him so interesting. He is making gigantic studio blockbusters of whatever he wants. Warner Bros smartly realized that this man packs theaters and makes money so they let him do whatever he feels like doing. Which is a little weird considering Warner Bros DC cinematic universe right now... Before I get too far into this movie I want to point out the few negatives I have with it. Keep in mind that these things will more than likely not bother anyone else. I also realize that these are nitpicking but regardless, they still took me out of the experience. And I would call this an experience, which is all the more reason that these nitpicks bother me. When something happens in an experience to take you out of it I think it's fair to point at that to say that it ruined a bit of the experience. And the thing that ruined the most parts of this film was the audio recordings. No, not the sound effects but the microphones that recorded the actor's dialogue. Almost every single time an actor talked there was an audible buzzing sound that would fade in and out each time a character opened their mouth. I'm pretty happy that most of the film didn't need dialogue because this bugged literally every time it happened. The only other blemish on the film's armor comes due to the color correcting and nonlinear nature of the story. There was a number of scenes where every single cut was a different color temperature. We would see a vibrant blue sky with a bomber flying and the next cut would be a boat that looked gray or orange. Or one cut would be during daytime and the next would be dark. Again, these are small issues but in an experience such as this, they stand out far more than they would in a 'Dark Knight' sort of film. However, this is easily the best war movie 2017 has to offer. Which is saying a lot considering the vast surplus of war melodramas from this year. Much like Nolans other movies 'Dunkirk' is a sensory masterpiece. Every shot in the film is near perfect. The composition of each frame and the camera movement is so precise for each individual scene. Not only that but the sound editing is absolutely spectacular. The film is abrasively loud and in your face. From the very first scene the film barrages you with ear piercing sounds that put you right in the middle of this war. Planes rumble overhead, bullet whiz by, and people yell at each other and it's all captured perfectly. In all honesty, if I were to judge this film based on its technical achievements this would receive top marks, especially when costumes, sets, and makeup is factored in. Because every single thing in this film is so believable that it often transcends being a film and almost feels like a documentary. Nolan's craft has never been better and he deserves endless praise because he directors the crap out of this movie. But Nolan is not only the director here, he is also the writer. Which brings me to the most intriguing aspect of the movie. The structure and story that we get aren't like your everyday war movie. Sure the story is very simple but it tells it from three different perspectives. Doing this allowed him to cut between the sea, land, and air which brings different dimensions to this battle. We see how each one affects and is affected by each other. This also allows Nolan to cut away from one thing to another the moment it gets dull. He doesn't have to restrict himself to making the air plane scenes interesting all on their own. Instead he just cuts to something interesting when the dog fight is over. Doing this keeps the pace of the film absolutely relentless. For ninety minutes you are barraged endlessly by this fight. While it may not always work the strengths far outweigh the flaws. The costumes, sets, acting, direction, cinematography, action, and the visual nature of the film all come together to create something that feels so different than everything else out right now. Sure, it may not be your typical summer blockbuster and I'm not sure I could ever watch it again but it's certainly worth keeping out.
9.0~Nolan being Nolan rudeonly Sign in Permalink I just wanna say what an incredible feeling watching this film. I actually felt like I was a part of it. The film isn't about one in particular man it's about community, and how every member is important in his own way. There isn't much talking in the film instead scenes are speaking for themselves, and that is exactly what is special about Dunkirk. I loved how the story was developing, and how in the end it became one meaningful entirety. I recommend it to everyone to watch because Dunkirk is another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan.
2.0~What a confusing boring movie. saybow69 Sign in Permalink Wow, what a letdown. War movies are usually this confusing. But come on? Seeing Cillain Murphy on boat (shell shocked) and then seconds later pushing kids back in water saying be back. Was told it was a different TL. Well what other different TLs were then? No movie should be that confusing! Not 1 seen German all movie yet shooting or shooting practice? Lol. Ya that's even confusing. Never see who was shooting at boat. Or Hardy partner that left or landed in ocean. Still not sure if guy who couldn't get outta boat was with Hardy crew? He who was low on fuel at beginning of movie and 2 plus hours later still flying. This not a review. This a questionaire. And ohh ya when then loud ass build up music does every 10 minute and nothing happens? Kinda gets annoying after 7th time! Think Nolans good but this was terrible or at least most overrated movie ever
3.0~Shameful lack of scope in this age of CGI neil-procter Sign in Permalink It amazes me that this film has an average review score more than 8. I found it tedious and unnecessarily time-skewed. Christopher Nolan seemed to think it was a good idea to jump between events that were happening at different times. So, for instance, we had night time scenes at Dunkirk while it was daylight 20 miles away in the channel. It was unnecessary and confusing - a chronological telling would have worked far better. More irksome still was that, in supposedly trying to right the myth that the RAF provide no support, Nolan has three Spitfires, three, being the entirety of RAF involvement, and only a handful of German planes too . This is patent rubbish. The biggest gaff of all is that we get no sense whatsoever of the huge numbers of civilian boats that made the trip to rescue soldiers from the beach, some of them returning over and over again. In this age of CGI I was surprised that, when for once the vast scope of something was a vital part of the story, the images showed hardly anything. This was a very poor effort from someone regarded as being one of the top film makers. And that people can review it so highly perhaps illustrates that people don't care, provided there's shooting and explosions. For me it was dull and unedifying.
3.0~Banal, boring... philenglishteacher Sign in Permalink I managed to watch 17 minutes of this film. Almost from the very beginning the acting was wooden, stereotyped and, in terms of story development, totally predictable. The Germans are portrayed as evil monsters, the French as cowardly traitors and the Brits as comic-book heroes. Appalling rubbish and I cannot for the life of me see how the critics are duped into admiring this piece of third rate melodrama.
10.0~This is a great war film because of the things it didn't do. ctowyi Sign in Permalink Dunkirk was literally my third war movie at the cinema in a roll. It started with War for the Planet of the Apes, which was one of the most evocative and unsettling human war films I have seen. It was followed by a Japanese anime, In This Corner of the World, an exquisite time-capsule of a movie, which showed me a new way the harrowing story of Hiroshima could be told. Then there was Dunkirk and what a film this is. I can't remember the last time I sat in stunned silence as the end-credits rolled, my mind awashed with the feeling that I have touched greatness. This is not just an excellent film, it is a great war film and it is great because of the things it didn't do. A word search of "dunkirk" in IMDb threw up 19 entries! (N-n-n-nineteen in the metallic voice of Paul Hardcastle's 19 😬) I had no idea the evacuation of Dunkirk became the inspiration of so many films and documentaries. First up, Christopher Nolan didn't need to serve up a history lesson again. A few simple opening sentences give context and we are thrown into the deep end. Dunkirk is about men trying to survive into the next hour with the onslaught of danger coming from every conceivable angle, plain and simple. It is how Nolan goes about showcasing it that is sheer masterclass. When was the last time you saw a war film without someone screaming jingoistic slogans in your face or not seeing a scene of a conflicted protagonist trying to justify the reason for war? When was the last time you not see scenes of carnage and human viscera? When was the last time you not see the face of the enemy in a fire-fight? These are practically the foundation of which the war genre is built on, but Dunkirk never treads the path of familiarity. Heck! It doesn't even have a single drop of blood (the bloodied bandage on the wounded soldier is not counted 😊). But yet the tension is so nerve-wrecking, the fear so real that I gripped the armrests for dear life and I thought I forget to breathe for over an hour. The dialogue is so spare and functional, it might as well have been a silent film with sound effects, but yet my entire being was transfixed on the big screen, ogling at the spellbinding vistas of war from the land, air and sea. The characters, what characters, are nameless, but yet their fear is so palpable they are instantly relatable. The heroics of ordinary folks is monumental but never felt emotionally manipulative. The cinematography is astonishing, recreating the combat of WWII so marvellously. I felt like I was running with the hapless soldiers or trapped in a God forsaken place praying for deliverance. Hans Zimmer's music score is an interesting detour from the usual soundtracks of blockbusters. It has no recognisable melody or an infectious refrain that will cement itself into your consciousness. It is largely monochromatic, like a few repetitive notes linked together, but by golly it worked. This is a score that makes absolute no sense when you play on your hi-fi system, but together with what transpires on screen the music feels larger than life, building that suspense to a mind-blowing crescendo. IMHO the music and the action share a symbiotic relationship, each element helping the other to create the biggest impact. On its own it wouldn't have worked as well, but together, it is a masterpiece. There are some superb films I have seen this year, but so far there is only one great film – Dunkirk. Throw away all you think you know about war films and immerse yourself in the biggest possible screen (that would be the IMAX and it is worth every cent) and feel the crushing blow of grim defeat. Next year's Oscars may be far away, but I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that the Academy will remember this big time.
1.0~I don't get it lcity Sign in Permalink 8.5 out of 10? NOT A CHANCE! I've always thought the IMDb ratings of various movies has been fairly spot on. No longer. This must be a 'PAID FOR' score! There is simply NO WAY people as a whole rated this movie THAT well, literally 0% chance. There is barley a movie to talk about here! Really, I can't even think of a good spoiler to tell you. Almost no dialog at all. No interesting characters whatsoever and no connection, you don't care at all if someone dies. Synchronicity flip flops all over the place for no good reason and is done poorly. The two redeeming features were the visuals and dramatic score... However, they do nothing to add value as you see right through them. Half a star each. After 20 mins I was ready to walkout due to boredom, I didn't, but I wish I had, because it gets no better... Credits were the best part, and even that was dull. Worst movie I have seen in years, and I recently watched Suicide Squad!
10.0~A love letter to Christopher Nolan dagurlh Sign in Permalink Dear Christopher Nolan. Every time i think you cannot top your last work you surprise me and bring something new. something fresh and original. Dunkirk is no exception. Its style and historical accuracy is on its own enough to give this movie praise but how it's executed that's what stands out the most. The movie fits together so perfectly and it all feels so natural to watch. There are no stages in this movie. Like the movie starts of with one stage where nothing is happening just to introduce the characters or a build up of how the Dunkirk disaster came to happen. No Christopher Nolan throws us right into the middle of it as it is happening and we get to see our characters and get to know them as everything is happening. The entire movie feels like one fluent motion. And the use of music in this movie is portioned and only used when needed. No pointless background music, just music to tell the story properly. You feel the emotions of the Characters and the terror they are faced with. And the cruel side of humanity (The Nazi's and the poor frank who the British soldiers wanted to sacrifice to lift up the boat) And we see the good side of humanity The people who came to the rescue of the trapped soldiers and the brave men who fought and fell. Just so we can stand free
1.0~Absolute Bottom Gravy doorsscorpywag Sign in Permalink The 1958 film with John Mills and company told the story of Dunkirk in a masterly manner showing the horror and the struggle to survive. The 2004 BBC Drama/Documentary showed some of the neglected aspects in those who manned the line to allow survivors to escape the carnage. In both there were some excellent acting performances from the likes of Richard Attenborough, Bernard Lee and Benedict Cumberbatch. Both told a wonderfully uplifting story of heroism and sacrifice to allow Britain to withdraw its army across the channel and continue the struggle. Neither shied away from the reality that was Dunkirk showing the audience the terror of attack from the air and the murder of civilians by the Luftwaffe and soldiers by the SS. The 1958 ensemble cast and the BBC documentary cast told the story from different perspectives in a way that made you feel part of what was going on. This pile of over rated toilet slop showed that film makers today have not the first clue how to tell a Historical story. Jumping back and forward telling the story from the air, the sea and the land and achieving nothing more than confusing the audience as Tom Hardy endlessly attacked the same plane for an hour and a half before running out of fuel and landing faultlessly on the beach and into a nest of Germans. The beaches were sparsely occupied by a few short lines of soldiers and there was no sense of peril as the Third Reich bore down on them. The odd air attack allowed Kenneth Branagh a chance to look dramatic and stern and some bloke from the army was there because there would have been some bloke from the army there in 1940. The dunes behind the beach were empty and nobody seemed that much in a hurry to leave. It must have been Hell for our brave lads in 1940 but it was a Hell for the 2017 audience as this incredible story was reduced to a few blokes here and there doing stuff in a really boring manner whilst being shot at once in a while from invisible Germans. The utterly stupid scene that opened this dross shows the Nazis a few hundred yards from the beach which is guarded by our brave French allies but nothing about the British who were holding the perimeter to allow the Army to retreat to Dunkirk. Their bravery is not even hinted at as they sacrificed their lives to allow others to get away. The French are treated with disdain as if their courage amounted to very little as a Frenchman sneers at a 'brave' Brit who has thrown his rifle away and ran through their lines. Being told to 'p#ss off' by a British officer when they dare to join the rather small line of Brits waiting for rescue. Even the terror of a torpedo attack looked rather dull and nothing Nolan did had an authentic look about it. The soldiers on the mole did not look as if they had spent weeks fighting their way out of Belgium against a Nazi horde and looked rather dapper as they strolled along the pier. When they got to the other side they arrived in the 80s and got on trains that were a bit too modern for that period as seen by the upholstery. Nothing about this film caught the imagination. Only the Mark Rylance Mr Dawson character and his crew looked as if they were actually interested. This was the only decent bit of the film. Tom Hardy flying around bored me silly and I was rooting for the ME109 at one stage. The worst were the land characters Kenny just one of a bad bunch. At least he was able to emote as Jerry bombed the handful of extras portraying hundreds of thousands of frightened, exhausted, hungry, thirsty and defeated soldiers trying to stay alive among the dunes. This nonsense does not even try to reflect the courage and steadfastness of our soldiers instead focusing on two cowardly types who weasel their way to the front carrying a stretcher. How the media was able to tell the arriving soldiers that 300,000 had been saved bemused me but was just another piece of terrible storytelling. I had looked forward to this but it was dreadful. Want to watch the real story go to 1958 and 2004. This turkey is not worth your time.
9.0~The Unknown Soldiers mikkjall Sign in Permalink This film left me speechless and I found myself left alone with the titles and Zimmermann as all the other members of the audience had left the cinema. Contrary to what others have said the music was the star of the show. It sometimes intruded as far as it actually told the narrative, but Zimmer's score underlined and reinforced the emotions to an even higher level. Despite desperate scenes of terror, most of the most white knuckle moments were more individual and close camera, like being trapped in a box. The fact that many of the characters were not given names meant that they came to represent thousands of others who shared the same fate, a sort of mass Unknown Soldier. The theme of the movies is Getting Home and how and if that would happen and what sort of a welcome awaits you. The high point of the movie when this possibility moves from hopeless to possible, is underscored by a remarkable synthesis of music and environmental sounds as Elgar's Nimrod gradually appears through the mists and for a brief instance the White Cliffs loom in the memory on the horizon. This wonderful music ebbs and flows like the tides of hope. Nolan's use of real planes and boats wherever possible gives this movie intimate credibility, and his general avoidance of CGI extravaganza makes it both more believable and more personal.
5.0~Cold, empty and lacking scale.... richard-davis-987-676615 Sign in Permalink It's a visual spectacle, of that there is no doubt. However. I was left feeling empty and disappointed for these reasons: 1 - The lack of all CGI ruined the film for me from the get-go. During the first beach scene's, it strikes you how 70's/80's the beach front buildings and windows are. That's because it is. It looks way more recent than wartime. It's wrong and it looks wrong. 2 - I had no sense of scale. The beaches seemed as empty as the dialogue. There were supposed to be 400,000 soldiers awaiting evacuation and many hundreds, of not several thousands of civilian boats coming across to rescue them. Watching the film felt like there were a few thousand soldiers and maybe 50-100 boats involved. 3 - The whole film is devoid of much dialogue. It meant that you really didn't connect at all with any of the characters - particularly the Hardy character who did little more than look menacing with his eyes in most shots. 4 - I really didn't like the way that the story-telling dotted about, seemingly randomly at times, to tell a short and limited story from differing perspectives, in a totally non-sequential way. It made a mess of the story-telling for me. 5 - Did the Hardy character really do what he does in the film? I think not. A missed opportunity to have used this visual spectacular really hit home on what really happened, and what it was really like back in 1940 on Dunkirk beach, in the same way that the opening beach-landing scenes of Saving Private Ryan are indelibly etched into my mind as really giving a sense of visual perspective of how epicly awful it was to land on Omaha beach under enemy fire. The visuals are great. The story-telling is poor. Overall, it's not a film I'll be rushing to see again.
1.0~Missed Opportunity bbangley Sign in Permalink Other movies have been tedious, boring, and confusing. This one made me mad. Wasted subject. Wasted time. Wasted money. Dunkirk has neither mind nor spirit. It is an empty piece of trash put together by a team without understanding or the slightest familiarity with the dynamics of men and machinery involved. The list could be long: boats that instantly turn on their sides when hit, men who can survive under water, a plane that defies gravity, ammunition that never runs out, young men in combat who seem more like observers than participants, mature men in leadership who can only stare. Some have praised Hans Zimmer's score. What score? Nothing but two or three monotones sustained indefinitely while their waveforms are tweaked. Any kid with a synth could produce such stuff in a few minutes. The other part of the "score" consists of a pulse-like sound, played accelerando to give an impression of increasing tension. This was repeated several times. Cheap. Easy. And he got paid for this. No need to say more. A great film never needs to be explained or defended.
5.0~Took an dramatic event of epic proportions and made it seem small and ponderous rcnaylor Sign in Permalink My expectations for this film where high. Its a great story. Not giving away any spoilers to note its history: a 400,000 man British army trapped at the start of World War II. Under constant Germany attack, strafing and attack on land and sea. Rescued by a flotilla of average citizens. And, while visually compelling, the action scenes come across almost as rehearsed. Little drama. Slow for such a riveting story line. Most of the army characters seem like they are either demoralized zombies or weaklings scurrying anywhere to save themselves. Even the character who represents all the brave citizen sailors who risked everything to come to the aid of their military men comes across as more fatalistically compelled than heroic. An event of heroism on an epic scale is broken down into individual groups cast in a light with little of it. Its a large, compelling, riveting story, that the movie maker turns into small, slow, uncompelling and, frankly, almost an amateurish, paint by numbers yawner. It is a story that deserved a far better film rendition.
2.0~A fascinating topic but poorly executed jasonramage-50-263165 Sign in Permalink Like more recent reviews, I was hoping this would be a great depiction of what the soldiers and small vessel owners when through during this daring rescue but I just became increasingly bored watching this film. None of the characters held my attention long enough to feel a connection to. It's a shame really. I think I'll go back to watch 'WWII in HD colour' to get my fix on this fascinating and shocking historical event. Cheers
6.0~Missed Opportunity 😔 cellarboy Sign in Permalink Lacking in scale, lacking in back story, lacking in character development, lacking in crucial details, lacking in respect for the scale of the operation planning back at Dover & the collaboration with the French navy. It's not so much that it's bad at what it DOES show, but more about what it doesn't. Also, this was not the movie epic I expected from a 2017 top director. This is no Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge. This is a missed opportunity to show the WHOLE story of Dunkirk. The BBC did a much better job in 2004 with their low budget 3 part mini-series (docudrama). Disappointed. 6 our of 10.
9.0~Action packed greatness Jwgrant100 Sign in Permalink This movie by Christopher Nolan was a brilliant piece of work and will go down as his best Movie so far Fionn Whitehead was a fantastic choice for the lead role he amazed me in every possible way he will be the reason why this movie will win tons of awards Who would of thought that harry styles can act, of course I thought he was just being used as a tactic to bring in the young fans but he was surprisingly really good The movie was full of drama and action packed, had me on the edge of my seat the whole movie.
3.0~I was so looking forward to this for this movie........ tompa_larsen Sign in Permalink Been traveling and away but just managed to catch it on its last week here. I made it, so exited when me and my son sat down...... then. Major disappointment. How is it possible that it has been graded so high? So many mistakes that even my 14 year old son could find, History and Pilot nonsense etc. The good, in short. Actors did a good job, but that is about it. Then. Dunkirk was a major milestone during the second world war. The scale of it could not be seen in the movie. The soundtrack destroyed much of the overall feel and was annoying after awhile. Allot of noise to summarize it. The plot and suspense when soldiers were trapped in the fishing boat was ridiculous. I mean the boat was too heavy and one guy need to leave to make it float free, all while the boat was filled with more than 2 tons of water, really? And water kept coming in through bullet holes close to the water line but still with pressure that you could believe it was a submarine 20 meters below the surface. Then soldiers still manage to drown in the fishing boat. Allot of nonsense trying to get some nerve into the movie. This do not even belong in a B-movie, period. Then you have a pilot that can fly forever without the engine, even engage in enemy dogfight that he wins. He then do a flyby over the rescue flotilla (that could pick him up after ditching) but he choose to land on the beach to be captured by the Germans, what? The pilot stand next to his plane and Giant gantry cranes are visible in the background. No such cranes existed in the 40s. For a time i wonder if there were a twist there in the end, moving in time or so, but no, the cranes kept showing in the background and Germans show up. By then i was hoping to move in time, about two hours back or so. Why i kept asking me, make such a bad movie on such a piece of history?
8.0~Amazing film - almost igmusapa Sign in Permalink As a cinematic experience, especially when viewed at an IMAX, Dunkirk is an astonishing achievement. Story, acting, tension, atmosphere, soundtrack, cinematography, it's all brilliant and I thoroughly recommend it. However, two caveats: there were 350,000 British and French soldiers in and around Dunkirk in May/June 1940, there were masses of abandoned vehicles and equipment, dozens of wrecked ships, destroyed buildings, continuous raids by the Luftwaffe. After watching this film you will wonder where they were all hiding. Christopher Nolan seems to have concentrated on the individual more than the masses; no bad thing except visually. Dunkirk looks empty. Also, as is being pointed out in the Goofs section, there are innumerable factual errors where modern buildings and trains, road signs etc. are visible or used. Nolan's wish to film in the real location rather than in front of a green screen is laudable, but there has been no attempt, either physically or digitally, to make the surroundings look like they did in 1940. For once there is a case for the use of MORE CGI in a film. These anachronisms do detract from the overall brilliance of the film, and by quite a lot. Rather like a Shakespeare play performed in modern dress, the sense of time and place is missing. This is the Dunkirk evacuation set in 2017, not in 1940. A shame, but it's still worth seeing.
1.0~Shining example of the utter corruption inside the film industry RichardvonLust Sign in Permalink There can be only one explanation how every professional film critic has praised this production to the roof tops whilst virtually every reviewer here has exposed it as a worthless piece of junk; the 'idependent' professionals got paid to lie. There is nothing at all to merit even a score for this sickening mumbo jumbo of absurdity. Kenneth Brannah has revealed himself to be nothing more than than drama prostitute able to take any part that conveys him as a British hero even though his lines are entirely trite. Mark Rylance puts on a good show and Harry Styles shows that he has more than just a pretty face but one character survives no less than 5 ship wrecks on one day whilst a gliding engineless spitfire proves to be a fatal opponent for a fully armed German bomber. There is no script, no character development, no story of the battle and no attempt to show the vast scale of the original event. Just leave this rubbish alone and avoid anything ever praised by any of the critics who try to sell it to you. You are better off watching paint dry.
7.0~Dunkirk proud_luddite Sign in Permalink Based on a true WW2 story: after the German invasion of France in 1940, thousands of British and Allied soldiers await evacuation to Britain in the northern coastal French town of Dunkirk. Among war films, "Dunkirk" is unique in that it begins during the aftermath of an invasion rather than before it. The focus of "Dunkirk" is on rescuing several soldiers - too many for the sea vessels available - and preserve their lives. The main narrative is broken into smaller stories. While all are intriguing action-wise, the characterization is thin overall. One exception is a story in which a helpful English civilian and ex-sailor (Mark Rylance) takes his own pleasure yacht to Dunkirk along with his young son and his teenage friend. The other stories are good in showing the tension of too many people to be rescued with too few vehicles involved but this tension could have been enhanced. Writer-director Christopher Nolan has done a superb job in co-ordinating numerous extras and evoking an event that is far from the experience of the average viewer. (Apparently, Dunkirk survivors praised the film's accuracy.) He is greatly aided by his technical team especially those involving visual and sound effects. Some of the film's visuals truly stand out. Although I don't fully join the almost unanimously high acclaim for this film, I still recommend it - especially on as large a screen as possible.
1.0~Nolan's first bad movie matt_fresh Sign in Permalink Being the obsessed movie junkie that I am, I'm not sure I've ever seen a film without a main character(s), protagonist / antagonist. Not only is that incredibly annoying because there is nobody to root for, weather you like the good guys or the bad guys in a movie, but the constant, repetitive musical score is even more irritating. There is hardly any dialogue, and the few and far between when people do speak, I didn't care at all what they had to say because I couldn't identify with any of the characters, or ever remember most of their names! I am a huge Nolan fan, and I have no idea how he can go from making one terrific film after another to this awful disaster of a movie... Lucky I only wasted $5.99 On Demand at home, rather than walking out of the theater, because I would've demanded my money back. I have no clue how others have rated this movie so high, unless being incredibly bored and falling asleep deserves high ratings. Nominated for EIGHT OSCARS???!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! Don't even waste your time when it's free and you can't find anything else to watch, put on a classic. Cleaning the garage is more entertaining than Dunkirk.
5.0~Its a NO for me. gavii2000 Sign in Permalink Its a Big NO for me. I think its a boring movie. I'm very disappointed. Many times are very confusing in time and place. I expect much more after i saw the trailer. I payed $5 for the ticket so i can really complain, but i did not like it at all. I was expecting a good war movie and good fights. The story it self is good the movie is not.
1.0~Really awful frankderose Sign in Permalink Just a really awful movie. No sense of history. Disjointed. Just another vehicle for portraying the preoccupations of the modern psyche.
2.0~Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! garrvanorden-378-358098 Sign in Permalink Dunkirk, more like Dung-Crap! I have no idea why this movie received good reviews. Let me start with the good. This movie looked and sounded great in I-Max, and I saw this movie on $5 Tuesday. That's the end of the good. Now to the bad. This movie had no characters. I felt zero emotional connection to anyone in this movie. I didn't care if anyone lived or died or anything. Mark Rylance's (the BFG) character was the only one who was halfway interesting. He was the only character who had a decent amount of dialogue in the film, who had a clear goal, and who made decisions. The other character that had more than 5 lines in the picture was Kenneth Branagh's. He seemed utterly pointless. It seemed like he was watching the movie, and his purpose was just to say a cheesy lines about "Home" every once in a while. Tom Hardy's character was boring and repetitive, only to predictably save the day in the end. Because this movie is so messed up, it is really hard to decide who the main character is, but if I had to decide, it'd be the guy we see 1st. He is very forgettable. He looks and acts almost identical to his friend and almost everyone in the whole movie. He meets his friend while he is taking a dump. This is not a joke. So the main character doesn't poop. He stops and helps his new friend bury a body. And the guy doesn't poop the whole movie. And him and his new friend just try to escape the whole movie. That leads me to my second point: there is no plot. It's just a bunch of explosions. There's more plot in a Transformers movie. 'Poop guy' and 'bury dead body guy' just go from ship to ship trying to live. By the way, the movie is almost over before 'bury dead body guy' says anything. So these guys try to live, Kenneth Branagh stands on a dock and says things that don't matter, Mark Rylance picks up survivors in his boat, and Tom Hardy shoots other planes, while in his plane, over and over and over again, while not being seen or heard. And that's your movie. I kept waiting for the opening action sequence to be over. I kept waiting for it to slow down a little and have some exposition, but it never did. It was like I missed the beginning and just tuned into the climax of a long, humorless, silent picture. That's not to say that a movie can't be action packed and be great. U-571 is an example of a nearly non- stop, action packed, WWII movie, thrill ride. U-571 managed to have memorable and distinct characters with different purposes. U-571 had a plot with a clear goal and twists and turns. If Dunkirk could've just cut out some of the unnecessary bits, like Kenneth Branagh, and had the 1st half hour be set up and character development, then it could've been really good. But as it was, I didn't care about any of it. I kept watching English soldiers die and thinking, "I don't care. This movie didn't make me care." As simple as the plot for Dunkirk was, the movie was really confusing. You'd think if you're going for an exciting, action thriller, that a simple linear plot would suffice. This movie jumps all over the time-line without giving any hint that it just made a jump in time. Christopher Nolan does a great job of jumping all over the time-line in his movie Memento. In Memento, he manages to keep things coherent and engaging. Not so here. This is just disappointing. The time jumping is completely unnecessary here. What little dialogue there is in this film is really hard to hear because of thick accents, loud explosions, masks over faces, and the music being really loud in the mix. With a really simple plot that is really hard to follow and characters with zero development or even distinguishing traits, I found myself in a really big struggle to care about what I was watching, even with incredible imagery and sound design. Yet, the whole time, the movie was telling me what I was watching was really exciting with it's music score. And that leads me to my last point: I hated the music. It pains me to say that because I usually love Hans Zimmer, especially under the direction of Christopher Nolan. There is virtually no melody in this score. It's relentless and annoying. I guess I can't blame Zimmer, considering he was just scoring to picture. Imagine watching The Dark Knight, but during the entire movie all you heard was The Joker's theme, non-stop. That's what it's like. The whole soundtrack may as well just be an air raid siren. And it's not just the music. The sound effects, as incredible as they were, were also loud, annoying, and relentless. At times, I found myself covering my ears. I thought, "Why am I paying money to cover my ears? What I'm covering my ears to is what I paid for." You know what movie is better than this: all the movies I have seen this year. Valerian and The Mummy were even better. They were at least fun. The best movie I've seen this Summer is War for the Planet of the Apes, but you really need to see all the Apes pictures to get the full enjoyment out of that one. The next best is Spider-Man: Homecoming, but maybe you're not up to date with the Marvel movies. In that case, see Wonder Woman. You don't need to see the other DC movies to enjoy that one. But what ever you do, don't see Dunkirk. I beg of you not to give that garbage your support.
1.0~Great Story - Awful Movie stewartj-64471 Sign in Permalink The Director missed a great opportunity with this movie. There is no effort to set up the context of the movie and why Dunkirk is happening. In 1940 most people knew of Dunkirk, its importance, and what happened there. That is not the case in 2017. I heard several patrons asking the questions; Did this really happen? Where is Dunkirk? There is a lack of dialogue between the actors but lots of explosions and machine gun fire. I felt like I was watching a remake of Vantage Point, seeing the same scenes shot from different angles and purported to be different actions. With only 3 British and 3 German aircraft, one civilian craft with a very few in the background and one mine sweeper - anchored, this was an underwhelming experience. The individual acting was very good, but could not make up for the lack of a good story line or the bad directing.
10.0~A mind blowing piece of cinema and a film like none other before it eddie_baggins Sign in Permalink I can safely say that you've never seen a film quite like Dunkirk before. You may think you know what your getting yourself into as you grab your ticket, order your popcorn and beveridge combo (and hopefully additional choc-top), but Christopher Nolan's anything but typical war film, that thrusts us headfirst into the Dunkirk evacuation/battle, is an experience unlike any other. Forgoing the need to follow a traditional narrative or even the need to join the audience to any one character more than another, Nolan's wholly immersive and often breath-taking big screen event, is the work of a cinematic genius at one with his craft with an ability to deliver a piece of cinema that will likely take us all some time to fully comprehend. From almost the very first frame of this visually stunning spectacle, Nolan brings us to into a thrilling fight for survival that for around 100 non-stop minutes takes us on a perilous, danger filled experience on land, sea and air as a collection of British soldiers and countrymen look to escape the beaches of Dunkirk as the German army encompasses them ever so surely. The way in which Nolan uses this history making moment of World-War 2 to explore a pulse-pounding tale of survival and sacrifice is incredible and delivered through a non-linear fashion that plays with timeframes and portrays numerous scenes through different points of view, Nolan has crafted a war film cume thriller that must surely be one of the tensest films ever made. You feel every bullet passing through the air, you feel the ominous dread of planes flying over head unleashing hell from above, you feel the full force of a crash landing or crushed bones and you sense the unrelenting will to survive, all playing out through a spectacularly crafted film production. Seeing Dunkirk in Imax is a jaw dropping experience and this is a one of those films that all should seek to catch on the nearest biggest screen available. Nolan who alongside DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema and renowned composer Hans Zimmer has crafted an undeniably impressive big screen creation. Zimmer's frantic tension racketing score and Hoytema's expansive lens (perfect for Imax enjoyment) working alongside Nolan and his committed cast that is spearheaded by Fionn Whitehead's young solider Tommy, Tom Hardy's dogged pilot Farrier, Mark Rylance's everyday seaman turned hero Mr. Dawson, Cillian Murphy's shell-shocked and nameless survivor and yep One Direction's Harry Style's Alex, Dunkirk is an all round production that will likely partake in an abundance of technical end of year awards and hopefully past-due awards recognition for Nolan himself. A master of his art for so long now, Dunkirk feels like the final undeniable piece of Nolan's filmography puzzle and for anyone that has felt in the past that Nolan is undeserving of the praise he has so far received, good luck arguing against it now after sitting through this impeccably designed and executed thrill-ride that achieves its goal of not delieveing a history lesson but an utterly captivating encapsulation of the Dunkirk event. Final Say – While it has some minor flaws and foibles (what film doesn't?), Dunkirk is clearly the work of a master director that acts as groundbreaking cinema that should be sought out by any who have even a passing interest in film. A white-knuckle examination of an unbelievable true life event, that's filled with spectacle but most importantly an understated yet touching and thought- provoking power, Dunkirk is easily one of the years must-see film's and a likely all time classic of the war genre. 5 pieces of bread out of 5
6.0~Not better than other movie about wars... hikaru_playful Sign in Permalink This didn't satisfy me at all: 1. Speed is too slow. It's a freaking war, dude, speed up if you don't want to die. 2. They add many characters that didn't give me time to build my emotion and feelings for characters. (One way to fix this is: giving me more characters, more deaths, more tragedy; make all of those things into a bomb and throw it to my face, please!!!) They didn't do it that way, so this whole movie is pretty boring. 3. A stupid useless time-waiting flashback. 4. A simple story-line.
2.0~Dull, uninvolving and nonsensical in spite of one or two moments SimonB27 Sign in Permalink There are no spoilers in this review. We know how the whole thing ends or, if you don't, stop reading and get a history book. This film is not the way to learn anyway. I had high hopes of Dunkirk. People were saying it is a great film. I remain baffled as to why. I did not quite want to walk out of Dunkirk, but I was bored and I can't say I enjoyed it. It has too many fundamental failings. Here's why. Firstly (let's start with something positive), the good points. There is a bit of spectacular photography. Some of the shots of ships are well done. The acting - Having said that there's not a lot of "acting" at all. Come to think of it there should be a lot more "acting". The characters should be more terrified, angry, resilient, defiant, chipper etc. None of this comes across but I think that's the director's fault, not the actors'. There are some interesting vignettes. They stand alone as well-executed scenes but, as I'll discuss later, they don't add up to much. Er, that's about it. Now, the things that just added up to make the film annoying, dull and uninvolving. Characterisation - I just wasn't invested in any of the characters. The "lead" in the form of the soldier that we follow through the trials and tribulations of the evacuation is just not a sympathetic character. He is a chancer trying to get ahead of the queue. Quite apart from the fact that he's certainly not representative of the troops at Dunkirk, it's unnecessary; he's a weasely little character when there's a much bigger story going on. The rest of the characters are largely two-dimensional. The sub-plot on the boat, brings in another unsympathetic character, is difficult to believe in, is a distraction and has nothing to do with the evacuation. If we needed character sub-plots, we'd have been much better off looking at the people back home in England, their fears, motivations etc. and we'd understand the story of Dunkirk better. There is also no sense of the real fear, desperation, defiance etc that must have been foremost in the minds of the men on the beach. In fact there is very little emotion in the film at all. We follow a couple of soldiers about for a bit but we get no sense that men are awaiting the lottery of the next Luftwaffe bombing raid, losing their comrades or wondering if they will get home to their wives or whether a Panzer division is about to come over the horizon. Scale - there is absolutely NO sense of the scale of the evacuation. The actual evacuation involved some 400,000 men. We see very few... really, very few. We hear a man on a stretcher takes the space of seven standing men but the ships leaving the harbour are clearly not full; there are just a few guys standing by the railings. At Dunkirk, men were so crammed onto ships they had to leave their backpacks behind. Surely the budget could have run to a few more extras or a bit of CGI. We see three British aeroplanes and a couple of German ones! Story - there is no real story to invest in. Quite apart from the intensely annoying non-linear narrative, there is no sense of what actually happened at Dunkirk. We never get to understand why it happened, why the commanders did what they did or what choices they had, the RAF's role, the French army's role, how the fleet of little ships came about, why Hitler didn't attack by land or anything really. Non-linear narrative - oh my goodness me! Why? Don't get me wrong I enjoy a well-constructed non-linear narrative, but this isn't it. The story jumps around for no readily apparent reason. We see things twice but then there are two planes at one point so we're not quite sure if it's the first plane or the second one. It's a mess. Again, some interesting little vignettes but not adding up to any coherent story we can invest in. And then there are all the other little nit-picking bits that made the film annoying and distracting. A soldier salutes a very senior colonel without his hat on (not done!) and then casually imparts a load of information without once saying "Sir". Would a senior naval officer in 1940 really say "we're stuffed"? Spitfires could fire their guns for a total of about 17 seconds and did not have apparently unlimited ammunition, nor could they keep flying with no engine. If a plane passes you at altitude (at what? 120-150mph?) and then ditches, it will not be 100 yards or so from your boat, it'll be well over a mile away. How is the boat captain an expert in German aerial tactics; his explanation makes no sense. When you're not invested in a film, you notice these things. Oh yes and other people have commented on the score. What score? It's just noise except for the final section is it supposed to be rousing or patriotic? It's just Elgar's Nimrod played at about 1/4 speed. Score by Hans Zimmer?.. not really. So all in all while this film does have one or two moments. It adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts. I had started giving this three stars but the more I think about it, I don't think it's worth even that. Not only could it have been so much more, it's actually quite a badly made film. Why on earth are people giving it high ratings?
9.0~Almost cinematic perfection dermobreen Sign in Permalink First off, it's great to be able to write a review and not be afraid of spoilers. Unless you have never opened a history book in your life, most will know how the story ends. The tag-line for Dunkirk is "the event that shaped our world". I'd like to think of it as "the film that changed cinema - again!" Too bold a claim? Read on. My first introduction to Christopher Nolan's work was 2000's Memento which also introduced Guy Pearce to the big screen as he leapt from Ramsey Street in Neighbours (playing Mike Young for four years) to Hollywood. Memento is a film that had an instant impact on me. At the time I was not sure what I had just seen and it is a film I return to at least once a year and find something fresh in it. The Noughties say Nolan immersed in the DC world with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. 2010 saw Nolan revisiting his fascination with time and our perception of time in Inception. It played with our perceptions of reality, time, asking what is it to dream, what is it to be awake and are we a dream within a dream, borrowing an idea from Edgar Allen Poe. Fast forward to 2017 and we arrive at Dunkirk. Before I discuss the plot or the performance, let's talk technical. Nolan filmed Dunkirk in IMAX with an aspect ratio of 1:1 and that is how one should view this film if possible. Not all of us can access an IMAX theatre. I saw it projected in 1.666:1 in my local multiplex so I feel I lost some of the visual, visceral aspects that the director intended. Getting an IMAX camera into the cockpit of a Submarine Spitfire could not have been an easy feat! Despite the technical wizardry on display, Nolan manages to tell a series of personal stories using vignettes. Dunkirk is a sombre film. This is no celebration of life. Nolan tells the story of the evacuation of 400,000 service men from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in WWII by pleasure craft from the south coast of the UK. We get the perspective of the Spitfire pilot, the service men on the ground, the Admiral in charge of the investigation. Yet amongst all of these personal stories there is tragedy. We see the desperation of the men trying to get home and sneaking onto ships. We see the despair of a serviceman take off his helmet and rifle and walking into the sea while his comrades sit and watch, each as helpless as the other. It is a huge credit to Nolan that while he paints this enormous palette of images, he can focus tightly on the smallest aspect of humanity. Nolan also revisits his favourite topic of time. Dunkirk, while being told through vignettes, splits up the story-telling into one hour, one day and one week. He then proceeds to rearrange the sequence of events into a non-linear act of story-telling. This has huge echoes of Memento and Inception and at this stage is almost a trademark of Nolan's. Personally, I think the style will divide audiences who prefer linear story-telling. However Nolan firmly believes that audiences are smart enough to figure it out on their own. They don't need reams of exposition to understand what is happening. I respect Nolan for that. To be honest I was almost half-way through the film before I noted the time-leaps he was making, back and forth. It is a style that allows him to tell the same story from multiple perspectives. I love it! Nolan has assembled a stellar cast including Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, relative new-comer Fionn Whitehead, not to mention One Direction's Harry Styles as Alex. Most characters only get first names and some get none. Cillian Murphy is "the Shivering Soldier" - it doesn't get more stripped-back than that. All performances are excellent. Character development is pretty much non- existent. It is not needed as motivation is obvious. Let's talk about the soundtrack, provided by Hans Zimmer. He has provided the soundtrack for a good many Nolan films with Dunkirk their latest collaboration. Zimmer's syncopated style provides a stunning addition to Nolan's story-telling. There is not a note out of place. This is what soundtracks should be. Is Dunkirk the greatest film of the 21st century, probably not but Hans Zimmer's score certainly is. A masterpiece. I was left wanting more and wanting to see it again in IMAX. My recommendation is to go see it on the biggest, loudest screen you can find. Size matters. So too does the sound system. For me, it's a 4.5 out of 5 - almost perfection.
10.0~A masterpiece. oliverbelus Sign in Permalink It's INCREDIBLE! But some people are blind and deaf... physically and emotionally too it seems. It used barely any CGI, and it wasn't a standard mainstream Americanized action-packed movie with clichéd characters. It didn't need any elaborate dialogues or "heroes". Nolan conveyed the emotions through classic cinematography (i.e. real planes, real people, real boats, and real locations i.e. no green screens) and through a haunting score (music track) by Hans Zimmer. It's a masterpiece. It's more about humanity and our struggle to survive. War isn't "fun" as some films portray it to be... War is about survival, death, sacrifice, betrayal and being in the present moment at all times. I was blown away.
4.0~Smoke On The Water And Fire In The Sky Dan1863Sickles Sign in Permalink This afternoon I went to see DUNKIRK since a dear friend from the UK (and she knows who she is) recommended it the other day. I thought the film really captured the panic, terror, and confusion of battle, but I didn't particularly like any of the characters and I thought the dialogue was very poorly written (and hard to hear.) Some things I thought were just silly, like the way the pilot in the ocean can't open his escape hatch just so the nice man in the boat can rescue him more excitingly! And the way those soldiers all climb into a boat that's just lying on the sand and then just wait until they get shot at and start yelling at each other. Worst of all was the Spitfire that just ran out of gas in mid air, and just went right on gliding along for another half hour! Beneath the silliness, there was a lot of spineless political correctness. I listened closely, (had to, with such dreadful sound editing and a dreadful soundtrack) but I never once heard the word "Nazi," or the word "Hitler." Or Gestapo, or Brownshirt, or Jew. You'd never know the "enemy" had done anything to fill the mild-mannered British people with such desperate resolve! Who on earth were the film makers covering up for? And what exactly did they imagine they were celebrating? Shell shock and shaky nerves? Men hitting each other in blind panic? Random explosions and tons of flame? Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky? (Now THAT would have livened up the soundtrack.) If you watch this movie, you won't learn anything about how the British pulled off a miracle at Dunkirk. Or why Hitler was a menace and his army were criminals. But you will see lots of close ups of Kenneth Branagh and you will have lots of time to contemplate the sublime beauty of his flabby old face looking pained and noble. Thanks chaps! If you ever want to see a really good movie about this exact moment in British history, you should watch MRS. MINIVER with Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. It was made in Hollywood but it's such a loving tribute to the British people, their kindness and gentleness and sense of humor as well as their strength and patriotism. It's a million times better than Dunkirk!
10.0~Sobering and captivating Figgy66-915-598470 Sign in Permalink 28 July 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Dunkirk. This is a name everyone has heard of, how the allied troops were forced north onto the beaches and how a grand flotilla of small boats went and rescued them, but how many people have really sat down and thought about what actually happened. Films often romanticise war, and it's not always their fault, stories transferred to the big screen often make heroes where there are none and hide true heroes in the background. That is not the case with this film......Christopher Nolan has written and produced a masterpiece. The raw edgy style of cinematography draws you in from the very beginning and you feel yourself running alongside these soldiers, sitting in the back seat of the spitfire willing the bullets to find their mark, and on board the small vessels urging their engines to go faster and get the job done. The film is full of heroes, not just the pilots or the skippers, but every single fighting man, played by actors representing real people, in a very real and terrible situation. I thought the way the film jumped between the three main parts of the story was captivating, I found myself getting immersed in each bit, not wanting to leave but eager to jump to the next part to see how that group of people were faring. There was very little in the way of blood flying around, but that in no way lessened the impact of the horror of war, and the desperation these men must have felt as they tried again and again to get off the beach and head for home. There were no fanfares, no trumpets, just a quiet satisfaction of job done and a sadness for all those who didn't survive. An excellent job from Christopher Nolan.

1.0~The worst Nolan's film ever quartzhun-838-664155 Sign in Permalink Very disappointing because of: *The worst voice quality of the recently watched films - terrible *Bad start ever, asphalt road, clear walls etc!!! *Too sterile pictures, sights - every body who starts a research will see on the old 1940s photos of Dunkirk that roads , buildings and coasts were full of mess, debris etc. *The casts have no faces, names like zombies - only a died boy's name - George- remained in my mind. There is no really main character(s) *Very poor views of the dogfights *Poor picture quality -grain noisy and sometimes the objects is out of focus- and camera movements compared example to the War for the Planet of the Apes - over all the best quality every levels, sound, voice, picture quality, camera movements actors performances etc.- and compared to other IMAX movies *I gave only 1 point because of these reasons, the huge budget and the very professional A list directors, crews and actors. The bottom of the B category for ~150 mil. Finally I was a big Nolan fan but now I am very disappointed and a bit up set in turn I'm and my family big fan of the cinemas especially ODEON ISENSE with Dolby Atmos. Usually I didn't do reviews I'm sick of this terrible movies.
3.0~Opportunity Lost lex-44169 Sign in Permalink An historic event like the Dunkirk/Dunquerke evacuation deserved a much better effort. The hype exceeded the content of the movie and I could not feel that I was taken along with the plot. The only thing I was taken for was for watching it. The roles played lacked any dramatic plot which is a shame. I will admit the air combat scenes were realistic enough and it was a pleasure to see that action. The actual event at Dunkirk was a side event to the movement of some soldiers scampering away from the action. Lacklustre.
4.0~utterly overrated sadak7599 Sign in Permalink I think that all the "micro vs macro" envision of the battle and other explanations on good reviews are bullshit. This is a bad movie full of trickery. The beautiful scenery, music, slow action that pretends to be deep and intimate (sometimes I remember the way better 'Thin Red Line', Terrence Malick, 1998) may fool a lot of viewers. But the reality is this: 1. No story at all. Simply some unlikable characters (except the old civilian captain) wandering around. 2. Very bad setting. Modern buildings around the beach, a modern factory on the background and modern ships equipped with recent technology that they tried to disguise, failing miserably, do not help to get into the movie. 3. No epics. 4. No respect for the facts. A few soldiers making a line, a bunch of small boats and three planes gave a very poor envision of the dimensions of the real Dunkirk battle, in which hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of pieces of equipment (trucks, guns, tanks...) packed out the beaches and the city, in which 40000 french soldiers died or were captured backing up the evacuation of the army fighting a real enemy, not an invisible menace that shot out a few bullets and a few bombs with one or two planes from time to time. 5. The French should be offended. 120000 French soldiers were evacuated also. In this movie, French are treated like garbage. 6. Risible air raids and combats, ended with a plane that violates the law of physics. This movie is not a tribute to the Dunkirk soldiers. It is offensive to the memory of that momentous event in the History.
6.0~A Visual Marvel, Minus Soul! namashi_1 Sign in Permalink Written, Co-Produced and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 'Dunkirk' is a magnificent technical achievement, that is a feast for the eyes. Nolan, a master in his craft, sadly fails as a Writer, delivering a War Epic that's ambitious & huge in scale, but also soulless. Its definitely a well-made film, but not in the level of how a Nolan motion-picture generally is. 'Dunkirk' Synopsis: Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. 'Dunkirk' puts 3 different time-lines together & jumbles them into a king-sized narrative. The film begins with a flourishing impact, showing us how the soldiers are in constant havoc. What follows is how survival is at stake & how the carnage of war can damage those who go at the battlefield to protect their nation. Nolan handsomely mounts a visually staggering war epic, that doesn't have a single frame that lacks ambition or genuine skill. The war depicted here in 'Dunkirk' is intense & hardcore, that's sure to leave you disturbed. BUT, 'Dunkirk' lacks a cohesive Screenplay. Nolan's Screenplay is packed with intensity, but is too busy to make us feel for its heroic characters. Seen from three perspectives, 'Dunkirk' has too many characters, but not for one, do you feel for. And that's indeed disappointing, considering this is a film about War Heroes. Nolan crowds the film with three perspectives, but forgets too give its characters depth. And that's certainly unacceptable from a guy like Nolan. Nolan made Superhero films that were more about the heroes without the capes, and delivered an affecting family-drama while indulging in the Sci-Fi zone last time, but in 'Dunkirk' there is not a single character that you'll remember or even, feel for, despite their heroic courage. Nolan's Writing is a letdown & comes up as a minus. Nolan's Direction is marvelous. He's a master at his craft & the atmosphere he sets in here, is simply terrific. How I wish his Writing was as strong as his Direction. Hans Zimmer's Score is magnificent & turns 'Dunkirk' into a heart-pounding experience. Hoyte van Hoytema's Cinematography is astounding. The lens-man has filmed each & every frame, with flawlessness. Lee Smith's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. The Choerography of the War-Sequences, are tremendous. As mentioned earlier, 'Dunkirk' is a remarkable technical achievement. Talking of performances, its only Tom Hardy as Farrier, a Royal Air Force pilot & the Legendary Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton, the pier-master during the evacuation, who stand out. On the whole, 'Dunkirk' is certainly a well-made film with plus points, but the lack of depth in its characters, are hard to ignore. Its a crushing disappointment.
3.0~Lacking in depth Floated2 Sign in Permalink Being a fan of Christopher Nolan's films and enjoying his other films, one was anticipating the arrival of Dunkirk. Released in 2017 and being an instant hit at the box office and seeing mostly overwhelming positive critics reviews, the anticipation got somewhat higher. As a film, Dunkirk is relatively great directed and has great visuals in cinematography, as it is well to look at. And the camera angles work well. The film is somewhat disappointing and boring in depth. There were many characters but hardly we get invested in. The film felt slightly longer than its runtime. As a film, it just didn't grab the attention and wasn't as entertaining as lead to be. Most of the film as a whole just felt slow and boring at times. Quite overrated simply because Christopher Nolan directed it.
9.0~Emotional and technical brilliance Morten_5 Sign in Permalink Thank you, Nolan, for being the saviour of my blockbuster movie summer. Your vision and creativity is unique in productions of this scale. When, a few years ago, I heard that the next Christopher Nolan pic would be one about WWII, I must admit feeling a bit disappointed. I wasn't quite sure there would still be something new to bring the genre. From the first few seconds of "Dunkirk," I gathered I'd been wrong to doubt. During the 107 minutes of running time, I was glued to screen. Nolan and his cast and crew delivers one of the tightest war thrillers ever to screened to this date. The airplane scenes alone are absolutely amazing. With sound design, sound editing, film editing, practical and visual effects, cinematography and a score like this, it will take, in fairness, a helluva movie to prove more worthy of associated Academy Awards.
5.0~An almost cinematic masterpiece lacking connection and the true grandeur of this event. Toocooltoobefooled Sign in Permalink This movie is just short of a masterpiece. It's failing is it's inability to build the suspense and anticipation in the viewer that it tries so desperately to achieve. The first time I saw the trailer I was mesmerized, "man i can't wait to see that movie." The second time, a little less. By the 4th and 5th time I saw the trailer with it's constant ticking of the clock and the attempted anticipating buildup at the docks, I felt like I no longer cared. In fact my son reacted in the same way. He also said, i'm not sure I really want to see this movie anymore, I'm kind of sick of all the build up in the previews that never seems to deliver any hint of what it's building towards. The whole movie has that feel. It's all about getting these boys home and there is a constant attempt to build up to something, that just really never arrives. They show the same scenes over and over, but from multiple different perspectives. I felt like I was watching a preview, a coming attraction, that never gets to the point. When I say the movie is a masterpiece, it really is, the cinematography is amazing. The actors, while they have very little dialog, are so authentic you feel like it's 1940. However, there is no back story on any of them and no main character, so there is no connection. This was I think an attempt to build on the theme of 400,000 nameless faceless individuals, but it leaves you disconnected from their plight. The attention to the clothing, the surroundings, all little details are amazing, but it all adds up to a few ships being sunk and a few planes being shot down viewed over and over from different perspectives. You do not get a sense of the overwhelming accomplishment this really was. Think about it 400,000 men having to be evacuated. You don't really see the enormity of it, you only see a few hundred, maybe a few thousand men, a few ships, there were over 800 in reality. The film fails to deliver the grandeur of the true historical event. As a result of all these failings, you never feel the anxiety the film is attempting to create, you never feel the sense of dread, despair, nothing. There is just no connection, just beautiful cinematography. A masterpiece without any direction, without any real connection. Too bad.
6.0~an okay nolan's movie prisleyfebrian-79751 Sign in Permalink i have to say the technique of this movie is remarkable.. the score, the camera shot, the real planes and boats..it's all good.. i really feel like i was there.. but I was.. confused.. and not in a good way (because I know nolan is always mindfuck our brains with his time manipulating, and by this, we need second or more rewatch). the timeline reminds me with memento, which is i get to understand just from the first watch, but not for dunkirk. i give this a 6 for i really get the message, and the experience, i have to say was real. i was hooked. but, i have to agree with others that this movie was emotionless..
1.0~Exceptionally poor story telling mayree-79278 Sign in Permalink I can't believe how over rated this movie is. Seriously, three Oscars! for this crap. Movies are intended to tell a story, but all Dunkirk did was show me show soldiers on a beach, a family on a boat and pilots in the air without giving me any reason to care for any of them. There is no character buildup to help us sympathize with them. Hell I don't even know the name of any character. The background sounds were unbearable. Only God knows what the money budgeted for this movie was used for. Dunkirk is an absolute waste of your precious energy and time.
5.0~Sorry, but a movie completely and utterly destroyed mainly by terrible sound and score............ Wayne1138 Sign in Permalink A film I have been dying to see ever since it was announced and early reviews were 'Nolans Best Film!!' 'A Masterpiece!!' Really?? I don' think so. So what went wrong, other than critics, websites and movie mags over praising yet another film?? Well the main reason I hated this film is because of the sound. Yes the sound. I always see blockbusters or films on a grand scale like this in IMAX. I have never watched a film in the format where you couldn't hear what the cast were saying 50% of the time like what happened with Dunkirk. Whether its been Star Trek, Star Wars, Marvel movies or even Nolans Interstellar, I have never had such a bad experience like this with IMAX before. I don't believe it was the fault of IMAX, it was the actual sound done for the film itself that was the huge problem. This didn't help at all with that god awful 'ticking clock' in the film as well. Over the trailer for Dunkirk, there was a ticking of a clock that ran through the trailer. Now that is fine for a trailer but through an ENTIRE movie????? Really???? It eventually stopped 10 minutes before the end where I felt absolute relief, and it is no coincidence that I then started to enjoy the movie in such short space of time. What an horrendous decision to make and it also didn't help that Hans Zimmers score (who is normally excellent with Nolans movies) was also terrible. I have never done it before, but I was close to walking out of the film half way through as I had enough and my head was literally pounding. I know a lot of people complained about the sound in The Dark Knight Rises so although Nolan is a great story teller 80% of the time and has literally nailed what visuals are up on screen, he REALLY needs to work on the sound for his films. Another reason the film doesn't work is the constant moving backwards and forwards in the story by having the same part of the story told time and time again from different peoples views and situations. This was also a big mistake and didn't help the flow of the film at all. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad. This film was visually faultless and I mean faultless. You really felt like you were there in the middle of this war. A so so bunch of actors and characters with Cillian Murphy on top form but unfortunately his character was a coward and for me, also a murderer. The real hero in this film though (even though he is behind a mask for 90% of the film) is Tom Hardy. In what is probably the most incredible realistic aerial battles ever put in a movie and up there on screen, his character is the real hero of the film. This brings me to one of the most beautiful breathtaking shots in a film ever where Hardy's Spitfire is 'gliding' along the beach at Dunkirk after he has run out of fuel. It was an incredible shot. This however, is not enough to make up for how the rest of the film was handled. If it hadn't been for the sound and the constant backwards and forwards with the story, this would have been rightly a masterpiece and Nolans best film. Alas it is not and for me his masterpiece is still Interstellar. Quite possibly the most over praised movie since Gravity which was another huge disappointment. I must admit I only saw the B&W version of Dunkirk last year and I would rather watch that version any day of the week than Nolans. What a way for a director to utterly destroy what could have been a film that would have ended up in my top 10 of all time. Going forward Mr Nolan, PLEASE work on the sound in your films as I don't ever want to be put through that ever again!!!
1.0~most stupid movie of the year robairlb-29914 Sign in Permalink why there is not a zero rating to give for this movie just do not waste your time and money the story is trivial and boring as hell compared to other war movies it worth nothing...people just start punching stars and amazing ratings for this crap but for what...i got so damn bored and fell asleep at the end
3.0~Awful strfrank Sign in Permalink I'm generally hooked on historic movies, usually fascinated by the aspect alone that the events displayed really happened. Sadly however that is about the only grace the movie can offer. Absolutely bland & one-dimensional characters, the antagonist SS- Officer was a complete joke - especially if you're capable of the German language. (grammatically this didn't even resemble German at times + there wasn't a single authentic line in the entire movie.) In its entirety Dunkirk has nothing to offer, but a few 'heroics'. - Not once have I been sucked into this story. Not once have I felt an inkling of the immediate threat of the situation. All that aside, perhaps the worst thing about this movie are the overwhelmingly positive reviews of critics. I know war hero stories from WW2 are a sanctity few would mess with - but this movie stands as a shameful testament towards that bias. I was expecting more from Nolan, hopefully he will get back to his old self.
9.0~Very Powerful... ycho-29371 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's newest film Dunkirk is a psychologically harrowing war film about one of the terrifying events occurred in history. While it may not be one of his best films, it still is a profound, powerful war film that truly honors the fact based story and event. Nolan crafts this film as if we, the audience is one of the frightened soldiers attended at the tragic yet distressing event that plays at the big screen extensively realistic. Dunkirk does the best job at satisfyingly delivering the frighteningly realistic portrayal of war and the evacuation in the outlook of the soldiers who were desperate at reaching home. What makes Dunkirk one of the best war films and eminently realistic are the production designs which has a usage of substantial boats, planes etc, the impressive performances and the top- notch sound design. Most films especially superhero action flick consistently include large reliance on CGI. It has become the crucial trend in the film industry. Nevertheless, Dunkirk has none of that. It uses practical effects, real-life locations, and substantive components. As a result, when boats sink or planes blow-up, it makes these additionally terrifying and hand-gripping. Dunkirk has some of the best aerial dogfights ever put to screen. Unlike the typical war films, Dunkirk isn't about sympathetic characters whom we know about their history or the amazing, drastic action sequences. This film mainly focuses on the evacuation and the survival throughout these drastically harsh conditions that are far from survival. It shows three directions which are the beach, standpoints at the boats, and the air. These three viewpoints intertwined concentratedly expressing the chances of survival of the 400,000 soldiers stuck at Dunkirk. The sound design was terrifyingly perfect embodying the gunshots, airplanes, and the crashes more resonant and an enhanced viewing experience that was memorable. All of the actors are great. Nolan used plentiful of young actors as the frightened soldiers. The main standouts were Tom Hardy (Farrier), Kenneth Branagh (Commander Bolton) and Mark Rylance (Mr. Dawson). All of these characters appear as the central focuses at the beach, the air, and the boats as they balance these stories. Mr. Dawson appears as one of the civilian vessels marching to help the soldiers. Additionally, Harry Styles (Alex) had an impactful presence along with Fionn Whitehead (Tommy). Overall, Dunkirk is an emotionally impactful and powerful war film about heroism, survival and a deep message that evacuation can be the victory along the supports of civilians. Nolan crafts this film thoroughly realistic, gritty and brutal for a PG-13 rated film. While the characters may not be the strongest, this is about war, the horror of the moment. Grade: A

3.0~8.4? Were we watching the same movie? guyzradio Sign in Permalink I sat through the movie and walked out concluding it was a near dud. A confusing attempt at anachronistic triple time line story telling, no discernible plot or character motivations, minimal appearances by the only two actors I recognized (one of them thanks to Netflix), no women, etc., etc., etc. I gave it a "3" for photography and effects. Much better expected from Christopher Nolan. Save your money and get it on video. Or not at all.
4.0~Over-bored noelbillington Sign in Permalink Over-hyped and over-budgeted this emperor's new clothes of a film is expensively but far from seamlessly stitched together. No character development or back story whatsoever so impossible to care about any of the protagonists, no cinematic grandeur and literally not a German to be seen ( probably a clever metaphor which like many of the bombs and bullets in the film went over my head ). Perhaps suffering from it's 12A rating the beach massacre was far too clinical and lacking in realism, explosion after explosion followed by soldiers simply getting up and immediately standing back in the ' sea' queue or playing dead, no one injured, screaming, bloodied or even limping slightly or sucking on a sore finger. The toe-curling shoe-horned incident of the Enid Bilghton caricatured thick kid fatally falling down two steps of a boat ( curiously the one place there was an actual suggestion of blood, but not much ) seems like a clumsy afterthought. At least we can depend on Tom Hardy to single handily knock those Gerry bombers and fighters for six, even with not a drop of fuel in his kite then, land beautifully on the German held beach and, avoiding their towels, get out, blow up his plane and standing rather dangerously close for my liking( of course he is very brave must have known it was safely out of ammo by now ) watch it burn whilst waiting stoically to be taken prisoner, no doubt to fight another day.
4.0~A story that fails to go anywhere; An extremely disappointing missed opportunity. alexpaintercanada Sign in Permalink Dunkirk is over-saturated with close-ups on actors, unnecessary filler, plagued by a pointless plot that goes absolutely nowhere, and leaves the audience wondering what in the world they had just watched. The French were merely alluded to, and the Germans barely made appearance. At least, one could say that there was an attempt at making a different kind of war film. Opposed to showing the grit and highlighting the horrors of war, Dunkirk tried to be a war-drama - It did not work. A slow, impotent script, plus a boring, uncompelling cast of characters leaves me no choice but to poorly rate a film that should have been a masterpiece. If I told you that the first twenty minutes of a movie follows two men running around carrying a stretcher, would you want to go see it? I would pray your response would be no. Suspense is a beautiful thing while being done correctly, but if by an hour into a movie the viewer is still wondering: "When is something going to happen?", there is well beyond too much suspense. There was a lot of history to grasp from, including the inner turmoil that Dunkirk stirred among the Nazis. There was Churchill's famous speech, the French, whom helped a hell of a lot more than what the movie showed. This movie seemed little more than patriotic, as if the British are pining for more praise. What seemed like a highlight reel of pretty camera shots, actor head- shots, and fancy editing tricks, missed the mark entirely. A war movie should make it's audience sad, maybe even a little angry. All Dunkirk did or me was made me feel immensely disappointed. This movie is not worth your money, and frankly, is unmemorable. Just watch Black Hawk Down or Hacksaw Ridge if you want to watch a decent war film. You'll get way more out of those two films. Cheers.
1.0~Nolan : Let's make people think that this movie is smart (Spoiler : It is not) wuhugm Sign in Permalink Let's make a war movie from the perspectives of random soldiers, it would be fun. Oh, let's also not shown "The Enemy" at all, it would be a masterpiece. Maybe it could be so, but it didn't. It failed spectacularly (But somehow people think this is epic, why?) Go watch Saving Private Ryan again then compare it to Dunkirk. If Saving Private Ryan is a 9 then Dunkirk would be a 2, and that's still a compliment. This is not smart evacuation movie, this is a boring and dumb soap opera. Bullets and Bombs literally came from nowhere. Boring characters you don't care about escaping from one place to another. Seriously guys, this is not a good movie, why is this so highly rated? Have most people on earth replaced by aliens from outer space that they think this is great movie?
8.0~An emotional trip back in time. ElementoSocial Sign in Permalink Ever since I was a child, I always felt attracted to history and specially to World War II, which is why I was on he first line to see this movie once it opened on my local cinema. After seen the movie, I have to tell that somehow Dunkirk felt different from all the other movies I have seen related to WWII. It might be the non linear narrative, or the fact that the movie depicts the struggle of more than 300k young soldiers trying to save their lives and by doing so becoming seating ducks to the German army. Even if this event can not be consider a battle victory, because they were fleeing away from he front. It is one of the most inspiring moments of WWII for the English people, were they realized that the impossible can be done and from that moment on, things started to change at least on the psyche of the common people and specially the soldiers. War movies based on real events, are always brutal and they usually leave you with harsh feelings and empathy thoughts about how it really was to be in the character shoes. A must see movie, Mr. Nolan did it again.
9.0~outstanding presentation of this historic event paulkalman-18-324697 Sign in Permalink There are, I think by design, no standout stars in this movie. The star is the event. The only detraction and it is a minor one for me. Is that it took me a little while at my age to catch on that there were multiple parallel time lines. Once I realized that, it was much nicer for me to follow. I usually don't like IMAX all that much, the sound is usually over powering and I usually wind up too close to the screen. However, this time the theater resisted cranking up the sound and the photography was stupendous in IMAX. This easily matched the intensity of Saving Private Ryan but it lasted much longer. Go see it!
7.0~Amazing visuals, lacks character development RussHog Sign in Permalink This movie tells the true story about the battle of Dunkirk - a small town in France taken over by the Nazis and the British soldiers had to be evacuated. The only problem is - the navy is too far away to help and the Nazis are moving in for the kill. So a civilian fleet of ships launches to rescue them. The movie takes place from the POV of three main characters - a pilot, a civilian boat captain, and a solider. There are other supporting characters such as a commanding officer and a shell shocked rescue. The German soldiers are basically never seen - but when they attack the scenes are really harrowing. Nolan does an amazing job with the battle scenes and the epic score that holds the suspense together. But the story never really explores any of the character's enough to have a huge emotional reaction to their success or failures to succeed. I do not know of Nolan did this on purpose - or if there is a lot of backstory left out that will be in a Director's Cut. While I did enjoy the filmmaking I did not exactly bond with the character's and it held the project back for me.
1.0~Looking forward to the remake; by another writer/director boblin2-1 Sign in Permalink The movie was a huge disappointment. Here's some of the things that have been said about this movie - none of them are true: "A technical masterpiece" "An absolutely outstanding depiction" "A must See" "Best movie Of summer 2017" "Best war film ever made" "A must see film" "Dunkirk is an authentic..." "Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made" If I had the time, for my own personal viewing I would re-work this movie by first re-ordering the overlapping and out of sequence scenes, and then kill the entire droning musical score (obviously it would have to be on a track that I can turn off). Just these simple changes would make it a far better watch. To fine tune the movie further, I would shorten the many long pointless pauses, when people in real life would either do or say something. The evacuation from Dunkirk was of course a real event, a significant element of which was the hundreds of small vessels and regular folk who took to the sea to being their boys back home – all of that hardly came through, nor did the true seriousness of the situation on the beaches and in the town, and the fighting that was going on in an attempt to slow the approaching army down. All in all, I think this movie is a p-poor-job. I wish I'd waited until it was on Netflix - I could have at least been editing some of my photos at the same time. Do I think you should watch this at the movie theatre: No!
6.0~A Triptych of Colors & Zimmer's Score Not Enough To Compensate for Nolan's Artsy Excess WhimsicalVonia Sign in Permalink This is one of those films where a lot of nothing happens. Not exactly nothing, but there is a focus on the mundane, if that can be said in regards to anything during wartime. This is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I can name several films, especially international ones, in which this is the exact reason I love it. It did not really work in this film, though. The Good: * The best thing about this film is Hans Zimmer. Aside from the music, constant clock ticking creates the almost claustrophobic and every present fear in the film (Zimmer actually used a pocket watch belonging to Nolan). With very little dialogue, Zimmer's score is its own character. * Along with the score, the cinematography was gorgeous. Wide angle shots of the beach, dark colors, the mise en scène. The film was actually divided into three segmented colors; sky blue, dark blue, and orange, referring to the triptych plot of air, sea, and land, respectively. (Note: Continuing his advocacy for film over digital formats, Christopher Nolan chose to shoot the movie in a combination of 15/70mm IMAX film and Super Panavision 65mm film in order to achieve the maximum possible image quality. After The Master (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015), Dunkirk (2017) was the third wide release motion picture of the current decade to be primarily shot and shown theatrically in 70mm. I was fortunate enough to see this version.) These two things set the tone and mode for the entire film. They made the film. The Bad: * I hate to admit that I was greatly disappointed. Nothing happened. It was depressing and depressing and sometimes that is a good thing. This is war, after all. There are other ways films that do this, but Nolan screws this up by trying to interweave all the stories. * Nolan always has admirable concepts, in theory. Lamentably, he then makes the mistake of being excessive with the special effects + unnecessary fancy tricks. His splicing of three different timelines and stories not only made watching it a little confusing, but killed the connections I could have felt with any characters. The film is told from three points of view: on the beach with the infantry, the evacuation by the navy (showing how civilians came to the rescue), and in the air. Speaking about the narrative structure in Premiere magazine, Christopher Nolan stated: "For the soldiers who embarked in the conflict, the events took place on different temporalities. On land, some stayed one week stuck on the beach. On the water, the events lasted a maximum day; and if you were flying to Dunkirk, the British spitfires would carry an hour of fuel. To mingle these different versions of history, one had to mix the temporal strata. Hence the complicated structure; even if the story is very simple. Do not repeat it to the studio: it will be my most experimental film." Although I have always and still do love Nolan's work, I refuse to play the cognitive dissonance game to convince myself that I loved this film for its artistic examinations of the desolation of war. 6/10
8.0~A Masterful Technical Achievement. Can't say the same Storytelling-wise. littleging12 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's newest film "Dunkirk" tells the true story of the evacuation at the titular location where allied forces were miraculously shipped across the British channel by civilian boats. Christopher Nolan does what he does best and puts the viewer right in the dead center of this significant battle of WWII. The result is an immersive, realistic, and intense experience that better give Christopher Nolan his first Oscar nomination for Best Director. However, the film did not meet the hype (at least my own personal hype being my most anticipated film of the year) with its unnecessary non-linear storytelling, emotional detachment, and pretentious cumpulsion for uniqueness. "Dunkirk" started out with a very jumpy bang. Christopher Nolan throws the audience right into the action and never lets up with the thought of an imminent attack lurking at any moment. The opening scenes are cinema at its most grandeur. The usage of practical effects for the ships, planes, buildings, soldiers, and locations are outstanding and say a lot about Christopher Nolan's dedication for telling realistic stories. The strafing runs and dog fighting scenes are directed to perfection and for a split second make you forget you are watching a movie. "Dunkirk" is undeniably gorgeous that'll definitively win Oscars for its craft. "Dunkirk" may be a winner on a technical scale but a movie needs a little more to be a truly remarkable film. A common complaint about the film is a lack of character development. Going in, I knew this would be a more visceral film with little dialogue where the emotional core banks on common human empathy. Christopher Nolan wanted to focus on the event of Dunkirk, not the characters, but it is hard to feel for these people especially when you don't even know their names. Frequent Nolan collaborator, Hans Zimmer, provided the score, and he delivers with pieces ranging from gut-wrenchingly intense (Supermarine) to searingly hopeful (Variation 15). A misstep the film took was overplaying Zimmer's score which ended up toning down the actual sounds of bombardment. I even had trouble hearing some of the dialogue (upon first viewing) resulting in a lot of confusion on what was happening when there were dialogue driven scenes. I couldn't even judge the acting because half the things people said didn't register, but at least everyone looked the part. Christopher Nolan structured the film with three different perspectives -- land, air, and sea -- all interweaving at a critical point. Some perspectives last longer than others (an hour, a day, a week) and Nolan jumps around between perspectives without any indication where the viewer is at in time. Some may think this is a clever and unique way to tell the story but it just killed some of the tension when you see the same scene for a third time, or when something is about to climax and it just cuts away. Nolan overcomplicates a quite simple story. He tries too hard to be unique when certain conventionalities would have been more effective like making his film R-rated for maximum realism and intensity. Given the potential, mastery, and high expectations, "Dunkirk" is a bit disappointing. It's a sensation for the eyes and ears but it leaves your brain in a knot further causing a blockade to the heart. It's a film that in order to fully appreciate, must be viewed on the big screen. For all of "Dunkirk's" flaws, it's still one of the best theatrical movies ever made, and can't be missed in theaters. 7.5/10
6.0~one of the most perplexing films I've ever seen shauni15 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk was heralded everywhere as his greatest achievement yet, so you can imagine as a big fan of his i was excited to see it. Well, that excitement turned to disappointment very fast The first 30 minutes are very impressive, the camera-work, the direction, the pacing are fantastic, the film has the best ship sinking scene filmed since titanic, the air battles are also exceptionally well filmed, and are way more subtle and realistic than most films. The problems however stem from two different, but very important things. first of all, the film has no characters, none of them are developed at all, we don't have a protagonist to root for really, all the actors are just used as props for the big battle scenes without any personality or investment. i feel like Nolan was so happy with how well he story-boarded his big scenes that he only realized he forgot to write actual characters in the movie when the cameras were already rolling, which is really confusing to me, because Nolan used to be one of those directors who prioritized characters over the plot in most of his movies, sometimes even to their detriment (like the dark knight rises). but this was just a big spectacle with zero personal investment, granted the sequences themselves were exceptionally well executed and filmed so kudos to Nolan for that, he really took it to the next level, but if we're not invested then no matter how well it's done we wont care, so the movie unfortunately became boring very quickly, which wasn't helped by the other big problem. The movie becomes very repetitive. We see an amazing ship sinking sequence, with mouths wide open, but then the next big sequence is another ship sinking, and then another, and then another, the same with the plane fight sequences, they just did the same thing over and over, and since we weren't invested to begin with, it became even more boring. So the movie was ultimately an exercise in futility, Christopher Nolan wasted one of his best directorial achievements on a movie with his worst writing one. Resulting in an impersonal, albeit impressive film, that lacks heart and character.
10.0~Beautiful, Intense, and HOPE josedumpy Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan brought out a movie about a British story that children grew up with. A story that not just one person could solve an issue. That people together have to gather up and solve the issue as a group. Dunkirk is not an ordinary movie. It is a war experience. It is the most realistic war film ever. Dialogue is sprinkled in the film. In all seriousness it is not needed. Soldiers are on that beach are emotionally unstable. How could people talk when the don't even know what they are feeling. If these soldiers see a plane in the sky. It was a 50/50 chance if it was going to bomb them or save them. The movie is intense. With Han's Zimmer's beautiful original score, dialogue between the faces of people, the spitfires, and so much more this movie has you on the edge of your seat. Because Christopher Nolan uses another realistic element in war. No one ever knows what is going to happen. You are looking at the screen never knowing what is actually going to happen. The soldiers from the mole are in a roller coaster of luck. They go through several moments where they are the luckiest people alive to moments where they probably walked under several ladders or broken a million mirrors. Their luck was horrifyingly bad. But in reality nothing is fair. These soldiers used what they had and tried to get back home. This film shows that humans will grasp at anything for a few more seconds to survive. This movie is based on hope. It's a movie that shows that humans can not move forward with out it. It shows that even if humans have a 1% chance of surviving they will take that 1% because it's better then .5%. Courage from all of those people like Mr. Dawns who went through the English channel just to save people who they don't even know is a characteristic of humans. This movie really shows that even though there is so much controversy that humans are the worst. That we destroy our own home. We have a natural gift of being evil. That we betray our own kind. That at the end we still have good in our hearts. That deep down we would help those who are in trouble. That all of us are moles. That dirt are our problems and difficulties. Humans are moles who dig through the dirt blind and reach the surface. The surface is our HOME.
1.0~PG-13 war miesnekawalki Sign in Permalink First 10 minutes and I've already checked out from this movie. How do you make a WAR movie in which a lot of people die and yet there's not a single drop of blood and everything's clean and sanitized to fit the requirements of being delivered to the largest imaginable amount of viewers instead of making this movie historically correct, logical and good in the first place? Answer - you don't.
1.0~Huh? gpica Sign in Permalink I read so many good things about this movie. I don't think they watched the version I did. Disjointed, impossible to follow with all the back and forth timelines and generally boring.
7.0~Elegantly shot, yet lacking character development. aceofspades96 Sign in Permalink A rather unfair notion moviegoers have about Christopher Nolan is that every movie he creates must be instant classics. This notion is unfair mainly because no writer on the face of the earth constantly pumps out classic after classic. While I will agree that Nolan has a beautiful resume under his belt(as well as being my favorite filmmaker), he is only human, and is not perfect. After seeing screen writing paradigms like Memento, Inception, and Interstellar, I fell in love with the characters that Nolan has created. I went into Dunkirk expecting to fall in love with a new set of characters all over again. Dunkirk just didn't deliver any form of character development at all. Unfortunately for Nolan fans, there is no main character for this film. Some actors get more screen time than others, however, the jury is still out on exactly who the story's perspective is told. However, the perspective changes 3 times, and in very rapid succession. We see either a young infantrymen, a trained pilot, or a group of civilians attempting to evacuate Dunkirk. These all sound like excellent ideas for characters, however, we know nothing about these people. Nolan did a fantastic job of making every moment of the movie have some sort of suspense. You were always on the edge of your seat hoping the worst wouldn't happen. However, I feel like the movie did a GROSS disservice to itself by lacking character development. A movie that is written to be this suspenseful should go hand in hand with amazing characters we hope don't die. Except, what we get is a very watered down attempt at suspense, and it really leaves a lot to be desired from the screen writing. For instance, Tom Hardy played a pilot in the Royal Air Force. Seeing him shoot down enemy planes with ease was very satisfying, however, at the end, when we see him captured by German soldiers, we have absolutely no clue why he purposely did that to himself. In fact, we know nothing about the man. All we know is that he is a damn pilot. What's even worse is that Tom Harry's character is a huge plot driver. To make such big plot decisions based off of characters who we know nothing about is very frustrating and overall a very cheap way to write a film. While the film's plot leaves much to be desired, Nolan absolutely nailed the cinematography and effects. Christopher Nolan is the absolute master of practical effects, and you can really see the difference on the screen. I found myself drooling at some of the shots in this film. Some of the shots in this film last for 15-25 seconds all by themselves. It is no joke when I say that one of the best shots in cinema history is when Tom Hardy is flying, and the camera follows the plane. You can see the entire city of Dunkirk France in the background. This was an absolutely gorgeous shot, as well as many others. The action sequences in the film absolutely blew me away too. Right from the very beginning, the film's action sequences sounded, felt, and looked so close to real, I almost thought I was there myself. Being a long time fan of Christopher Nolan, I have to say that I am disappointed in this film. Again, I would never have thought that a polished writer like Nolan would ever have a problem with character development. However, this is not the worst Christopher Nolan film to date, and is definitely better than Insomnia(not that that's saying anything).
7.0~Missed Opportunity joemooreem Sign in Permalink During the opening scene I thought "this is gonna be great" but the start was quite slow which did lead up to a satisfying ending. There was definitely a lot more that could have been added.
4.0~Enormous Disappointment ReinaMissy Sign in Permalink I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan since I saw "Memento", and Cillian Murphy is good in everything he does, so I was really looking forward to this film. What an enormous disappointment. I have to wonder why film critics are doing an ecstatic dance over it; being Christopher Nolan does not give you an automatic pass to having your film considered great. This is the worst movie I've seen in quite a while, regardless of director. What the film presents is about a half dozen sub stories but with no simultaneous time frame; it hops from one scene to the next with no continuity. Nowhere are we able to make an emotional connection with the characters, which is really the key to a fine film. It was simply a collage of well acted scenes about war thrown together into one huge mess. Maybe Nolan felt he was unable to due justice to those who so courageously stood at Dunkirk without bringing in sub stories. He should have found a better film editor to attempt to tie it all together.
9.0~Dunkirk, Dun Realism Right rgkarim Sign in Permalink War, huh, yeah, what is it good for? Entertaining movies, that is what it is good for. Hollywood has numerous examples of wars from the various historical times in our human legacy. Many of these installments focus on a hero who saved the war, or a band of brothers that bravely faced the odds to hold the line. In most cases though, you can bet there will be violence, explosions, and often graphic portrayals of the hell contained in our squabbles. I finish my weekend reviews with Dunkirk, which is the latest installment in the Christopher Nolan library. Can the Dark Knight director work his magic in war? Or does it fizzle out like a dud bomb. Robbie K here to give his opinions. Let's get started. LIKES: Layered Story: Many war movies are the linear tales of the hero who will win the battle. Dunkirk diverts from this main path and instead presents its plot from three viewpoints that overlap at various times. A cryptic opening doesn't do much to explain this, but eventually the plots coincide and your mind is blown by the presentation. This element, though confusing at times, adds that unique flare to the movie that keeps your interest piqued as you connect the journeys of those involved. In addition, the multiple viewpoints give you a more complete picture of the war, further bringing the history to life in a manner Hollywood special effects is famous for. Realism: We know the doctoring editing and story writers can make to score big bucks in the box office. These moments often lead to overdramatic, eye-rolling moments that war dramas can be. Dunkirk again shines in the unique department in terms of crafting the story to be realistic in many details. You'll be pulled into the war in this film, grounded in the nightmares that plague the battlefields and the internal struggle that all involved face. I felt plagued with the emotional guilt in the choices made in this film, while also concerned with the consequences that could follow those choices. The film's focus on the people and not the battle works on so many levels, and makes you interested in the characters more so than the special effects. Nice choice again Noland! The Cinematography: Dunkirk doesn't have a lot of lines, award winning dialogue, or even one- liners that we as humans like. Instead it is the cinematography and editing that bring Dunkirk to life and make it shine in the theater's dark halls. While the special effects are certainly impressive (though not that showy), it's really the camera work that brings the mood out in the form of hope seeking faces that are suffering through the onslaught dealt to them. Throw in the powerful musical score and mix in the little line delivery and you get that recipe for emotional bombardment that brings respect, empathy, and pride of the sacrifices made by troops long ago. Short run time: Such a dynamic, sounds like it would take foreverfortunately Nolan's direction kept the movie under 2 hours and brought quality out in that short time. This is an example of good directing and editing, and proof that you can have a quality film in a short time limit. DISLIKES: Missing that Hollywood Story: Realism is good, but I certainly missed having a flared-up story to grip onto. Dunkirk is a quality movie, but it isn't as much fun as I have had with other war movies. It lacks some of the big, bang excitement made famous in other war movies, and the realistic psychological approach can drag at times. The result is not the action-packed survival I had hoped for, but I can always rewatch Hacksaw Ridge for that. And while I enjoyed the layered story approach, I again think it was confusing at times to piece things together without a central story, plot, or goal (outside of survival/rescue) to hook onto. The placement of certain scenes: My buddy and I agreed that there were points to this movie that were difficult to follow. Much of this came from the odd placement of clips in the movie and the rapid transitions between these various stories with little guidance. Things do get better when the lines start to come together, but there are still scenes that still stay confusing at points until the end of the movie. In addition, the pacing of the stories was uneven at times, with a couple of stories rapidly concluding (so you think), only to reappear after a prolonged gap. Not the biggest weakness, but things could have been a little better oriented for me. Depressing: We know war sucks, and this movie's portrayal of the loss of hope amplifies those feelings. There are so many elements of depression in this movie that you may feel a little down following the opening. I felt a little tired during this movie, especially during the drawn-out moments that were more depressing and less stressing. The VERDICT: Dunkirk is certainly one of the more artistic and clever portrayals of war, dropping Hollywood flare for realism. Nolan's impressive directing opens up new worlds of war theater and keeps things fresh with the impressive displays of heroism. Yet all the good the cinematography and directing is I missed the Hollywood flare that cinemas bring. Without that story/entertainment value to it Dunkirk has some confusing presentations and dragged out moments that can weigh heavy on you. Still, this movie has plenty to qualify a visit to the theater, and one of the better movies of the summer. Not the epic wartime thriller, but certainly one of the more realistic, war dramas I have ever seen. My scores: Action/Drama/History: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0
7.0~A little too overrated considering TheTopDawgCritic Sign in Permalink I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and Interstellar is one of my all- time favorite films. Although he chose a different and refreshing direction for this film, it wasn't my cup of tea. The cinematography and directing and score were all perfect 10's, but the screenplay and writing lacked what I was craving... something/someone to route for - not the entire film. Yes, I wanted a hero and a villain to hate an cheer for, not a documentary. Nevertheless, very enjoyable. Would I see it again? Probably not, and if so, only for the stunning visuals. It's a 7/10 from me
5.0~Powerful story poorly told. Know your history. ambrosia_1 Sign in Permalink There are NO spoilers in this review, but some helpful information to understand it if you see it. This movie is based on the true story about the rescue of over 300,000 (out of 400K) British solders during WWII. I went into this movie believing the soldiers were POW's in a camp and most of the story would be about *them*. THEY ARE NOT. The troops are "stranded" on the beaches of France, cut off from England a mere 22 miles across the English Channel. Cut off by land by Nazi troops (whom we never see) and by sea in the heavily patrolled waters by German planes & "U-boats" ("Underwater boats", aka: submarines.) The movie is told in three parts (actually 4): Land, Sea (2 sea stories) & Air... but the movie expects you to figure that out for yourself, making things quite confusing. Part one is "The Mole" and takes place over the course of a week, but here, a "mole" isn't a "spy", it's a French word for extended shoreline/pier. It would have helped immensely if the screen told you this was "*STORY* 1: The Beach" instead of "1. The Mole". I spent the first hour trying to figure out who the Spy was (and the paranoia of some of the soldiers didn't help.) The movie is well acted (and LOUD), a lesson in one of Britain's proudest moments, but the telling of that story is too disjointed... a prime example of why writers should not direct their own movies (and vice versa.) Christopher Nolan (Director of the Batman films) both wrote & directed Dunkirk. He's a great director, but should have outsourced the writing to someone with more experience. I rated this a 5. Deserves at least a 7.5 for the story & production quality, but is just so damn disjointed, everyone who sees it says they would need to see it again "now that they understand what was going on." But no one wants to see a movie twice just because they feel they HAVE to to enjoy it *once*. :(
1.0~The most boring movie i have ever seen in my whole entire life ! zzz123467 Sign in Permalink seriously, if you are not a fanboy you would see the bad acting, bad soundtrack and the horrible interception of WW2. what did i hate you ask ? well, here is the list: 1) its war... where is the voice acting ? why is everyone mute ? 2) the scenes are horrible... wow a ship sank ? well here is another scene, same scene, but now so similar with a boat sinking... had enough ? here's another one... and another one. 3) look up in the sky scene, its a plane !! didn't have enough ? here is the same scene 5 times, like the boat scene repetition. 4) the depressing soundtrack, you know, when there is a depressing scene or a scene with much suspense you normally put a depressing score, which is perfect, but how is poring a cup of F**king tea depressing ? the editor literally put the sound track on all the cut scenes, ALL OF THE MOVIE IM WILLING TO BET ON IT!. the list goes on, read this list and watch the movie, thank me later! p.s the movie has no action, only silent drama.
1.0~how can this movie get a high review? agusleoptpp Sign in Permalink The boring plot of the story .. from so many good WWII movies. This film does not even close to the criteria of good film. Out of acceptance.
9.0~Beautiful depiction of Threat, Time and Hope. phil20972007 Sign in Permalink An exceptional Nolan's venture into the war drama genre that had me captivated from the start. It's pure Cinematic thrill cleansed the ongoing plethora of superhero films being churned out by the likes of DC/Marvel to offer a serenity that was missing. It's not a history lesson. Purist will look at the Spitfire's fuel range and complain or the presence of a French Destroyer rather than an English one, or of how the yellow nose of the German planes did not come in till later in the actual war. But trust me, it gets drowned out in the outstanding visuals Nolan offers without sacrificing the pace of the film or the narrative. It's captivating to see how, without showing any actual enemy soldiers, Nolan could make us feel the threat by just using brilliantly shot scenes and a heart pounding sounds by Zimmer. Man! The pure adrenaline rush at each moment the soldiers faced was equally perceive by us, taking us along in every bullet sizzling by and the suspense of not knowing when another German bomber will fly by. You can actually hear the roar of the Spitfire's Rolls Royce long before it approaches, or the imminent threat of the German war-birds swooping down for a fish in a barrel run. Even if you closed your eyes, you'd actually feel the fear grip you simply by the sounds on these scenes. Nolan perfectly uses the concept of illusion to great effect. While at first i thought the enemy was the German army invading and cutting off all exits and closing in for the kill, upon further pondering, the real enemy i think was "Time" itself. And i think he used the Beach, the Sea and the Air scene transition just to reaffirm that. While the Beach scene probably lasted about 1week, the Sea was about a Day and the Air fight about an hour. At first, the transition was confusing, but towards the end of the movie, you realized it was all leading up to the climatic closing and it had the impact, at least to me, of what the film was about. How different people perceive time. Without showing us the enemy except for a few dogfight scenes and never from the perspective of the enemy planes, you are immediately made to think about the "enemy", and the film goes on to gnaw at your thoughts to affirm who's the enemy? Time? or the invading Germans? We've had brilliant films based on war from "The Thin Red Line" to "Saving Private Ryan" that I've watched and loved. Dunkirk, while not focused on a group of soldier to tell the story, relies on the overview of the war and tells a broader story while feeling every sting of the bullet and then feeling hopeful when Farrier, played by Tom Hardy, shoots down the German fighter on a beeline for the French & English soldiers awaiting transportation to go home, even when he was out of fuel. The film left me with a broader sense of how an event plays out and how different people react and perceive the actual threat of Humanity, Time. To me, This one is for the Oscars. Thank you Nolan & Zimmer and to all cast & crew of Dunkirk for giving us one of the best movies of 2017.
10.0~Absolutely stunning. A masterpiece in every sense. tmazus Sign in Permalink Wow. Wow. Wow. Where to begin? First of all, this is a masterpiece. The acting and the storytelling WITHOUT the need for dialogue to drive the film makes this film my favorite war film. It's an accurate portrayal of the evacuation of Dunkirk and anyone who appreciates a good war film will absolutely love this masterpiece by Nolan. From start to finish I could not take my eyes off the film. I'm still buzzing about this film in my head over an hour after the film. I was fortunate enough to watch this in a motion activated seat. The film matched with motion activated seats is absolutely superb. It's almost like these seats were made for this film. The amount of action goes well with these seats and if the opportunity arrives to see this film in these types of seats, do it! I will be seeing this film again, for the second time, in motion activated seats. That's how much I loved this film. A breathtaking war film and a masterpiece of cinematography. Please watch this film, you will not regret! The hype is real folks.
1.0~Very disappointing and too overrated Luigi Di Pilla Sign in Permalink I watched this movie on a flight to New York by seat screen. I was so disappointed by the very poor action. Even the story gave nothing substantial to me so that finally I felt asleep. I am happy I didn't spent a cent nor wasted time. i cannot still believe how director Christopher Nolan and his crew could create this catastrophical work. See instead Saving Private Ryan or The Band Brothers mini series. It deserves no doubt 1/10.
10.0~I came out of this film with no nails left to bite esthercross Sign in Permalink I would prescribe that anyone going to see Dunkirk bring with them 1) a defibrillator 2) strong anti perspirant 3) a stiff drink for afterwards. (Oh and some tissues for the end when Elgar accosts your already tattered emotions!) Going into this film I was emotionally under-prepared for such a fiercely evocative experience! The film is an immediate sensory explosion and has your heart beating at an alarming rate pretty much within the first 5 minutes. When I came out of the cinema I had bite marks in my knuckle and here's the magic formula for how you put exhilarating and slightly cruel levels of tension on your audience. First off the music has a constant ticking beat which seems to slowly become more frantic as the film progresses. Han Zimmer manages also to interweave an almost mechanical quality into the score which ramps up the tension especially when there is large scale damage. The quality of the ambient sound and shots made me feel scarily involved in the unrelenting Dunkirk conditions. The shots were so wide and dynamic it felt at times like virtual reality. There are three different stories that cleverly interweave as the film progresses; Land, Sea and Air. Land is explored over the course of a week, the sea explored over a day and Air over the course of an hour. As the stories weave together you are often pulled between three different perilous scenarios. I love how Nolan play's with around with time lines in his films and I thought it was a very original concept to have three different time frames in one film. Dunkirk did an impressive job of capturing the immensity of the damage as we experience ships being torpedoed and sinking from various terrifying angles and perspectives. In amongst these large scale sequences though the film also hones in well on the micro moments. There where some beautiful facial reactions that expressed real depth of emotion without the need of dialogue. I think the film had an interesting presentation because as Christopher Nolan said in an interview he wanted the whole story to be very present tense and there was no focus on backstory. Some people disliked this approach to character presentation but I thought it worked well for the film that everything was happening in the moment. There are some very breathtaking sky shots in this film and when the planes where diving I can say I felt on the cusp of queasy. Definitely catch this film on a huge screen with an all guns blazing sound system as you will feel the bombs and music in your seat! A fantastic film and a very emotional ending (bring tissues or at the very least a porous sleeve)
3.0~Nice filming, but terrible storytelling wasecan Sign in Permalink I thought the look & feel of this movie were great, but it just stumble about, script-wise. From the get-go, it felt like I started watching halfway through. None of the characters were fleshed out at all, and I just flat-out didn't give a rodent's rump about any of them. The cinematography was outstanding, but you need more than that for a movie to be good.
10.0~Dunkirk - a lesson in empathy lorenzruwwe Sign in Permalink Just a few thoughts after seeing the movie (spoiler free): This movie is an important one. It achieves something that not a lot of war movies can. Which is staying objective and not using (or exploiting) the perils and real suffering of men fighting in war for the mere sake of dramatization. Dunkirk is based on historical events. It should not be expected to please or entertain. Think about it: Why would you look at something like war and use it for entertainment? That is just wrong. I read a lot of reviews by people who criticized the film due to its lack of 'characters'. Well, this movie has actual humans. Are they telling me they can only feel something when they can identify with a character? If they know their backstory and if they are portrayed in a sympathetic way? "There was no emotion in the film?" "It wasn't romanticized?" Well, then maybe that is a problem with the viewer and not the film (there is always Pearl Harbor.. :v). And for the record, my initial reaction was also one of being a bit underwhelmed, maybe mostly because I expected something different, a narrative type of movie. I was waiting for some gripping storyline, action sequences and fleshed out characters etc, too. (And I will always love Saving Private Ryan) After the film ended my wife quickly said that it is her favourite Nolan film which then made me think twice about it. This film requires the viewer to have true empathy. To feel for another human being that you don't know and might not have anything in common with. It teaches us what actual unbiased empathy is. If you tell a war movie in a subjective way and create favorable and unfavorable characters you're mostly creating division. Why is one soldier's death more tragic than another? I appreciated that the Germans were 'faceless'. They were the enemy in this case, yes. But they weren't painted in an exaggerated, Hollywood-style demeaning way so as to create animosity towards them. The viewer isn't made to feel hatred. The Germans were simply the historical opposing faction. This objectivity is nicely reflected in the outstanding cinematography which used many wide shots and aerial establishing shots to show the global action. It focused more on the group, and not so much the individual. It also beautifully showed their movement in a given space. This objectivity demonstrates why Dunkirk wasn't really about individual people or characters, but the bigger group, the bigger picture, as seen in a historical context. (Oh, and dat 70mm film, mmmhh) If you look at the events of Dunkirk and what meaning they had for the outcome of WWII and maybe even history, it becomes more clear to choose an objective lens to portray these events in an unbiased way and from an elevated viewpoint. You are literally seeing history unfold from afar. I had one gripe with the film, which was the constant soundtrack playing. There were no moments of silence but that's just a personal nitpick. This is the type of movie they will probably show in history class and should. -Some real cinematic piece of art.
9.0~A revolution of the war genre Alexander_Blanchett Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan never disappoints. He is such an visionary director who is now giving the war genre a revelation with this interconnecting war action drama. Visually the film is more than stunning and satisfies all the needs you have for such a movie. Tremendous in every way: Cinematography, editing and visual effects. The sound is pitch perfect and will sure score at the Oscars. The only little flaw I had with the film is that the screenplay wasn't exactly awesome, it was good, no question, but I missed some deeper looks at the characters and that's the only big thing that differs from "Saving Private Ryan". While we had a good look at the characters of Mark Rylance and Fionn Whitehead who both played their roles magnetically. I missed more background of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy. Don't get me wrong, those performances were as good as they could be with the material they could work with but especially with Hardy's character it surely had improved the film and make it a pure masterpiece. But it is still a fantastic film, a great entry and the filmography of Christopher Nolan and a defying film of its genre. And it is a film that reminds me once again why cinema still overcomes screening because that film delivers its great impact on the silver screen.
7.0~One of the most disastrous events in British wartime history depicted in a less than triumphant but hardly disastrous film TheLittleSongbird Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts. 'Dunkirk' had me interested in it from the get go. Not just because Nolan was the director, though he is to me one of the "appreciated" directors than a personal favourite, and, while all his films range from decent to outstanding, again from personal opinion only 'Memento' is a film without faults, so like him and his films but don't consider them the best thing since sliced bread. There was also the involvement of Hans Zimmer, who has penned some great scores (both in his collaborations with Nolan, being a regular, and elsewhere) and a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Plus 'Dunkirk' was based off one of the most disastrous events in British wartime history, actually cited by Winston Churchill as "a colossal military disaster". Seeing 'Dunkirk', after hearing a lot of acclaim but also a lot of divisive opinions on both sides, there was a lot to admire about 'Dunkirk' but, although it is a visual, technical, audio and directorial masterpiece, it is not the triumph of film-making it could have been. As far as Nolan's films go for me it's a lesser effort, meaning often impressive but flawed where ambition gets in the way of execution, feel exactly the same way about 'Interstellar' which has similar strengths and flaws to 'Dunkirk'. Personally do feel strongly that regardless of how disappointing it would have been to others it is a long way from a 1/10 film, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least from me. Let's start with the strengths first. First off, 'Dunkirk' looks amazing, so far being one of the best-looking films of the year. Very evocatively designed, atmospherically lit and the cinematography is dazzling with some grit but also some audaciousness. Nolan's direction is often superb, especially in the very visceral spectacle, and on an audio level it is just as big a triumph. The sound is constant but didn't bother me, coming from somebody who can have hyper-sensitive hearing but is used to loud noises and high volume (necessary for the experience) when going to the cinema. If anything it added to the authenticity. Hans Zimmer's score has garnered a lot of praise, acclaimed from most in part, but has had some dissenting opinions. Count me in as someone who loved it, there is an ominous quality but also a pathos and rousing bombast that enhances the pulsating heart-beat. The action is often enthralling, and there is some nerve-shredding tension and some heart-wrenching emotional pathos (like in Cillian Murphy's performance). Loved the performances as well, the best coming from a quietly dignified and understated Mark Rylance who can say little and still speak volumes with just a small gesture, his eyes and his facial expressions. Kenneth Branagh's role is not a large one but he does make much of it. Nolan regulars Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy command the screen effortlessly, Murphy's shell-shocked soldier in particular is genuinely moving. Was absolutely shocked in a good way at how good Fionn Whitehead's and Harry Styles (on paper an insane casting choice) feature film debuts were. On the other hand, what makes 'Dunkirk' less than triumphant is that the characterisation, writing and story are on the messy side. Didn't mind the minimal dialogue and understood completely why it was done, did mind that the characters were underdeveloped and severely lacking in depth, one never gets to know them which is a shame because the acting is so good. 'Dunkirk' has been criticised for being emotionally cold and not getting enough into the horrors of war. Do agree with those criticisms actually. There are times actually where both actually come through, there is tension and suspense, there are some harrowing moments and some poignant ones, but we don't want moments, we want consistency. 'Dunkirk' is not horrifying or gut-wrenching enough (for war films it is fairly tame) and does lack consistent emotional investment. Nolan could have done more with the historical side of things, it is a good thing that a good deal of people here have knowledge of the event but it can't be assumed that everybody knows about it or all the facts, nobody expects a history lesson but there was a missed opportunity in this regard. While being a technical and visual masterpiece, some of the editing is chaotic in places, as an epileptic it was just about bearable but still felt too much even for what it was trying to do. Lastly, while having a non-linear structure is not a bad thing (Nolan did it with 'Memento' and masterfully) how the three stories were told did get confused at times and it was hard keeping up with the constant back and forth. So overall, less than triumphant but hardly disastrous. Often impressive but problematic. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox
2.0~Good story, bad script, worth seeing if you have nothing else to do yellowpenguin Sign in Permalink This movie could have been a masterpiece considering the story and the resources. Unfortunately, the script was poorly written. It seems as if they were in a hurry to complete the film and couldn't take the time to edit the script and focus on details. The lack of detail in the several scenes container cranes appear in the background, but containers and container cranes were invented 30 years later. Left theater with many questions.
4.0~Waste of money, doesn't tell the story reikiquilter Sign in Permalink Spoiler Alert IMHO do not waste your money on the movie Dunkirk. Although it does have magnificent special effects the story line is completely absent. If you did not know anything about the evacuation, you would be seriously misinformed by the movie. Nevermind that the "star" is a coward. And it is completely unnecessary to kill off George. It adds nothing to the story. Sigh This is Hollywood being so artsy fartsy they fail at storytelling. Oh but they did manage to glorify cowards very well.
5.0~disappointment neutrophil-241-261528 Sign in Permalink Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly my favorite director since memento. There was so much hype in this movie that i had a pretty high expectation (also just because of his name), I regret to say I didn't enjoy the movie as much as his previous movies. I actually can't feel much emotion in this movie like I did in his other work (I was teary in both inception and interstellar) Maybe because I'm not too familiar with the story (but I did research the whole Dunkirk evacuation before I went to see the movie)I can only say i'm very disappointed and first time in any of his movie i kept wondering when it would finish. If he has to make a war movie in order to get his elusive Oscar, so be it and I hope he wins it because he totally deserves one. But my vote would still go to inception.
9.0~An attack on your senses FabledGentleman Sign in Permalink Back in high school i wrote an essay on what happened at Dunkirk. And i was especially intrigued by Hitlers major blunder to not attack the beach with his tanks. If he had done so, the outcome of world war 2 could have been very different. It was one of the biggest mistakes Hitler ever made, and we should probably be quite happy about that. When i heard Nolan was going to make a movie about this, i was afraid he would paint the wrong picture and not tell the entire story. Nolan is good at bringing in nuances in his films, but i was still afraid he might forget about the French and the Belgians. And focus entirely on the British. Turns out, this movie is not at all what i expected. This is not the kind of movie you go see to get a history lesson. Nolan does not go into specifics on what led up to this point in history, and the movie has no character buildup. The movie starts where many other films ends their second act, right in the middle of the action. What this movie does is to focus on the share terror of war, and we see it from the viewpoint of the trapped soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk. Awaiting their fate, totally surrounded, hundreds of thousands of them. The movie tells three main stories. One on land, one at sea, and one in the air. And it jumps forward and back in time, so you feel you lose total control. And that is exactly what this movie needs, this is all about not being in control. German planes do regular sweeps, dropping bombs on the beaches. Planes and u-boats bombing and torpedoing the English warships. And the allied soldiers just standing there, with nowhere to run, they are basically just target practice for the planes. Who will survive? What would you do to try and survive? How would the consequences of your actions afflict you and your fellow soldiers? All these questions are at the very core of the film, it is all about survival in the darkest of times, and the movie is carried by Hans Zimmer's hypnotizing score which feels like a psychotic hymn that drills into your subconscious and attack your senses with brute force. It is accompanied with ear deafening sound effects that pound your ears until you feel very unsettled. The imagery presented here are outstanding, with lots of wide open shots in insane resolution. Never have i felt a movie so claustrophobic, using so many wide and open shots. This movie is indeed best viewed on a huge cinema screen. War is hell, war is chaos, and rarely has it been displayed better than in this film. Nolan has again showed that he can master almost any type of storytelling, and this time he even wrote the script himself. There are times in the film it feels like it might get a bit too sentimental, or that the film overly focuses on a few things that i feel i didn't need to be told again and again. But not before i start to get those feelings, it drags me back in with yet another pounding action scene. This is like nothing i have ever seen before. It is a war movie told in an unusual way. The movie doesn't have much dialogue, most of this movie is expressed through the eyes of the characters. And the terror in those eyes when the German bombers comes diving down for another sweep, making the most terrifying screaming noise, speaks louder than words. There aren't really any main movie stars in this film, it's the event itself, and the terror of war that is the primary character. And with the great cinematography, the loud sound effects, the pulsing music score, and the intense battle sequences, you feel like you are right there, on that beach. And that is probably the last place you would ever want to be. It is an intense thriller packed with suspense from the very first frame to the last, it never let's go. This will be a strong contender for many movie awards this year, and it's one of Nolan's best movies so far. That is saying something indeed, the man has a habit of making quite good films. Highly recommended
9.0~Brilliant and unique shalaw-fatah Sign in Permalink I've always expected the best thrillers from Christopher Nolan, but this kind of movie, no. He proved to be a great director. 1. No central character, no firm story-line, yet the movie is attracting you well. 2.The background music is amazing, weird and haunting. 3. The imagery is just perfect. 4. Although it's a war movie, no heroism, CGI or gore is shown. 5. It's no thriller by any rate. 6. The brilliance of this movie is that it works against the current. The vast majority of movies attract audiences through appealing characters, interesting story lines, quotes or twists, but this movie works against all these and yet you can feel the most real and human experience. 7. How the plot is depicted, the closest in terms of storyline development is Boyhood [2014], in terms of imagery is Titanic, and in terms of music I'd say Under the Skin.
3.0~The best thing about Dunkirk is that it ends. varunpidugu-55807 Sign in Permalink When I first read about the Dunkirk Evacuation, I was in awe- and the possibilities of exploiting and furthering this particular emotion were boundless in Nolan's 'Dunkirk'. Unfortunately, this movie falls embarrassingly short of its promise. Let's start with the positives. -The acting: In my view, any great war film needs to not just have great characters, but also great ACTORS to portray those characters. In this aspect, Dunkirk shines. The acting is brilliant, as can be expected when your cast features the likes of Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Sir Mark Rylance and Harry Styles(?). There isn't a moment when any character exhibits an emotion out- of-the-ordinary, and there isn't a single actor in the film that falls short of acting talent or ability. -The music: Contrary to a lot of other people, I actually quite enjoyed the background score- the theme of foreshadowing, which is at the center of the movie's premise, is brilliantly explored in the score. Now, to the (rather long) list of negatives: -Redundancy and repetitiveness: As you've probably heard already, Dunkirk's story is told through three perspectives/timelines: The mole (aka land), The sea, and The air. Unfortunately, while this idea holds enormous promise, it only results in redundancy and confusion. There are times in the movie when it is unclear through whose perspective the story is being told, and there are times when scenes become repetitive. This is particularly apparent in the scenes shot in the air. Maybe this was intentional, and if it was, Nolan succeeded here. To me, it just seemed like poor editing and confused direction. This results in the movie seeming exceedingly long for its 1 hour 45 minutes run-time. -The inability to convey the scale of the evacuation: This, for me, was perhaps the most blatant flaw in this movie. You would think after a $150 million budget and the sheer scale of the actual evacuation itself that the movie would truly convey the likely thousands of ships/boats that were involved. This is just not the case. Throughout the film, we probably see maybe ~10 planes and about 20-30 boats/ships. This, in my view, does not do justice to the miracle of the evacuation, and greatly detracts from the promise this film initially had. -The emotionless characters: This, in my view, is the biggest problem with Dunkirk. The thing is, there just isn't enough dialogue, there isn't any background on ANY of the soldiers that makes you empathize with them. The consequence of this is that when a semi-major or major character dies, you don't feel anything. Really, all you think is: Well, I've already seen 100s of random soldiers die anyways, why is this different? Again, maybe this was intentional, maybe the point was to trivialize the deaths of even major characters to the point that they are no different from any of the other deaths. I personally didn't enjoy it very much. All in all, Dunkirk is a film with a lot of promise, and an incredible potential for awe-inspiring characters and story lines. However, its weak character development, and lack of ability to truly convey the enormity of the Dunkirk Evacuation ultimately lead to its downfall, and result in a film that inspires neither empathy nor awe. Very disappointing.
3.0~So Disappointing sinapisme Sign in Permalink The aerial sequences were very well filmed and realistic. I'm afraid that is all the positive comment I have to offer. The beaches laughable by their emptiness. Three hundred thousand saved? The impression was that if they had got three hundred off they would have been lucky. Christopher Nolan seemed fixated by a few spectacular disaster scenes and the rest filled in anyhow - never mind historical inaccuracies or anachronisms which were abundant. And then the plot, such as it was - parts of it corny and unbelievable melodrama. Tricks with the timing? Nothing special, the three scenarios could be view in isolation without worrying about the clock. The 1958 Leslie Norman movie with John Mills and Richard Attenborough - a tried and well-proved WW2 movie combination - gave a far more realistic and highly believable representation of what actually took place. But being much closer in time to the actual event, Norman needed to be much more careful with so many actual participants in the potential audience, and the advisors had all survived the horrors of that beach. If you have a military or historical interest in Dunkirk, this is the movie to watch. There is also a very good French film 'Weekend at Zuydcoote (Dunkirk)' directed by Henry Verneul and starring the great Jean Paul Belmondo. It is based on a book by Robert Merle who was actually rescued by the British from the Dunkirk Beaches. Either of the latter two films recommended but Nolan - Oh dear, you can do so much better.
10.0~Survival is Victory coreyjdenford Sign in Permalink This review of Dunkirk is spoiler free ***** (5/5) CHRISTOPHER NOLAN HAS shown time and time again that he is no stranger to massive box-office breaking productions which come with genre busting techniques, he's done magic in The Prestige, he's done superhero in The Dark Knight Trilogy, to a mind-bending dream world in Inception and finally he's done Matthew McConauhey being sucked into a black hole in Interstellar. His latest is essentially his The Longest Day having trying his hand at a war drama, although it is in fact his shortest film since his 2002 remake of Insomnia standing at only 106 minutes it's an epic feat showing that he doesn't need length. In fact, throughout it's entirety it's one big battle in a slight deviation from that first thirty minute opening of Saving Private Ryan or the big battle towards the end of Hacksaw Ridge no, Nolan kick starts this with the action and refuses to let up. Dunkirk is intense, set in May 1940 on the beaches of Dunkirk, France 400,000 allied soldiers with teams of French, Canadian and British soldiers are evacuating the battle in a desperate attempt to get home, instead during their fight for survival home comes to them. During this evacuation there are several destroyers, medical ships lead by Kenneth Branagh's naval captain, all while in the midst of German fighters trying to gun them down. There are spitfire's that fly through in protection for the allies flown by a team of pilots led by Tom Hardy's hot-headed pilot Farrier, in the water, Mark Rylance's Man on the Boat is heading towards the war in an attempt to pick up soldiers. A powerful introduction to an intense war drama which is incredibly by Nolan on his IMAX camera, along with the beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's eerily incredible score and it's brilliant. Every scene is handled perfectly nothing feels out of place from the fighter jet's gunfire, through the incredible heroics of Rylance, to the rough waters below Nolan's camera weavers through these intense dramatic moments smoothly not avoiding any detail and it's wonderful. Where the action is its strongest is in the skies. The allied soldiers are constantly bombarded by German fire, there are allied planes flying in from every corner in a desperate attempt to gun them down. Yesteryear's audience would've settled at watching digital laser dogfights in Star Wars but today we get bullets flying, planes dropping and smoke engulfing the screen and it's brilliant. In addition, unlike any other war film Nolan doesn't linger on the violence of war he doesn't refrain his camera to piles of bodies with there intestines hanging out, or having missing limbs, no here he finds a new path for his focus; the psychosis of it all, the pain of being shot or nearly drowning, the torment of constant gunfire, and the fear of having shell shock a message which Cillian Murphy fantastically conveys. The performances are excellent too, though there is limited dialogue Nolan handles his actors brilliantly teetering through several different perspectives, there's one on the docks, on the planes and on the ground with the youngsters. However, despite having the star power of his older cast their characterization is sadly limited to their jobs Murphy is just a whining soldier, Rylance is the man on a boat, Branagh is just the naval captain and Hardy is the pilot there's no other characterization that goes beyond that. It's the newcomers who are the real stars led by Fionn Whitehead's Tommy who leads the team of young survivors to rescue, they're put through a string of dramatic moments they are shot at, they are drowned and they are forced to make sacrifices to save themselves. Their performances excel Whitehead is brilliantly quiet he is teamed up with Alex (Styles) who mostly seems disappointed that he didn't fight for his country. The two work together to save themselves and their teammates. Still, despite the slight drop in the older characters, Dunkirk is an excellent piece of filmmaking which excels in brilliant cinematography, a fantastic score, shining camera angles and brilliant performances this is easily Nolan's best film since Inception and it could just be the best film of 2017. VERDICT: Nolan's latest is an intense war drama which holds no bars to the torture of those men and ultimately pays off in style as an excellent lesson in history.
4.0~One of those Highly Annoying Jump Around in Time movies, about a bunch of guys standing on a beach targe1314 Sign in Permalink I went into Dunkirk with high hopes, respecting the director, and impressed with what I had seen from the previews, but expecting they were hiding the best for last in the movie. I left confused, disappointed, and as I walked back over the movie, I grew increasingly so. This movie, which, if we were to believe the media hype around it, is a proud return to the stellar WWII movies of our youth, in short, a complete opposite to the disaster that was the 2001 Pearl Harbour movie. NO CGI!!! We are informed, as if that somehow indicates the signs of a GOOD movie... Instead we are treated to an incredibly boring 2 hours of guys standing on a beach, an old fella driving his boat, and some very leisurely and boring flying. I was disappointed going in that the movie was only 2 hours. 'Barely enough time to give such a subject the grandeur it deserves' many were saying. Instead I was staring at my watch, begging this snore fest to be done, and begging that the ludicrous stories would not be overtopped by even more ludicrousness. I was wrong, the finale, which I'll get to, is so completely ridiculous that one wonders if they were hoping for zero pilots in the audience. No, I'm not a WWII war buff who is going to rip this movie a new one because of technicalities. The mistakes are both small and huge in this movie, and seemingly never ending. The movie makes an attempt to separate the topics into 3 main areas: Land, Sea, and Air. Or, to be more accurate, Boring scenes of guys standing around at the beach, lots of guys drowning in multiple ship sinkings while grandpa putters with his son and friend to the rescue, and leisurely Sunday flight maneuvers with a couple of planes. LAND. In trying to be realistic, C. Nolan, instead of CGI'ing the spectacle of 400,000 desperate soldiers crowding on a beach awaiting rescue, we are shown maybe 500, many of which are apparently cardboard. It's about the size of a rock concert lineup outside the stadium on Friday night, for an old 70's band. The guys are bored, we are bored. Occasionally a dive bomber comes down to drop some bombs and kill 1 guy or 2. Then back to smoking and staring at the sea. When this seems like it will just never end, we get a scene change as some soldiers find an old boat and try to sit in it and wait for the tide. Yes, this is a riveting scene of guys sitting in a boat waiting for the tide to come in. And it's exciting compared to what we saw previously. Then a guy loses his mind and decides someone must die, for some bizarre reason, he figures if one guy get's out the bullethole ridden hulk will finally float. SEA. We are treated so multiple ship sinkings and guys drowning. It's never ending. If you are a shipwreck survivor, I HIGHLY Recommend YOU AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!! It will re-ignite your PTSD. We see the same sinking over and over, from multiple angles because? THIS MOVIE JUMPS AROUND IN TIME. I am biased, as I ABSOLUTELY HATE movies that jump around in time. This is one of the worst I have seen in years for that. AIR. They have only 1 German bomber left that can fly, apparently, so we are treated to that, exactly ONE bomber. Flying around and around, aka jump around in time, from multiple angles. Now the technical details come to the front, as droves of pilots walk to the exits. The spitfire fighters have an inexhaustible supply of bullets. The German planes refuse to get out of the way of the bullets. The spitfire pilots appear bored as bullets strike their planes. All planes execute lazy, civilian aircraft lazy turns and banks, as if they are all out for a nice Sunday fly. The spitfire pilot flies around for the last ten minutes with his thumb on the fire trigger, as if he doesn't know what the heck he is doing. Then he proceeds to glide for about 10 minutes with no fuel, and shoot down a German plane, in a heavy fighter plane that would have been on the beach in 2 minutes with zero banking or turning. He glides up and down the beach like this for what seems an eternity. It is maddening. Finally, a guy ditches his plane in the drink but FORGETS TO OPEN HIS CANOPY FIRST. A cardinal sin for any pilot. He is rescued by a kid with a boathook, who somehow manages to chop through his canopy in one blow, even though it's already under water. Cringeworthy. MUSIC FAULTS As a young lad loads lifejackets onto his dad's boat, we are treated to a hammering tension filled score that one would expect for the imminent attack of JAWS. No jaws, or Godzilla happens, just... a ... kid... slowly loading lifejackets... on a boat. SOUND FAULTS As stated, they accidentally put the '20mm cannon guns firing' noise over top of the German bomber machine guns firing. See Battle of Britain for a properly done WWII flying picture. EDITING FAULTS The movie jumps around in time so much one is quickly infuriated. It appears we are watching 20 minutes of film that is stretched to 2 hours using the multiple camera angles. FALSE DANGERS Finally, There was zero rough stormy seas during Dunkirk. It was the opposite actually, unusually calm. There was zero issue with the tide at Dunkirk. They had boarding options all the way from high tide to low. Both of these are used as tension elements and plot elements in the movie.
1.0~Over hyped by those who have no real comprehension of what this film is about rickjb Sign in Permalink I only write a review when a movie is being badly over hyped. Very, very few people alive can actually remember Dunkirk. It is a certainty that those who have written the glowing reviews are neither historians nor veterans, and have no concept of the reality of this World War 2 chapter. This film in no way reveals the true scale or horror of the evacuation of the British Army from France. Perhaps all these generous 9 and 10 star reviewers feel that Christopher Nolan gave them a first hand education and true taste of war. He did not. The film is grossly inaccurate n both the detail and the representation. I won't repeat all that other critical reviewers have written - please read some to get a balanced view. However there were some 350,000 troops and some 800 boats. Not the small numbers depicted here. Similarly, it was not fought by 5 German planes and 3 British Spitfires. This was pure Hollywood indulgence for Nolan. Spitfires that glide without fuel forever. No blood. No groans. No cold. No shivering - not even in a cold, waterlogged uniform. Poor continuity. A debatable soundtrack. A woefully poor use of acting talent and lack of meaningful script. A film does not always have to be truthful or realistic to be a good film. This film might have provided entertainment for some, but for those who suffered and died in Dunkirk or those who wanted to see the truth, this film is a true let down. There were also a lot of cheap short cuts used in making this film but, if a film about Ryan Gosling dancing and playing the piano can steal Oscars, this certainly will. I gave it 1 star to help bring down the average but would otherwise have given it 5.
5.0~Dullkirk neillaoshi Sign in Permalink If I was in charge of marketing for a big budget movie, do you think I could get the score on certain websites to stay high and a lot of good reviews to remain near the front of the review board? Could I wine and dine the reviewers for top magazines and tell them why the movie is so great and make it easy for them to spin it that way? Possibly. Looking through the reviews on IMDb I seem to have 10 start reviews repeated multiple times, while unfavorable reviews only appear once. I enjoy real creativity and originality, interesting plots and witty or smart dialogue. I've loved Christopher Nolan's previous movies for these reasons, but they are absent here in Dunkirk. But there are other things to enjoy in true story movies which tell of overcoming things when the odds are stacked against you and triumphing in adversity: in these movies you can hope to get some emotions of pride, admiration, wonder: perhaps even a lump in the throat. But, perhaps deliberately, Nolan avoids these big moments (thinks they are cheesy?). The problem is they are not replaced by anything else to elicit any feelings. This combined with the lack of background and development of characters meant that, for me anyway, the movie was emotionless and therefore pretty dull. Others have likened it to a docudrama on the History channel,but there is really almost no information conveyed about the history, so it wouldn't be a strong contender in that field either. The only real originality I saw was telling the three stories on different timescales with them all converging at the end, but nothing about this impressed me and it just seemed more of an expedient so that the short (real time) story of the spitfire could be interlaced with the other stories. Others seemed to find this confusing, I didn't really find that a problem I will be very surprised if this movie doesn't become one of the biggest flops of the summer, if not all time: great marketing and spin can only go so far.
6.0~Should have been better mrnettek2000 Sign in Permalink Okay...I guess that's the review, just, okay. Without IMAX, it would have fallen below my score of 6/10. I saw this movie on 7/24/2017, in an IMAX theater. While the screen and sound were amazing, the movie itself suffered from character development, or the lack thereof. I also think this movie was barely PG13, ranging closer to PG, which a serious war movie should be rated R, in my opinion. I honestly don't know how this movie is getting 8's, 9's, and 10's---it just isn't that great. Without giving anything away, you basically only connect with one character, and you still learn nothing about him. What this movie needed: -Character development -Tighter plot -In sync, instead of out of sync storytelling -And women who helped in the war effort If you see this movie, sit close to the screen (IMAX does make the flight scenes awesome), and bring food; no use you being hungry and bored.
6.0~Not Tied Together Well edgemarty-152-556428 Sign in Permalink The camera work and the acting were spot on great. The music was superb. But, the film did not offer any historical references. How did the army become pinned down? Why was the army stuck at that particular location? Where were their enemies? There was no mention of the three day pause enacted by the Wehrmacht which enabled the Allied forces to escape. Where was the Luftwaffe? A few planes were in the film but no real numbers. So many unanswered questions. This could have been another Patton but better.
9.0~Extraordinarily tense war film told through individual stories PotassiumMan Sign in Permalink Although touched upon in some films in the past, the British-French evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 as France neared total collapse at the hands of the Germany Army in WWII has never been given the kind of comprehensive and vivid treatment that Nolan's explosive war film does. This film fully captures the anxiety, desperation and seeming hopelessness that the British Army faced in its efforts to save its troops in France and prepare to defend their own soil as Hitler's armies defeated the French and overran the European mainland. It does so by giving the audience a close-up of the evacuation from as many vantage points as possible. These include the British troops trying to cross the English Channel (told from both masses and a small group) as well as civilians who used their own vessels to aid a depleted British Navy in rescuing the troops and from the air in which British spitfire pilots fought gallantly to protect British ships and troops from German aircraft and finally from the British high command desperately trying to pull off a miracle. In the air strike scenes, Nolan makes the screaming sound of a German dive bomber as menacing and tension-inducing as any director has done in recent memory. The tension is amplified to a raw crescendo by Hans Zimmer's brilliantly realized soundtrack. Equally impressive is the sense of dread created in individual troops trying to escape but facing one seemingly fatal catastrophe after another. As far as performances go, this isn't any one actor's film, though everyone is great with exceptional work by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Mark Rylance. Tom Hardy has a fairly important role though he spends most of the film muzzled by a fighter pilot mask. The film's achievement lies in creating a wide-ranging account of courage, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of almost-certain disaster. It doesn't offer much speechifying or jingoistic sentiments, just the hard-boiled realism of war. The story of a hardened and weary army trying to escape to defend its own shores might not resonate right away with audiences unfamiliar with the war, but this film is a lot more than just a mere depiction of history. It's also a master class in dramatic spectacle and the recreation of an epic tale of survival in a war that at that moment seemed likely to end very soon. Splendidly realized, it is not to be missed.
1.0~From Nolan you excepts more than this. S7umit Sign in Permalink If you are watching this because of Christopher Nolan, You sure will be disappointed. If you don't have any idea of the incident or WWII then this movie is not for you.
5.0~"Some ships rescue a bunch of soldiers" By Christopher Nolan jbuchana-21199 Sign in Permalink This was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. I LOVE historical and war movies, but this is not the case, Though it wasn't awful, i'd probably never watch it again. Pros: great story. Good acting. No cheese scenes. Period. Cons: Edition is terrible, very difficult to get along with (my sister got completely lostwith the non lineal timing). Characters are really underdeveloped. I didn't cared at all if they lived or not, because there was no plausible difference with non- main character soldiers. Music is quite annoying (sorry Hans) Staging SUCKS. There were 400.000 souls and 1000 civil boats in Dunkirk. But Nolan decided that 2000 soldiers and 20 boats were enough. WHERE THE HECK ARE THE OTHER 398000 SOLDIERS AND 980 BOATS MY DEAR CHRISTOPHER?!??!?!? A HUGE BUDGET JUST TO PAY FACELESS TOM HARDY? WELCOME TO CGI ERA!!!! YOU JUST HAVE TO DO COPY PASTE A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH YOUR ARMY! MY DEAR GOD IT REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS. Pause Breathe Happy place Where were we? Yes! Conclusions. The movie is just... good. Maybe the problem is that I was expecting a movie way more overwhelming. The movie is, all in all, inconsistent. Characters are shallow and you never get to understand the real dimension of the events. You just now how many people they saved because the paper says so. But if it was for Nolan's point of view, it's just a bunch of boats that saved a couple hundred soldiers. Really difficut to understand if you never read about Dunkirk before. As I have already said, the most disappointing movie I've ever seen.
10.0~THE best Nolan film matt_dutton Sign in Permalink Dunkirk may well be the best war film ever made. Tense from start to finish (epic score btw), incredible aerial combat scenes, and thoroughly unnerving and horrifying throughout. The whole film is a series of crescendos, both musically, emotionally and cinematographically. As far as Christopher Nolan films go, it makes The Dark Knight look like a warm up act. The acting and casting is superb too... astoundingly even Harry Styles!! I was genuinely left in bits after watching Dunkirk. It is beyond sensational. If this film doesn't win every award it can, I'll be amazed!!
4.0~No substance , no style. vladpasat-88492 Sign in Permalink The description says: "Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German Army, and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II." Fierce battle? Oh , you mean the repeated plane "battles" where no more than 3 planes are present at a time. The characters look the same, it is very hard to tell them apart, but you wont give a care about them anyways. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was hyped thinking I'd see how the hundreds of thousands of troops are evacuated. Instead I got to see two people constantly hopping from one boat to another, a cliche drama on an old guy's boat, and a plane gliding around for 10 minutes after it ran out of fuel. Overall boring movie, it has scenes that drag on for way too long, it's pathetic attempt at a story, and lack of realism.
