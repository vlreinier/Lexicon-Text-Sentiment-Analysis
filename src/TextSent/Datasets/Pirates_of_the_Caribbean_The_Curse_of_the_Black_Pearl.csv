10.0~Johnny Depp up for Best Actor Oscar louise_is_goldilockz Sign in Permalink What can i say that hasnt already been said, i went to see this for Orlando Bloom and went back for Johnny Depp. It is the best film i have seen this year. It combines action, comedy and romance, which i find is the best kind of film. ok so some of the fight scenes look very choreographed, but the comedy is natural, i havent laughed so much in ages, another reason to see it is that i have just read the shortlist for the Oscars next year and Johnny Depp is up for Best Actor
5.0~OK but overrated derbo73 Sign in Permalink I skipped the whole franchise because the franchising was getting on my nerves right from the start. Whenever everyone starts trying to convince me that something is amazing, I shy away from it. And I never was in the mood to see a pirate movie until recently. So I gave it a chance. That's what I think (not that it would bother anyone anymore so many years later) a simple damsel in distress story, although the damsel knows how to help herself, actually she is more productive than the rest of the "heroes" - Jack Sparrow is completely exaggerated and silly I guess this means mission accomplished. I don't like Johnny Depp that much and I admit he played the role well, but I didn't like the character. He is not cool and not smart, he is a selfish lucky jester and half the time his plans only worked out because of the script. I wish he had real wit. lengthy and tedious first half. The story is so simple, it would have easily fitted into a 1.5h movie or even shorter. - all of a sudden the movie fast forwards (when they follow the Black Pearl to that secret island only Jack knows about) dialogues and scenes were set for laughs, but it's a kind of naive slapstick that gets tiresome fast. I can watch Laurel & Hardy for hours and laugh, but this is just dumb. camera was mediocre at best. There were opportunities for breath taking shots over the ocean, ships in pursuit - but no. Closeups of silly people constantly. All in all it is standard popcorn cinema stretched out to the max. Nothing new here, nothing special. No real adventure as everything is predictable, situations change back and forth, back and forth. I hope the later parts get better.
10.0~The Greatest and Most Underrated Movie of All Time edm-03542 Sign in Permalink This is the Greatest and Most Underrated movie of all time! It succeeds with great directing by Gore Verbenski, great performances (Most Notably Johnny Depp and Geffoery Rush), Great Writing, and A Great Score by Kalus Bladet. Also, The Cinematography, Production Design, Costumes, Hair, Makeup, and VFX. It is my Favorite POTC Movie, and Favorite Movie of All Time! I'll give it a 10/10!
9.0~Great Movie Ross16 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. Each actor did a great job. But the one that really stands out it is good old Johnny D not to mention he's hot but he has a lot of talent. his portrayol of capt. jack sparrow is what makes this such a great movie to watch he's funny charming and witty. my suggestion is to go out and buy the DVD. it has a whole CD of special fetures that are just as good as the film. I rate this movie 9/10. The extras on DVD are fantasticE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film. The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story.
7.0~Awesome... onlinesteve-1 Sign in Permalink ...the thing about this movie is... if you haven't seen the ride, it's cool. But if you have seen the ride, even better. What I would like to know, however, is does this mean that there are going to be movies made from every single one of Disney's rides? And then, will rides again be spawned from the movies? So we're stuck in a never ending cycle of Disney-to ride-To Movie-back to ride.. and so on... Does anyone know of any other Disney rides being turned into movies? Does anyone know of any other themepark rides that were turned into movies?
1.0~wow, and double wow nouseforaname Sign in Permalink im pretty surprised that this is actually on the top 250 list, and ahead of some pretty impressive films. I was dissapointed to say the least, when putting the disc in the dvd i thought to myself "a good ol fashioned, pirate ghost tale, marvelous".... ah no... suffice to say the peak was when i got a chuckle out of the scene where you see Depp standing tall and proud as he jumps down on what you expect to be a massive ship but turns out to be a dinky sailboat. That was about 5 minutes into the movie, it all went down from there. It was just boring to me, pirates who were cursed and now need the blood of a certain fellow to lift it, whoooo. Orlando Bloom was annoying, I can understand pre teenage girls waving their "Potc" flags because hes oh so hot(those would be the imdb users with reviews like, "omigawd this is like tha best movie EVER, orlando bloom rules!!!111". My confirmation came when my sweet mother, who never has a bad word to say about anyone or anything proclaimed, "it wasnt really good", when an hour rolled around we had both lost all interest and i was reading comic books, glancing at the tv now and then to see if anything interesting pops up. It didnt. Finally, I fell asleep. 3/10
10.0~The best pirate movie ever! josh_ostro Sign in Permalink Wow was this movie good! I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this before! I went to go see it when it first came out in 2003 at a huge theater and it was almost completely full, but luckily I got in. I wanted to go see it because people kept on bragging on about it so I just wanted to check how it really was, and to tell you the truth, I don't regret any of it. This is also probably one of Johnny Depp's best movies. He was a perfect and sometimes even funny character in the movie. He met the exact pirate voice, which is kind of weird because I haven't heard him talking like that before. Also, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did a good job. It was just a really good movie with an awesome storyline. The reason I'm giving it a 10 is because of the plot, the cast, the acting and so forth.. And I feel that it was delivered in this amazing pirate movie! So if you're bored one night, and decide that you wanna rent a movie that you haven't seen before, I suggest picking up Pirates of the Caribbean, as you won't be disappointed.
8.0~All hail, Captain Jack Sparrow is on board Sparrowmaniac Sign in Permalink It is so unfortunate this movie releases alongside LOTR. Otherwise it was bound to snatch up many many awards. Black Pearl, is in all respect a classic. A super super movie, coupled with Johnny Depp's massive skills, it is just mind blowing. Its a pity that a actor of his caliber hasn't got an Academy Award in his belt. I though expect that it wont be far away. The movie brings up many legendary facts, which makes it so fascinating to watch. Instances which speak of the secret Pirates Code known to none but the pirates themselves, and curses that the pirates suffer under the consequences of trying to steal a cursed treasure and lastly treachery. The movie fills you end to end with excitement. Johnny Depp is the evergreen Captain Jack Sparrow, probably the most unfortunate pirate in history, because of his ill luck, with which he always ends up loses his ship. But no one knew about his colorful past, when he was the captain of the most feared pirate ships in history, The Black Pearl. Even lesser knows of his consequences, where he was left stranded on an unhabitated island with a pistol loaded with a single bullet. He escaped by making ropes with his own hair, and he comes back to take back his ship, the Black Pearl. And with some help from young Will Turner and the aristocrat daughter of the ambassador Miss Elizabeth Swann, he succeeds in killing Captain Barbossa, and evading capture by the British army. The movie is extremely well done, with a superb plot, superb direction, superb screen play, and some excellent on screen performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. He really does deserve some special recognition. Klaus Badelt does a good job with the music, and with some pretty neat visual effects. This is just a movie which you cannot afford missing. 8/10 !!!
1.0~i hate this movie GeneralDisarray Sign in Permalink this movie sucks , its way too long kind of boring and a very crappy ending. the only thing that saved this movie was johnny depp . the only reason this movie made alot of money is because it was a ride at disneyland . WOW , that is so exciting , actually no it isnt this movie is the worst film i have seen ever , god i want that 2 and a half hours of my life back , and my 8 dollars , well all i have is 4 words: i hate this movie
6.0~Good summertainment. Pass the rum. Pavel-8 Sign in Permalink **Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!** If I were given $125 million and told to make a B-movie about pirates, "Pirates" would be something I wouldn't mind coming up with. The flick works because it doesn't quite take itself seriously. Had it been a straight forward movie, boredom would have set in sooner, but the tongue-in-cheek humor makes it endurable. At the core of the askance goofiness is Johnny Depp, who plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate of questionable skills and methods, in a half-drunk manner that can't be taken too seriously. He embodies all things pirate, complete with cliches, sarcastic remarks, and rum. Initially his odd mannerisms threw me, as I didn't quite understand why he couldn't walk straight. But as his character was fleshed out, everything made sense; and Depp's brilliance was understood. He and his character carried the movie, in part because every time Pirates drifted towards over-the-top seriousness, a mere glance or comment from Depp put it back in its proper place. Popcorn movies don't usually supply opportunities for great performances, and maybe there wasn't one written. Depp, however, took the part to a level beyond the movie itself. The rest of the cast ranged from servicable to good. Orlando Bloom finally starred in a movie without his pointy ears, and did quite well as blacksmith apprentice Will Turner. Although he didn't have much to work with in a combination role as both straight man and hero, he filled those roles admirably, proving once again that he has a stellar screen presence. The striking Keira Knightley, in a slightly different role than Bend it Like Beckham, doesn't have much to do as the damsel in distress. But she presents Elizabeth as a step up from the token screamer. Her long figure and bold facial features (Natalie Portman-esque) draw attention as well. She and Bloom make quite the on-screen duo. Geoffrey Rush leads the rest of the cast as Captain Barbossa, the requisite evil pirate and Sparrow's nemesis. He eats up his part, nearly outdoing Depp in the campiness department. Everyone else is competent, looking their parts well, but doing little more. Aside from Depp's performance, the look of the movie was the highlight. The rich and colorful palette of the film enhanced the bold lifestyle embraced by such rogues. The sweeping cinematography, meant to be seen on the big screen, captured the feeling of living such a sea-bound life, providing an experience that truly felt on location. Much has been made of ILM's skeletal special effects, and they deserve whatever praise they receive. Simply designing the skeletons and their smooth movements is impressive enough. But the real accomplishment is the phenomenally fluid transition of the undead from flesh to bone when moving in and out of moonlight. This movie should at least get a look when the Academy Awards come around. Surprisingly for a pirate movie, the sound is quiet during the opening scenes, so quiet that the rumbling bass from the neighboring theater intruded on my screening. But once the action accelerated, the sound did as well. Fortunately it did not reach the ear-splitting levels of previous Bruckheimer fare like "Armageddon", plateauing at a loud but manageable volume, providing a pleasant aural experience. That experience was enhanced by the score of Klaus Badelt. He is clearly a disciple of Hans Zimmer, as the music rings of Zimmer's "Gladiator". It is also reminiscent of "Mask of Zorro". The strings and horns drove forward with the action of the movie, especially during the climactic scenes. Some may find the music over-bearing, but for a movie such as this, it is quite appropriate. As much as I've raved thus far, I rate this movie only 6 out of 10 (still a thumbs up in my book) for a number of reasons. Unfortunately, "Pirates" has a running time (nearly 150 minutes) that matches the titular length. Trimming 20-30 minutes off, mostly at the beginning and end, would have made this film much better, limiting the lulls between action. After the humorous introduction to Sparrow, the exposition was too long. Depp portrayed the part well enough that we didn't need every single aspect of his character explicitly shown. In the last half hour, the battle scenes between the undead and the British, while visually attractive, were both too long and unnecessary. Since the pirates were immortal at that point, shouldn't they have overrun the British more quickly? They could have easily reached the ship later and just commenced the fight when the curse was lifted. The inclusion of a mandatory happy-ending epilogue was fine, but it too dragged, because the writers had to politely wrap up the love triangle. Speaking of which, the whole Elizabeth-Commodore Norrington romance angle should have been axed. Not only did it add length, it overstated the fact that Elizabeth and Turner were going to fall in love. Speaking of needless romantic angles, the ambiguous past between Sparrow and Anamaria should probably have been trimmed too. I'm guessing there was more to it in the original cut, but most of that was eliminated, leaving the small remaining parts out of place. Speaking of out of place, the comedic relief pirates and soldiers, although amusing at first, quickly wore out their welcome. Characters such as theirs are usually present in Disney movies, but in a more 'adult' flick, particularly one already replete with humor, the cheap comedy only annoyingly slows down the pacing. But the biggest problem with Pirates is that for all its positives, the movie still is not truly interesting. It does engage, but does not pique interest. There is just too much going on between too many people to really care about what's occurring. Don't get me wrong. It's an enjoyable film from which you will likely remember a handful of images; but outside of Captain Jack Sparrow, the depth is lacking. Maybe that will be remedied in the inevitable sequel(s)... Bottom Line: Good summertainment. 6 of 10. Pass the rum.
7.0~Funny russem31 Sign in Permalink There is only one real reason I liked this film and can be summed up in two words - Johnny Depp. He really made the film what it is - a funny action adventure. In fact, although the the main focus seems to be around Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters (and their romance which was not very believable), Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was the real focus and what a riot he is! The visual effects was pretty good too. Other than that though, the story itself is okay (I thought Cutthroat Island had a better story and that's saying much) and the music was average (Hans Zimmer has done better - i.e. The Lion King). But still see this film because of Johnny Depp, actor extraordinaire!
10.0~best pirates movie i ever seen rasheed_rashad Sign in Permalink The Pirates of the Caribbean one of the best movies dealing with stories of pirates, where he was wonderful on multiple aspects, namely: Scenario: The scenario of movie nicely well as the complete text of movie and draws the viewer and has a high level of exciting and wonderful, especially the text on the character of Jack Sparrow and comedy associated with this stirring personal Directed by movie: I think the movie directed was not easy, and made us live inside with the characters, I do not think there are enough words to talk about the extent of the work of genius Gore Verbinski. The finest scenes of movie, the scene of fighting between Captain Jack and Captain Barbossa Sbaaro in the last chapter of movie, and perhaps what makes this movie also extravaganza of music soundtrack of the film and the performance of actor Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character to where he played a major role in making this character alive
6.0~Boy George and Legolas are not pirates!! cindyx Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, these two actors have one thing in common, they are not pirates. johnny Depp walks around like Boy George walked up on guffballs, too much makeup, no wonder the pirates kicked him off the ship and left him on an island!! Orlando Bloom... well what can i say He´s just Legolas on a pirateship. To bottom line it, Pirates of the Caribbean is a very handsome movie with two main caracters whos been casted to the WRONG film.
5.0~Much ado about nothing aj-to Sign in Permalink To me, this was a disappointing movie. I anyhow wasn't that much inclined to see it, because of the popularity amongst the youngsters: that's invariably a bad token. So maybe I should rephrase my opening sentence. The movie was what I expected, but I'm always disappointed my bad expectations are so vastly responded to. This product is so obviously invented - with the help of some adequate stealing from the predecessors in the genre. To name a few examples: Jack Sparrows bearing clearly is a loan from Sandokan, the head figure of a popular pirate series in the 70's; the stern character of the commodore, rigid and uncompromising as in numerous examples before (the loosening at the end is a bland falsification); the Yankee Doodle type of the father of the heroine; and so on. The movie distinctly was made for commercial purposes, and has no historical traits whatsoever. The Zombie effect of pirates doomed to perpetual half-life is one of the many dispirited genuflections to modern taste and merely augments the mendacious value of the motion picture. I can give more instances of such unhistorical nonsense, but cannot do so without giving away the plot; so I'll avoid that error. All in all, if you like pure fantasy without any pretension of truth – go see it, when you have nothing better to do. But don't you think things in any respect could've happened this way; life isn't a fairy-tale.
10.0~Mixed Feelings On This Movie slightlymad22 Sign in Permalink Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl. I have very mixed feelings on this movie. One one hand I love it, it's almost perfect entertainment and I love Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. On the other hand, I think the success of this movie and the character was a blessing and a curse (much like Smokey & The Bandit for Burt Reynolds) as it turned Depp from a popular actor, into an A List superstar!! And in the process, it ruined one of my favourite actors, who even in his worst movies, was always interesting. When the TV Show 21 Jump Street was a hit, it made Depp famous and turned him into a heart throb and an instant teen idol, and he hated everything about it. He fought to get out of his contract, and when they refused, he became a prima donna. He stopped trying and was awful to work with. Once free, he then spent the next decade, avoiding star making movies, preferring roles in smaller, more artistic movies that made little money but gained him credibility, and earned nicknames like Hollywood's favourite odd ball or Hollywood's favourite outsider. The last 5 years had been the most settled of Depp's life, he was living quietly in France with Vanessa Paradis and their children. Then he made this movie, so his "kids could finally see him in a movie." And it put Depp back right where he began. Beholden to a major studio, a product, a living embodiment of a theme ride. His next two movies were already in the can, and the following two were already in place, before the studio-approved Depp of the last 12 years. Now on to the movie. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is not the main character, more of a supporting character, but he steals every scene and was deservedly nominated for his first Oscar (losing to Sean Penn in Mystic River) he is the best thing in the movie, and truthfully the movie is duller when he is not on screen. He is at his quirky best (is he permanent drunk or did he get too much sun whilst stranded on the island) and I usually smiled every time he was on screen. Imagine how boring this would have been if Depp had played the role straight. It's a tad over long, the battles become a tad too repetitive considering the only casualties are the non pirates, since the pirates can't die. Even watching Depp and Geoffrey Rush engage in a totally pointless swordfight is a bit blah, as you know what's coming thanks to a reveal earlier. Orlando Bloom is a tad bland but is ok, likewise Kiera Knightley who looks good, but lacks the certain something that would explain why all these men are in love with her, and more importantly are willing to die for her. Geoffrey Rush Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are all fine in their supporting roles too. OK I have waffled on enough. Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl became Depp's highest grossing movie, and joint best performing movie (alongside Platoon) as it grossed $305 million at the domestic box office to end 2003 as the 3rd highest grossing movie of the year.
9.0~Rousing fun gforce762 Sign in Permalink A Disney ride and now a movie. Alright, alright, alright - rode it, seen it, done it, big deal. Not quite with this movie. Set right out the attraction at Walt Disney World, this movie has the "feel" of the ride done to a tee. The sets are wonderfully brought to life and if you look carefully, you will see several aspects of the ride in the movie, most notably the scene where the dog has the key to jail cell and the prisoners just can't get the dog to bring them the key. Best quote in the movie - "Jack Sparrow, you are the worst pirate I've ever heard of." "Ah, but you have heard of me." Makes the movie, shows what kind of character Jack Sparrow is and what kind of actor Johnny Depp is to pull it off. Go rent it, go buy it. Just go see it.
3.0~Another Bad Bruckheimer Production SUNLION777 Sign in Permalink The only thing memorable about 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' will be Johnny Depp's usual out-standing performance. I can only hope that this 'Blockbuster' featurette won't do for his acting career what "Leaving Las Vegas" did to Nick Cage's. Remember Nicholas Cage, a quirky, interesting actor who was almost always worth watching, no matter how bad the movie? Then his big moment in "Leaving Las Vegas", and he hasn't done a thing worth watching on-screen since then, including his woefully lackluster performance in Martin Scorcese's 1999 film, "Bringing Out The Dead", where Mr. Cage would only be considered interesting in contrast to John Goodman's typically bombastic, bizarre, supporting-actor overdoses. Now it's Mr. Depp's turn as an actor. Either he will continue to pick and choose his movies based on the merit he sees in them as an actor, along the lines of the late, great, Gregory Peck, and the still living, and equally astounding, Meryl Streep; or, he will pick and choose his movies based on how much money someone is willing to pay him for his 'appearing in' their studio's (insert studio name) production of (insert producer's name and/or production company name) film directed by (insert director's name), and starring (insert actor's name). I am rooting for the uniqueness of Johnny Depp, of course. For a movie as over-produced as "Pirates of the Caribbean" is, with the occasional well-done special effect (which should be a given considering the money spent), and interesting costuming (especially in the 'heaving-bossoms' scenes), some of the 'special effects' come off rather mediocre in comparison to better done summer fodder. The distance shot of the burning Port would have been at home in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds". The underwater skeleton-walking scenes looked like out-takes from "Clash of The Titans". The humor of the movie is also in question, first during the looting of the British Naval Port and attacks on it's citizens by the pirates, with scenes of murder and attempted rape, played on film as quasi-comedy (in someone's seriously disturbed idea of entertainment); and also during the scenes when British Sailors are being slaughtered left and right onboard their own ship, immediately after the Pirates' underwater skeleton-walking scene, although these sailors are mostly being dis-embowelled off-screen so as to further distance us from contemplating the possibility of their deaths, and we are coerced instead into laughing at a Pirate's severed boney claw, clutching for the cowardly Governor Swann's throat. A character foppishly over-played by Jonathan Pryce. Can anyone say "Vincent Price" cheese-ball? The dashingly pretty Orlando Bloom, as Will Turner, barely registers a ripple of a human nuance, rather like observing an interesting wall-paper. Likewise for Keira Knightley, as his longed-to-be-statuette-on-a-pedestal, Elizabeth Swann, the (of course!) Governor's daughter. For a good acting comparison see Kate Winslett in "Titanic". Both parts seemingly conceived by a group of writers discovering cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark religious icons for the first time and attempting to pass them off as feminine Heaven. On screen for an hour too long, with convoluted plot 'twists' packing the wallop of moist cardboard, character actors required to do uninteresting comic 'bits' that might amuse a two-year old, screen-writing that barely rises to a fourth grade school play, wooden acting filmed along the lines of "Stand there and don't move while we shoot the scene", yet another 'typical' Hollywood feel-good ending, and, voila!, this summer's simple-minded Block-Buster movie is completed. On to the usual mass-merchandising, burger chain tie-ins (no matter how oddly far-fetched), and 'direct-to-DVD' sequel(s)! Thank you very much.
9.0~Awesome Lyngbak Sign in Permalink The first in the "Pirates" range of movies and it does not disappoint. Action, adventure and full on humor all the way.
10.0~Swish Buckling Action, Adventure and Fun! SonicStuart Sign in Permalink PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL Rated: PG-13 for Action Adventure Violence Genre: Action/Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy/Thriller Starring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley Star Rating: ***** out of 5 At first when I was looking at lots of previews for Pirates of the Caribbean, I thought it wasn't going to be that good but then when I heard lots of excellent comments on the movie, I decided to change my mind and watch the movie. Also after the movie had it's first weekend in the movie theaters, I was reading the entertainment section in the newspaper and saw that Disney announced that they were going to make a sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean and I thought that was fast especially since it made $46,630,690 million dollars on it's opening weekend! The movie is based on a theme park ride at Disneyland or Disney World. I think because I don't know which one. Pirates of the Caribbean is a sweeping action-adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas. There is a curse on this gold medallion for whenever it shines that is when Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his ghostly crew awake! When the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is captured by these ghostly buccaneers, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with an rogue pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to fight these ghostly pirates! SPOILER WARNING: Will and Jack attempt to recapture The Black Pearl ship, save the British navy, and relinquish a fortune in forbidden treasure thereby lifting the curse of the Pirates of the Caribbean. I really liked how this movie had lots of action and funny parts! I thought Johnny Depp did a really good job has a pirate and plus he was also really funny! Orlando Bloom did a good job too! I also thought the beautiful Keira Knightley did a great job also! I think Keira Knightley is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen especially with her looks and her sexy English accent! BOTTOM LINE: GREAT MOVIE WITH ACTION, ADVENTURE, THRILLS AND HUMOR!
9.0~Review overall madeline0603 Sign in Permalink Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl When I first saw this movie I had no idea what to expect as I have never really took interest in action pirate movies. It turned out to be a pretty good movie with comedy, action, and a little suspense and romance thrown in. I was beginning to take a really deep interest in this movie about 1/3 of the way through. The actors were really experienced and really got into character. If the actors didn't get into character as much as these actors did or, weren't as experienced then the movie would not be as excellent as it is. They really drew me into the movie. I felt that once I saw the first movie I had to watch the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Series because the end of each movie left me hanging and I needed to see what was going to happen next. I felt the cast did a good job in keeping the viewers hanging at the end. All the main actors played their roles well so it made me feel like I actually know all the characters. Johnny Depp did an excellent job in playing the pirate; Captain Jack Sparrow. It was like he was made to be Jack Sparrow his personality and everything. The director made the right choice in casting Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He acted the part as like I knew Jack Sparrow, like I have met him in reality when he is just a fictional character in a movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and or comedy. The actors transitioned from action, to comedy, to romance all very easily. They showed that they could play the part with ease. Yes it does take a while to get the part but, these actors made it look so easy based on how well they played their part. On the other hand there were some parts where the actors could have gone deeper into the part of their scene. For example during some of the fights there could have been a little more suspense. Though some fights they did a good job in building up suspense. The actors throughout the movie did a good job in keeping the viewers wondering what was going to happen next. It kept me wondering through out the whole movie. I enjoyed how they kept the suspense going too. The movie was not another cliché pirate movie either, it was something different and new. In conclusion I really enjoyed the whole movie. The director and script writer did a good job in filming and putting the movie together. I enjoyed how they paced it because if they wanted to they could have shortened the whole movie. The special effects on the movie didn't make the movie look bad either, they did a good job on adding them into the movie too. "Jack Sparrow: If you were waiting for the opportune moment, that was it." This quote means to me that you have to take the moment whether it is a good time or bad. People think all pirate movies are the same, but they are not. After watching this movie would you consider this the same as all other pirate movies?
10.0~love it Linda24502 Sign in Permalink Beyond Johnny Depps acting ability, of course, he is fantastic, but, Captain Barbosa, wow and wow, he totally committed himself to acting this part, I was totally drawn in and enjoyed so much, by far, Captain Barbosa's acting, its perfect. My one question is who does this music to this Movie? ITS awesome! I am told that my comment does not contain enough lines.. So, I will try and explain more on how I really enjoyed the acting in this movie, and how I sincerely look forward to a part two, if there be one. Its a really entertaining movie. I hope there are enough lines now to explain how I feel about this movie..
3.0~Money down the Drain leoblack Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl - The movie is as aimless as the tittle. Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme. The director, Gore Verbinski, made a horrific effort to add suspense, and about the only scary thing in the film is a cursed monkey! The characters, although interesting at first impression, soon get boring and ridiculous! Jack Sparrow has a major speech impediment, always looks like he's drunk 24/7 and seems to have hands that don't look connected to his wrists! His opening scene where viewers first catch a gimps of Jack was quite comical, but his later acts were plain, foolish. It's impossible to believe that such a pirate could even be conceived! The actor Johnny Depp played a magnificent part, but it's Disney's lack in concept to produce a more credible character, which unfortunately destroyed the feel of a real pirate film. The character William Turner was an even bigger let down. His jokes are dry to the bone, at best they my cause a chuckle. His character's desires are typical of what modern movies are about. All of this was made worst with the selection of actor to play the role. Orlando Bloom's parts in the film were particularly weak and lacking in emphasis, as you felt that Jack Sparrow was more important then the less adventurous blacksmith Will. The few good things about, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl are the tunes and the CGI effects. These are the only factors that keep the viewer from going to sleep! The music is on the dot, particularly when you see beautiful long shots of the surroundings. You'll get butterflies in you stomach, similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, when you witness the sight of the Computer Generated Images! Since the cursed pirates can only take the undead form in certain conditions, the lighting, and shadow effects make these images top-notch. This film is better of to just have CGI pirates walking around, raiding random ships, then to have poorly thought of characters, residing in the picture. There is too much that has been added to the film, and the mambo-jumbo comedy, action, thriller, love story, adventure theme is just a missive cliché of genres. The attempt made by Disney to have a classical family movie was a disastrous shamble! Millions of dollars have been wasted, down drain on actors who don't even suit the characters. I strongly recommend no one see this monstrous movie, as viewers would also be throwing away their money down the drain.
8.0~Great film pmc69 Sign in Permalink Brilliant acting by depp, makes you fall in love with his witty character jack sparrow.
10.0~Awesome!!! kylie_smile Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best movie I've ever seen! If you haven't seen it then GO SEE IT NOW!!! It's so funny and yet it still has plenty of room left over for serious parts. I enjoyed every 143 minutes of it and not only because of the cute guys in it! I mean, any movie with both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp has got to be good but this movie has really over done itself. I can't think of even one little bad thing about it. It is simply Awesome! I'm going to go buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out and I suggest that you do too! ^_^

9.0~Finally! My generations Indiana Jones. curtains Sign in Permalink Yes, yes, yes! A gorgeous swashbuckling rouge, pirates, monsters, a damsel not so much in distress and a monkey. How could anyone resist it? One of the most entertaining films i've ever watched. It's smart, funny, engaging, exciting and it's fun! One of the rare films where you are actually taken on adventure. You admire and love Jack, you feel sympathy for the villains. You want to be a part of this world. It somehow manages to touch the child looking for adventure in everyone. A film you can watch again and again and again... Capt. Jack Sparrow takes a podium on the eternal hall of fame for heroes and his adventures I imagine will endure as long as Indy's. Bring me that horizon!
10.0~BEST FILM ABOUT PIRATES...EVER!!! eamon-hennedy Sign in Permalink That's right. This is the best film about pirates and the high seas. Everything here works, this is the most perfect summer slice of blockbuster escapism that has emerged in a long time. High brow critics may bulk, but this is not meant to be a film that is all about characterization and emotion, it's meant to be fun, fun and fun and we get a lot of it. First of all, Johnny Depp is great. The surprising thing about it is, he seems well suited to being in a blockbuster film, more so that I thought before, and even more surprising is that his role as Jack Sparrow isn't the type that is taking advantage of his movie star good looks. Here is has dirty teeth, rag tag long hair and is playing basically a crook, but a lovable one of course. His performance is perfect, from his mannerisms, the slurred speech and the Keith Richards like accent, he should definitely be a favorite for the Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. The rest of the cast are well filled out too, with Orlando Bloom magnificent as the straight man Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is very lovely as the damsel in distress and finally Geoffrey Rush is great as the evil villain with a nice sideline in comedy. The script is surprisingly witty here, but coming from the writers of Shrek, this isn't surprising. It's not high art, but the script is a wonderful adventure laced with magnificent humor. Gore Verbinski as director handled the material rather well, which is a surprise. As the director of The Ring and Mousehunt, I wasn't sure if he were the right choice to be doing this film, especially considering that it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but alas, I wouldn't be surprised after this effort if Verbinski joins Michael Bay and Tony Scott in the esteemed list of Bruckheimer directors. Of course the special effects are brilliant also. The sequences involving the dastardly crew of the Black Pearl turning into skeletons (the CGI monkey is terrifically well realized) are amongst some of the best special effects of 2003, while the shot of all the pirates of the Black Pearl walking on the ocean floor is spine tingling. Overall this is a fantastic film and ranks as one of the best blockbusters to have emerged from this decade so far.
10.0~You better start believing in ghost stories, because you are in one. vamsyajay-1 Sign in Permalink This is my all time favorite Hollywood movie. This movie came in the time when I used to watch very low number of English movies. I came across the trailer but I knew nothing about the Disney ride, or Johnny depp or nothing about the concept. So I let it pass by thinking it as some other stereo type Hollywood horror pic. Years passed by trailers of third part of the franchise are coming, then i got interested and downloaded the movie and watched it. God, I felt great, I'm so spellbound by what I watched, the action, comedy, concept I liked everything in the movie. There are stories called chandamama kadhalu in my native language like these, this is one of it kind, so well made, till now i had watched this movie more than 50 times, and i'll keep watching it when ever i got bored.
9.0~Witty and Humorous Adventure alexmap Sign in Permalink This is a nice and clever film. It keeps the spectator interested from beginning to the end. It has tasteful humor and lots of action. The romance, although somewhat trivial, is nicely staged and the character played by Johny Depp steals the performance. This is an, all in all, very good movie to see.
10.0~A swashbuckling joy for every fan of classic film kadi1329 Sign in Permalink It just goes to show, this movie was created to promote a ride, but it has turned out to be one of the best movies of 2003. Set around 1700, a ship of cursed pirates scour the oceans for a piece of Aztec gold to lift the curse. Their search leads them to Port Royal, a port town, home to the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) and her secret, blacksmith admirer, Will Turner (Bloom). The pirates, lead by the evil, Captain Barbossa (Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in an attempt to break the curse but when Turner finds out, he tries to save her by seeking assistance of the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). The plot is pretty mediocre- the true sparkle of the film is Depp and the wonderful script. Johnny Depp's flamboyant Keith Richards impersonation is fabulous as Sparrow- probably his best role yet. Orlando Bloom is cringe-worthy as 'nerdy' Turner and portrays the character brilliantly- as does Keira Knightly who brings the feminine energy to the rather over masculine film. This is a film that could have easily sunk like the ships in it but it is ridiculously well casted and brilliantly directed. The script is Oscar-worthy, which could be down to Johnny Depp who made many adjustments to his lines. Full of charming, fun characters, convincing special effects, energetic action sequences and an array delightful accents, this film will transport you to sun, sea, sand and a swashbuckling masterpiece.
10.0~above more than excellent freebe1 Sign in Permalink The movie was great. My favorite characters in order are....Will, Elizibeth, and then Jack. I loved Will he was really cute and nice as well as a little funny(Orlando Boom),Jack was really funny and gross but still.....weird(Johny Deep),and Elizibeth was great and sweet and gorgeous yet very proper(Kira Knightly). I really liked the part where Will got hit on the head by the pirate with the glass. The whole movie was really good. I cant wait to see the second. I think Will will come out of his shell a little bit, Jack will get funnier, and Elizibeth will get taught sword fitting. I just hope they make the movie series all the way up to 7, Mab even more than that. I'm truly it's biggest fan.
10.0~The Best of The Best justinmarinelli Sign in Permalink Out of all the Pirates of the Caribbean, THIS IS THE BEST ONE OF ALL! Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, & Geoffrey Rush together- AMAZING!!! Plus, the Attraction itself is my favorite one of all time at any Disney theme park! For those who have not seen any of the Pirate Series, this Film would be the best choice, that I recommend, to see first.
10.0~Best movie! skaterdolphin Sign in Permalink This movie is my favorite movie of all times! It's full of action and is not a scary pirate movie. I have watched it many times and I can't get enough of it. The actors/actresses are great in this movie. Johnny Depp is especially good with his facial expressions. I am eagerly waiting for the release of the second and third movies. I have bought the DVD and the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this movie is also really good and the only soundtrack I have ever bought. In this movie Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) must sail in search of the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth Swann(Kiera Knightly) has been held captive. The Black Pearl is under the control of Captain Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of cursed pirates. This movie has a great plot and is continuously exciting. Also there are many memorable scenes and quotes. If you have not seen this movie then you are missing out on a great movie.
10.0~Depp for Emperor? eak-1 Sign in Permalink I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one? And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney "adventure" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect? And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience... I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen "Pirates" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, "Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?" And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s? I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb? I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins. Except for this year. Go Jack. And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected "money shots" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, "You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey. And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking "overproduced by" credit on the cover-liner. "Bombastic." "Overdone." "Absurdly Stupendous." Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine. Once again, the children were wondering, "What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?" Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, "Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has. At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes. This is not just another "entry" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of "The Wizard of Oz." I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.
1.0~One of the worst movies of all time 20057kmz Sign in Permalink Terrible, repelling and completely unwatchable. It makes the first Mummy look like a masterpiece. Even the visual effects are terrible and ugly to look at. And Johnny Depp's performance was bad in every way. Just because you manage to speak in a way that is hard to understand does not mean it is good acting. What was the Academy thinking have they completely lost their mind. As much as I thought Return of the King was ridiculously overrated after this abomination I am starting to respect it. After such a bad decade of bad and unoriginal movies people must have broken critical fuse and mistaken this atrocity for a great movie. When will James Cameron finally start making movies and resurrect Cinema. A very deserving 1 out of 10.
5.0~Original Music?? I think not!!! smitty7777777 Sign in Permalink I was watching Gladiator the other day and I noticed that in the first battle in the colliseum the music playing sounded really familiar. And then I realized that is in Pirates just changed slightly. It pisses me off that you have to go and steal music from another movie especially since its one of the best movies ever made. Gladiator = KICK ASS Pirates = Music Stealer/not as good as Gladiator So if you think Pirates is good well watch Gladiator instead cause it kicks Pirates ass any day of the week!!!! I mean Johnny Depp was good and all but people make him out to be God in this movie. I'm sick of all the hype and people having orgasisms over these movies. I mean OK they are good we get it already!! Now if you want to see some good acting watch GLADIATOR!!!
4.0~Sinks in its Own Contradictions Bob-45 Sign in Permalink A BRIEF SUMMARY: Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the new island governor, is traveling by ship with her father to their new home. The come upon a ship, ransacked and burned by pirates. Suddenly, Elizabeth spots an unconscious boy, Will Turner, in the water. When Will is brought onto the ship and laid upon the deck, Elizabeth spots a gold medallion around his neck. Fearing the authorities will arrest the boy as a pirate, Elizabeth steals the medallion. Years later, when Will and Elizabeth grow up, they share an adventure involving the medallion, an unearthly pirate crew and `the curse of the Black Pearl'. `All opinions are vanity ' including my own. Well, I guess I better prepare myself to be clobbered once again for trashing a movie `everybody loves'. `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is most illogical movie I've seen since `Lost in Space'. `Lost in Space' at least had three shapely women in body-hugging space suits. PCCBP has Johnny Depp. Johnny has turned in some really good performances (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Ed Wood,' `Sleepy Hollow,' and, especially, `Don Juan DeMarco') but his loose, effete `Jack Sparrow' is more `Captain Morgan' than Captain Kidd. That is, the rum is doing most of the acting. WARNING: SPOILERS Well, let's see, all the crew of the Black Pearl except Jack Sparrow, BUT INCLUDING WILL'S FATHER, have been cursed for stealing Aztec gold. As part of their curse, food turns to ashes; and, while they cannot die, in the moonlight they are clearly rotting corpses. HELLO! If they cannot die, HOW COULD THEY KILL WILL'S FATHER? If they are really rotten corpses, WHY DIDN'T THEY DIE AS SOON AS THE CURSE WAS LIFTED? I can understand why Will wasn't cursed, BUT WHY WASN'T ELIZABETH? Oh, because she did it to save Will, THEN WHY WAS JACK SPARROW CURSED? Oh, because he was Captain of the Black Pearl; DO YOU REALLY THINK A CURSE WOULD BE SO SELECTIVE? I can understand why the Black Pearl crew became rotting corpses when they were cursed. They spent a period of time suffering from starvation and thirst, but WHY DID JACK IMMEDIATELY BECOME A ROTTING CORPSE? Oh yes, I've heard, `Forget the logic and enjoy the fun.' How much fun is there in an adventure movie where the only mortals you care about are so central to the plot you KNOW they cannot be killed? I enjoyed the production values, the music and the performances, but I never forgot this is a BAD pirate movie. If you really want to have fun watching a good pirate movie, see `The Crimson Pirate' or `Swashbuckler.' If you insist on seeing a bad pirate movie, see `Cutthroat Island'. At least it makes sense.
8.0~Pantomine pirates paul2001sw-1 Sign in Permalink 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is a hugely entertaining, comedy-cum-action-cum-horror romp, with Johnny Depp, arguably the finest Hollywood actor of his generation, running riot as Captain Jack Sparrow, reportedly modelled on Keith Richards. In terms of how the film is constructed, the nature of his role is interesting, as there's an almost conventional story without him: a romantic lead, a beautiful, feisty heroine, a love rival and an evil villain account for most of the plot without Sparrow even getting a mention. Sparrow is more like an annoying child than anything, cropping up and getting in the way, pursuing his own ambitions and desires with childish abandon. As is often said, he really is the "world's worst pirate", scarcely meriting being taken seriously; but instead of just being a comic extra, he's actually the film's central character. It's hard to imagine the story working without Depp in the role, but fortunately, it doesn't have to. Sit back and smile.
2.0~fork in eye, knife in concept h-a-r-doolaard Sign in Permalink Yes, dear Disney fans your dreams have come true. Your youth can be prolonged. There is an other formula that will turn the average adult into a giggling teenager. I have seen it happen in a big cinema in my city. Mature folk that went hysterical by the dozen as flying cutlery landed in eyeballs. Please man, stop it! Go see a flick to get out of the daily routine, but please stay a bit critical. Just for the record: These words do not sprout from the mind of a bitter person, but from a bitterly disappointed one. Once again a great concept has been completely overdone in the wrong direction. It has been said before and that does strengthen me to discuss it one more. This genre is weirdly annoying 'the portrayal of gruesome (in this case 18th century buccanic) violence combined with Uncle Walts very own vision on slapstick'. What is the message and who is supposed to be addressed? Is made for big children or for small adults? In one way you might say that in works for those you have a good time watching this film. In an other way I would like to take great distance from exactly those people over 18 that reward this flick with anything over a 4. Hereby I do so, bunch of gullible kid souls. I declare I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. My mistake, 'cause I had wrongfully set my sights on something like Mutiny On The Bounty (1962 and 1984) meets Master And Commander(2003).
10.0~Amazing absolutely Amazing badgerboytc Sign in Permalink Although when thought of a pirate movie was in the making i had my doubts whether it would be a worthwhile movie 1 to watch or 2 to even make, whether or not it was based on a Disney theme park ride or not. But how i was wrong. With none stop brilliant acting throughout and a real smart dialogue with the right amount of humour to not this into a comedy genre movie was ideal. The real show stopper was off course the great Johnny Depp who up to now in my opinion has never played apoor role.The way he move and most definitely talks is perfect and in my opinion no one else could have played the character as good as he, he was seriously a joy to watch. With great help from the all star cast or Bloom, Rush and off course Knightley the film started and ended with absolute flying colours. The best thing in this movie is the way that the zombie pirates of the black pearl are portrayed and in my opinion a bliss to watch. I feel that every one should watch this movie and if they don't should be cursed to being in a zombie state themselves. Ps that last line was a joke.
10.0~Highly entertaining! tmag70 Sign in Permalink I absolutely loved this movie!! Johnny Depp was incredible as Cpt. Jack Sparrow. As with most roles..he makes it his own. If you want a movie with action/adventure, laughs and a bit of romance..then you must see this movie. I can't wait to own it on dvd.
6.0~The blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) attempts to save the governor's daughter in an action packed tale of pirates. doctrNIC Sign in Permalink Far be it from me to judge films like a specialist, but POC is quite an experience. Throughout the film you will obviously notice what makes it good, but perhaps not what makes it fairly appalling. Johnny Depp takes the part of a half maddened pirate who lost his ship years ago and subsequently arrives on an Island whereupon he encounters the blacksmith who has no expression. Keira Knightley is just as poor as her majesty's fellow servant. Luckily, Johnny Depp is so good, you don't notice the other two who are just terrible. All in all, the film is enjoyable, although the story lacks any real twists. How can you guys have rated it 8.1?
7.0~My Journey Through IMDB's Top #250 owenmcalister Sign in Permalink Title - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Date Released (UK) - 19 July 2003 Average Rating at Time of Review - 8.0 Position in IMDB's Top 250 at Time of Review - #248 Directed By - Gore Verbinski Starring - Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Orlando Bloom Plot - Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead. I saw this film many years ago; I imagine it wasn't long after its release. I didn't remember much about it, but I must have enjoyed it as I have watched every other Pirates of the Caribbean movie upon release. Over the years I have (half-heartedly) attempted to watch this film for a second time, but have never felt up to it. Until tonight. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is not a perfect film, it can barely be classed as a great film. In fact, I was surprised to find it holding a spot on the Top 250. Upon watching it, I can understand why - it is an incredibly fun film that had me entertained throughout its runtime, despite its shortcomings and made me want to come back for more. More importantly, it reignited childhood fantasies of sailing and plundering the seven seas. PROS: - The Music: This has to be mentioned. The music in this film is such a huge part of what makes it so enjoyable. It perfectly balances a sense of urgency while still being fun to listen to, enhancing any scene it accompanies. - The Action: I was impressed with how well the action was handled in the film. Watching the trailer will have you believe it is made up of action scenes thrown together in the editing room, littered with quick cuts and close ups. Thankfully, this was not the case. The main point of the action is always in focus and easy to follow and makes the experience much more enjoyable. - The Story: One can imagine when watching that this was never planned as only one movie. What the writers have done with this film is created a world. A world that feels loved in and offers more to explore. There is plenty of foreshadowing of things to come in this and future films of the series, whilst still managing to make an entertaining, standalone pirate adventure. CONS: - The Acting: I know that the film doesn't take itself too seriously and it embraces that, which I can appreciate. However, barring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, I found a lot of the acting and character interactions to be stiff and hollow with no real gravitas to the words being spoken. - Character Development: Character Development is important to me, especially if I'm to be invested in these characters and their fates. This is why I was let down when none of the characters develop in any significant way over the course of the film and when they do, it feels shoe-horned in for plot purposes. I find though, that both of those cons can be forgiven; as I mentioned, the film doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't ask to be. What it does do is offer a wholly entertaining, thrilling ride through a world and society long-lost to us. A world that hadn't had the greatest luck in the film industry. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with these characters and this world and look forward to visiting again with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest.
10.0~Excellent film, excellent performance by Johnny Depp. xbabe82517 Sign in Permalink I didn't see this film at the cinema, but I really wish I had because it has instantly become one of my favourite movies of all time. I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humour. What I usually find with movies that contain a lot of special effects is that they rely largely on them to get ratings. That may work for some but not for me, and this movie impressed me so much because despite the effects being absolutely amazing - I can't fault them - they don't overshadow the characters. All the actors were brilliant, but Johnny Depp really surprised me because Jack Sparrow is unlike any character he's ever played before, yet he played it so fantastically. I just thought he had so much charm and wit, yet you can still see the genuine human emotions and can really feel for him when **SPOILER! SPOILER!** he is once again stranded on the desert island. There is also excellent chemistry between the lead characters, especially Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) even though **SPOILER! SPOILER!** Elizabeth is romantically involved with the other male lead character, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). I think this movie would have been successful without Johnny Depp, but his performance is exceptional and I personally think he made it what it is. His facial expressions, mannerisms and quirky comments are just hilarious and fascinating to watch. In my opinion, Depp should have an award for this performance. This is my favourite Disney film of all time, absolutely fantastic in every way. 10 out of 10!
7.0~Delivers the goods jmartinsson Sign in Permalink "Pirates" is a fun adventure film that breaks out of its "based on a Disneyland ride" chains and delivers a near-perfect summer family blockbuster. The film is aided tremendously by the casting, especially Depp and Geoffrey Rush. All of the performances are very good, and it adds immeasurably to the quality of the film. The production is also very well done, right up to the great visual effects. However, one let down was the music, which features a pounding quality heard in many Bruckheimer action films. The characters are brought to life with the skill of the "Indiana Jones" or "Harry Potter" movies, yet somehow the overall film seems to be just a few notches of "The Mummy" and "Tomb Raider" movies. Unlike the latter movies, however, it seems a sequel or two could really help lift "Pirates" out of that same category and into the heights reached by "Indiana Jones". The verdict: about as good of a summer blockbuster as could be hoped for.
10.0~Pirates of the Screen cobra-8 Sign in Permalink It really does steal the screen! This is, without doubt, my favourite movie of all time. It was brilliantly written, performed, filmed, and put together. I cannot work out the mystery of why critics gave it such bad reviews. The special effects were excellent, as well. I was very choked that it did not get a single Oscar award. I especially couldn't believe that Return of the King got best Makeup over it. I saw NO makeup in that (the Orcs were people wearing masks), and then in Pirates, in come Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in spectacular makeup. I certainly think that Johnny should have gotten "Best Actor" for Jack Sparrow rather than Sean Penn. A great movie for all pirate lovers out there, and well - any movie lover out there.
10.0~Forget the potty break aliceinfairyland Sign in Permalink I saw this movie 4 times in the theater, and since I didn't have a DVD player when it was released for the home, I bought the VHS tape. Only to buy the DVD when I got a player for Christmas. I have not regretted any of the money I spent on this movie. Yes, I feel Johnny Depp has been robbed of both the Golden Globe award, and the BAFTA, for Best Actor. No one else could have played this character with as much swish and buckle. Hopefully the Academy of Motion Pictures will find it in their hearts to be just and do the right thing. The special effects were so well blended with the CGI. Seamless and smooth, the skeleton crew and swordfight between Jack and Barbossa awed and amazed me. The script was witty and smart, never playing down to the audience and making us feel like idiots. These writers deserved to be nominated too. And while I did notice some minor continuity faults for the most part, most of this stuff made sense through and through. This is a movie worth seeing on the big screen at $9 a pop and worth buying at $25 a video. A must see, must own. And truly one of this summer's highlights.
8.0~Exactly what action entertainment should be NateW Sign in Permalink There is a large group of candidates, but Pirates of the Caribbean gets the vote for my favorite movie of the year thus far. I love everything about it and it still entertains me after more than half a dozen viewings. There's incredible swashbuckling action, hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, and delightful performances all around. The star of the show is the always reliable Johnny Depp, who turns in a career best performance as the seedy but lovable Jack Sparrow. He takes turns chewing scenery with Geoffrey Rush, who is perfectly over-the-top as Captain Barbosa. The supporting cast is great as well, but Depp and Rush leave them in the dust. If you haven't seen PotC yet, do so. It's the most fun you'll have from a single movie this year, and probably many years for that matter.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean laura_237 Sign in Permalink I recently watched Pirates of the Caribbean again and it was great.The cast is brilliant and Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was hilarious.Hes so good at the part.Keira Knightly was excellent too and Orlando Bloom(whom my big sister is madly in love with)was good too.(I prefer Johnny)A great film which deserves heaps more of awards.I can't wait for Pirates of the Caribbean 2:dead mans chest to come out.I will be first in the ticket line at my local cinema to see it.It is great.Excellent and i hoped so much Johnny Depp would get the Oscar for his role in Pirates of the Caribbean.It was such a shame he didn't win.He should have as i adore him.
8.0~A Comparative Look at the Series - Part 1: The Black Pearl kdavies-69347 Sign in Permalink I wanted to go back and watch the series as a whole, and comparatively speaking 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' is by far the best in the series. When compared to the other films in the series, this one shines brightest. The plot is quite simplistic when compared to the other 'Pirates' films, but it doesn't get muddled in its own story. It's a love story at its heart, between a privileged daughter of a Governor of one of the many Caribbean islands (Keira Knightley), and an orphaned apprentice of the local Blacksmith (Orlando Bloom). There is a sense of history between them goes back to childhood, and is a very strong bond between both, which becomes the main driving force behind the events in Part 1. The pirates have a real sense of danger about them, and are just as dangerous and evil looking when they are in or out of their ghoulish form. and I think most will be surprised at the level of violence (off screen that is) which this movie contains. The first entry into the series introduces us to the most pivotal character in the series; Captain Jack Sparrow, and is by far one of Johnny Depp's best creations. A perfect blend of heroism, ineptitude, and just a hint of madness. He brought such a unique character to life, and it is very easy to believe that you need to be somewhat crazy to be a successful pirate. From the very introduction to the character to his last scene in the series, you know that there is something off about him. Every single interaction, every little quip has a real sense of improvisation, about it, as though everything that happens around him is more of a nuisance to deal with, rather than a consequence of his own actions. The remaining characters are very much real in this single minded drives. Elizabeth swan as the damsel in distress, William turner as a driven hero willing to stop at nothing to get to the women he loves, and of course Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) who is evil to his core and willing to stop at nothing to relieve the curse upon him and his crew (but mostly for himself). Although shorter than the other movies in the series, this one is by far the best, without stretching the story too thin or becoming to convoluted in plot devices. It is in many ways a cleaner and simpler story. A great film from beginning to end with just the right blend of love, adventure and magic. 8/10
5.0~OK but too cartoonish for me Hang_All_Drunkdrivers Sign in Permalink A bunch of pirates have been cursed and need the blood of a certain individual to break the curse. They end up chasing two englishpersons, Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley, and Will played by Orland Bloom. Helping them out is the good guy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow played by Depp. Depp gives an energetic performance to be sure but this movie goes way over the top with outrageous scenes and dialogue that would never happen in real life. I love action-adventure movies and I wish the producers had taken this show seriously and left out all the slapstick. There's even a running gag about a pirate with a glass eye.
9.0~Great film, would recommend it to anyone. alexjonlin Sign in Permalink I thought Pirates of the Caribbean was a great film.It was very well put together and had a great plot. It had great scenery and props. The actors were perfect for there parts. They had just the right accents and the right looks. I would DEFINITELY recommend this film to anyone.
9.0~The Epic of all Pirate films...brilliant, a classic for certain Robert_duder Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean I think came as a surprise to a lot of people. Had Hollywood gone too far...basing a film on an amusement park ride??!! Slapping a 150 million dollar budget on it and putting huge stars in the mix?? Well it wasn't a mistake and Disney knocked one out of the park with this incredible swashbuckling adventure that completely invigorates the "Pirate" film, not that I can think of any others at the moment. Pirates is possibly one of the greatest adventure films I've ever sat through. Completely unashamed of it's 2 1/2 hour time frame and although still to this die hyped as a kids movie it's pretty brutally violent at times with freaky undead pirates and plenty of sword play and guns blazing. Director Gore Verbinski creates this entire Caribbean world with all this legend and lore and it just draws you into it's people and places and the adventure ahead of them. It is non stop adventure!! On top of all this is a guaranteed cinema classic character...the one, the only Oscar Nominated performance of Captain Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. How can you sum up Captain Jack Sparrow, he's an anti-hero...not quite a good guy, tries very hard to be a bad guy but also has a very high moral standard according to the Pirate Code. One of the great lines in the film is when they think Jack is screwing up an attempt at stealing a ship and a naval office comments "That has to be the worst pirate I've ever seen.." and then tides change and they realize Jack has duped them and taken off with their ship and the same officer exclaims moments later "That has to be the best Pirate I've ever seen.." Depp brings the character of Sparrow to life in a way I've rarely seen. Jack Sparrow is a brilliant, vibrant, fun, hilarious, tough hero with such a unique personality. If for no other reason he makes this film and Depp IS Sparrow and deserved that Oscar nod for this. Orlando Bloom is the young handsome swashbuckler/blacksmith who gets involved in this adventure over the love of a woman. Bloom plays young William Turner who doesn't realize he is the son of a famous Pirate. Bloom who I often find rather drab and low brow seems to make that work for him in many roles and this is no exception. He still manages to be subtly vibrant and him and Depp play such an incredible duo playing off each other in action scenes and comedy all at once. This is the pirate version of a buddy cop movie and Bloom and Depp are perfect together. Bloom's performance is in many ways the exact opposite of Depp's Sparrow and it works wonderfully. He is the perfect hero...handsome, in love, quiet and strong. Keira Knightley is the lovely Elizabeth Swann, daughter of the Governor and a bit of a dreamer when it comes to adventure and pirates. Secretly in love with William Turner she is being promised to another man who is a "better match." Knightley is terrific as Swann because she is as strong a character as any of the male leads. She holds her own against all of them and her character is feisty, strong and holds her own in battle. She does all this while still appearing lady like as to the time of the film. The absolutely phenomenal Geoffrey Rush plays Captain Barbossa, Jack Sparrow's brutally evil nemesis who has stole his ship and crew from him but has been cursed by a treasure. Barbossa is Captain Hook with a shot of evil in him. He's brutal and convincing and Rush is brilliant. Him and Depp have terrific chemistry as enemies and he is a great adversary and probably one of the best movie villains of all time. The chemistry and performance between these four actors make this film as brilliant as it could be. Add into that an absolutely stunning story and script that mixes true action with laugh out loud comedy, physical stunts and special effects. Being a huge anti-fan of CGI I was a little disappointed with the hokey look of the undead Pirate Crew, I think they could have done more with good old fashion special effects. The crew looks clunky and fake when they are CGI'd out but even still it doesn't ruin the film by any means. Adults will love this just as much as kids if kids should even see it. There is plenty of the good guys specifically the English Navy who die at the hands of pirates and the pirates are pretty brutal as well and there are some really creepy scenes and I think adults will love this one!! Don't let the Disney stamp scare you away because you can't get adventure better then this one...I guarantee it...savvy?? 9/10
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the black pearl. dobbin-4 Sign in Permalink Now let me get this straight I do not particularly like Pirate movies and I despise most Pirate movies but this movie was really something. It was sure funny thats for sure, it had good action and a sweet plot to match but the thing that made the movie great for me was Johny Depp I have never seen a funnier pirate then Captain Jack Sparrow he made the movie about twice as good. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also did pretty well and the movie also had sweet special effects which is needed in Pirate movies. Overall I rate this movie high and it has become my favourite pirate movie ever so I rate this movie really solidly at a 98% because of none other then Johnny Depp. So go Pirates.
10.0~Perfect in every way Blobbybrew2 Sign in Permalink This is masterpiece. Jonny Depp is just the best pirate there could have been. He is witty, slightly charming and a ferocious sword fighter. This is a film for all ages and all ages would enjoy it! It has the lot: Sword fights, an evil pirate captain, treasure and a terrible curse. Orlando Bloom is a good choice for a shy, handsome, young blacksmith, who falls for the governor's beautiful daughter (Keria Knightly), who is eyed by the more respected Comodor Norrington (Jack Davenport). This is ideal for family entertainment. A funny, exiting and enjoyable film 10 out of 10
10.0~Bravo! Two Thumbs up! Future_Film_Director Sign in Permalink This is one of the best pirate movies you will see in a long while. That is until they make the sequel. Pirates of the Caribbean, is an action adventure film with a great cast and a wonderful story line. It starts in Port Royal, Jamaica. Where Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by a crew of cursed pirates. Right before the kidnapping a pirate by the name of Jack Sparrow comes into town looking to commandeer a ship. Sparrow agrees to team up with Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner in search of Elizabeth. But what Will does not know is that Jack is linked to the kidnapping and the cursed pirates in more ways than one. To find out the rest, see the movie! A must see for all adventure lovers and Johnny Depp fans of course! Take my word, a great movie. My rating is an A!.
10.0~Johnny Depp Perfect!!! jtindahouse Sign in Permalink Magnificent! I will start off with the one problem so that I can end by thrashing it with compliments: Too long. If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp.
8.0~Great old fashioned action movie CharltonBoy Sign in Permalink Although Pirates of the Caribbean is not a film likely to win acadamy awards this is a film that you really cant find fault with. The story is fairly simple , a little like a fairy tale , which gives it charm.The cast is magnifiscent. Jeffrey Rush is superb as the baddie as is Johnny Depp as the comic hero. What is good to see is that he seems to have mastered the English accent unlike in the film 'From Hell'and he is charming with it. This film reminds me a little of Jason and The Argonaults but with more humour and recommend if you have not seen it do so. 8 out of 10.
9.0~A pirates life for me ryanskywalker-87402 Sign in Permalink A fascinating blend of action, adventure, comedy, horror & fantasy, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliantly scripted, skilfully directed & cleverly narrated cinema that paints an interesting portrait of pirates mythology on the film canvas like never before and is also notable for bringing to life one of the most iconic characters of 21st century cinema. The story of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl follows the quest of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow who teams up with a talented blacksmith, Will Turner, to rescue the latter's love, Elizabeth Swann, who's been taken hostage on the notorious pirate ship, Black Pearl, which is commanded by the feared Captain Barbossa and carries a crew of cursed men who were once Jack's allies. Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean brims with an energetic & creative vibe which keeps the story refreshing throughout its runtime, doesn't take much time to get its main plot moving, and with its firm grip on refined storytelling ends up infusing a new life into the pirates genre. The screenplay handles its different genres with remarkable ease and also exhibits a fine balance between its various elements. The production design team does a stellar job with its period sets & meticulously designed ships. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera to capture each sequence in fine detail, use of colour palette is quite splendid and the expertly staged camera angles & movements make its story all the more captivating. Even the Costumes are pretty much in tune with the depicted timeline, and the work in make-up department is no slouch either. Editing is undoubtedly one of its strongest highlights for it never allows the viewers to settle down, keeps the adventurous tone alive & kicking all the way from start to finish, and paces its 143 minutes of story amazingly well. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff which blends into the narrative quite seamlessly. The background score is composed by Klaus Badelt and is an absolute delight that enhances the whole experience by a great deal with its pulsating tracks. Coming to the performances, Pirates of the Caribbean features an awesome cast in Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley and they all manage to leave their mark, one way or another. Depp makes Jack Sparrow completely his own for it's his added inputs only which gives his character a unique look & edge over the others, and there isn't one scene where he isn't the show-stealer. Rush also impresses a lot with his crazy take on Captain Barbossa, while Bloom & Knightley deliver good performances in their given roles. On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a powerhouse of action, spectacle & humour that's loaded with all the ingredients one requires to make a great blockbuster, which it is in every sense of the word. A work of ingenious craftsmanship that packs in a whole lot of fun, absolutely nails its comic timing, wonderfully balance all its aspects, delivers an entertainment worth your time & money, and is a highly enjoyable, unforgettable & swashbuckling ride that presents Johnny Depp at the pinnacle of his talents while permanently engraving Captain Jack Sparrow into the annals of cinema & pop culture.
10.0~One of the best movies i've ever seen! x_pri_x Sign in Permalink This movie is one of the best ones i have ever seen, in my top five along with movies like Shakespeare in love, sleepless in Seattle and ladder 49. Not only was Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as Jack Sparrow, but he was irresistibly hot as well! The plot seemed unbelievable and slightly cartoony on first sight, but when it was transformed into a movie it developed into one of the most entertaining and engaging stories of the year, even my lifetime! Johnny Depp was hilarious as the eccentric Jack Sparrow, and i am looking forward A LOT to the second and third movies not only to watch two more wonderful plots unfold, but i can't wait to see Captain Jack Sparrow's cheeky smile again...and i can't wait to see him run like a chicken who lost control of his wings again either. The plot of this movie is complemented further by the compositions of Klaus Badelt, one of the first things i noticed while i was sitting in the cinema. The original score that the rest of the music was based upon was pure musical genius! Basically, Pirates of the Caribbean is Brilliant!
10.0~Fun movie with great acting whatsthepointofyou Sign in Permalink I think that this movie could possibly be up there in my top 5.or even top 3. i think Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffry Rush is also excellent. This film is fun, fast and entertaining. Everyone must see it!
7.0~2.5h well spent. hakko504 Sign in Permalink Well, the script is barely above average, acting OK and the special effects are very well made. The person who did the casting though has to get some extra credit. Bloom and Depp complements each other perfectly, giving this movie the little extra that actually makes it something to watch out for. Sometimes quite funny, but I suspect that they will not pass the test of time, and a second watching of the movie might not be quite as enjoyable. The action scenes are of good quality, about what you'd expect from a modern movie after watching the remake of Zorro starring Bandeiras/Hopkins. Don't go to this movie and expect to see something new though, the parts have all been done before, and most of the time better than what you'd get here. The combination is new though, and as the genre of swashbuckling isn't very common in modern movies you will find some fresh elements still in this movie so I'd say that if you enjoyed the aforementioned Zorro (which I rated 9/10), you'll find this a pleasant experience. My vote on Pirates of the Caribbean: 7/10
7.0~excellent Depp p_hytych Sign in Permalink I would like to say, that I did not expected anything special from this "movie of Disney production". It is not a very best piece of art, but it is piece of art. I think, and I tell it to everybody with which I talk about films, that film is a kind of art. It is in essence a theater piece fashioned with modern digital effects and sounds and music. It is art and it is hard to say, that it is just good or bad. But shortly: this movie is family movie and story is very simple. Characters are not preciously described, but every "holes" are counterbalanced by Johny Depp's acting (and Rush). Without Depp it would be a little boring movie, but with him it is fun to see it even twice or more. In this category (family "fairytale" movie) it is very amusing.
8.0~Welcome to the Caribbean! KvMauB Sign in Permalink What great fun this movie is! It is in this spirit of fun that I base my high esteem for this excellent, entertaining movie and consider it one of my favorites that I will watch over and over. It is funny, exciting, ahem, er.... sexy, and adventurous escapist fun! It is not meant to be authentic or seriously considered (against the likes of Master and Commander). Rather, it is grand art of a different sort. The key element in this film that made it superior to other pirate fantasy films is the casting. I thought both Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush were magnificent! It is their endlessly entertaining, outstanding performances that made Pirates of the Caribbean into an instant classic that is very repeatedly viewable. Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Jonathan Pryce and all the rest of the cast were all great also. When I was 8 my father took me to Disneyland for the first time. Although I was apprehensive at first (seeing the talking skull and dropping down through darkness into the caverns in a boat), I ended up loving the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and wanted to ride it again and again! This movie perfectly evoked that same feeling and reaction... creepy apprehension turning into fun adventure and humor... jolly family fun. The various references to the Disneyland ride in the movie just thrilled me. I wholeheartedly recommend it!
10.0~So good!! SnowLeopardMaster Sign in Permalink This movie was awesome. Just plain awesome. While the plot can be, and sometimes is, quite confusing, the effects were brilliant given it was 2003, with the 'Skeleton crew' scene being one of the best things I have ever seen in a movie. It also manages to perfectly balance itself between being humorous and action packed. Usually, movies tend to lean too far over to one side, but this one manages to be downright hilarious at times, such as when Elizabeth and Sparrow get drunk on an island and dance in circles around a fire singing 'a pirate's life for me' and also exciting and suspenseful, like during the sea battle. At times, it is also kind of scary, so well done for that. 'Skeleton crew' was a very scary scene, and so was 'underwater attack' in which Barbosa's skeleton warriors march along the bottom of the sea to get at the imperial ships. The musical scores are awesome, and really well done. In total, this is an amazing, very exciting and fun movie that's definitely worth watching.
5.0~A chick flick jeff_joseph1 Sign in Permalink A boring movie based on an amusement park ride. This chick flick features all the stuff the sighs and droopy eyes can muster: Swashbuckling sword scenes (yawn), Romantic goo-goo eyes (yawn), and 40 year-old dream boat Johnny Depp, doing a lousy job of faking an English accent.......
9.0~Loved it kaytmay411321 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was an excellent movie with everything a movie should have to entertain. It was action, humor, love, and a s great story line. Even the music is exciting. I highly recommend this film to anyone, whether they are 9 or 90...it has something to offer everyone. The acting was stupendous, the story was exciting, and throughout the movie I was glad to be watching it and when I was done watching, I wanted to see it again and again. I am very excited about the 2nd Pirates of the Caribbean to come out in July and I'm sure even the 3rd one in 2007 will have just as much to offer. My only fear is that this trilogy will be become mindless like so many others have(Mission Impossible.)But with a cast like Johnny Deep and Orlando Bloom, I doubt it will go south.
6.0~Visually stunning but ultimately the usual Bruckheimer tosh. favero Sign in Permalink I've got to admit this is one of the most disappointing films I saw this year. It was nothing more than a two hour pantomime, featuring some credible acting talent. Has Depp been watching the BBC's "Stella Street", as he has an uncanny likeness to Keith Richard's character in the show. He's probably the best actor in the film as well. Bloom was wasted. Rush was surprisingly not evil or nasty enough. The supporting cast was decent enough including some stand out performances from the British actors. The only people I can see enjoying this sort of tosh is children and underdeveloped adults. Can they be making a sequel. Please God no save us the pain. a generous 6/10, mostly for set design/costume and special fx.
8.0~An entertaining action-adventure danjakubik Sign in Permalink "The Pirates of The Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl", 2003 Directed by: Gore Verbinski * * * Viewed: September 30, 2010 The first chapter of what was to be a successful trilogy, is an entertaining, big scale adventure film, loaded with action and visual effects. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, gives an impressive performance in the film, complete with accent, energy and mannerisms. The film, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, is longer than usual, for it's genre of action/adventure. The film moves along at an energetic pace, and considering the scale of it's story, does not feel overly long. The story concerns pirate Captain Jack Sparrow's return from exile and meeting up by chance, with the owner of a fabled pirate medallion, believed to have the power to help lift an old deadly "curse of the black pearl". Technically, the film delivers, along with Johnny Depp's acting performance. One should not expect much from the story however, as it was inspired by a Disney Land theme park attraction. The story is a blend of action, adventure, fantasy and humor. I imagine, humor was added to lighten up the film as a whole and provide additional entertainment value, while not frightening it's targeted young audience too much. The somewhat solid story has some convenient plot points to move things along, but there is a large cast of characters: heroes and villains, to help keep things interesting. Keep watching until the end of the closing credits, for a sneak preview of the story set up, for the next film in the trilogy. The real stars of this film: Director Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp and the technical/effects crew.
8.0~Amusement Ride Disney Expansion DKosty123 Sign in Permalink This is the first time an amusement park ride got a movie. This one has one main reason it succeeds - the casting of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. His character is fresh and ready to go in this one. Granted Orlando Bloom is a good counter balance to Depp but it is Sparrow whose the Pirate that stirs the action. When this strong entry came out, it was very popular. It incorporates a few of the ride features with the action, but for the most part it goes into it's own world. Walt Disney's imagination really is the anchor for this film. The PG rating holds the Pirates into a more family oriented format theme the real ones, but that is okay. We have enough real pirates keel holing our lives anyhow. This escape is a welcome refuge from them. This film re-invents the role of women damsels being in attractive distress but not needing to take off their clothes to get the desired effect. The big success is the classic triangle between 2 men interested in the same damsel. That works well here too. When this came out, I was surprised by the length of the film, but pleased with the results. This is the best one still in the series. Yo Ho Ho and a broken compass to ye mates.
10.0~***1/2 Stars Okonh0wp Sign in Permalink Pirate lovers have been waiting for a movie like this since the days of `Waterworld' and `Cutthroat Island.' Set in Port Royal, an island historically associated with pirates, and based on a Disney world ride, the movie follows Orlando Bloom as a sword smith with a dark past, who enlists the help of famed pirate (Depp) to rescue the object of his affections (Knightly). To go in more detail would take hours because, unfortunately the plot's long-winded and has more twists and turns than one can keep up with in one sitting. Nevertheless, while Pirates veers into the basic formulas and clichés of any other pirate movie, it does so with purpose and style, to make a quality ride out of a familiar outing. The movie also has some truly original elements, most notably Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow, a name you'll remember long after you see this movie.
8.0~Very, very enjoyable manzoorulhassan Sign in Permalink I'm really sorry that I missed this one on the big screen and watched it on DVD (on my 35" TV). I can only imagine how much more entertaining the movie must have been in the theater. Even though I had already heard enough positive comments about "Curse of the Black Pearl", I must say that I had not expected to enjoy it as much as I did. It had almost the perfect proportion of comedy, romance, adventure and. . . . surprise. The special effects, visual and sound were great (and I'm sorry I didn't watch it in the theater). I'm not sure if I will actually get the DVD (I only watched it for the very first time last nite), but I am quite tempted. Anyway, I also just found out that there is going to be a sequel coming out in 2005. Can't wait for it.
9.0~The best pirate film of all time alindsay-al Sign in Permalink This film is one of those that changed the landscape for film and because of its success the pirate genre is nothing but The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The story sees the undead crew of the Black pearl attempt to lift their curse by kidnapping the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann and her possessions. So old friend Will Turner and the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow attempt to rescue her for their own needs. For starters Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow has become a legendary partnership and the performance is phenomenal and unfortunately for Depp it is so good and legendary it has consumed his acting career, but in this film he is amazing. The supporting class is great as well Keira Knightly as Elizabeth was a good choice as she is passive because of her status and also heroic and aggressive when she needs to be, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner was another great choice as he is a great foil for Sparrow and is possibly the character to connect with most. Whereas Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa is a fantastic Villain and is truly evil and a great fit and foil for Sparrow. Now the one weakness possibly in this film is that the story is quite basic and predictable as it goes but this isn't a huge detriment to the film but stops it from being a 10. The script is phenomenal especially with Jack sparrow but everybody truly gets a moment to shine. The style is also really good with the epic pirates theme song, the stylised awesome fights and the undead visuals. However, the style of some of the comedy is off a little bit but not enough to take down the overall quality of the film as this is a truly fantastic film that will be tough to better for pirate films.
9.0~Adventure for everyone! tastyworm Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film that was created from Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean amusement at Disney World in Florida. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a humorous, egotistical, unpredictable pirate, who is attempting to catch the Black Pearl'  a pirate ship `with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that hell itself spat him back out'. After saving the Governor's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) from drowning, Sparrow is arrested as a pirate and taken to jail where he awaits the gallows. In search of lost Cortez gold, the Black Pearl and a motley crew of pirates (led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)) raid the town and kidnap Elizabeth. The blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), in love with Elizabeth springs Sparrow from jail in return for his help in tracking down the Black Pearl and saving Elizabeth. Depp's own quirkiness brings Captain Jack Sparrow to life, continuing his tradition of portraying rather unusual roles. Bloom and Knightly play their roles wonderfully, while Rush, so versatile in his character portrayal, presents himself as an enjoyable bad guy' to watch. Pirates of the Caribbean  Curse of the black pearl was filmed on location around St. Vincent and the Grenadines, providing a spectacular backdrop of crystal clear blue waters and picturesque islands. The special effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic and as usual, blend into the live-action seamlessly. Merge all of this together with the wonderful musical score by Hans Zimmer (who created the music for Gladiator and numerous other films) and you have a really enjoyable experience. Obviously you can't have a film about cursed pirates without a little horror, and although most violence is implied and not shown in this film, this is the first Disney film ever, to be rated PG-13 in the United States, and M in Australia. This film is definitely a fun, adventurous family film, but some children under fourteen may find the occasional scene within this film disturbing.
10.0~skill and talent made it wonderfull freakyfundevil Sign in Permalink It was on of the best movies i saw in 2003. It was way beyond my imagination when i first saw the poster. Johnny Depp was to stunning for words and so were the others . I think Johnny Depp really deserves an award for his great acting skills.I loved the way the bad people were on the deck of the ship and were scaring Elizabeth Swann. My favorite line of the film was "Not all treasures silver and gold mate ....." and " me I am dishonest............................" both said by the very talented Jack sparrow that is Johnny Depp. The fighting was cool and awsome . My family had a great time watching it especially my bro and me and i would really say this film is worth a watch. I really loved it, east or west Pirates of the Caribbean is the best.
10.0~The ride's good.....the film's better! uds3 Sign in Permalink As has been correctly stated in piecemeal form, Bruckheimer simply got it all right with this one. He went back to basics, hired the best in the business and came up with pure escapist entertainment that works on every level. THE ROCK with an eye patch! Didn't hurt his cause either, that Johnny Depp handed in this once-in-a-career performance as Master Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow - part cockney, part Gilbert Grape, all Rock-Star - the most endearing rogue this side of the Jolly Roger! Geoffrey Rush's turn as Barbossa, a supernatural `Captain Hook' gone feral and swapping his parrot for an occasionally digitised monkey-with-attitude is given arguably his best role since Helfgott! Bloom also does just that.Erroll Flynn coming along nicely! Meanwhile, the painfully corsetted Miss Knightley balances the film's romantic interest, Elizabeth Swann, beautifully - somewhere between Ripley and GI Jane.Toss in a truly great script that bridges the gulf so well between pirate chatter and teenage attention-span and you're looking at a seriously brilliant off the wall two and whatever hours of cornball whimsy that wouldn't put a harmful psychological dent in a five year old's psyche. Depp drops one-liners that are funny as all hell (`Stop putting holes in my ship'). The production work, costuming, action sequences and set-design are cutting edge. What we have here is a multi-dimensional `lost-boys' loose in a candy shop. It's a buddy movie, a romantic comedy, an actioner and always at its heart, tasteful family-orientated entertainment. Bruckheimer has tossed everyone's juvenile pirate fantasies into a blender and poured out this tribute to childhood memory and screen decency. Great ending also that does justice to what preceded it. Reminded me very much of another rollickingly good-time action-fest from Sam Raimi that co-incidentally was also top heavy with some seriously aggro skeletal miscreants - ARMY OF DARKNESS. `Hail to the King baby!'
4.0~Average Disney adventure rob-236 Sign in Permalink Average action adventure Disney yarn is watchable mainly due to good performances by Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and the lovely Keira Knightley. It's the tale of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, once captained by the eccentric Depp, whose new captain  Geoffrey Rush is looking for a pirate medallion that ends up in the hands of Knightley, the daughter a rich governor (Jonathan Pryce). Throw in Bloom as the dashing hero with a sketchy past and a major crush on Knightley, and you've got yourself a special effects ridden harmless piece of entertainment. Downsides are too many silly additional characters, who will only be of interest to very young viewers, and at 143 minutes, its far too long - they could have cut out about half an hour of footage off at least. Nice to see a fairly original idea through, although I hear it is based on a computer game(?) or something (I may be wrong), instead of the countless sequels that have cluttered up the cinemas over the past year or so. ..saying that, no doubt there will be a `Pirates of the Caribbean 2' through, sooner rather than later!!
10.0~The Best Movie EVER Blinded_By_The_Light Sign in Permalink Well, to sum it all up this is my FAVORITE movie of all time. It appeals to a wide range of people from kids to adults it has something for everyone. It never speaks down to its audience and the script is pure genius. The characters are so well developed that you feel that you have known them all your life. Johnny Depp however, is the pride of this film. He shines through as the mischievous, and mysterious, Captain Jack Sparrow. His acting skills are amazing as he creates a character that is surely the most memorable pirate to ever sail the Spanish Main. It is BRILLIANT, the movie never slows, never bores its audience. I am sure you can now see why this is my favorite movie.
9.0~Go Johnny go! fluffyclown Sign in Permalink When I first heard that Disney was making a film based on the ride, "Pirates of the Caribbean," I was excited. This was by far my favorite ride at Disneyland as a child. I could just imagine the swashbuckling hero battling the pirates and saving the fair maiden. And sure enough, Disney delivered. I loved this movie. My favorite part of this movie was: an actor. Johnny Depp. The man is a master. Even with his slurred speech, matted hair, and half black/half gold teeth, I was amazed at how sexy a character can become when Johnny Depp is bringing him to life. I have seen this film four times now, and every time I sit impatiently until Johnny first appears on his sinking ship. Then I am glued to the screen for the rest of the film. Now I'm not saying that the rest of the cast wasn't good. Kiera Knightly was absolutely beautiful, and Orlando Bloom is as cute as he was in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But I was just completely captivated by Johnny Depp in this film. I can't think of any other actor that could have filled the shoes of Captain Jack Sparrow with such life and zeal. So bravo, Johnny! I can't wait for the sequel. Rank: 9
10.0~Absolutely brilliant cast, great film! giusisalvi Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. I saw it at the cinema with my best friend some years ago. I remember that I was skeptical and I didn't want to go. I usually don't like pirates and adventure stories. But I have to admit that I was very much involved. It was very exciting from the beginning! It's an adventure /fantasy film. What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done. Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this character. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view. Geoffrey Rush played Barbarossa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people. A great adventure. Well played sword-fighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book. Absolutely recommend!
9.0~Must watch movie internetfuncity Sign in Permalink The only way the crew of the Black Pearl can lift the curse upon them is to return a golden Aztec coin to its treasure chest. But that coin is currently hanging around the lovely neck of British Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann Year after year, lazy poster quotes try to convince audiences that the latest blockbuster movie is "a roller-coaster ride". Pirates Of The Caribbean does, in actual fact, have its roots in a theme park attraction — a slow-moving boat trip past richly detailed tableaux of lusty buccaneers and skeletons who breathed their last grasping for forbidden treasure; not the most likely base material to turn into cinema gold. But producer Jerry Bruckheimer proves yet again that he's a big-screen alchemist where sheer entertainment is concerned. Pirates Of The Caribbean is, without a doubt, the best blockbuster of the summer. Director Gore Verbinski steers his ship through choppy commercial waters by keeping the romance, adventure and comedy on an even keel. If there's the slightest niggle to be had, it's probably that the swashbuckling sequences don't really lay down a challenge to the Zorros or Robin Hoods. But such cares are swept aside by a rollicking tale of pirate lore, with cursed treasure, secret identities and enough acts of betrayal and loyalty to keep the final showdown as sparky as the firecrackers in Blackbeard's whiskers. It's also very funny. Shrek writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio spice up the pirate genre as gamely as they did fairy tales; but on the comedy map it's Johnny Depp's inspired turn as Captain Jack Sparrow that really marks the spot. Depp, arguing that pirates were the rock stars of their day, models his entire performance on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones: it's there in every slurred vowel and every drug-fried wiggle of the head. There's an endearing dignity to Sparrow's hunger for fame. "You are, without doubt, the worst pirate I've heard of," says one British officer. "Yes," replies Jack, "but you have heard of me." Gloriously over-the-top, this performance is pitched only as high as the film's fun factor itself. In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a masterclass in comedy acting.
10.0~MY CHILDHOOD ronin-19288 Sign in Permalink I watched this movie everyday after kindergarten best movie out of all 5 amazing
9.0~This film is better xXmRx Sign in Permalink And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s? I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb? I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins. Except for this year. Go Jack. And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge- podge of loosely- connected "money shots" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-beardedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, "You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck- swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey. And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking "overproduced by" credit on the cover-liner. "Bombastic." "Overdone." "Absurdly Stupendous."
10.0~Excellent loona_moona_2000 Sign in Permalink this has got to win something when time comes to get an award!!! this is pne pf the best movies made this year, and there has definitly compition. if you want to see a GREAT movie this would the one to see, in theatre's or on your couch... dont miss this one...
4.0~More Boring Pirates August1991 Sign in Permalink I fell asleep while watching this film in a THX cinema. While this weakened my understanding of the film's plot, my 11 year old companion cheerily filled in the details on the drive home. I sympathized with Johnny Depp who, like me, seemed to have just woken up prior to many scenes. While I was clueless as to what exactly was going on, Depp pulled off well his wake up calls and instead appeared to have a brilliant, original take on the plot twists. Move Depp, on probation, into the "watchable actor, sole reason for buying ticket" column. Hollywood producers accept pirate projects at their peril. Maybe it's a challenge match for those with money to spare. Someone today no doubt pitched a TV series based on the pirates in 'Six Days, Seven Nights'. Pirates. Hollywood. Fairbanks. Swashbuckle. Search me.
10.0~amazing movie sunnysummerbaby Sign in Permalink this movie contains so much fun for the whole family with dead pirates and ghost ships. the governor's daughter is taken by pirates when she tells them she is someone else. while this is happening Captain Jack is using Will to get a crew to go after his ship. when Jack is on Tortuga he gets slapped a few times by past lovers who now dislike him. after gathering a crew Jack, Will, and Mr. Gibbs go through storms to catch up with his precious pearl. as the sort of zombie pirates arrive at their destination the governor's daughter is put into more danger as they plan on killing her if she is the right person. in the end Will saves Jack and his girl from pirates and death.
10.0~Avast there ye mate's blackmamba99971 Sign in Permalink A wonderful thrill ride through the times of the swashbuckler. Johnny Depp is marvellous as the scheming captain Jack Sparrow. His use of incoherent attitudes and forte's of paragraphs of confusion, really gave the audience a good dose of how a pirate is supposed to be. A person of the sea, no quarrels with another except if a foe cheats lies or steals, but that's a pirate for you. This film was a grand scope of true adventure, to be at sea and fighting off cut throats at every corner of the ocean. Geoffry Rush was magnificent as the double crossing Captain Barbosa. And in the middle is William Turner (orlando Bloom) a man who is love with the lovely Miss Swan (Keira Knightly). Both together are and unstoppable force for good in the face of betrayal and uncompromising dastardly deeds between heathen swine and gobs who lose their eye. This movie has every element of action, locations, humour, great sword fights, and above all true Pirates Of the Caribbean.
10.0~Not what you'd think OscarStuckinthepast Sign in Permalink When my friends told me they wanted to see Pirates of the Caribbean I was a bit skeptical. The movie didn't even seem that good in the previews. But when I seen it recently I couldn't believe what I missed out on. I have found great respect for Johnny Depp. He is an amazing actor. If he was not cast in this movie I don't think the movie could have been so great. Overall I give it a 10. It had everything a great movie should have.
6.0~Everything is good except Johnny Depp ghostofdaniel Sign in Permalink This is exactly the kind of story I'd wish to see when I was a kid. Action, horror, lady to save, and so on... SFX are good and surprising. Acting are good (great Geoffrey Bush !) except for Johnny Depp and his character. His character : a teenage-looking pirate who is SUPPOSED to be an old friend of the father of a man. But the son (Will Turner) looks older than him ! Unbelievable ! And more : this kid-pirate is supposed to have been the great chief of the worst pirates of Caribbean, twelve or twenty years before ! Sorry, I can't swallow that ! It's clear : Johnny Depp is really too young for this part ! I know, it's a sex symbol. But what for ? He's not the one who got the girl at the end ! I think a more mature man (like "Jack Nicholson" for example) would be a better choice. And what about his make-up ? He looks like a "transvestite", he just missed the lipstick. That's a bad choice, again. To fight all these bad choices, this poor Johnny overacts loudly to gain credibility. But in vain ! So, for those who can forgets an enormous casting mistake, the movie is pretty good. For those who thinks that a casting mistake can sink a movie, avoid this one.
2.0~Thin plot...boring movie Shlo Sign in Permalink All the action in the world couldn't save this poorly laid out story from practically putting me to sleep. Johnny Depp's performance (despite the Oscar nomination) has got to be his worst in what has otherwise been an accomplished career. The camp, the predictability, and the ridiculous characterization almost caused my friends and I to walk out after the first twenty minutes....I wish we had.
9.0~Masterpiece Rockford_6 Sign in Permalink As everyone here can see, many of the comments about this movie is positive. The Writing was excellent and i can give it a 9/10 for just its writing. There are tricks and twists in this story. Hence, for those who have not vote, watch this movie again and concentrate with their actors and the script. I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it. Although not a classic piece of film-making, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining.
10.0~It's Johnny Depp for crips sakes!!! meadowsidhe Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp is a wonderful actor, nevermind his rugged good looks that make you want to use the drool cup. His acting has gone from 'needing help' in "Cry Baby to absolutely 'wonderful' in "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". Johnny Depp makes this movie!
1.0~Absurd kgilpin Sign in Permalink The movie, while it has an engaging start, quickly falls apart. The discovery of immortal ghost pirates whose appearance changes with moonlight is too ridiculous. By the end of the movie, my friend and I were turning to each other and shaking our heads in shame. Not only was it unbelievable that the movie could have received such great reviews but that we paid to see it. If you must watch it, do so while inebriated.
9.0~Fantastic sepwaltz Sign in Permalink It is very exciting movie. I like Disneyland and I also like an attraction of Pirates of the Caribbean but I had never seen this movie. After watching this, I regret that I didn't watch such a fantastic movie. Captain Jack Sparrow is very cool. I was surprised that the performance of Johnny Depp. I love Charlie who is a character of Charlie and Chocolate Factory and also acted by Johnny Depp. Both characters are acted by him and Charlie and Jack are quite different character, so I think it is difficult to understand that these character are acted by same actor. Captain Jack Sparrow is very unique and attractive character. These are many action scenes so full of exciting and the BGM is also wonderful. Music, actor, plot are all fantastic. I want to watch the sequel.
7.0~For a Disney blockbuster, unique and entertaining. independantyam Sign in Permalink It's hard to review such a popular, blockbuster film as Pirates. Basically, Depp's acting is terrific. So is Geoffrey Rush's. Bloom makes another appearance in a big movie, but both his and Knightley's characters are fairly shut out due to Depp. Some great dialogue; the script is absolutely hilarious. I have to admit I loved the costuming and makeup (it's unfortunate that all its Oscar nominations occurred during the year of Lord of the Rings). The music is also wonderful, fitting the adventurish theme perfectly. Although the story has a couple flaws and there is a fair bit of Hollywood predictability, the movie counters this with humour and good storytelling. All in all, the first pirate movie of its kind - modern, funny, and adventurous.
10.0~A positive review of Pirates of the Caribbean Duckie24 Sign in Permalink I saw this movie and I thought it was excellent. Admittedly, I originally was only going to see it for Orlando Bloom, but I ended up loving the film as a whole. The actors are excellent in their individual roles and all worked very well together. Johnny Depp was hilarious and portrayed a unique and lovable pirate. Geoffrey Rush played an excellent adversary who was both sinister and entertaining. Orlando Bloom played his part of a devoted lover wonderfully despite many people's opinions that he was weak and too lovey-dovey. The plot was interesting and captivating, and although I found a loophole, I think it was purposeful as they are making a sequel. Wonderful special effects and sets helped to make this movie excellent. Wonderful direction from Gore Verbinski held this movie together and an awesome score by Klaus Badelt accompanied the entire movie very well. Overall, I thought it was an excellently made movie that was fun for all ages.
10.0~Welcome to the Caribbean!!! iam_moriya Sign in Permalink Pirates. What were they thinking? They're making a film based on a attraction at Disney land. A film based on a roller-coaster!? Are they nuts? No, they're not. Say whatever you want about Bruckheimer but he knows what the audience wants to see. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films so far in late years. Pirates is a perfect movie too watch on a rainy afternoon. Classical Sunday matine. Give me this film, some snacks, candy and a bottle of Cola and I'm satisfied for a couple of hours. It has humor and action, two very important thing nowadays, and it has a quite good story and fantastic characters. You just got to like Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp, being a brilliant actor, gives one of his best performances so far. I don't know how much of Captain Sparrow that comes from Johnny and how much of him that's in the script but ones thing for certain: He is one of the most lovable fictional characters in a long time. But just because Jack is the best character this movie doesn't lack good supporting characters. Elizabeth is a cool chick and I would like to see her use a sword in the next movie. Barbossa is a very good villain and the Thomson & Tompson like pirate duo on Barbossa ship is a funny couple. Sadly enough Will Turner is a very lame character, but he became better in the sequels. Just don't expect to see a realistic movie about piracy. This movie is far from realistic. Like I've said before, it is a classic Sunday matinée. So, to wrap things up, what do I think about "Caribbean"? Well, it's a lovely place. It's a nice vacation for a couple of hour. It has sandy beaches, great pubs and the people are wonderful. Overall, their is only one problem with "the Caribbean". For some reason the rome is ALWAYS GONE!
10.0~Climb Aboard My Ship. NJRocker091188 Sign in Permalink I wasn't at first interested in seeing this movie. But since a few of my friends where interested and asked me If I wanted to go with them to see it, I figured I should since the ones that asks me to go I hardly get a chance to hang out with. I found every moment of this movie to be excellent. Although I was unaware of whom the actors where, I found the performances to be excellent. Each actor and actress gives a great scope of the charitors and are quite believable. Some people that saw the movie might say that it is a bit boring because there is more dialog then action. Or because they expected it to be action packed. But just because it isn't action packed doesn't make it a bad movie. The action is mostly at the end and the action scenes and special effects where great. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to have hated this film.
10.0~The fantastic film "Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Pearl" Marcellobrizzi Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the Black Pearl" is the best movie I've ever seen. In this film there are: a cursed ship, the Black Pearl,with a cursed crew; a charming, fascinating, romantic, wonderful, clever, smart pirate, Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp); a proudly and lover blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom); a lovely, beautiful Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley); and a perfidious, horrible, ironic captain of the cursed crew, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). To notice the perfect performance of Johnny Depp (Oscar nomination), and Geoffrey Rush's performance, too. The director of the film is Gore Verbinski (THE RING), and the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer (PEARL HARBOR). The scores are perfectly for this movie and they are absolutely amazing. All in this film is wonderful, but not so wonderful as Jack Sparrow! I love him! The best interpretation of Johnny Depp, his most popular character, which includes his first nomination at the Academy Awards. He is so perfect!
9.0~This movie was something special nilen-51573 Sign in Permalink Looking back on this movie, I remember at the cinema when I went and saw it back in 2003 that the introduction of the character Jack Sparrow was the best character introduction I have ever seen and I still think that. Other than that, the movie is solid with a good deal of awesome action and jokes.
8.0~Great shallow movie pontifikator Sign in Permalink This is a great shallow movie. No pretensions, great action, great jokes, pretty good actors. Directed by the well-known Gore Verbinski (no? not well-known? C'est la vie) and starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and some woman I forget. Like Tommy Lee Jones, Johnny Depp has pretty much stopped acting and started playing the same role in all his films. (Tommy Lee Jones is now acting like Richard Crenna in Hot Shots! Part Deux or Wrongfully Accused or maybe Rambo IV, I forget.) But I digress. Depp here plays Jack Sparrow beautifully (and famously as Keith Richards), and the film kept me laughing from the opening scene to somewhere near the end. It's a great buddy film, although lacking the ensemble acting of "The Princess Bride." The bad guys are not really bad, the good guys are really, really good, and our hero gets the girl. The special effects are excellent and used to good, uh, effect: creepy when they should be creepy and hilarious when they should be funny. I was sorry when it was over.
8.0~The Celluloid Pirate thinker1691 Sign in Permalink In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****
8.0~Yo Ho, Yo Ho, I like this film CKCSWHFFAN Sign in Permalink Going into this film I thought I like the ride more than I will this film. That is still true but..... This film is fun. And, much better than I thought it would be. Bought the soundtrack, it fit perfectly to the film. As a woman, loved looking at Orlando. Knightley we can do without. The more I see of her the less I like her. Too much. Depp was great as Jack. Looking forward to the 1st sequel & seeing Keith Richards who the Jack character was based. A draw back though, the action scenes, although good, are a bit too long. Could have been trimmed. "Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For Me".
9.0~Gentlemen, ladies .... You will forever remember the day when you first saw the incomparable Captain Jack Sparrow! BiiivAL Sign in Permalink This film impressed me right after the first viewing, in August 2003, after which the following followed and so quietly peacefully, imperceptibly, I probably approached the mark of ten views. In principle, it's worth it, this film can already be called a legend, and it's a pleasure to watch such films. And now also compare with the sequel, but in fact someone seriously believes that the sequel came out better than the first episode. I, of course, do not agree with this, but I will not argue, everyone has an opinion, and there will be euphoria from viewing (views) of the "Deadlock Chest" and people will soberly look at the "Curse of the Black Pearl" and realize that the second part is not even nearby worth, but it is also a product of the highest class. The first film is better, maybe not all, but in humor and the plot exactly, and even such a banal sign as novelty, in the second part we saw only a sequel, a slightly different story with the same characters, and in the first film, it was all new , and moments are brilliant. When I speak genius with regard to this film, then, of course, I have the look of Jack Sparrow in the incredible performance of Johnny Depp. This is one of his best roles, from the very beginning he was performed in a genuinely brilliant way, from the first appearance on the screen to the eighth when he sailed on a small boat, flowing through all the cracks, to excellent music - completely capturing the episode, one of the best in all movie. And his first step to Port Royal, an English colony in the Caribbean. And after it began ... The whole genius of Jack Sparrow's image can not be conveyed in words, that's why we watch this film and review it time after time, and expect the continuation. Especially the second part is the benefit of Jack, and in the first and except for Jack there was a lot of interesting things. About humor, plot, music, I already said. And also this is the Captain of the "Black Pearl" Barbossa, some minor characters among the Barbosa pirates and among Jack's team. In addition, you can add to the appearance of Jack in the city of Torturra, a meeting with old friends and friends. Or repeated scenes, when Barbossa and Sparrow are in one frame. All these and other episodes can only be admired, for, they do not bother and remain in the memory. The plot of the first part is much more interesting than the plot of continuation, besides the ship full of skeletons under the moonlight, where it surpasses the ship from the team in the form of sea monsters-yudisch. Special effects are here and there at a level, at a high level. Pirate films now go to the screens of the world a little, and no one can surpass the Pirates of the Caribbean Sea, here in fact there is even a romantic story between Elizabeth and William, the only problem for them is that it moves back to the second or third plan , thanks to the excellent performance of pirates of their roles. Young Bloom and Knightley could not support the level of their older colleagues, I would say that it's forgivable for them, if they were not so important to the director and producers, and in the eyes of ordinary fans of this film, they are not visible, they swam far beyond the horizon, only, unfortunately, sometimes appear on the screen saying important phrases, for me these characters are superfluous. About Bloom, you can talk separately, his goal is to play a simpleton, spinning around the main character, sometimes trying to throw out an incredible and very daring trick, in the first part he still copes with the role of a simpleton, but when he tries to play the guy, everything fails, he does not go, and should run all career in a skirt of Paris. And in the second part of it they are already trying to make a serious man, give a chance to steer at the head of the film, but time to think, because Jack can not block him, and he does not want to be funny, but could try, maybe an idiot with the protagonist - his role ? The screen time for the Knightley-Bloom duo is very little allocated, I mean when they are together, and for this it is necessary to say a special thanks to the creators of the film, this does not allow to turn the film into a love story of two childhood friends, but, damn it, from time to time they turn out to be in one frame, and these frames can easily be called not the most interesting for the whole film, in the sense of an acting game, because these young actors do not show anything super-ordinary. Ditch the ocean, shoot cannons (even with forks), rob ships and ports here is the destiny of pirates, and after they also appear on the screen under the magnificent setting of Verbinsky - that's the real movie. The spark from the sensations is getting stronger, the film practically does not allow him to tear himself away for two and a half hours of viewing, except for the episodes of Knightley-Bloom, but this does not prevent the movie from watching when Jack Sparrow appears from the second to the second. The film really deserves only flattering reviews. The ending of the film, although romantic, but much better than in the second part, when I did not see the ending, it was simply not invented - it's the main and very big minus of the second part, but now the conversation is not about it, because the first part ended very much in rating , I do not mean the MPAA rating, but the main thing is that it's a cobblestone in the sequel garden. This movie you will remember as the best one in which Captain Jack Sparrow was almost hanged.
9.0~Great film, shame about the sequels nicholls_les Sign in Permalink This is a great film, full of action, romance and humour. I loved it and couldn't wait for the sequels ( I lived to wish I had missed them ) Johnny Depp creates one of movies great characters in jack Sparrow who really steals this film. All the supporting actors are good, even the smaller parts and the film seems much shorter than its 2 and a half hours. This film was so good that the awful, over special effected sequels have ruined what could have been a great series of films. The sequels should have concentrated more on Jack Sparrow and his humour instead of ridiculous and unbelievable characters that appeared in them. ( Davey Jones to name just one stupid invention )
6.0~Highly overrated HunterDK Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has been regarded as the best film this summer in the US, and many IMDb users have praised the return of the pirate genre. With this in mind I went to the cinema and watched this movie, and once again I disagree with the IMDb users and possibly also a lot of critics. The story had a lot of potential with ghost pirates and stuff like that, it is a pirate movie and you can accept things like this, but the movie fails to impress me for several reasons. First of all the cast was not chosen wisely. Johnny Depp is without doubt a great actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for an old pirate. He does not look old, but according to the story he should have been captain on the same ship where Geoffrey Rush was chief officer. The rest of the cast was chosen more wisely, but I never liked Orlando Bloom's character either. One thing that really annoyed me was that almost every character should be funny, it was very annoying and at some points unbearable to watch. First we have some stupid English soldiers, later Johnny Depp has to be funny, and we also have to watch some funny ghost pirates all the time. Suddenly all characters have to be funny, and the ghost pirates are just comic sidekicks in this movie, they are not scary at all. The idea to make the English soldiers stupid has also been seen so many times before, and I really dislike it. If that was all of it, then I maybe would not be that grumpy, but that was not all of it. The whole idea of immortal pirates was actually not good even though I accept stuff like that in this pirate adventure genre. I can ask a simple question, why do people take a fight against these immortal pirates? There is absolutely no point in doing that because the outcome has already been decided. Am I the only one who is asking these simple questions? Hopefully I am not. After having criticised the movie I also have to point out some of the good sides. The movie is well done in both sound and picture. The effects are good and the ships can fascinate most people. Anyway, the movie does not deserve a good rating, because the plot is too thin and all scenes have to be fun, which is a disaster in a 143 minute movie. Beautiful scenes and a few laughs however make this an acceptable picture, which should not be treated as an memorable movie of year 2003. - Rating: 6/10.
10.0~Pirates Of the Caribbean mbr8 Sign in Permalink This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever made.. (so far) I think that he's exciting, very good, and you can live your selves in to the movie. And every time (specialy the first time of course) you look at the movie you will be so catch-ed, and you can't be interrupted of anyone because the movie is so good, and you are holding tight on the chair while you're watching. I mean.. I have looked at this movie a 100 times. And I can still sit down and watch it again and again. You are punishing yourselves not looking at this movie.. Serious.. Watch it alright?
10.0~The best adventure film since Goonies! snowpap Sign in Permalink This is truly one of the best, if not the best adventure film I have ever seen! I'm not the only one as over 36% of the voters gave this one a 10 out of 10. Great characters and terrific writing make this a classic for generations to come! If you have not seen this one, get out and buy it today - notice I said buy and not rent. You will love this one!
7.0~Ah-har! extravaluejotter Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are two of the main reasons to see this film. Their note-perfect and seemingly effortless portrayals of rival pirate leaders Sparrow and Barbossa fills the screen whenever they appear. Other actors are allowed their chance to shine as well, thanks to Gore Verbinski's generous direction. The action is plentiful, the laughs come like a volley of cannonballs and the special effects don't overwhelm the story. What's not to like? Well, er, Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, unfortunately. Shrewish and drippy respectively, neither of the two young leads has the screen presence to create a credible romance. Knightley gets more annoying as the movie progresses and I found myself hoping that someone would kill her character with another 45 minutes to go. Bloom is fine and athletic in the action sequences, but fails to convince as soon as he stops moving and starts to open his mouth. Fortunately, the energy, charm and quality of this movie outshine the damp squibs of Knightley's and Bloom's performances. 'Tis a fine film, to be sure, ah-har etc...
10.0~Great!!! vexred_freak Sign in Permalink The film is such great fun, all through you are bombarded with action, romance, comedy and amazing cgi. Geoffery Rush delivers a wonderful performance as the evil Captain Barbossa and Johnny Depp MAKES the film with comedy that just brings tears to your eyes (from laughing so hard), his best role yet!!! As for Orlando Bloom he is also in one of his best roles to date, although playing Legolas in LOTR catapulted him into stardom, this is without a doubt the role he shall be remembered for....at least, I believe he shall.
8.0~Surprisingly entertaining Antagonisten Sign in Permalink A movie based on a "ride from Disneyland" or something like that. That was the first i ever heard about this movie. Not the best premise for a movie you might say. But i was very pleasantly surprised i must say. The governors daughter gets kidnapped by pirates. Her love-interest and the famous captain Jack Sparrow both set out looking for her. Her love wants her, Sparrow wants the pirate ship. Many have tried to live up to the matiné-classics of old. Or not just them maybe, also more modern classics like the Indiana Jones-movies. But it seems the essence of the adventure-film is hard to capture, considering how many have failed. And the pirate genre especially seems to be treacherous ground. Just think about such catastrophes as "Cutthroat Island". Here though the tradition of adventure, and fun for the whole family, is picked up in an admirable way. There are several elements that make this such a great experience. The acting is solid, especially from Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp who both seem to have a lot of fun here. Orlando Bloom is his rather stiff and bland self, even though it's less evident here than in most cases. Also this movie is very playful. It makes jokes at the genres expense, at almost everyones expense. And foremost it doesn't take itself very seriously. There is quite a bit of violence in the movie (it involves pirates after all), but it's all quite mild and it never disturbs the experience. When it comes to family fun this is one of the best i've seen. Not that i'm a fan of the "family" genre, but still. And the older viewers can always stare at Keira Knightley, and maybe dream that we too could fence, sail and rescue ladies like her... Rating is 8/10 and very recommended!
7.0~One of the Top 250! I don't think so.......... djohn2581-1 Sign in Permalink I thoroughly enjoyed this very clever movie. It's a fun ride and I really did appreciate Depp's unusual character. That said, this is no masterpiece. It is, rather, a very enjoyable and expertly done piece of fluff and a rather long advert for Disneyland. It's basically a lovingly rendered rehash of all the well-known clichés of 80 years of swashbuckler films with a bit of "Sinbad the Sailor" thrown in. This is like Ray Harryhausen (all hail!) would have done had he CGI tools at his disposal. Pirates of the Caribbean is fine entertainment and it's certainly a far better movie than the recent Star Wars efforts. But it's no masterpiece. It pales in the wake of classic swashbucklers like "Captain Blood" (Errol Flynn) or "Treasure Island" (the one with Jackie Cooper and the Disney one with Robert Newton), or even the recent "Master and Commander". Let's put POTC in the "fantasy" category. Within that context I would rate it much higher than within this TOP 250 FILMS category. It is a great fantasy film. As a "spoof" it's not in the same class as "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein" or "Love and Death", but it's very close and a job well done. Good film. Rent it.
10.0~Fantastic, Thrilling! Depp is No. 1 Actor diane-bonner Sign in Permalink This film has got it all, humour, excitement, fantasy and most of all, Johnny Depp! Depp deserves every credit for this film which is surely the film of the year. When I got the film on DVD, I watched it over and over again as it just gets better every time. Knightly is a fantastic actress who expresses her part in the film amazingly. Bloom is good at his parts, not as good as the rest of the main character's although he is great in the sword fight scene with Depp. Geoffrey Rush is a fairly unknown actor although he deserves to be known as he is a super actor who really gives the audience the feel of his part. Depp is a masterclass and really makes this film my Number 1 !!!!!!
10.0~Great Movie--Saw it twice cuzin007 Sign in Permalink This movie had it all: Action, Romance, Humor, and Mystery. It was good enough to go see it more than once, and I'd go again if you asked me to. Johnny Depp was hilarious, and I wanted to kiss all over his Pirate face. It was well directed, and certainly not slow moving.
10.0~Depp made this movie, with a little help from his friends lucky_star_1 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp is truly an acting legend of recent years. This film is proof of it. He is always very considerate of what roles he takes on and is usually a totally different character in each of them. Jack Sparrow is no exception. He is absolutely hilarious, as is his accent which does ring true; plus his friendship with Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner also rings true. There is chemistry between Depp and whomever he shares dialogue with because he is central to the whole movie - thankfully. Depp is my all-time favourite actor, I think he is so much more talented than he gives himself credit for. Bloom and Keira Knightley form the romance, which expected in all modern movies so I can't complain because the acting is great all round. Another talented actor who proves himself in this movie is Geoffrey Rush. Like Depp he brings charisma and comedy to the role, as well as threat. Barbosa is a character you love to hate (because of how he treats Sparrow as you will see for yourself and what we learn from their history). Jack Sparrow's drunkenness will have you splitting your sides with laughter, believe me. If not then you can't possibly be viewing the same movie. 'Yo ho a pirate's life for me' was sang by Depp and Knightley who are rightfully paired by a campfire in one scene. There is a spark but the romance is firmly between Will and Elizabeth (Knightley). A great movie I would definitely recommend for anyone over the age of 12 who loves a good action movie mixed with comedy, romance and the talent of Johnny Depp! I give it full marks
10.0~Bringing Swashbuckling movies back obiwan2005 Sign in Permalink PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is truly an adventure that is worth 4 times the price of admission. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are after the fabled ship, The Black Pearl, after the dreadful crew lead by Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Will's main squeeze, Elizabeth Swann (played by the lovely Keira Knightley). On the way, Will learns that the Black Pearl used to belong to Jack, who lost it after Barbosa lead a mutiny against him. But, Jack is lucky, because soon after the Pearl was stolen from him, the crew had a nasty curse put upon them. Which makes them invincible, but turns them into skeletons in the moonlight. Not only that, but the crew needs the blood of a Turner (Will Turner!) to break the curse! This movie is an exciting, swashbuckling tale that doesn't fail to entertain you with eye popping battle scenes and asurbic wit. The running time is about 2 and a half hours, a bit long for a summer flick. But it doesn't bore you at all. The entire time your into the story and being dazzled by the action (and beauty of Keira Knightley). Movies like this aren't made...ever! When was the last time you saw a pirate movie? Cutthroat Island doesn't count! Anyway, this movie is one of the best of 2003 and manages to make pirates cool again. RATING: **** out of ****
10.0~A tale of curses and love! How does that work? Light Spoilers lols802 Sign in Permalink Being in South Africa I had to wait an extra 2 months to wait to see POTC. But finally the day came and I was definitely not disappointed!! A movie for all people: action, comedy, drama and romance included. I am totally in to Orlando Bloom. I thought that he was good (being the romantic gorgeous hero) but Johnny Depp made the movie. Without his quick quirky comments the movie would not have been the same. The story follows Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)as they follow The Black Pearl and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) so they can rescue Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) who is believed ,by the pirates, to possess the ability to stop the curse that torments them from experiencing any feelings. A movie that is definitely on my to-buy list!
5.0~A waste of time. bgolson Sign in Permalink I just got back from watching this movie. I should first mention that I had no idea what this movie was about (beyond Pirates). All I knew about this movie was that it did great over the weekend. I don't understand where all the comments about this movie being good, and Johnny Depp acting great are coming from! First, the overacting by Johnny Depp was driving me crazy! I kept expecting to see Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy show up on screen. His character had no purpose in the movie! The nice compass he had could have been given to any other character, and the plot of the movie would not have changed a bit. The characters were so shallow, I had no strong feeling about any of them. There was nothing very interesting about the plot either. It was so simple, that reading the one sentence plot outline from imdb.com tells you everything you need to know about it. The best part of the film is the visual effects, very stunning throughout the entire film! Overall, I give this film a 5/10. If you've got nothing else to do, go see this film and watch the nice visual effects. But remember to turn your brain off before the movie starts, or you'll end up with a splitting headache by the time it ends.
10.0~A real pearl under the movies!!! Yeager81 Sign in Permalink When great actors are acting in a great movie, the result is astonishing. Gore Verbinski produced a pearl that will be a classical in the future. Johnny Depp seems to be pirate for his whole lifetime. Orlando Bloom at the side of the stunning Keira Knightley confirms his potential to be one of the best actors currently.
9.0~relatively clean pirates movie reniand Sign in Permalink I watch this film without knowing anything about it, except that my brother said it's some sort of historical fantasy about pirates: And I'm pleasantly surprised. I fell in love with the Jack Sparrow character right away at the start even though I didn't know yet if he's a baddie or not. Another surprise is the minimal amount of blood and gory (considering this is a pirates movie), and instead I get plenty of laughs. I only like funny movies only when the actors look and talk seriously but actually acting funny (do you get what I mean?), and this is that kind of movie. The story have plenty of twists so sitting for more than 2 hours didn't bother me at all.
10.0~Excellent! joy9585 Sign in Permalink Despite the obvious gift of total hotties in this movie (Ahem: Johnny and Orlando) the plot, for the most part, is very original. Sure, it's about Will Turner going off to save the woman he loves, but the plot is so intricate and delightful that the first time you watch it, you don't even concentrate on how gorgeous these men are, but more so on the plot. The actors were well-placed as their characters, but most importantly the characters were believable, due firstly to the writers. The CGI effects were truly amazing, as they were able to characterize the skeletons to the characters, which made it easy to keep track of them. Pirates, well put together, is not just a family-fun movie or a chick-flick, but rather something that just about anyone can enjoy: action for men, romance for women, and humor all around. Shorlty: humorous and captivating, this is a must-see. One can only hope that the second and third movies are as well-written.
10.0~A pirate schemes to regain his ship by helping a young man rescue his love from pirates. hersheyguy2112 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent movie. It shies away from the excessive violence, sex, and profanity so common in today's films to present a funny and exciting adventure about pirates. It is not a highly realistic story, but that is what gives it so much charm. Captain Jack Sparrow leads the ideal pirate life, stealing and swindling instead of murdering. As a character, he is laid back and scarcely ever seems serious. He also has a seemingly never-ending supply of great lines. Jack's resourcefulness and wit are his greatest assets, and the ego he totes around is comical as well. William Turner, blacksmith's apprentice, balances out the light-hearted Jack. Will is intense, focused, and dedicated. He has goals and he goes for them. Jack and Will are an amusing pair throughout the movie, especially when Will's intensity and seriousness are shot through by one of Jack's witty retorts. Elizabeth Swan, the beauty of the picture, is by no means helpless. She is fearless and resourceful, witty and intelligent. Elizabeth seems to be more of a happy medium between Jack and Will, and complements the others quite well. The effects are great, and this prevents the movie from taking a cheesy turn. While the accursed pirates may be a bit much for some of the younger kids, it is still a great family movie as it is clean and enjoyable for both kids and adults. It has action and adventure, with an exotic aura to it. The fight scenes, especially the sword duels, are well done. Overall, this movie earns a 10 out of 10.
10.0~Johnny Depp for Best Actor! dannycantwakeup Sign in Permalink Best performance of the year! Sean Penn is nothing compared to the sheer bizarre force of nature that is Captain Jack Sparrow. I saw it SEVEN TIMES in the theater! Before that the record was held by SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, UNCUT with only THREE TIMES. It's a must-see for all ages!
5.0~Huh? jilla1 Sign in Permalink Talk about sound and fury signifying nothing! Okay, the sets, costumes and cinematography were great, Johnny Depp was interesting (if confusing),and the action scenes were there but for some reason this movie never touched me. I just watched it, trying to figure out why Johnny Depp was playing a gay pirate when there was nothing in the script about it.
1.0~Boredom tahamai Sign in Permalink While the effects were slightly admirable, this movie made virtually no impression on me. I don't really remember the names of the characters, let alone why they did or felt what they did. I never could figure out why people kept getting into sword fights and shooting at skeletons they couldn't kill. Wouldn't you run away if you shot some guy in the head and he just shook it off laughing? Clearly nobody in this film caught on. Overall, I was not entertained. It wasn't even so bad it was funny.
8.0~FANTASTIC!!! 9 out of 10 at least Animal89 Sign in Permalink FANTASTIC!!! 9 out of 10 at least. A great combination of action, adventure, comedy, mystery and a touch of romance. All in real Disney style. Anyone who has been on the "Pirates of the Caribbean" Disney ride will notice a few odd jokes that others don't see, so you'll get a few extra laughs. Johnny Depp is hilarious, the special effects are ground breaking and edge of the art, the fight sequences are fantastic, the music is addictive, and this whole film is a feature you'll want to watch again and again. This is a film that almost anyone can enjoy but I would particularly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Johnny Depp (from hell, sleepy hollow, secret window) or the producer Jerry Bruckheimer (bad boys II, top gun, armageddon, pearl harbor). If you enjoy this film then look out for its sequel due out in 2006.
9.0~I'll drink to this one me hearties! nurse_ratched Sign in Permalink At first glance, you can be forgiven for being sceptical about Pirates of the Caribbean. A movie title taken from a slow-moving, Disney theme park ride in a genre in which Hollywood has failed to make any real imprint onto since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling days. On closer inspection, however, Gore Verbinski's latest offering, penned from the writers of Shrek, boasts an impressive cast and a trailer showing just a glimpse of some the amazing CGI special effects that no Summer Blockbuster can do without. So, did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean 'shiver me timbers' or did it make me want to run off the nearest plank? I am pleased to report that this film more than lives up to the preceding build-up. It looks gorgeous (helped along by the fresh faces of our disgustingly handsome hero, Orlando Bloom and his, 'bonnie lass' Keira Knightley); it has just the right mixture of romance, action and comedy and is a showcase for one of the most mesmerising and innovative performances this year (move over Errol, Mr Depp has landed.) Probably one of the most underrated and the most unconventional actors in Hollywood, Johnny Depp masters the character of Captain Jack Sparrow and creates a half-drunk, half-insane pirate, delivering the gags with almost perfect comic timing and an assortment of hilarious mannerisms. Alongside Depp, Geoffrey Rush plays the villainous Captain Barbossa, doomed to live as a cursed man because of his greed and piracy. Rush ensures that Barbossa is a genuinely creepy character whilst even managing to evoke a degree of sympathy for him as he wanders miserably through life in a desperate struggle to lift his curse. A script containing every ingredient you would look for in a movie of this genre backs up these superb performances. Without ever taking itself too seriously, Pirates of the Caribbean, embraces all of the old pirate clichés, to produce a cracking story, exciting action sequences and enough double-crossing buccaneers to provide one of the most entertaining two and a half hours I have sat through. The CGI special effects create amazing fight scenes as Barbossa and his cursed crew exchange their human bodies for that of ghostly skeletons as they are hit by the glow of the moonlight. All praise goes to the special effects team that created these seamless transformations. Not just a fun Summer Blockbuster but also the movie that has resurrected the swashbuckling genre, Pirates of the Caribbean comes highly recommended. Yo-ho-ho, roll on the sequel!!! 9 out of 10.
10.0~The BEST! AliasC4 Sign in Permalink This is just plain and simple... a great movie. Very entertaining,exciting, and Orlando Bloom with Johnny Depp are great fun to watch. Johnny Depp gave the best performance in my opinion. Orlando Bloom and Keira are amazing for being so young but so interesting to watch. This is just a one of a kind movie,go see it.
10.0~Fantastic deserves nothing lower than 10/10 lucasrulez Sign in Permalink This was an excellent film Johnny Depp takes the lead in i think one of the best films of the 21st century.Its unique and effectively draws the viewer into the film. The drunken pirate Jack sparrow played by Johnny Depp is exciting to watch and you feel at ease from the outset of the film. I also think that the sexy Kiera Knightley was fantastic and played a very convincing role as Elizabeth Swann. Captain Jack Sparrow's idyllic pirate life capsized after his former first mate, the wily Captain Barbossa mutinied and commandeered Jack's ship, the Black Pearl and Captain Jack will do anything to get it back. I've always believed that top actors make top films and this film reinforces this point. Fantastic deserves nothing lower than 10/10. Exceptional cast, exceptional film.
1.0~wake up - this movie sucks lateralex Sign in Permalink Why have I read so many good reviews for this movie? This movie is bland as can be. Essentially this is a family/kids movie, but the special effects would likely be too scary for young ones. This movie had two things going for it: 1. Excellent special effects (gets slightly overused) 2. Johnny Depp (easily the best character) The plot holes in this moving are amazing, and the characters are completely unbelievable. This movie should have a run time of 45 minutes, but instead drags on with fight scenes that make no sense (see the movie to understand). Simply put: only stupid people would like this movie, and I am suprised it has an 8.1 rating (at the time of this post)
8.0~Clever, witty, and very entertaining movie_nut1991 Sign in Permalink At first, I wasn't at all interested in seeing Pirates of the Caribbean, but, after I rented it and watched it, I realized what a cool movie it is. Its really clever. I likes most of the actors. Johnny Depp never really caught my attention before this, but, since now, I have been waiting anxiously to see him reprise his role as captain Jack Sparrow. Kiera Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are excellent as well. Now, on the other hand, Orlando Bloom sort of bugged me. He didn't seem to fulfill his character as well as he could have. But, luckily, this didn't detract from the movie too much. Pirates of the Caribbean had a very original story line. Packed with witty, funny lines and very clever dialog, it never ceases to entertain. While I found some lines a little bit hard to understand, I thought it was very well done. Last, the special effects were really amazing. When the pirates turned into their ghostly form, I found the skeleton effects incredibly real looking. Never inconsistent or weak, the effects were done to best possible degree. So, having said all that, the bottom line is this: I would recommend Pirates of the Caribbean to anyone who enjoys an action/comedy about some pirates of the high seas.
5.0~If not For Depp this movie would be complete slop lilwound Sign in Permalink This movie was for the most part, a contrived piece of filth. It was stocked full of lackluster action scenes and cheesy one line quips. It was poorly written with little development and didn't even cut it as a exciting action film as the fight sequences were poorly made. However... What saved this film from a rating of 3 which it rightly deserved was the amazing acting back Johnny Depp. despite having a badly written character in a badly written film he still managed to make the movie worth seeing again. He was the only character who actually showed signs of life. I would suggest everyone wait until it reaches video... don't rush off to spend 8 dollars at the theaters... it's not worth it... pay the 4 dollars at blockbuster just to see Johnny depp.
5.0~Only as good as Johnny Depp mooncat82 Sign in Permalink Caught this film last week and have to say I didn't think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but Johnny Depp and his over the top campy performance delighted me. It was worth seeing just because of him. I like that Depp chooses unusual, frequently non mainstream films, I think he is a decent actor. His facial expressions in this movie were priceless and I giggled through much of it. My suggestion..wait for it to come to cable tv, but enjoy it when ya want to just relax and have a little fun.
8.0~A nice, entertaining and funny adventure Stibbert Sign in Permalink Ever played Monkey Island? This film is a pirate movie in true Monkey Island style. In case you've never played that game it means lot of fun, crazy pirates, a beautiful lady and a bunch of zombie like pirates. First of all the story is good. The whole love thing is simple and not original, but who cares?! It works and the setting, characters and the whole curse thing spices up the story a lot and makes it very interesting. The dialog is very nice. It's funny, but not all too funny. That keeps the focus on the story. The characters are good and they work well together creating contrasts and showing development through the film. Johnny Depp is very good. He pulls off this whole pirate act really good and manage to take on an English accent. Orlando Bloom is nothing worse. His performance in believable and good. All together the cast is strong and preform very well. The use of English actors makes the whole thing more believable. The effects are well done. In the beginning you'll see some not exactly impressive CGI, but the rest is much better. The skeletons looks good and the explosions too. The fights are well coordinated and the rhythm of the fencing in the blacksmiths workshop is really nice. The music is also good. It's piraty and gets you in the mood. It builds up around the action and fits the movie very well. You don't pay attention too it, witch is a good thing. It means it fits the movie and the action and subconscious just affects your feelings like it should. It's a good looking movie, meaning the cinematography is good. The composition is good and so is the lightning. No shots stood out as extraordinary, but no one stood out as bad neither. It's nice shooting with some playful shots here and there and all together good cinematography. The sets and decorations also make this movie good looking. The mix of CGI and real stuff is good and the look of the costumes and the settings are believable and nice. All together I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way better than I expected. It added a lot of comedy, but still focused on the story and managed to remain serious. I would definitely recommend this movie if your looking for a high quality, cool and funny adventure movie to watch.
8.0~Not Bad For A Pirate Movie TEAQUIEMORO Sign in Permalink The first time that they ever made a great pirate that they made in this century, Pirates of the Caribbean. This was as good as Lords of the Rings, and had many special effects like the Lord of the Rings. Gore Virbinski was very lucky to have a great cast and crew to help him on this great pirate movie.It tells the story of a bunch of pirates who stole treasure and they didn't know that it was cursed.So because of this curse, every day for their rest of their lives they can't digest of eat/drinks what they want, and at night they become skeletons.Now they rome the earth to get all the treasure and get the blood of Will Turner and thats when we met the cast that made this film great.
10.0~great movie pers-68494 Sign in Permalink I dont know how anyone could possibly dislike this movie or give it 1 star, its amazing
7.0~An Enjoyable Ride mjw2305 Sign in Permalink This is the kind of movie that most people will either Like or Love, There is little here to Hate, it is a good fantasy Movie. I also noticed that Women tend to rate this movie higher than Men (that wouldn't be because of Mr Depp or Mr Bloom would it ladies?) In Short this film is Well cast and directed, it has great visual effects and is good entertainment, the problem is this, the film simply doesn't have enough story or character development to attain its quest for epic status or justify its length. Strange as it may seem, this is not a heavy criticism, because the film still carry's enough action, humour and charm to be an enjoyable one. Most people will love it, but i just like it. 7/10 for the film 10/10 for Johnny Depp's performance (it is masterful)
5.0~But isn't piracy BAD for movies? MrVibrating Sign in Permalink Lame joke, but I can't think of a good summary. Pirates of the Caribbean is a pretty decent summer blockbuster that received much acclaim thanks to massive marketing. It's not terribly original, it's not terribly funny(lots of the lines meant to be funny really doesn't work very well) and in the end, it's not terribly satisfying either. As movies come, it's solid and well-made and there's nothing to complain about in directing or the score, which both are good. The acting is one of the disappointments. Orlando Bloom is totally wooden as usual, Kiera Knightley doesn't exactly leave an impression, and Johnny Depp, although he is a god of acting, doesn't take his cool role nearly as far as he could have(with a script like PoTC's, there's no room for anything outside the frames of well-tried movie/money-making guides). The plot is the standard damsel-in-distress scenario and some Incan curse thrown in for good measure. Add a bit of Dawn of the Dead or the work of Ray Harrihausen in "Jason and the Argonauts" and you have the storyline. I've watched PoTC two times and it has failed to impress me both times. It's a bit too violent to be appropriate to the audience I think would have appreciated it best, and a bit to childish to appeal to the rest of the movie-goers. Not something you have to see.
10.0~the movie was excellent trainali Sign in Permalink though it has been a long time since the release but i have already seen it for the seventh time. i think the movie was great and very entertaining. i also liked johnny dept in the movie. he was looking very cool and sexy as always.Orlando bloom and Rush was good.but i didn't like the acting of knightley, it was the only thing i didn't like. the story was basically good but i had to concentrate very hard to understand every single aspect of the movie. but the reason i rated the movie 10 out of 10 i because i thought that everybody's acting was good, and it was done according to the situation (the acting is supposed to be good when you have great actors like Rush and Depp).the whole set and settings was done accordingly. but the biggest applause goes to the pirates who did a wonderful job. they really looked like real pirates though i haven't seen one.the animation was very good though a little shaky. if i write too much, i might tell you guys the whole story. but fortunately i am not gonna. see ya.
10.0~Huge Fan of the Film cruz20526 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies i've ever seen. After this movie I bought up all the Johnny Depp movies i could. Became a huge fan of his work. This is a definite pleaser when it comes to adventure! Johnny Depp played this part extremely well and no one else could do it like him. By putting a lot of himself in his work, he brought the character of Captain Jack Sparrow to life. Extremely well done by all the supporting actors and actresses. Bloom and Knightley has done a fantastic job playing their characters as well. Gore did an amazing job directing the film. The sequels are sure to be some of the biggest hits in box office history.
8.0~The Curse kipton Sign in Permalink How could Boot Strap Bill die (ie not cursed), when the rest of the crew of the Pearl was left to be cursed? in the movie, Boot Strap Bill, seems to have given his son (Will Turner) a gold coin, part of the cursed treasure... when Will is discovered floating in the water Elizabeth takes the coin from his necklace. We later discover that the crew of the pearl is cursed and cannot die. Why is it that BootStrap is not cursed and left to a similar fate. Instead we are told that he is already dead! I would love to have someone help me with this failure in plot logic. Thank you. Kipton Toronto
10.0~Great film. Very good storyline. andrew_fender Sign in Permalink Storyline: The storyline was amazing. I won't tell you, but it has a lot to do with pirates. The story is very clever and has many twists in it. 10/10 Graphics: Also very good. They were not over-used, and when they were they were cleverly used in the right situation. Again, very good. 10/10 Characters: The characters were very in-depth. You begin to learn a lot about them during the film. This aspect cleverly ties in with the story, as a girl uses a man's sirname in it (Turner) which makes a big twist in the story. Excellent. 10/10 Altogether: This was a spectacular, amazing and astonishing film. If you say it's just 'good' or you 'like it', then you're wrong. If there's anyone who hasn't seen it, see it NOW! No, not next month, not in 10 days, not tomorrow, NOW! It will do you a world of good! 30/30 (Total score /10=10)
4.0~Johnny Depp is great, movie is weak (**) Ronin47 Sign in Permalink An "adaptation" of a ride at Disneyland seemed like kind of a flimsy idea, so I'm not entirely surprised that this overblown entry in the 2003 summer movie season isn't all that good. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a humorously goofy pirate who walks with a constant, drunken swagger. Depp, as always, gives a fun and eccentric performance and gets some great lines in, but unfortunately he's the only thing worth remembering about this movie. The story and all the other characters are a total snooze. Jack is trying to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back from a group of skeletal ghost pirates (led by a hammy Geoffrey Rush) who have kidnapped the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Winona Ryder look-alike Keira Knightley) in order to use her blood to bring them back to life. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is in love with Elizabeth, so he teams up with Sparrow. Bloom, from the "Lord Of The Rings" movies and Knightley, from this year's great "Bend It Like Beckham" are both interesting actors, but the characters they're playing might as well be cardboard cutouts. There is lots of action and some twists in the story, but I found very little of it interesting. In fact, Johnny Depp's likable performance and one-liners were all that kept me awake through the ridiculous 2 hour, 15 minute running time. It's directed by Gore Verbinski, and I guess it shows he can direct a big summer movie, but it completely lacks the small-scale style and effectiveness of his earlier films like last year's eerie "The Ring" and especially the quirky, sadly underrated "The Mexican". And when the army of skeletons shows up in the end, all I could think about was how much cooler it was in "Army Of Darkness". I liked Depp's performance, but in a nutshell, the ride is better.
10.0~Cut Throat Island sounds like people cutting each others throat on a Island. "Pirates" are looking for treasure in the Caribbean, and there is a curse somehow to be stopped or to happen. Palj9 Sign in Permalink The movie was the uppermost and uplifting, vigorously powerful. The "title" fits the movie, and it explained the "title". The actors/actress, were incredibility virtuoso (regarding their acting). The "humor" was always at the right time. The "visual" effects were "outstanding". (awesome) The music was absolutely brilliant, and virtuosity (music). The sceneries were perfect.
9.0~Terrific. Depp at his best. wynter_wynd Sign in Permalink A brilliant action film. Well-choreographed fight scenes, a sweet romantic storyline, and thoroughly enjoyable humour. Orlando Bloom plays a very convincing sweetheart, and the ever-worthwhile Depp plays a delightful scoundrel with a quick wit and excellent flair. Definitely one for the collection.
1.0~Trash of the worst variety potblackettle Sign in Permalink So my friend was like, "I really want to see this movie." I fought it and lost. So we went. It was the most miserable two hours of my life. What trash!!! Someone actually paid to make this piece of crap? Bad acting, stupid dialogue, labored plot. Johnny Depp is now dead to me. It was so bad it can't even be analyzed.
6.0~Depp makes this worth watching... brettlu Sign in Permalink Fun stuff, and I think Depp is definitely the best part about the movie. My major qualm with the film is that it was way too long, this could have been cut down to a 90 minute non-stop adventure movie. But instead it gets a little repetitive and unnecessary at times (fighting the undead?). The second major annoyance was that the fight scenes were shot too close. The cinematography was very fast paced and close up (remember Moulin Rouge?), there are really no long drawn out panoramic shots here. This may seem trivial, but I had trouble following the action, it seemed very rushed and inconsistent. The acting was pretty good, given the fairly straightforward, cut and paste adventure movie script. With the exception of Depp's eccentricity, the dialogue is mainly to advance the plot instead of develop any interesting characters. Geoffrey Rush overacts as normal but is an entertaining villain. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are at times a bit stale, but otherwise do a decent job with the material. Overall, Depp is entertaining, and good swashbuckling action is rare these days. I'd give it *** out of four stars...
7.0~Go sailing with these Pirates rparham Sign in Permalink At first announcement, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sounded like a really bad idea to me. It was one of three films announced that would be adaptations (for lack of a better word) of rides or shows at Disneyland. The first was The Country Bears, which I skipped and the third was The Haunted Mansion, which was none too impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean had probably the best cast, headlined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, and was produced by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I was still skeptical, but Pirates of the Caribbean proved to be better than it's pedigree would suggest. It is an entertaining, enjoyable romp, albeit a little overlong. Pirates of the Caribbean focuses on young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith's apprentice who has a thing for, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) the daughter of the Governor of the British Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), a notorious pirate, arrives at Port Royal in search of the Black Pearl, a pirate ship he had previously been Captain of but had been deposed by a uprising led by the ship's first mate, Barbossa (Rush). Sparrow is captured by the local militia when the Pearl attacks the colony and makes off with Elizabeth. Sparrow strikes a deal with Will to help him track down the Pearl and save Elizabeth, but the crew of the Black Pearl are not exactly what they seem: they have stolen and spent Aztec gold, which came complete with a curse that has turned them into the walking dead, a fate they are attempting to reverse and Elizabeth has the last piece of gold they need. Considering there is a dearth of good, old fashioned swashbuckling films in Hollywood today, Pirates of the Caribbean actually manages to be somewhat unique in the current entertainment climate. It, for the most part, lives up to the visual style you would expect from a pirate film, complete with elaborate sailing ships, down and dirty crew members, plenty of swordfights and cannon battles, not to mention the obligatory walking of the plank. However, director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot don't just deliver a standard pirate film, but one with a nice streak of comedy to it. Most of the humor is derived from the lead of Jack Sparrow. As portrayed by Depp, the master of cinematic eccentricity, Sparrow is a rather unusual pirate. Yes, he is self-serving and double-crossing, but he is also played with such a humorous air and a light touch by Depp as to become endearing. He also ensures that we aren't just looking at an actor using the role of a pirate to provide the usual moustache twirling. Jack isn't a hero, but he's not a villain either. Pirates of the Caribbean is an attractive enough film, no expense was spared in creating an environment that fits the material and when the action sequences kick in, they are engaging enough. However, this kind of film is still somewhat fluffy entertainment, not exactly the deepest of material, and Pirates of the Caribbean manages to overstay it's welcome a bit. The film runs 143 minutes, and eventually, it starts to feel like it. It never grinds to a complete halt, but it has no less than three points where it would seem to be reaching a conclusion and yet manages to keep going. This is the kind of film that needs to clock in well under two hours, not run two and half. The rest of the cast acquits themselves well. Rush turns in a decent performance as the villainous Barbossa, Bloom is appropriately fresh-faced and yet defiant enough as Will and Keira Knightley manages to blend her good looks with fire as Elizabeth. The film also boasts some nice visual effects when the Black Pearl crew is exposed to moonlight, when they are revealed as walking skeletons. All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean is a good, fun movie that is more than worth checking out, just don't be surprised if you start checking your watch a little late into the film.
10.0~A true legend chussey-1 Sign in Permalink I was a huge fan of The Pirates of the Caribbean long before the movie, so I was very nervous--would the movie do justice to the attraction? Or would it be another stinky pirate movie? The first time I saw it, though, I knew it would be a hit. The casting was perfect, the music spectacular, the special effects astounding, the story intriguing--this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in a long time. It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the "damsel in distress" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only "cardboard" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels. Even if he doesn't, though, this will be one of his best roles ever, and it's truly a movie that everyone involved can be proud of.
8.0~Good movie! babyjamz Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a lot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights. Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.
6.0~A succession of thrilling scenes valadas Sign in Permalink If you still remember those old pirates movies with Errol Flynn, Walter Slezak or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr and Jr) please forget them because this movie has nothing to do with them not only because the means employed are quite more developed but also because we are not in presence of a mere adventure movie but before a movie which combines in well balanced doses comedy, suspense, horror and of course also adventure and action. The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story? Well as you know the story in this kind of movies is always the weakest part with its usual flaws but we must tolerate it as the necessary conducting wire giving a logical sequence to all the scenes. So if you don't have anything better to do or to watch go see this movie. It will keep you fairly amused during more than two hours.
9.0~I love this movie! And Johnny, je t'aime beaucoup! showgirl626 Sign in Permalink Great action flick. I was quite surprised that Disney was behind this, and that they gave Depp such free reign. He is a marvelous actor, though, I love just about everything he's done. It was nice to see Orlando Bloom have some more lines than he did in the LotR trilogy. And Geoffrey Rush...ah, Geoffrey...I love just about everything you do as well (Quills, though? What were you thinking?). Mr. Rush did such a great job, overshadowed only by Depp. What a great character he created in Captain Jack Sparrow. But he's created so many great characters. Johnny? When are you going to team up with Morgan Freeman to do something? Now THAT would be a movie. But this one was great too. Pirates of the Caribbean? Two enthusiastic thumbs up, and I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
8.0~Highly Entertaining and Enjoyable... fearfulofspiders Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl is not only the best pirate movie you'll ever see, it's also one highly entertaining and enjoyable film. The acting is great all around. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is so crazy and comedic, he's destined to be remembered for that role for a very long time. Orlando Bloom is very good, as well as the beautiful Keira Knightley. Geoffrey Rush is also evil and grand as Captain Barbosa. The score is okay. It certainly can sweep and have some soaring romantic cues, however, it's very redundant. I only recommend it to collectors and fans. The ghost pirates provide for some amazing CG sequences, and are the high points in the film -- yet, Sparrow's first couple minutes on screen is the funniest and most brilliant part of the picture. The writing is very good, though there's many points in the film that could've used a rewrite or two, as thing's become confusing, silly, and improbable. Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely done, though is highly unnoticeable with all the bombast going around. All in all, with some ridiculously funny characters and moments, as well as some jaw-dropping visual effects, and a cool story, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great family film. I highly recommend it.

8.0~Entertaining Disney fun davispittman Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is the first film in the Disney Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. This franchise has been a humongous money maker for Disney. This first movie introduces us to what is probably one of the most widely known characters ever know, Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. This really is an interesting character. I'm not a big fan of Johnny Depp, but I will say that he was the correct pick for this character, I've really taken issue with how he represents characters before (Charlie and the chocolate factory), but this time I think he did a good job. His character is complicated because on one hand, he is someone we root for and someone we're amused by because of his humorous nature and personality, and then on the other hand, he's a flawed character that steals and cheats others. But it's a whole lot of fun to watch Johnny Depp plays this humorous captivating character, hence his academy award nomination. We are also introduced to Will, played by the ever handsome Orlando Bloom. Will is one of the most commendable characters you'll ever see, he's a noble charming character who everyone has no choice but to root for. And then we have Keira Knightly playing Elizabeth. She plays Blooms love interest. But what I loved about her role is that she's isn't just some female for Bloom, she is not a damsel in distress. Yes, it's great to see her and Will fall in love and to see their great romantic chemistry, but it's also awesome to see Elizabeth stand up for herself and take charge in different scenes. She played her in a very bad ass way, which makes it so much fun to watch. The plot of course revolves around pirates invading and these characters I've told you about going up against them. There's more to it than that of course but that's the basic overall plot. I really enjoy watching this now ever famous film. It deserves the positive reception it received when it came out. 8/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
10.0~go johnny go johnny is good edwbur Sign in Permalink amazing. finally a good pirates movie. they had just the right story, just the right actors and the right movie. johnny depp showed great acting and made this character one of the greatest characters ever created. geoffery rush matched great with johnny. did great as barbossa and both johnny and geoffery should have been nominated for Oscars and johnny should of won the Oscar for his role. what was also cool was how this movie could be funny and serious. not many movies like this one can pull that off. also orlando bloom and keira knightley had great chemistry and fit perfectly in the film. this will go down as one of if not the greatest pirate movies ever made. congrats to everyone that made this movie and thankyou for making this movie.
10.0~Awesome awesome movie... CapitanMeh Sign in Permalink Aside from Kill Bill, probably the most fun I had this year. I saw it thrice in theaters and can't wait for the DVD. Damn, Johnny Depp, if I was like that... Woo! Great acting from Depp. Bloom was cool too. The only thing that I don't understand is... why isn't this on the Top 250 movies yet?
8.0~Way better than expected! adrnathms Sign in Permalink I wasn't expecting much from this movie but walked out of the theater commenting that this was probably the best movie I've seen yet this year and now that I've thought more about it, it is. I will even go as far as to rank it up there with the LOTR movies, which is saying a lot. I still think the LOTR movies are at the top but Pirates was at least in the same league. Jack Sparrow couldn't have been casted any better, Orlando Bloom continues to prove himself, Geoffrey Rush was excellent as always and the newcomer, Keira Knightley (who is a dead ringer for but acts a lot better than Natalie Portman), was refreshing. The writing was superb, the effects were top notch and I gave it a 9/10. Excellent!
10.0~Take off your eye patch to watch this one!!! ashers32 Sign in Permalink This movie is GREAT!!! The fighting scenes get a little old but other than that it is great!! watch for the scenes that they imitated from the ride in Disneyland!! and stay the credits are finished to see the extra scene!!
10.0~Must-see for any and all movie-lovers mythicsam Sign in Permalink When my family first watched Pirates of the Caribbean at the theater, we weren't expecting anything great. In fact, we fervently believed that it would be terrible. The commercial looked awful and the fact that it was modeled after a Disney THEME PARK RIDE almost guaranteed a flop. Boy were we wrong. *SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD, BUT NOTHING BIG* Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible movie and an amazing achievement in cinema work. It combines the best of every genre and has something for everybody. I laughed my butt of when I watched this movie during its many comedic scenes, and I nearly screamed during the skeletal attack on the British ship. The action sequences are many and excellent, such as the thrilling sword fight between Bloom and Depp and the sea battle between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor. The love affair between Bloom and Nightly wasn't the movie's best part, but it won't make you cringe like Attack of the Clones' love scenes. Special effects wise, POTC is very good. The skeletons are quite disturbing and the battle scenes are extremely well done. POTC doesn't set any standard for movies, but it still looks excellent. The cast is absolutely stellar. Bloom and Nightly do very admirably and could easily be related to. The support actors are great, particularly the stuck-up British commodore and captain Barbossa. But Depp really makes this movie shine. He delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as captain Jack Sparrow, a hilarious, daring and enigmatic figure with a strangely feminine attitude. The fact that he didn't win an Oscar for this one is a sure sign of the coming Armageddon. Bottom line, Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies in history. It will blow you out of your seat and make you laugh until you throw up and is great for the whole family. 15 out of 10.
10.0~Greatest film ever silly_soraya Sign in Permalink I think this is the best film ever, and I don't care what anyone else thinks! I've seen it at least 25 times, and never get bored of it. My favourite part is when Jack Sparrow grabs Elizabeth Swann and says, "Gentlemen, m'lady, you will all remember this as the day that you almost caught captain Jack Sparrow!" He is a great actor and plays his part very, very well. He's so funny to watch, and Orlando is a good actor too, and Keira Knightley. Anyone who hasn't seen this film must be mad, as everyone should see the greatest film of all time!!!!! Oh, and I voted: 10 p.s Orlando Bloom is fit! Don't forget to watch Calcium Kid too.
10.0~the best movie brumby_online Sign in Permalink this movie is one of the best films i have Eva seen it is a must see movie and Orlando bloom was very good as and actor in this movie as well as johnny Depp. it is interesting how jack sparrow and Will turner meet and have to become friends in order to save will's bonny las as sparrow says. and how sparrow and barboser must fight to distract him so jack can (watch the movie) but it is a great story line my fave scene in the one how jack and will meet jack needs to get rid of him chains and succeeds and than will walks in and they have a sword fight.Elizabeth (the bonny las) has the medallion because she took it from will turner when he was a boy and she loves to sing a song YO HO YO HO A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME
7.0~Great fun. chinatown74 Sign in Permalink There's no need to go on and on about this movie. It's lighthearted, thanks to Johnny Depp and the occasional nod to the Disney theme park attraction which inspired it, and it's the sort of movie you have in mind when you think of seeing a good, fun pirate/adventure movie. If you want to see some Academy Award winning film with the requisite brave character who dies from some terrible misunderstood malady, don't waste your time with this movie. If you want to have some fun, a few laughs, and a reminder of good, old-fashioned Saturday matinee popcorn adventure then go see this. Even better, go get Disney's "Treasure Island" classic and watch it before you see "Pirates of the Caribbean"---really get yourself in the mood.
8.0~One Of My Favorites cal-brady Sign in Permalink This movie is, and probably will be, one of my favorite movies. It's fun, the characters are likable, it's light-hearted, and let's face it: there aren't nearly enough pirate movies being made anymore. The plot isn't the most serious of stories ever written, but it wasn't really meant to be. Besides, it works well, and it kept me interested for the two and a half hours it went for, and it's better then a lot of stories I've seen done in movies. When I first saw this movie in the cinemas; I was impressed. Seven years later, watching it on DVD at home, I'm equally impressed now as I was then, though the CGI is a little outdated now (not that it's a problem).
7.0~Depp at his best! Kassdhal Sign in Permalink What can we say about this movie that has not already been said? Johnny Depp gives a extraordinary richness to his character and we follow him around the oceans in a strong scenario, served by a very solid filming and editing. Keyra Knightley is still charming and Jack Davenport is still a great actor (who could have forgotten his role in the original, British, Coupling). Orlando Bloom is the weakest link here, as always, lacking presence and charisma on screen. Overall, a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that would have deserved a higher grade if Bloom hadn't been involved.
9.0~can enjoy! betoexko Sign in Permalink Elizabeth who is a governor general's daughter has a golden medal which was had by Will. They come to love each other. One night town is attacked by Barbossa and Elizabeth is caught because his aim is the golden medal. Will asks Jack for help. They go to Elizabeth's rescue. This movie is so exciting. There are a lot of thrilling scenes in this film. Everyone will be able to watch it with eager anticipation. My favorite character is Will because he is so brave and he has strong feelings for her. I was surprised to watch that Barbossa and his underlings are living corpses. My favorite scene is jack's fighting scene because he is so cool and he is good at swordplay. Lastly, I think all casts' performance is very nice and good . This movie is really worth seeing. The ending is happy for everyone. This movie is so interesting. This is one of my favorite movie. I recommend it to you.
10.0~wow!!! laughin_princess Sign in Permalink jack sparrow has got to be one of the best characters in movie history!!! I loved him before he even said his first line. johnny depp played him fantastically, and orlando bloom, keira knightley and geoffrey rush were brilliant in role too, and not forgetting mackenzie crook from TV series "the office". the whole film was thoroughly enjoyable, and perhaps the best thing about it was its' unpredictability!!! it has action, romance, and the part with the crew walking across the sea bed was quite creepy! I think that whoever you are, there is bound to be an aspect of this film you will love.
8.0~A Master Piece nowshedhossain Sign in Permalink Actually there is much to say and admire that it may become a very large composition. The first and foremost matter is the acting was seriously great. The acting of Captain Jack Sparrow is so astonishing that i forgot he was an actor not a daredevil pirate captain. The movie was full of fantasy but it didn't have any negative affect of me. The costume, graphics and specially the language was used is so perfect that it seemed i was watching a video clip from the great pirate era. the story out line was something very new. i don't understand why it was rated only 8.0! it deserves more. Never forget to watch it, it is something different...
9.0~Unexpected pleasure! redkiwi Sign in Permalink Often I've not been the world's biggest Johnny Depp fan, and any film made by Disney is usually by default corny rubbish targeted at raking in as much cash as possible with no merit whatsoever. This is very different. Depp plays a wonderfully camp pirate captain helping the sickeningly annoying (as usual) Orlando Bloom get the girl while battling against the new pirate captain Geoffrey Rush, who mutineered Depp when he was his captain. Swashbucklingly funny frequently, the highlight is definitely Depp's performance is what is a very enjoyable ride.
10.0~Depp: My Favorite Pirate semioticz Sign in Permalink Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is not y/our typical Errol Flynn type of machismo, swashbuckling pirate; nor does he play another Disney Captain Hook. He's more like Fagan in "Oliver." Capt. Sparrow's ever so fey. That's his charm. Though the pirates on the "Black Pearl" ship are dead & sometimes in their skeleton form they aren't scary enough for kids since this is a comedy. The story line goes as follows: A governor's daughter is in charge of a young boy her own age who has been pulled out of the sea by her father's bourgeoisie crew. She notices his necklace is a pirate's & takes it from him to protect him from being hung to death. But, the golden medallion is the last 1 of a pirate's treasure that has cursed the "Black Pearl" ship's crew. Without its return, with the blood of the boy on it, the skeletal crew remains dead, unable to feel any life in themselves; they are also not killable since they are already dead. Capt. Sparrow (Depp), though a bumbling comical pirate who's bent upon owning the "Black Pearl," the ship the cursed crew stole from him, plays a marvelously lovable & lucky pirate who is the super glue that holds together the loose ends of the movie. Depp gives his cutest performance I've seen; he's now my favorite pirate! The script is clever; cinematography is fine; special effects are spot-on.
4.0~A Critical Voice In The Cinema Wilderness museumofdave Sign in Permalink This is a perfect movie if (A) you are a twelve year old boy, (B) you like to see stunt men ejected from explosions over and over and over again (C) you will watch anything with Johnny Depp, regardless. For more discriminating adults, the two and a half hours of noise and chaos unrelieved by any semblance of careful plotting becomes tedious. Depp is certainly fun for the first half hour, sending up the pirate image by coating his eyes with kohl and sending up the Disney image by acting a little less than wholesome, but after a while, one longs for more than people screaming with swords in their hands backed up with a bombastic music score that underscores the emptiness of the enterprise. One longs for the sense of heroic purpose and genuine derring-do exemplified by Errol Flynn/ Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, or Burt Lancaster in such grand adventures as The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Sinbad The Sailor or The Crimson Pirate, all recently released on vivid, family-oriented DVDs; Pirates From The Carribbean is cynical corporate entertainment, the humor ironic or tongue-in-cheek, and, though marketed as such, is really not for children unless they are so desensitized to blood and savagery from video games that nightmarish visions do not bother them.
10.0~The best action movie about Pirates in a long time! dgcoen Sign in Permalink This film has everything - Action, Romance, Mystery and a little bit of Horror and History thrown in. This should be the film to give Johnny Depp the recognition and respect he deserves as one of our most talented actors around. Disney really made a winner this time - a definite Must See!!!
10.0~The best pirate movie aloedrink Sign in Permalink Lots of fun and entertainment. Not too serious but not too over the top, well written story that's engaging from beginning to end. The jokes aren't annoying like in the sequels.
10.0~i love this movie!!!!!! It is the best! stameyv Sign in Permalink With Orlando Boolm and Johnny Depp in the same movie there is never a dull moment! I can wait until the next two movies!!!!My favorite part of this movie is where Jack and Elizabeth are marooned on the island.I also think the part where Elizabeth is on the Black Pearl and she tries to stab Barboosa is kinda cool.But i don't like the part is when Elizabeth says yes to Norington! I think it was smart to stand by Will. I like the part where Jhonny Depp and Orlando Bloom are in his house and they have that sword fight.I think the part where Jack is in the house alone and he puts the hot metal rod to the donkeys butt is very funny.It is so cool where Barboosa drinks that red wine. I also think the part where the pirates walk under water is so cool.I really like the part where Will and Jack walk under the canoe!If you have never seen this movie you don't know what you are missing!!
1.0~TERRIBLE. Effulgence Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely horrible. I want that 2 hours of my life back. It is extremely predictable and written by a formula. Depp did his usual strong performance, but I wonder if he actually read the script before agreeing to do the movie. My guess is that he was looking for a money maker and the Disney logo spelled cash. It must be expensive living in France. Even though Depp performed well, the persistent intentional head bobbing was annoying. It could have been understandable if there was anything resembling a story.
10.0~Great Movie jrmorrish Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was a Great Movie filled with action, adventure, humor, romance and suspense. My favorite character was Jack sparrow played by Johnny Depp. He was comic relief and made me laugh out loud. Of course, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) was also great as the romantic lead with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley).
10.0~Officer Hanson still Rocks!! antisoul82 Sign in Permalink The below or above writer made a valiant point in saying Disney hasn't come out with decent movies for quite a while now (at that point in time), however you cannot say Johnny Depp would be as famous as he is because of this movie? He has always been great in his own right even though he wasn't the mainstream actor of that time...he had a cult following and his movies and characters are quite memorable. Movies made from Disney haven't always been the best as i can agree with this previous writer, however, of all Disney movies...NOT ANIMATED...this movie will always be a top the list!! Depp sold this movie!! Hands Down! The rest of the cast added to the beauty, laughter, and amazingness(my word) of this film!! One of my favorite rides of Disney actually made an Amazing Film!! Can't say that with a lot of Disney Films now a days.....
10.0~Great DrkInvada1137 Sign in Permalink I'd like to ditto everything said above, however I'd like to comment on the "flaw". It was explained several times why Turners blood was needed to break the curse. The gold was cursed and the only way to lift the curse is by retuning all the gold to the chest and paying a blood price. and since everybody stole the gold (the pirates) all of them had to pay the blood price, however, Bootstraps couldn't pay it because he was dead at the bottom of the ocean, so his son (who had the same blood as bootstraps) paid it for him, and the curse was lifted. Now about the movie, i definitely recommend this movie for everyone. Its funny, action filled, and overall a good movie. i give it an A+++
10.0~Great adventure flick haterofcrap Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean" is one of the best adventure franchises of the recent years. It is a incredibly funny and exciting combination of adventure, action, fantasy and comedy, with excellent results. The performance of Johnny Depp is magnificent, and his character (Jack Sparrow) is one of the most memorable and fascinating (And also funny) characters of all the history of the cinema. The rest of the cast was incredible here, too. All their characters were great. The special effects and the music were excellent, and create a great atmosphere of adventure. It is epic, exciting and enjoyable. "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" was a perfect beginning for a great trilogy, and it was one of the best adventure flicks of the recent years.
10.0~Overall a Fantastic Movie Silmarwen Sign in Permalink I originally had some doubts when it came to POTC, and was somewhat pleased when I had to cancel on seeing it. When I did finally get around to seeing it, I was blown away. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as the roguish, bumbling, half-drunk, handsome ;-) Captain Jack Sparrow. His character is not one we will soon forget. Geoffrey Rush is awesome as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom weren't bad, but I just found their characters to be boring. Coming in at just under two and a half hours, some view Pirates as too long, while other, more obsessive fans, didn't want it to end. So, all in all, if you want a fun, swashbuckling, good for the whole family but you actually WILL enjoy it unlike some other movies who said that too, check out Pirates. You won't be sorry. *****
10.0~cinematic masterpiece plants_pants_and_pageys_strings Sign in Permalink I personally enjoyed this film more than many I've seen this year. Gore Verbenski is a wonderful director, and I must say that this type of movie was not expected from him. Johnny Depp is a world-class actor and he did a world-class job. He is truly gifted, able to conform to many different roles. I give this movie three and a half mutated thumbs way, way up, and I reccomend it to anyone who calls himself a "movie lover."
3.0~Good movie, let's not get carried away though Dar Star Sign in Permalink Acting was decent, though I was expecting more of the Jack Sparrow character after reading all of the reviews. Special effects were good too. This was certainly a visually stunning film. Overall a 7 out of 10.
10.0~Keith Richard(s) as role model EdenMarie Sign in Permalink While I absolutely loved this movie, and while I have been a huge fan of Johnny Depp's since "Benny & Joon", I must say that toward the end of the movie I found Depp's portrayal a little cloying. Most of his portrayal was GREAT FUN, but toward the end when the Black Pearl and crew arrived at the Isle de la Muerta, his actions and mannerisms got so repetitious that I just wanted the movie to be over. It didn't help when one of the pirates explained his behavior to Orlando Bloom's character. I read later that Depp said he had based his performance on Keith Richard(s). I've spent time around Keith in the past and, while that "wavy gravy" thing he does is indeed one of his mannerisms, he does not go around acting like that every split second. Sorry, Johnny, but your portrayal during the last third of the movie was a little over the top for me. Nonetheless, I eagerly await the second and third installments of "Pirates" -- glad to have the blighters back in my life!!! Watching Keith "portray" a pirate (and Depp's father) should be worth more than one bottle o' rum!!!!
10.0~Definatly a must see Smells_Like_Cheese Sign in Permalink I figured I'd comment after all the craze for Pirates. I've seen this movie 5 times in the theater. you know how it goes, a friend says "I haven't seen that" or parent wants quality time, etc., etc., etc. But I didn't mind seeing it again and again. It was a good movie. Johnny Depp, whew! That boy is hot. And his acting isn't bad either, just kidding. he's a wonderful actor. He does an excellent job in this film. He can do a wonderful comic charactor. Orlando just keeps getting better and better. He's a great romantic actor. And you just automatically fall in love with his charactor. Kate is a good actress. She has the whole "Damsil In Distress" routine down. But in the end I fell in love with her role. Geffory, damn! What can I say? He can't give an unforgettable performance. 10/10 A movie that everyone should see
9.0~Never thought that pirates could be cool tintja Sign in Permalink I think pirates of the carribean is graficly a great movie. It amazes me what they can do with a computer. I laught with the sketeltons and i think it is the best movie starring pirates ever!
8.0~Originally a skeptic, it got to me! A mighty fun adventure! triple8 Sign in Permalink SPOILERS THROUGH: Well believe it or not I just saw this movie! Up till now I had no desire to see it. I'm not a particular fan of pirate movies and not a big fan of action/adventure type flicks(though that's been changing a bit in the last few years.) But I have to admit I have been curious. So many people I know have seen it and told me I am really missing out on something special. So I did indeed see it this week. And the movie got me! I thought it was excellent. As has been mentioned, the best part of the movie is Johnny Depp. Now I'm not exactly a huge Depp fan. I appreciate him and do think he's an amazing actor but have never taken to him as strongly as some other actors. But I have to say, his portrayal of Jack Sparrow was brilliant and easily the best role I've ever seen him in. Depp takes this role and Creates an unforgettable history making movie character. His Sparow is fun, funny, mischievous, lovable and quirky. He definitely made The movie for me. And the cinematography is fantastic. The movie rippled with adventure and drew the viewer in immediately. The campy fun atmosphere was perfect as was the larger then life quality. If one's ever been on the famous pirate ride, they will find things they recognize about it too. And Bloom was very good as was Kneightly as the fiery pirate loving Elizabeth. Perfect casting. The movie may have been a little long for me and I won't say there weren't a few draggy moments but by and large this was a wonderful adventurous ride and I really felt bad I didn't see it when I originally came out though I'm not sure I'd have appreciated it as much then, if I had. As mentioned, I had been gradually getting more into these type of flicks and I think the more appreciation one has for the action/Adventure film the more they will appreciate this though it is the type of film one can enjoy without necessarily being a major fan of pirates and sword fighting. The reason that is so, is because, simply put, these characters are fun and different as is the movie and there are moments of pure exhilaration. That's something that a good adventure movie needs(actually almost any type of movie) and Pirates has it. It is so utterly unique it isn't surprising to me now that it has received so much recognition though I admit I didn't get it before I saw it. Not that there were not some negatives. The biggest one is the length of some of the sword fighting scenes. Some of them I thought, just went on an unbearably long time, particularly the one toward the end. It did get to the point where it really became a little numbing and unless one is terribly into the sword fighting element I think a lot of people might feel that way. I'm not sure how long the last sequence was but it seemed like hours. I wish that had been a bit shorter. One scene I loved though, was the fight between Depp and Bloom in the beginning. That was excellent and one of my favorite scenes. So....I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and can't wait to see Pirates two which I will be doing very soon. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it and maybe Skeptical. It's a mighty fine time!!!!
10.0~Johnny Depp Should Have Won An Oscar! TexasSleuth Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp, in my humble opinion, has been ignored far too long by Tinseltown. His acting in this film was truly gifted and inspired. If you have not seen this movie, please do so. Mr. Depp is able to completely submerge in whatever character he plays and he does so amazingly in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. A pirate with a heart of gold! Oh, the movie is great, too! Orlando Bloom is fantastic and the special effects are quite phenomenal. I cannot believe that the Disney Studies actually produces this film so perhaps there is still hope for them after Eisner.
10.0~Swashbuckling adventure! TribalWarriorPrincess Sign in Permalink This is one of my favorite movies. It mostly centers around 'Captain' Jack Sparrow, who is obsessed with rum and is as crazy as they come. He also has his good and bad parts (like a Han Solo from an alternate dimension :-D), courageous and selfless blacksmith Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of Governor Swann. Captain Barbossa was an excellent villain, the kind of person you love to hate. Pintel and Ragetti also added a fair share of comedy relief to the movie, especially Ragetti. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys pirate movies. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. Also, be sure to stick around after the end credits for an additional scene.
9.0~More fun than a barrel of ghost monkeys! TheBabblingFool Sign in Permalink Action! Keira Knightley! Adventure! A very dashing, charming Orlando Bloom! Keira Knightley! A god-like performance by the god-like Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, played like a drunken drag queen (in a good way)! Laughs! Keira Knightley! Geoffrey Rush as the perfect evil henchmen! Chills! Spills! A monkey! Keira Knightley! Beautiful drool-worthy special effects by ILM! Swordfights! Cannonfire! Keira Knightley! Lots and lots of pirate thugs! At least one guy says "ARRR!"! Fun for all ages! Ghost pirates! A ghost monkey! Did I mention the very very very hot and talented Keira Knightley? Well if all that doesn't sell you, nuts to you, because I loved this film!
2.0~Keira Knightly Ruins It !!!!!!!!! BustinRach Sign in Permalink I usually love anything that Johnny Depp is in, but this film is an exception, mainly because they picked the worst actress in the world to play the leading lady. Keira Knightly is given so much credit about being the finest female actor in Britian, I think however that her acting in this film somewhat contradicts this statement. She is truly terrible, the only bit i thought she was good was when she fell off the castle wall. But otherwise this film is quite good, i thought Johnny Depp was brilliant playing Jack Sparrow and also looked gorgeous in the process, which isn't very hard for Johnny Depp. Unfortuanatly i could only bear to watch this film once because of keiras unemotional presence and Orlando Bloom being overcast by Johnny's shadow.
10.0~AWESOME! NewOrleansMovies Sign in Permalink I don't care what everyone else has said, this is by far one of the top movies of all time, words cannot describe my awe while watching this Gore Verbinski hit film. The impeccable acting matched the satisfying yet cliffhanging story. Looking forward to Pirates of the Caribbean 2 in 2006
10.0~Fantastic Pirate Movie! g-bodyl Sign in Permalink This movie is the opening to a very good franchise though this is the best one of the series yet(I heard really good things about #4). The only other pirate movie I saw before this was Hook. Hook should not even be compared to this. Sorry, Mr. Spielberg! Johnny Depp, in my opinion, turned Jack Sparrow into the Top Ten list of all-time acting. Savvy? Elizabeth Swann, daughter of a governor, was kidnapped by a host of feisty pirates. Now her lover Will Turner join forces with Jack Sparrow who used to be with those pirates to rescue Swann. This movie has a little of everything here. There's plenty of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. I didn't want to see this movie when it first came out, but I was forced to. I'm glad I did. I rate this movie 10/10.
10.0~most enjoyable movie ever made. abra-kadabra Sign in Permalink When is enough, enough? After viewing this movie 32 times, we are going to see it again tonight. The whole atmosphere of this movie is incredible. There is no remarkable violence, no gutter humour, no nudity, just intelligent story line and great acting. Captain Jack Sparrow is a treat throughout the movie with his witty humour and off the wall body language. This is the first time we have felt so strongly about a movie to see it this many times or write a comment about it. POTC has demonstrated that there is still hope for entertainment. We spend a lot of time on the water and this movie clearly has it right, it is "freedeom"
10.0~Beat All Errold Flynn Films whpratt1 Sign in Permalink This film starts off nice and calm with a young pretty gal looking out over the ocean from the bow of an English Vessel with all its sails blowing in the wind. This young girl is Keira Knightly, (Elizabeth Swann) who notices someone is floating on a raft in the waters below and summons help to rescue him; Elizabeth then proceeds to steel a metal object from around his neck and never says a word about this incident for many years in the future. The rescued young boy was Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) who has a secret past relating to his father and his associations with men on the seas who had Cross Bones and a Skelton as their flag. There is plenty of sword crashing steel and creatures resembling Draculas along with things you can not even imagine. Errold Flynn would never be able to complete with Johnny Depp, but Errold was good way back in the 1930's and 40's.
8.0~Great, Modern Swashbuckler keithbrown-90195 Sign in Permalink I've always liked this movie. It's lighthearted and grand all at once, with an iconic character and performance at its center that still feels wholly fresh and original despite the overbearing nature of the character in subsequent films. And his introduction is so good; iconic even. Despite the presence of Jack Sparrow, it's Elizabeth Swann that's the true protagonist here (and the first 3 films). She's solid, and so is Keira's performance, and it allows the strangeness of the story to creep in from the margins without overwhelming the main narrative. The romance with Will Turner is definitely the weakest aspect of the movie, but it doesn't detract from the fun of the story and it's certainly necessary for the film to work as a whole. I love the throwback to the era of sword fights and battles with cannons on pirate ships. When I think of adventure, I always look to this movie. The rousing score definitely helps, but also the open ocean and the tropical locations. They really make the best use of the blue waters and palm trees. Romance, daring escapes, backstabbing, ancient curses, comedic bumbling; it's all here, with great production values and a sharp eye for the visual witticism.
8.0~Piracy at its best! meeza Sign in Permalink `Yo! Ho! Ho! A pirate's movie is not for me!' I always said every time I watched a torturous pirate film. In fact, the most pleasurable live pirate episodes I have experienced were the ones where some of my compadres seized their mate's stunning girlfriends in several happy hour watering holes. In fact, that can lead to pirate `eye-for-an-eye' warfare where it turns out too difficult for friends to patch things up. Anyway, back to pirate films. I am astonished but glad to report that `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' has broken the curse of horrendous pirate flicks. The film is based on the Disney attraction ride, and the movie does not derail from its voyage of cinematic cleverness. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a charismatic pirate who is on a quest to regain his old ship `The Black Pearl'. Johnny be very good with his oscar-worthy performance as Sparrow. With this work, Johnny has paid his Depps I mean debts to those critics who have condemned him for not selecting roles in more commercially appealing films. It is one of the best acting pieces of the year! Co-star Orlando Bloom is blooming into a star with his role as the Blacksmith on a quest to rescue the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann. Speaking of which, Keira Knightleys breakthrough performance as Elizabeth was also commendable. Geoffrey Rush as the evil pirate continues to demonstrate his scene-stealing ability to portray scoundrel antagonists. Director Gore Verbinski provided just the right touch of Goreism for it to be a Gore candidate as the best film he has directed. `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is the pirate film for me! So guys take your hoe hoe hoe (sorry ladies) to watch this jewel and you will see that this pirate film is for you too. **** Good
7.0~The adventures cinema has returned joseav10 Sign in Permalink At the end a good film for everybody. Wonderful actors,an excellent Johnny Depp; a delicious, beautiful and magnificent Keira Knightley and a very good performance of Geoffrey Rush (as the damned pirate). The reality and the fiction, the special effects at the service to the story... Maybe, someone can say that exist so much fight scenes, but the story is so good and the gags so funny... and the quotes, the sensual, brave and adventurous world of the pirates reflects in each scene, in each sentence... really good, I recommended you... I remembered some movies that I saw when I was a child... This is a movie that the nowadays children will remember...
10.0~A ridiculous and fun ride that will be around for a long time dimoulas-466-176153 Sign in Permalink As I go back and watch Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I find the viewing experience just as much fun as the first time I saw the film in theaters. I also find the film more and more ridiculous. When I first saw the film I was 13 years old, and I was just starting to realize that I wanted to be in the filmmaking business. Where films like American Beauty, Signs, and the films of Kevin Smith and Mel Brooks, really influenced me in the types of stories I wanted to tell, the original Pirates of the Caribbean really influenced the type of colorful characters I wanted to explore with my stories. In particular, and I'm sure to no surprise, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow dazzled me (for the record, and for no particular reason, the other performance that significantly effected me in my life was Heath Ledger's as The Joker). I can remember imitating him for a long time, something that caused much frustration for my parents I'm sure. And also probably contributed to my unpopularity in high school. But I didn't care, I loved the film and the performance, and it once again helped solidify my certainty in wanting to write movies for a living (now that I think about it, this might have been the aspect that frustrated my parents the most.) At some points the movie has a complicated plot and can also be quite long. By listening to the commentary of the film, the director even mentions at one point, that at that particular moment in the film (when Captain Sparrow and Elizabeth are stranded on the beach) the audience has all the information they need to end the story. Yet the film will continue for another 40 minutes. The film is flawed, as with ALL films I think. But with the eclectic characters, the overall plot of pirates and treasure, and the fact that it is just a fun ride, what's there not to love about this film? When I look back now, I have the same feelings I would image a grown up viewer of films like E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark might feel. When you go back and watch the movies from your own childhood you are aware of the dated effects and sometimes unbelievable sequences, but you also are reminded of the magical feelings that you felt upon first viewing those images. Now, I do not mean to compare E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark to POTC, but the feelings for me are similar. Classics are in a way defined by the generation in which they were released. Huge amounts of people saw E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, and Raiders, and some have now deemed them classics of their time. And if you don't want to call POTC a classic of a more recent generation that's fine, for the record I'm not particularly calling it that. But I do think that this movie, whether we like it or not, will be around for a long time. And well deserved.
10.0~A joy from start to finish jangomac72 Sign in Permalink Disney's surprise hit from 2003 based on their long running theme park ride was widely expected to be a huge flop but is a fantastic popcorn blockbuster featuring swashbuckling action and a very sly funny screenplay from the writers of Aladdin and Shrek. Johnny Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, possibly the worst pirate you've ever heard of, in search of reclaiming of his long lost ship, the cursed Black Pearl, captained by his rival Barbossa (a brilliant Geoffrey Rush) who have been doomed for eternity by pieces of Aztec Gold. The cast is rounded out by a large contingent of British actors (Bloom, Knightley, Pryce, Crook, Davenport) who excel in this kind of film. There are countless references to the ride throughout the film (and lots of hints of what was to come in the sequels, which is surprising as the follow ups were never planned which is unheard of for a summer blockbuster these days) There's nothing to fault with this film at all IMO. Acting, screenplay, direction, production design and FX are all superb. It's very rare with today's Hollywood product that you come across a film like this that is just pure enjoyment from start to finish. 10/10
3.0~Massively overrated Leofwine_draca Sign in Permalink Generally I dislike pirate movies, especially Hollywood ones. In fact the majority of historical adventures made after the '60s aren't usually worth watching. But this film caused a big fuss in the cinema, everybody applauded Johnny Depp's performance, and it even featured cursed pirates who turn into skeletons in the moonlight. Sounded a bit like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS. So I watched it. I guess I should have been forewarned, knowing this was a Disney movie, but I went ahead with best intentions hoping to enjoy the whole thing. Unfortunately, I didn't. This film is a mess. From the moment you first see Johnny Depp you realise what a misfire this is, a popcorn, brainless piece of trash specially geared towards teenage girls. It's a film where the female audience watches only because the "hunky" Orlando Bloom is in it. Sorry, girls; although he's pretty (although far too feminine) he can't act for peanuts. I want to see this guy get his teeth into some real material, like when Brad Pitt tore people's throats out in KALIFORNIA. Maybe then I'll respect him. For now he's just a wooden statue, torn loose after his part in LORD OF THE RINGS and already becoming typecast as a handsome but empty action vessel. Nothing wrong with the scenery or the special effects though. The skeleton pirates are great CGI creations but appear far too little. Plus this is a two hour film where nothing happens to further the slim plot for an hour or so. Try hard to stifle the yawns. The story is non-existent, the dialogue atrocious and even worse, clichéd. It's all so predictable these days. The film is played as a comedy, but the jokes are lame and tired. In fact I hated them. The only mildly amusing thing is Mackenzie Crook's wooden eye. As for the action, it sucks. One of the first things you see is Depp sliding down a rope, that was tired when Kevin Costner did it back in WATERWORLD, now its just sad. The sword fight between Depp and Bloom is pathetic, no excitement or skill whatsoever. The action at the finale is also particularly bad and unappealing, with a bunch of characters you want to see die, a load of stupid sets, and more rubbish acting than you can shake a stick at. Depp is atrocious – how desperately did he need the money for this one? Usually Depp makes great choices in some great films. I loved him in FROM HELL and ED WOOD. Here, he acts so over-the-top and stoned all the time, it quickly becomes boring. This isn't acting, it's over-acting, and a disgraceful performance. You're not funny, Depp, so move your backside and make some good films again. Supposedly 'hot' Keira Knightley is also bland, looking like a million other young girls, pretty but nothing to distinguish her. As for the good actors: Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce are given absolutely NOTHING to work with, just standing around and looking good. Geoffrey Rush is also uninvolving as the chief villain, who does nothing very villainous, doesn't even kill anybody I don't think. Rush is poor here. Go back to making proper films! Definitely worth a miss, this one. Total rubbish from beginning to end with only a few good special effects to make it even a little worthwhile. Don't see it. Unless you're a teenage girl. With a crush on a made-up Johnny Depp. And Orlando Sodding Bloom.
10.0~seen it 4 times..and counting kazalenko Sign in Permalink This film was by far the best I saw over my September holiday period. In fact it was probably one of the best movies I have seen...ever! The reasons for this are numerous: Clever casting, interesting story setting, love story meets action..the list continues. I will say that the plot is not particularly extraordinary but that just shows how well the other elements of the film contribute to its overall greatness. Firstly, and most importantly, the cast was fantastic. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were hot!! Not only physically, but their acting was superb. Johnny's character (Capt. Jack Sparrow) was played with such realism, and the humor he brought to the movie made a great film an excellent film. Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightly were also remarkable. The cast aside, everyone loves pirate films. The dark mystery that comes helm with the pirate way of life and the quaintness of the island settlements enriched the film with a glorious setting that is original. There have not been many films based on pirating in the Caribbean, let alone to the standard of this one. The film is also one which all can enjoy. Hot guys for the girls and a gorgeous love story, but sword fighting and skeleton pirates for the guys (By the way GREAT visual effects!). It's also child friendly, a family movie. I have seen this movie 4 times but am not nearly sick of it yet. The movie is not so much great because of it's story but because of its novelty. The witty humor brought by Johnny Depp and the amazing acting along with the audience it appeals to and the fantastic story setting make this movie one of my favorite EVER. I can't wait for the sequel!
5.0~Perhaps I would have liked it more if not for.... jd9014 Sign in Permalink I could have accepted this movie in all its pseudo-mediocrity as being enjoyable. Not good. Not a movie to watch over and over again, but enjoyable. But then, the fact that it is so overrated only made me so very disappointed. "Arg", and now, I will sit back and prepare myself for the inevitable swashbuckling backlash of pirate fanatics.
10.0~"Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate." gluttony14 Sign in Permalink The first time I watched this movie was sometime during the summer of 2003. I read about it a bit, heard about it from a friend, and decided it sounded like a nice movie, so I might as well go watch it. And at first, I came out thinking it was a nice movie, nothing more. But I had watched it again later. And again. And again. And you could say the movie grew on me, because while I admit this isn't the best film ever made, it is my favorite movie. So what makes this so great? It's fun. I can watch it many times over and over and never grow tired of it. Be it the incredible fight scenes, the captivating scenery, the rich and amusing dialogue, the interesting plot line, or the unbelievable acting, something about this movie never bores me and just has me watching it again and again. I have seen the Star Wars movies many times, and can find myself growing bored while watching them. I have seen the Indiana Jones films many times, and lately found myself beginning to grow a bit bored while watching them (they are still enormous fun, though). I have seen Pirates more than any of the previous films, and never once have I been bored with it. Too often I catch it on the TV, sit down to watch a favorite scene, and stick on for the rest of the movie. It simply never gets old, and it's just as fun to watch it the tenth time as it is to watch it the first time. Part of the reason for it is, I suppose, that the movie doesn't really rely much on its plot to progress. Sure, it has a good, solid and interesting plot: the town of Port Royal is attacked by the cursed pirate ship, the Black Pearl, captained by the vile captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal, is kidnapped by the pirates due to a certain medallion she possesses and the name she gives the pirates as her own. Young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith who has a secret love for Elizabeth, goes to rescue her and enlists to his help captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own plans regarding Will, the Black Pearl and Barbossa. It is interesting to see how the plot develops, but what really holds you are the magnificent scenes that come one after another. Whether it's the amazing sword fights (such as the early fight between Will and Jack, an extremely well-choreographed and amusing clash), the naval battles (fire all cannons, arr!) or the stellar performance by Johnny Depp, each scene is as captivating as the previous. I have mentioned all the good things in this movie (and yes, there are a lot of them), but the absolute best is the acting: Bloom and Knightley are good as Will and Elizabeth, each portraying their characters personalities extremely well, and you can believe that the two care about each other. Geoffrey Rush is extremely captivating as the villainous captain Barbossa. He manages to look, feel and sound like a true villain (even adding a little "arr!" here and there) while still having us believe that Barbossa is a human after all, with motives and feelings. You can understand why he's doing what he's doing in the movie. And as for why he's a pirate - that's what rotten scalawags such as him do. The true star of this movie, though, is Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow is incredible - he acts a bit drunk and a bit crazy (to the extent where you hardly see the difference when he actually is drunk!), yet he is also cunning, intelligent and thoughtful. He is also amusing to no end, dishing out funny lines one after another, while maintaining to remain serious when the time calls for it. Depp's acting in this movie is truly the best I have ever seen in my opinion, and I believe to this day that he has been robbed of his rightful Oscar. And finally, I can't help but mention, that simply the fact that this is a pirate movie makes it so fun. Pirates are fun, and I am really interested in pirates. This film may not give a historically accurate version of piracy (I don't recall undead pirates ever mentioned in history books) but it's still fun, and gives you everything you need when it comes to the romanticized view of pirates that's so dominant in today's modern culture. Jack Sparrow says at one time during the movie: "Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate." and this is especially true of this film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is treasure. It's a captivating, enriching experience. You'll come out with a smile on your face, and the mood for swashbuckling. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, hurry up and do. Anyone who has, go watch it again. It's worth it. I'd give it 11 out of 10 if only I could. ARR!!
9.0~These Pirates Stole my Heart JuliaGulia967264 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Carribean is not your average film. Action, special effects, a good score, romance, and great acting encompass this film and make it an adventure that you want to be a part of. And a great part of it is that the actors maintain great character and bring humor into the story. Johnny Depp is without a doubt at his best in this film, and most definetly delivers an award-winning portrayal as the adventurous, swave, and disillusioned Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley, along with others, light the screen also. However, in the end it is Depp who bedazzles the viewer. A great movie to rent and watch with others. Although may seem to be a bit of a lengthy epic, it has some great lines and moments that you'll remember days after watching it. I can't wait for a sequel!
5.0~Boooring... ckeegan-3 Sign in Permalink Oh my god this movie did not have to last this long. The length of the movie made it so unbelievably boring it was rediculous. There were a couple times I knew nothing was going to happen so I made some calls, checked my e-mail, etc... Effects and cinematography were pretty cool hence the reason I gave it the five. Wait until it comes on TV, unless you get a gift card for a free rental or something.
9.0~Could have been better djecatepec Sign in Permalink This is, as so many have already noted, a great pirate movie, in fact one of the best ever. But it could have been better, I think. I'm not exactly sure just how, but somehow. Perhaps because it was produced by Disney. It seemed to have some of that usual Disney "insipidness" that tends to take the edge off of otherwise excellent movies. Some kind of pandering to an unseen and irrelevant "political correctness". I don't know exactly. It is great for kids, my 10 year old just loved every second, and when you have kids, that counts for everything. I personally enjoyed it, but I wouldn't sit through it again. (Unlike "Return of the King," which I could sit through another 17 times, I'm sure!)
10.0~DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! DEPP! SoncoChairman Sign in Permalink I sat there in the movie theater and just could understand something. How is that no matter what Johnny Depp is in he keeps bringing the awesome. He was in top form for this picture. It amazes me how this guy is so quiet and not media sociable and yet can pull of this cocky, funny over the top character. He's just nuts and it is fantastic. Orlando Bloom? Meh, he was okay. He took nothing away from the experience of the film but he was just a bit too righteous for me. Geoffrey Rush is another impeccable talent. He just knows what he needs to do to get the job done and then he adds a little spark to make his character go over in a big way. Jonathan Pryce is always good to watch. I love how during one of the big scenes he just sits around like a taco but then takes credit in the end. Hysterical. The rest of the film is just plain fun, not an Oscar contender but just a feel good, action packed adventure. The film's plot and storytelling are told with outstanding visuals and clever dialogue, but it is carried by the subtle, yet exciting score of Klaus Badelt. I have followed Klaus's career since his early work with Hans Zimmer. He wrote a convincing and exciting score that keeps up with the manic pace of the film, at times driving it. Truly a gem. However, with all that said, it is Johnny Depp's vehicle. He branded the film with his magnificent sense and talent. I find one thing funny though, whenever a film does well the star is always commended and sometimes the director is left out. Gore Verbinski pulled out a sharp, crazy spectacle that hasn't been seen in a while. It appeals to movie fans of all ages and not many films these days do that. Kudos to him.
3.0~"The Fog meets "Treasure Island". HCG714 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" has to be one film I'm addding to my "Worst Films of 2003" list. "Pirates" has to be "one" of the oddest, strangest, most over-the-top, far out, blockbuster film's of the summer 2003 lot. For starters, director Verbinski isn't enough of a stylist to pull off the script's delicate balancing act. As he showed with the "The Mexican" Verbinski has problems finding just the right tone between humor and adventure. The film is never quite funny enough to make us forget that dramatically it's pretty slim stuff. With is combination of action, comedy, over the top acting, big sets and one-liners this movie couldn't be taken too seriously for an action film and it so far off the map that it couldn't be called a comedy. For one thing Johnny Depp, who delivers what has to be the strangest lead performance in a $150 million Hollywood production to date, and has to be the only one brave enough to play a gay drunk pirate this side of the Caribbean. Wait until you see what Depp does here. You can't take your eyes off him!! He is funny, crazy and he over takes every single scean he is in. Even Geoffrey Rush is over shadowed by Depps's over the top performance. Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Barbossa, and it shows what a great actor Geoffrey Rush really his; and how multi-talented he really his even when he sells out to crap like "The Banger Sisters" or "pirates" He can make a really bad role work for him. But it was Depp's film and he ran with it! Keira Knightley, well not much to say except she is a really bad actress and how many times do we have to set her either wet or getting her clothes ripped off with out once having bad hair or runny make-up? Orlando Bloom was flat, his character was a cardbaord cut out of every single character out to rescuse the woman he loves and finds himself an adventure. "Pirates" was a bad movie, but Depp's over the top performance was the best thing and the only thing besides the over top F/X and interesting story line that keeps this mess afloat! Yes folks; the story had promise. Real promise. But somewhere between directors Gore Verbinski ideas, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ideas the story somehow merged 2 diffrent out looks with no real mediuem. The whole film felt like "Treasure Island" meets "The Fog"! With a running time of two hours plus, "Pirates of the Caribbean" feels terribly flabby, even the over the top battle scenes are so drawn out we start to lose interest. Depp's odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized by film buff's as a bad film that we love. One word to describe "Pirates" is "BIZZARE"!
10.0~Good Plot, Good Actors, Amazing Movie Chibichasechan Sign in Permalink I must say when I first watched this movie, I loved it, I loved the plot, music, characters, and the actors. The actors are so good in this movie that I surprised that they were even acting, and pretending to be like the people in the movie. Johnny Depp really did his best in this one, and I was not even the smallest surprised that he did an amazing job in this movie. Seriously, if they picked anyone else for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, then I would not like this movie, and no one else would like it. Everyone I know believes so, and no one yet has stepped up and said something about changing the actor for Captain Jack Sparrow. The writers did an amazing job with the script, but obviously Johnny Depp did a little improv while acting this role. Very good improv at that. All the other actors where good too, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffory Rush, which happened to also be one of my favorite characters in the movie also. Oh yes, the role of Barbossa really knocked me in the head. His acting was almost as good as Johnny Depp's. The way he looked and talked just freaked the hell out of me and I just wanted to scream my lungs out. The special effects in this movie also got me too, the way the Skeletons look when the moon rises really got me. The special effects people did an amazing job at that, as well as the Make-Up people. Putting Make-Up on Johnny must of been tiring for both him and the people, as his role had a lot to do with that. I for one would not like it at all, I can't even handle 2 days of it. 10/10, most people would agree that this movie is very stunning, and well done. The actors play their roles as if they themselves are that person, and all the other people who made this film possible, I bow down to your success pf getting into half of the worlds hearts.
7.0~A fun movie. samrs Sign in Permalink Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Carribean is one of those summer films where you can have a fun time. It is nowhere near a masterpiece, but it doesn't have to be. Johnny Depp stole the show as Jack Sparrow, and Rush was excellent as the villian. The visuals are very good, which adds to the experience. Keira Knightley is a pretty face, but she has yet to show her real acting abilities, she sure didn't show it in this movie. Orlando Bloom was pretty dull as well, he didn't really have anything to do other than follow Depp around. Overall, a fun film. 7.5/10
10.0~The good Captain Sparrow abcvision Sign in Permalink With so many options to experience a movie from IMAX, 3D, surround or on a regular TV the options are overwhelming. I can now say I have been spoiled and can never go back. As part of the SuperPOPS! Concerts Series, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra played alongside of a full screen version of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. First the Friday night I attended on this two night series was packed; you simply could not fill another person in the room. This Pirates series revolves around the adventures of Captain Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who has a good heart but a mischievous spirit and a heart of a pirate. The kind Captain Sparrow simply wants to recapture a ship so that he can lead a team of merry men on the high seas. This is the problem; he crosses paths with wily Captain Barbossa who steals his ship the Black Pearl. Unbeknown to Sparrow the Barbossa crew has a curse that can only be removed from the blood of a living decedent of a pirate. With maiden Elizabeth Swann in the mix, the British fleet gets in the mix lead by a charming Commodore Norrington all to make a fun witty old school pirate tale. At first you think that the presence of a full orchestra will be a distraction but Conductor Richard Kaufman quickly took command of the ASO and they seamless blended into the background and you are transformed to a magical journey to the high seas. Simply a fantastic experience to see these artist in full swing and the only, I mean only way to see a movie. Coming up December is a full schedule of holiday treats, do not miss out to hear this music loud and reignite the spirit of the season.
10.0~Awesome Movie gothicmania27 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp has been a favorite of mine for awhile and He is an Amazing actor. All the Pirate of the Caribbean movies are amazing. Johnny Depp plays his part very very well in all these movies. There will be new Pirates of The Caribbean movie coming soon. I know Johnny Depp will do an Amazing Acting Job in it. In the Next movie of pirates of the Caribbean will be the most awesome one. It's Like Harry Potter each pirates of the Caribbean you watch they get better and better. So the next Pirates of The Caribbean Movie will be awesome. Johnny Depp is a very Powerful Actor in every movie i seen with him. He will always be one of my favorite Actors of all time.
9.0~Completely surprised! janne_w Sign in Permalink When we went to see this, we were unprepared. A long time Depp fan, both my husband and I had never seen him in such a role. We didn't know that this movie was supposed to be a comedy. Sometimes other Depp characters come across funny but I think that is his own little "edge" when acting. He has fun and it's contagious. Anyway, this time the character charmed us into loving him. How can you not love this goofy pirate? The film itself was done beautifully. The stunts and special effects were brilliant. Yes, it was a lot of fun, but then I always loved that ride at Disneyland best anyway... I guess I'm biased.
10.0~The worlds best movie xshellbabix Sign in Permalink Will turner (Orlando Bloom), Comodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), and Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) need the help of a pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) from deadly pirates. Everyone fears for Elizabeth's fate in the hands of pirates but they all resort to the help of a pirate to take them to where Elizabeth has been taken hostage, the Black Pearl. It is the most feirsome pirate ship in the Caribbean and captained by Captain Barbosa (Geoffry Rush) and his crew, whom are all hiding the secret of why they took Miss Swann. Will Turner and Captain Jack Sparrow voyage out. But can they track down the Black Pearl? Can they save Elizabeth?
7.0~memorable Johnny Depp SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her. The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history.
7.0~A decent (but overrated) adventure flick. Rectangular_businessman Sign in Permalink I enjoyed the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie. I consider it to be a very well done pop-corn flick which was very well directed, managed to combine in a clever way the comedy, the adventure, the action and the fantasy (And this even adds some little hints of horror) without insulting the intelligence of the viewers. It is something that whole family could enjoy, and it certainly has many virtues that deserve appreciation: The production values are wonderful, the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is excellent, and the performances of the entire cast were more than appropriate. Even when the story of the movie isn't very deep or complex, the result is pretty satisfying. What I don't understand is the absurd comparisons between this movie and superior films such as "The Lord of the Rings" from Peter Jackson or the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Those movies are in a completely different league, and (for me, at least) were life-changing experiences, with many memorable scenes, while this didn't have anything remotely comparable to that. "Pirates of the Caribbean" it's a decent adventure flick, but it's way too overrated. Well, at least this movie was worth-watching and entertaining, unlike the sequels.
8.0~Good blend of action and story simpsonguy27 Sign in Permalink This swashbuckling adventure movie, simply put, blew me away. I had seen it multiple times as a child and I liked it then. But now that I'm an adult, I love it. When I watched it when I was younger, I mainly just viewed it as a mindless action movie with pirates in it. Now I understand it a lot better, with the treasure /curse being the focal point of the movie. This aspect of it drives the movie forward, while also having some fantastic action sequences inter-spliced throughout. The pacing of it was great, in a similar regard. Also let's not dismiss the acting here. They brought in some heavy hitters...Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush,...and they ALL hit it out of the park. The crew of this film also did an amazing job, having good time-appropriate costumes and the effects were decent, given when it was made. Overall, the first Pirates is a great way to spend two and a half hours. It might seem like a long running time, but it does not drag at all, as each minute is filled with cinematic bliss.
10.0~I LOVED this movie!! apriluofa Sign in Permalink There has rarely been a film that I wanted to watch 2 times in 1 day..but this is definitely one of the few. There was just something about the movie that draws you in. The acting for one is great. I thought Johnny Depp was hilarious..just the way he walked and talked..but it fit the character perfectly and really made him stand out. He couldn't have done a better job. And Orlando Bloom..besides the fact that he's a great actor is of course yummy as always and apparently has great tastes in movies (first LOTR and now this). It's nice to see Hollywood producing movies that don't have the same feeling of 5000 movies before them. Definitely a 10/10.
10.0~Fun movie cbatch17 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was, in fact, much better than I expected it to be. I was dragged to see it by some friends, and I have thanked them many times for making me come. Johnny Depp is awesome as Captain Jack Sparrow; in my opinion he steals the show. This is definitely a fun, swashbuckling adventure, which is exactly what Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer wanted. The DVD is one of the best of the year, as noted by myself along with various newspapers and magazines. The writing, especially for Captain Jack Sparrow's part, was clever. Citizen Kane it's not, but definitely one of my favorite movies of the year and probably one of my favorites ever!
6.0~just OK with me lpersons-2 Sign in Permalink I love pirate movies. I love Erroll Flynn type Pirate movies. This was a disappointment to me. I thought that Johnny Dep was a poor choice for the main character. I like Johnny Dep, but the portrayal of a pirate is a reach.... not at all believable. He seemed to soft to be a pirate, not rugged enough. There were some good scenes, but not the ones with Johnny Dep. If you are going to watch this movie don't expect a classic Pirate Movie, you will be disappointed. I have no real desire to see part two any time soon. I don't think the characters were developed enough and it felt like the movie is probably catering to the kids and not to adults. It had no historical value either and seemed to be done on a limited budget. Just not as good as all the hype.
10.0~Best film, EVER! Unmissable! bacardi_babe88 Sign in Permalink Before I saw this film I really wasn't fussed on Pirates, Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom, now I love them!! This film was absolutely spectacular!!! You haven't lived if you haven't seen it. Anyone who cares to disagree clearly has a problem or are jealous of the wonderful performances by the actors in it. Johnny Depp is by far the best! He fits the role perfectly, and is also VERY sexy ;-) The music in the film is great too, I had to buy the soundtrack after i had seen it. The extras on DVD are fantastic!! You HAVE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film :-D I would be VERY VERY surprised and shocked if this didn't receive a few Oscars!
10.0~There is no Pirates without Depp Tessa11 Sign in Permalink So scrap it and move on. Leave the 5 films as a classic. Don't ruin it like the Star Wars Franchise. Keep Depp and get some descent writers to keep him from being a dragged down lush. He's supposed to be an anti-hero...and Captain of a ship, not what is in the last film. Black Pearl is the gold standard....and Depp needs to still be part of the franchise.
8.0~A Fun Movie With a Great Cast of Characters performing_x_dream Sign in Permalink Personally, I thought that one of the major reasons this movie was popular was because of the cast. Johnny Depp does an OUTSTANDING job playing Jack Sparrow in this movie. Along wtih Orlando Bloom, Kierra Knightley, etc. They all really play their character perfectly, and almost everyone who is a fan of those three actors/actresses will definitely want to see this movie. The music is also quite impressive, and really sets the mood for the film, especially with some of the ship scenes. Not to mention, a very creative and beautifully written plot that really gets you hooked on while watching the film. Probably not one of the best films ever made, but you will still have a great time watching and enjoying the film. :-)
7.0~Fun but hugely overrated tramsbottom Sign in Permalink I saw POTC at the cinema and wasn't that blown away by it to be honest. So I rented it to see if maybe I liked it more second time around, seeing as how everybody seems to rate it so highly. But no, I still think it's overlong, unfunny and...just average really. It's not the worst film ever, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 'best film of the summer' taglines either. There's too much talk and not enough action IMO, and the leads are pretty to look at, but utterly bland in the acting stakes (Bloom and Knightley have all the sexual chemistry of two wet towels being thrown together). And Depp is just annoying. What's so 'brave' about a performance that basically comes down to pretending to be drunk for the entire movie. Brave? I'd call it lazy if anything. And I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, before you beat me with clubs. Cutthroat Island however, is a much better pirate movie IMO. Hell, all the best action in POTC is stolen from this very movie (the monkey, the ship-to-ship firefight, characters getting trapped in the hold before the ship blows up). Don't get me wrong, I liked POTC, but can't help but feel it's hugely overrated, especially compared to the bombastic action in Cutthroat Island. I hope POTC 2 is an improvement
10.0~One of the 48 best movies there are!!!! themovienut27plus Sign in Permalink This was the best movie of the summer!!!! It had me laughing a lot and Orlando Bloom looks really good!!! Johnny Depp uniquely portrays Captain Jack Sparrow and it's so much fun for everyone!!! Don't wait another second go and see it right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2.0~Pirates of Boredom blunderspleen Sign in Permalink Ho-hum. What the heck is everyone seeing in this film? It's really long and drawn-out, edited in the usual thousand-shots-for-every-three-seconds-of-film Bruckheimer manner, and the script is mediocre at best. The audience I saw it with were psyched when it started, and then what followed was almost two-and-a-half hours of indifferent silence. If this is "the movie we've been waiting for," this summer is finished.... Johnny Depp's performance is jaw-dropping, all right. Jaw-droppingly awful. Skip it!
5.0~Entertaining - but predictable and average overall scerevisiaety1 Sign in Permalink First, the good parts. The film is entertaining with some good pirate action sequences and Johnny Depp does a fabulous job. For a Hollywood pirate action film it isn't too shabby at all. But...that being said there is very little extraordinary about it. Instead it is simply average. The skeleton crew is not very menacing at all - so why did they have to be skeletons? The movie would have worked better with another 'plot' without the curse and just focusing on actual human pirates. The plot is predictable and full of holes. The film could've ended LONG before it did. Most all the roles were cardboard cut outs. There is the handsome hero that is willing to stick his neck out for the girl especially because he isn't encumbered by any societal status. There is the rich suitor that is stuck up and walks so straight and narrowly that he is more robotic than human and thus obviously not the man for the heroine. And finally the heroine that despite living in the past is somehow endowed with all sorts of concepts of the independent modern woman.
10.0~How Movies Should Be Made ARTaylor Sign in Permalink This is one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen. Brilliantly done. This will be one movie that will be remembered for years to come. The story works. I ride the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland all the time. It's so refreshing to see that they just didn't copy the ride story like Haunted Mansion did. It's original and doesn't feel like you're just going on the ride. They used parts of the ride but only when it fit into the story. They could have perfectly well made this story without the ride at all and it still would be good. The scene where Jack is in the prison and the others are trying to get the dog to come over is hilarious, if you've been on the ride. But it's not like the whole movie revolves around that dog. Just one of the subtle touches that people love. I could go on forever on the acting. Every character is perfectly cast. But the two that I must point out is Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. While every single actor and actress does a good job, these two stand above the rest. Barbossa is no nonsense and completely threatening. A villain worthy of the ranks among Darth Vader, Sauron, and Hans Gruber. Jack Sparrow is . . . well he's different. Completely unique. Like none you've ever seen before. Depp plays him almost like Christopher Walken would. He does goofy things with all seriousness. He steals just about every scene he's in. And when those two characters meet it's like when Batman and Superman meet. Two great characters, great on their own and even better together. I just love the way they play off each other. The CGI also terrific. It's not over the top like some movies tend to get. When they need CGI they use it but don't use it everywhere. Just the right amount. The most incredible scene is the Barbossa-Sparrow fight. The two go in and out of the moonlight, both turning into skeletons, and yet the CGI doesn't take away from the fight itself. The CGI use is so great you'd have to go through the movie frame by frame just to get it all. The CGI is just used to enhance the already good story. The soundtrack is outstanding. The music never overwhelms the movie. It fits in perfectly. It's also a great soundtrack to listen to on it's own. It's one of my favorite CDs. Now, no movie is without it's flaws. The rules for the curse seem to change. Like how exactly did Bootstrap Bill get out of the curse? Why does Barbossa die when he's shot before Will drops the coin? It seems that a movie of this size should have had such an important part of the story a little more defined. But unless you really stop and think about it or are just picky like that who cares. Also the last fight scene seems a little tacked on. They just had this huge climatic battle and then they decided to add just one more. It sort of seems like a pistol shot after a cannon blast. It is nice to see Will and Jack working together but after the previous fight it seems to drag the movie on longer than it needs to be. But the movie works anyways. A great movie for everyone to enjoy. Go out and rent this, then go and buy it. You'll love it. A movie you'll never regret seeing.
9.0~Movie Gold, Always a Pleasure to View, lesleyharris30 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's such an entertaining film, I've seen it many times and I still thoroughly enjoy it every time, the story and characters are all executed very well and we are never really sure where the next scene is headed, which is great to see in a movie, you never really know what's going to happen. My only problem is that they tended to hold back on the scary moments, just when the film starts to feel like a bit of a horror and it's sending a shiver down your spine, it would make a joke or do something to completely lighten the mood of these scenes, which I do understand because it wanted to be as kid friendly as possible, but these parts would have a much better effect had they been more thrilling. The cast are of course a major part of what makes this film so great, there is excellent chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush is unrecognizeable as his character, but the star of the show is, without a doubt, Johnny Depp, it will come as no surprise with a character as flamboyant and likable as Captain Jack Sparrow that he manages to steal every scene he's in, certainly one of the most beloved movie characters of all time, for all the right reasons. Action packed, thrilling and also quite funny, I would recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. Will Turner must team up with wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save the governors daughter Elizabeth Swan from a gang of pirates that have become cursed by their ship, the Black Pearl. Best Performance: Johnny Depp
6.0~A decent action/adventure film that has a secret weapon FilmOtaku Sign in Permalink I have never been to Disneyworld or Disneyland so going into this film I had no idea what this movie based on an amusement ride was going to be about except for the fact that it was going to have pirates in it. And lots of them. After seeing this film, I still have no idea what the correlations between the ride and the movie are, but I did come to one solid conclusion: Johnny Depp is an unbelievable actor. Without Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow, this film probably would have still done very well. It's a fun, reasonably well-done swashbuckling film that has a `cute' lead actor (Orlando Bloom), a `cute' lead actress (Keira Knightly) and Geoffrey Rush, a very good actor (who has unfortunately made some, shall we say, `interesting' career choices in the last few years) as the main villain. Plus we have a lot of sword fighting, perilous moments and an undead monkey  all elements that will bring the kids in droves to the multiplex. Myself, I had no interest in seeing it really  mainly because I figured I would either A) embarrass myself by laughing at the pirate-speak, which never fails to set me off, or B) engage in said pirate-speak myself, thereby embarrassing both myself and whoever was unlucky enough to drag me to see the film in the first place. I could not ignore the buzz surrounding Johnny Depp's performance however, which ultimately is what got me into the theater in the first place. He is *so* incredible as Jack Sparrow that even a subtle facial expression or use of body language was enough to make me laugh out loud. I have long respected his career since he eschewed the mainstream `hunk' roles that he seemed to be genetically predisposed to doing after his stint on 21 Jump Street in favor of more avant garde fare, but this particular performance solidified my opinion that he is one of the best actors we have in the industry right now. I remember hearing that he had taken this role last year and was disappointed that he seemed to be jumping from his independent/obscure film repertoire in favor of commercialism, but his inspired performance will without a doubt get me into the theater to see the sequel(s). In terms of the direction, I had absolutely no problem with Gore Verbinski's approach. I found it to be atmospheric and evenly paced, and the special effects were impressive as well. Conclusively, a good movie  with Johnny Depp, a great movie. --Shelly
9.0~I feel I should clarify an earlier review. Aaron1375 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed it when I saw it at the theater, but I was very much sleep deprived at the time so I didn't catch everything. On having gotten the DVD, I can say that there are no plot holes are such as I thought there were then. It is also still a very good and funny movie when I watch after having loads of sleep. Why oh why, though is this movie rated pg-13? Seems to me it should be pg easily. I mean pg means parental guidance and I do believe many eight year olds would love it. Just seems the ratings board has forgotten that movies like Jaws and all the earlier James Bond movies were rated pg. I just think they under use that rating to a ridiculous extreme these days. I also thought Spider-man should have been pg. Well enough of that, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family with action comedy and all that good stuff.
10.0~Pirate's Life. andreasbushi Sign in Permalink An amazing, nostalgic movie I would recommend everybody to see!
8.0~Disney makes good movies robert-710-767167 Sign in Permalink Disney makes good movies sometimes. In this case it's a pirate movie. I normally don't really care for pirate movies, but this one was quite well done! Good acting, funny humor, many cool scenes, and so on. It was actually quite interesting how the story went together so well. It was a bit confusing, but still was very interesting. I liked the CGI and how that worked. Considering how much technology has advanced since then. I hopefully will get the chance to watch the two other movies soon and I hope that they will be as good as this one! And I heard it was based off a ride, not a book. I'm very impressed.
7.0~typical pirates story, but astonishingly catching dcldan Sign in Permalink Jack Sparrow is a pirate without ship, the evil Captain Barbosa has stolen the Black Pearl (jack's ship) and he wants to recover it. Qill Turner is a young smith that is in love to Elisabeth Swann, the noble of the island. When she is kidnapped by Barbosa, he and Sparrow will work together (more or less) to defeat the evil Barbosa. This is the curious thing that surprised everybody, it has anything new, special effects are nowadays typical, it should be one senseless unknown film, but it had a great success. Why? Depp's acting as Jack Sparrow was just superb (nomination to Oscar included), he is able to make o charismatic character that all becomes easy when he is by there. Showing us one of the best character presentation in the last years, he is the one who really supports the movie. Rest of characters are correct and charismatic, but it is not SO impressive, this is the main thing of the movie, all actors make a good and catching part. In addition, the special effects are fabulous (as expected in such a expensive-to-make film), it is filled with stupid funny jokes (which you laugh because they are them) and a very confusing plot (who is friend of who??), but the result is funny and absolutely enjoyable.

Jack Sparrow embarks in a mission to regain his stolen ship and the governor's daughter. betsy_depp Sign in Permalink THe movie "Pirates of the Caribbean(curse of the black pearl)gave me what I expected...FUN and enjoyment,I fell in love with Johnny Depp(who looked very cute by the way, despite all the makeup on his face)as Captain Jack Sparrow,He really delivered his role very well.He was funny and scary at the same time!!The cast was amazing,Orlando Bloom and Goeffrey Rush did amazing as well.The movie was injected with humor,mystery and suspense!!The sword fights was very entertaining.The story was a little predictable,though,but either way It was a good movie.You will laugh,you will scream and you will love it!I know I did!One of Johnny Depp's best movies.I can't wait for the next one!
3.0~Ok over all in spite of being a Bruckheimer film Mentat327 Sign in Permalink Over all the movie ended up being ok, in spite of the fact it could have been great. But as anyone who's familiar with Jerry Bruckheimer movies knows, lots of scenes ended up being over dramatized, over humored, grossly contrived scenarios, a lot of style with very little substance, and generally for people with low intellect and attention spans. But as someone else pointed out, it should at least be pretty fun for the kids. Johnny Depp's character, while over the top, was still pretty entertaining as a pirate who's got a screw loose, or one sandwich shy of a picnic (which in the movie seems to mean having effeminate mannerisms). All the other characters are mind numbingly cliched. The real stars of the movie, of course, are the special effects. Spectacular transition effects done almost seamlessly. So gather of the kids and head on down to the matinee. If you're an adult, you might want to have a drink first and check your IQ at the door. Trust me; you'll have a better time.
10.0~Awesome movie jennifer1224 Sign in Permalink I think that POTC is a very good movie if you are looking for a good laugh. The antics of Captain Jack Sparrow are hilarious, as are the antics of the two "dumb" pirates. The costumes are fantastic, as are the sets. The plot may be a little campy, but it adds to the fun. A great movie to see with kids, the MPAA rating is a bit higher than it probably should be. This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, and the writers did an excellent job keeping the plot moving along. The movie is quite long, but it flies by. After watching this, I couldn't' wait to enter the world of Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann once more. There are also many inside jokes from the Disney World attraction present.
1.0~Shockingly poor turborory Sign in Permalink There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself... Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness. Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.
8.0~Once in a while, a Hollywood film wins Jack_Acid Sign in Permalink Make no mistake; this is a true Hollywood movie, through and through. But it's an entertaining one, to be sure. I was skeptical of its integrity when I learned it was "based" on the Disneyland ride, let alone a Disney film. But again, it does entertain from start to finish and despite moments of cheesy humor, it's serious enough to satisfy those seeking a more "real" approach. For the most part, it's historically correct. Thankfully, they used fictitious characters instead of tarnishing the reputations of true high sea swashbucklers such as Ed Teach (Blackbeard) and John Rackham (Calico Jack). Depp pulls off a convincing character in Jack Sparrow, especially when you think he based the character on Keith Richards (mannerisms, hair and all). Rush also shines as Barbossa, while Bloom and Knightley fulfill their roles fittingly, though their performances are hardly outstanding. This has more to do with the script than their abilities. The cinematography and CG effects are outstanding and very convincing. Another thing this film does pull off well is character development. They successfully illustrate 8-10 mainstay characters (lead and supporting) without bogging the story down or leaving things incomplete. This is quite rare in a film and I was pleased at how well it was pulled off. All in all, if you haven't seen this film, do so. Though you may not be blown away, you should at least be entertained.
10.0~Excellent Disney Film! bljk_15 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is in fact, in my opinion the best film Disney has come out with so far. I went to the movies twice to see this when it came out. I have to tell you there is not one second in this film that is not either good, entertaining or fascinating! I really like Johnny Depp's character (Captain Jack Sparrow), he's really good with doing that character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are also good, as well as Geoffery Rush. Anyway, this movie is great...actually it's terrific! If you have not yet seen it, go to the store, buy this movie and then sent down and watch it. I can guarantee you will not regret it! Trust me, you will love this movie.
2.0~copy of monkey island adammcadam Sign in Permalink Basically this film has completely copied the famous 1990 computer game monkey island. In which the governors daughter is kidnapped by an undead pirate ghost and you have to rescue her. It even copies ideas like being stranded on an island and going crazy (like how herman toothrot was stranded on monkey island for so long and went mad). The idea of finding a ship and a crew. And it copies other things like not only it being set in the caribbean and having a voodoo lady, but the actual set and having to row through a swamp to get to the voodoo lady's shack, pirate towns made of broken ships and so many things just completely lifted from the game and lazily put into the film. The main villain of Pirates of the Caribbean also looks identical to the villain in Monkey Island. If you search for this on google, youtube, or anything, you can see how pirates of the caribbean just completely ripped off this game and is a really uninspired unoriginal film. The thing I did like about the film is probably Johnny Depp who seemed to play an alright quirky, silly pirate.
10.0~An Excellent Family Adventure alley117 Sign in Permalink Walt Disney's beloved theme park ride comes to life in the hilariously entertaining comedy-action film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Pirates stars Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley with a supporting cast of Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally, and Zoe Saldana. Set in the picturesque 18th century Spanish Main (part of the New World empire), Pirates of the Caribbean delivers an exhilarating adventure that will keep the viewers coming back for more! The film opens with young Will Turner (Bloom) being rescued from a ship wreck by Captain Norrington's (Davenport) crew as they are sailing from England to Port Royal. Young Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) is present and discovers a medallion on the unconscious Will. She steals it, fearing he is a pirate. Eight years later, Elizabeth, who just happens to be the governor's daughter, has become quite the beauty and has captured the attention of both Captain-soon-to-be-Commodore Norrington and the all-grown-up Will Turner. Elizabeth is secretly in love with Will, however, she is unable to profess her love due to his lowly status as a blacksmith. Elizabeth's life is further complicated by the arrival of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow who after threatening Miss Swann and crossing blades with Turner, is thrown in jail. To make matters worse, a band of pirates lead by Captain Barbossa attack Port Royal and abducts Elizabeth in search of the medallion she possesses. Desperate to rescue Elizabeth, Will enlists Jack's help, who only agrees to help in order to get back his beloved ship, The Black Pearl, stolen by Barbossa. With this unlikely pair, a damsel in distress, a villainous crew of pirates who aren't all that they appear to be and plenty of sword fighting, Pirates leads its viewers on a swashbuckling adventure with an explosive finale. Gore Verbinski does a fantastic job at directing this film, engaging the audience from start to finish. With contrasting scenes of light and dark, choppy angled camera shots and breathtaking panoramas of the Caribbean islands and sea, Verbinski puts the audience at the center of the adventure. After all, Pirates is based on a theme park ride, and the movie is nothing short of exciting. For example, during the epic ship battle scene, Verbinski alternates low angle, close-up shots of the ships' bows pitching in the waves with high angle, long shots of the whole ship and its crews fighting. He also uses a plethora of close-up cannons going off and guns being fired in succession with facial expressions to convey the intensity of the situation, providing an utterly thrilling sequence of scenes that creates a vicarious experience for the audience. Above all else, however, is the impeccable performance by Johnny Depp. Borrowing mannerisms from rocker Keith Richards and adding his own drunken- inspired flair, Depp is convincing as a seasoned pirate with a vendetta on a no holds barred quest. Depp reaches deep into himself to bring Captain Jack Sparrow to life, completely immersing himself into his character and capturing the audience with his bad-boy charm and devil-may-care attitude mixed with his feminine swaying walk and "guy-liner." Balancing Sparrow between villain and hero, Depp enchants the audience into sympathizing with Jack. Much of Depp's brilliance as Sparrow is conveyed solely through the body language of Jack. Even when he has no lines, Depp's Sparrow engages the audience through quirky facial expressions and woozy bodily movements; even when he is an observing character he keeps the attention on him. Perhaps Depp's most crowning moment comes when Sparrow is marooned on an island with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. Depp manages to play off Jack's unrestrained interest in Miss Swann without offsetting the audience who has already invested in Will and Elizabeth's love for one another, and when Elizabeth burns all of his rum, Depp brilliantly portrays Jack's baffled rage in what may be the funniest portion of the film. Although a great movie by itself, Depp elevates the film to epic status. All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderfully entertaining film that is great for all ages. Classic and original all in once, Pirates of the Caribbean is not your average pirate epic, but a fresh and captivating story with traditional underscores. This film is a must see for anyone who enjoys an action packed, adventure with lovable and endearing characters and larger than life special effects.
10.0~Something to remember when you're into your second century. mullaryn Sign in Permalink The theme of pirates is a very common one in movie-making. There hasn't been a high enough level of mathematics invented yet to number the pirate cartoons made. Several of the 'immortal' classics such as 'Treasure Island' are about pirates. And of course, Hollywood has it's share in the pirate stories: 'Cutthroat Island' (I don't know why it flopped), 'Treasure Island', and variants have all graced or disgraced our screens for decades. And then this... I truly think that pirate movies aren't going to get better than POTC. The plot is original, surprising, and impossibly dynamic, the humor fresh and unforced, the filming absolutely stunning, and the acting thorough and enjoyable. Watching Jack Sparrow (by the way, the entire image of Jack Sparrow was left up to Johnny Depp. I can't imagine how it could've turned out better) clamber, sway, and in extreme cases fall through trembling holds, cages, and rigging was something that I know I will look back upon in about twenty years with just as much relish as I do now. The brilliant dynamic created by the sarcastic, irreverent Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the uber-eccentric, hilarious, infinitely scheming Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is something that cannot accurately be described by anyone on this earth. Add to that some semi-peripheral roles that only enhance the humor and action, and you get a masterpiece. The sets were filmed on location using real ships (well... 2/3 real ships), real ocean, real islands, and a specially constructed real fort, giving this movie an authenticity that serves to endear it even more. There is something in this movie that will appeal to anyone: action lovers, wisecracks, the romantic souls, those that like to tickle their nerves with semi-scary images, the thinkers, ANYONE. Should you watch this movie? Of course! And bring the kids along too... the skeletons and such, they're not even really scary. The whole movie is almost like a story, in fact. A very fast-paced, engrossing, exciting, and profound story.
10.0~The Best Summer Blockbuster I have ever seen Bigfootballfan Sign in Permalink This movie flat out rocks. It has all the elements of a great blockbuster. This is what a summer movie is supposed to be about. Tons of comedy, action, and enough light-hearted fun. Johnny Depp is unforgettable as strange Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow has got to be one of the best and most original characters ever created. Geoffrey Rush is good bringing teeth-gnashing to an utmost evil yet playful pirate. Having Depp and Rush on the screen provides most of the films energy, which is more than enough. Orlando Bloom is fine in a light part, and Keira Knightley just plain enjoys herself as Elizabeth. The cinematography and special effects are remarkable. They are all convincing and entertaining. When matched with Klaus Badelts score scenes like the first time we see the sailors in full skeletal display take on an eerily lifelike quality thats unlike anything I have ever seen before. Just go out and get it. Turn your brain off for two and half hours and just enjoy the ride.
10.0~Pirates malmsteneino Sign in Permalink This is best Pirates of the Caribbean film. Orlando Blood is good Will turner
10.0~. sandrukisbd Sign in Permalink In my opinion, this film is one of the most gripping films i've ever seen. And it isn't only the own film, it's all the saga. It has a great actors like Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Jack Sparrow is an eccentric character, as Johnny Depp usually is. The film has moments of all type. There are so great moments of adventure, laughs and, more like a secondary story, so many moments of love between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. I think Will Turner is so brave, because he has a infighting between being a pirate or not, and it wants to save her although he isn't noble. She is so brave too, because she risks her life and lies to protect him.
1.0~You will probably like it... though it doesn't deserve it. danila_1 Sign in Permalink Disclaimer: I saw a moderately crappy cam-version with a crappy dub (50% translation, 50% own creation). Most people seem to enjoy this flick and I guess that chances are that you will too. I saw it (better to say some parts of it) yesterday and to say I was disappointed is to say nothing. After about one hour my dad said he can't bear it anymore and walked out. I followed him, but later returned, since I had to kill time somehow. My mother and 19 y.o. sister moderately enjoyed it (or may be just thought it would get better), but after less than two hours said they will watch it sometime later (read 'never') and stopped it. Well, my impression was that the movie was pretty stupid and cliche. May be not the worst script, but nothing to write home about. The acting was either over the top (Johnny Depp) or bland and boring (everyone else). There might have been some brilliant special effects that I missed on the cam-copy, but I doubt it. There was hardly any sea worth looking at, and everything else was taken out of the Hollywood library of generic effects. If you have nothing better to do, see it on the big screen, may be it will look cool (it probably won't). Don't pay much for the tickets, though.
9.0~action packed, funny and well done williameyewtiger Sign in Permalink this is definitely one of the best action movie i've ever seen. Not only that it is action-packed, it is also very funny and light in various ways, thanks to the good performance by actor johnny Depp, whose role is funny, light and courageous. The performances of the other main actors are also admirable. I would also have to say that the roles of the villains are also amazing, with spectacular make ups, which creates good imageries of pirates. The visual and special effects throughout the entire movie are also great. I would also have to say that the choice of the settings are also well done; which brings up the genre.The soundtrack throughout the film are also cleverly composed. In my view this original pirates of the Caribbean is the best action movie yet .
9.0~Excellent, Johnny Depp steals the show jemicron-1 Sign in Permalink Another triumph for Johnny Depp showing his range as an actor. His Captain Jack Sparrow is a surprisingly effective blend of Errol Flynn and Bugs Bunny that keeps the story moving with wit and adventure. The rest of the cast is strong, too and the story is well written. Geoffrey Rush is delightfully villainous as Barbarossa. Kiera Knightley is the perfect heroine. Orlando Bloom stands out as well. The story has enough tension and excitement to keep you on edge to the end. It's great to have good acting and a wonderful story in a family movie that can really be enjoyed by all ages. I'm looking forward to the sequel. A must see!
8.0~A good movie, a must see.. khanalian Sign in Permalink Good movie, lots of good old pirate action, but the story is a little thin.. it's clearly that this movie has been made for the effects alone... hope there's a sequel on the way, cause the theme is GREAT! Johnny Deep is Awesome! His role as Jack Sparrow is the best role in the movie and Deep is matching it perfectly! A must see movie.
9.0~boy, was I surprised! kittiwake-1 Sign in Permalink A movie based on a Disney ride. A movie based on a Disney ride. Hmm. Does it sound appealing?? No. But did I finally watch it?? OH, yeah! Loved the casting. Can we do something with what's-her-name's teeth, though? At parts, looks like she's trying to pout over the overbite. Not attractive. But Johhny Depp??? Incredible job as the Pirate who helps others only to help himself. ("Don't do anything stupid"..."like that..." *sigh*) I am looking forward to the sequel, but not seeing it in theaters... Cause I'm going to buy it straight-out. I know it will be worth it as long as Disney didn't drop the ball. I can't imagine Depp signing back on if they had. So, looking forward to it. This movie is a must-buy. The casting, acting, direction and cinematography/choreography were all almost flawless. The special effects were well-done. Disney's getting better at the CGIs. (Hooray.) You'll love it for the plot. It's safe to root for the underdog again. You'll love it for the characters. How sweet the attraction between the main characters. Great family movie. Pop a large bowl of popcorn, grab your drinks, and have fun. Much better than the ride at Disney. (I don't want to see the Hall of Presidents on screen, so please, Disney, draw the line before you go too far, but good job on this one.)
8.0~Pirates of the Caribbean DesertDogMedia Sign in Permalink Title: Pirates of the Caribbean Condensed Storyline: A group of cursed pirates are looking for pieces of Aztec gold which a woman called Elizabeth has, she gets kidnapped so a black smith has to team up with a pirate to rescue her Notable Acting: This entire franchise stands on the shoulders of Johnny Depp, he is what gives this movie it's spark. No matter how great Geoffrey Rush's, Orlando Bloom's or Keira Knightley's acting was if the main character of Jack Sparrow wasn't done right, the movie would have fell on deaf ears, mainly because this movie was suppose to be about Will and Elizabeth's characters, but it was just as much about Jack and Barbossa. So everyone really needed each other to make the drama and tension work for this movie. Graphics: The skeleton crew of the Black Pearl are nice effects to say the least Incorrect Science: The boat scene at the beginning is impossible because you would need to have the strength of 100 men plus the weight of them to keep that boat from floating to the surface, mainly because wood floats and the air trapped in it that they are using to breath would make it float more Incorrect History: Granny Smith apples were not discovered until 1868 "Bob's your uncle" was not used until 1890 Concertina was not invented until 1829 Trapdoor gallows weren't invented until 1800 Incorrect Geography: Gunships are generally too big to sail in Jamaican waters Overall Feel: This movie was one of the biggest gambles Disney had made up until this point, as Disney always liked being family friendly. They found that this movie worked they would continue milking this franchise for another 5 movies up to this point. There are a lot of science and history errors in this movie, but it is made to be an action, adventure, comedy flick. I liked this movie as it had a solid cast, decent budget, good effects. Everything you would want from a fun movie which doesn't take it's self too seriously. This movie was based on the ride of Pirates of the Caribbean, but there is little to no reference to the ride in this movie, there is more reference to the previous Disney in this movie than the ride. But the movie was made to be its own movie, so it stands by its own merits and works great.
10.0~Well worth the watch!! JulianGerami Sign in Permalink This film is full of humor, action and special effects, basically what everybody loves in films. Johnny Depp displays another superb character to go with his other creations such as 'Edward Scissor-hands' and 'Sleepy Hollow'. Of course, Orlando is a young actor and has done some tremendous work for 'Lord of the Rings', i don't think this is the best we've seen him but he can only get better, and i believe he will. This flick has a great fight scene at the end between Depp and Rush and the score just makes it so energised and keeps your eyes stuck to the screen. I truly say, if you ever get the "Oppotune-moment", watch it.
10.0~An excellent surprise sweetrupturedlight Sign in Permalink This was a movie whose trailor was played all day, everyday, as the build-up to the release loomed here in Cape Town. Me, im one for swash-buckling pirates and handsome hero's, so of course i was intruiged and dutifully paid the fee to see the movie, although i have to add that my expectations were sky high, and this is normally a recipe for intense disappointment. But not this day, this movie. It had me from the opening sequence, to the end credits and left me wanting more. i found the entire movie a marvel, the characters well scripted and perfectly brought to life. above all of that though, the humour and wit brought forth by the wondeful Jack Sparrow and counterparts made the film. the chemistry was perfect and this is definitely a movie i would indeed pay to see once again. as mentioned, Johnny Depp was PERFECTLY cast as Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow that is. He melded with this character and there is truthfully none other i could see in the role. it was tailor made and he fit it like a glove. it was also interestingly refreshing to see him in a role that departed from the "Sleepy Hollow" "From Hell" spectrums of the last few years. Orlando Bloom, an actor surrounded with much hype. and i have to say much deserved. He was fantastic, and a wonderful support. Will Turners chemistry with Captain Jack is a marvel to watch and i found myself smiling an aweful lot. and yes, i too drowned in his gorgeously long lashed eyes! Kiera Knightly, the herione is one that i did not care for much. despite her success in Bend it like Beckham, Kiera never really captivated me, but even she had me smiling and praising the casting directors for their choice. she was lovely and a wonderful foil for the otherwise all male cast. there is no other rating but 5/5; 10/10 Excellent, and more inportantly a movie that EVERYONE, adult and child alike would love. something for everyone!!!
10.0~Klaus Badelt's score is phenomenal twohandz Sign in Permalink This really is one of the best adventure movies of this year (possibly of all time) but as yet another glowing review would be redundant, I will instead focus on the score. Klaus Badelt's score is amazing. If you don't already own the CD for this movie, buy it. Though not quite a prodigy of Hans Zimmer, they often work together, and I know his style has been compared to Zimmers, but Badelt's style goes beyond Zimmer's in originality, and freshness, and the result is one of the best scores of all time, in my opinion. I do have to say, however, that I am disappointed to learn that Badelt will not be reprising his role as composer in the upcoming Pirate's films, and that sadly Zimmer has ousted him for that spot. I do not believe he will be able to do them justice.
10.0~So many great aspects, you should see it many times. selene_666 Sign in Permalink The first time I saw Pirates, like most other teenage girls, I went for Orlando Bloom. The second time I went for Johnny Depp's outrageous character Jack Sparrow and for the incredibly complex plot twists. The third time was for the rest of the characters. The most intriguing of these characters is Commodor Norrington. He is in a position, especially given that this is a Disney movie, for the audience to despise him: he is not evil, but he is the competing love interest for Orlando's girl. Yet Norrington is selfless, perceptive, and a strong leader. Unlike anyone else in this movie, he is everything he claims to be. I won't describe the plot twists here, but I will say that all of it was unpredictable and brilliant. The staging and the music impressed me as well, from Sparrow's majestic appearance, to the treasure cavern, to the heartstopping final gunshot.
5.0~An okay goofy pirate adventure, but kinda boring and forgettable Wuchakk Sign in Permalink I don't go to the theater too often. A film really has to light my fire to get me to actually go out and see it. Well, "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" got me interested enough to go see it when it was released in the summer of 2003. Why was I so interested? Probably because I occasionally enjoy fun adventure films in the manner of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981) or "The Mummy" (1999). "Black Pearl" is a film of this ilk. WHAT WORKS: The film looks and sounds great, which includes the actors, costuming, cinematography, locations and score. Johnny Depp as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow is a notable character; Sparrow comes off as a young Keith Richards gone Pirate. Keira Knightley is beautiful as Elizabeth Swann; and Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Lee Arenberg are all fabulous in their roles. WHAT DOESN'T WORK: When I first saw it in 2003 the film struck me as too long for such lightweight fare (2 hours and 23 minutes). It also struck me as boring and forgettable for some reason. I decided to see it again recently and came away feeling the exact same way. What makes it boring and forgettable? I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint. Maybe because it's too drawn-out; light film fare like this works best at around 80-95 minutes. Maybe it's because many of the characters are unable to die because of the curse, which naturally creates a lack of suspense. Mostly it's because the story and characters, although fun, are absurd and superficial. Also, I suppose it's too much to expect to glean some morsel of depth or truth from a film like this. CONCLUSION: "Black Pearl" is a fun, goofy pirate adventure; it's okay but far from great like, say, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or even the 1999 version of "The Mummy." It's overlong, overly light, kinda boring and ultimately forgettable. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a fan and can't recommend it, except maybe to kids. But if it trips your trigger that's great. GRADE: C+
10.0~A brilliant comedy wacky_rockraider_kid_200 Sign in Permalink I can not think of a better person to play Jack Sparrow than Johnny Depp. The part was made for him. Keira Knightley plays the part of Elizabeth excellently and Orlando Bloom did a great job with Will Turner. There is a lot of comedy in the movie, most of it coming from Johnny Depp. There is a part near the start of the movie when Depp comes sailing into Port Royal in a sinking boat and by the time the boat gets to the platform it is just at the right height for Depp to step onto the platform from the crows nest. There is also a thing called the Pirates code that the Pirates will never break, however Captain Barbossa always finds loopholes in the code. I could never get tired of watching this movie
9.0~Captain Jack Sparrow apkr Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl(2003) It is one of the best entertaining movie with a good story line.This is a sit back and enjoy type of movie.This movie is combination of action,adventure, fantasy and humor. The story is about pirates and Britain army at Port Royal in Britain in 17th century with added supernatural theme.It all begins when cursed pirate crew lead by Captain Barbosa(Geoffery Rush) kidnapped Governor's daughter,Elizabeth Swann(keira Knightley).Will Turner(Orlando Broom),local black smith who in love with Elizabeth teams with other pirate Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) to save his love .The Royal navy lead by Commodore James Norrington(Jack Davenport) who also in love with Elizabeth chases them around the Atlantic sea to save Elizabeth and capture the pirates. Johnny Depp gave his best performance as Comical pirate Jack sparrow.Jack's funny dialogues and how he converts every situation to his benefit are the best things in the movie.Orlando Broom is perfect for the role of Will Turner.Geoffery Rush also gave a good performance in a negative role.Though there are some small plot holes in the story,the story is fine.The story is evenly paced.Action scenes and graphics are also good.Soundtrack by Klaus Badelt is amazing. This is perfect movie to watch,if you want to watch the movie just for entertainment.You will enjoy every scene through out the movie.

9.0~Interesting!!!!! Hassanmughal375313 Sign in Permalink When I first heard Disney was going to make a movie out of their Pirates of the Caribbean ride, I (like many others, no doubt) thought it was a horrible idea. I mean, how many movies based on video games worked, let alone movies based on an amusement park attraction. What was next? "Hall of Presidents: The Motion Picture"? But to their credit, Disney not only turned out a good movie, but spawned a billion dollar franchise. Thanks to Johnny Depp's great (and Oscar nominated, no less) performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, great direction by Gore Verbinski, and a storyline that is both action-packed, yet whimsical and fun, Disney made an epic adventure that appealed to all ages. Now Disney is finally releasing the first two films on Blu-ray disc, and they're a true delight for any owners of the high def format. The picture is stunningly sharp and colorful, and I could find nothing to complain about. Every scene...indeed, every frame...was gloriously sharp and beautiful in this 1080p transfer. The audio is equally remarkable, with both a 5.1 uncompressed track and a 5.1 Dolby Digital track sounding fantastic. Watching Pirates on Blu-ray reminded me of why I spent money on the format in the first place...nothing I've seen (including seeing the film in the theater itself) matches the experience of watching the film in this format...it's simply incredible. Disney hasn't slouched on the rest of the package either, making this a 2-disc set, with the second disc containing nearly every single extra that was on the 3-Disc standard release (including all the bonuses from "The Lost Disc" in that set). All those features and bonuses are still shown in 480p, but Disney has included a brand-new interactive documentary on the movie disc, presenting it in 1080p as well. This new documentary, entitled "Scoundrels of the Seas" can be watched in its entirety or can be edited by the viewer so he or she can watch a custom-designed version. By selecting an option in the main menu, viewers can watch the film and then click on "coins" that pop up during the movie, indicating topics available in the documentary. If you want to find out more about that topic, click on your remote when the coin appears. If you don't want to know more, don't click. When the film is over, you'll get to see the documentary with only the topics you clicked on covered. Of course, viewers also have the option of watching the movie without the distraction of the coins, as well as designing their own custom documentary from one of the menus, or just watching the complete documentary straight through. The documentary and custom design makes use of Blu-ray's Java capabilities, so users with stand-alone players and/or PS3's will want to make sure their systems are properly updated. Also on the movie disc is an interactive "Jolly Roger" character that will help guide you through the disc; three separate audio commentary tracks (the same three that appear on the 3-disc standard version); and a handful of 1080p trailers for your enjoyment. Disc Two contains most of the 480p bonus features that were previously released on the 3-disc set, including just extras as a Making-Of documentary; a blooper reel; deleted and alternate scenes; an image gallery; and a few "Easter Eggs" for all you pirates out there to hunt down! Just in time for the theatrical release of the third movie in the trilogy, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a reference-quality Blu-ray release that fans of the movie are just going to love. It's a must- have for Blu-ray owners, no doubt.
10.0~AMAZING! BEST MOVIE OF 2003! faisalakers Sign in Permalink this movie was amazing. whether ur a fan of action, adventure, romance, or thriller, this movie was right for you. i thought everyone did good in the movie and I'm glad they're bringing another pirates of the Caribbean in 2006. the movie starred johnny depp, Orlando bloom, Geoffrey rush, and keira knightley. i guarantee that you wont be disappointed if you watch pirates of the Caribbean. the movie has an excellent soundtrack, great sword fighting scenes, and if you purchase the DVD, tons of great features. even though its a Disney movie, it is for adults as well as teenagers. i thought it would be for kids since it was by Disney, but the movie was more for teenagers and adults. all in all i think that the movie of the year 2003, was Pirates of the Caribbean. I really recommend getting the DVD or if not at least watching the movie! overall pirates of the Caribbean was an A+...5 STARS
10.0~Amazing HMG234 Sign in Permalink Wow. Originally I thought this movie wouldn't be so great, but after I saw it, I realized how stupid I had been. This movie is fantastic. It's Romantic, funny, a little scary, historical, and, of course, action packed. Is there any genre this movie ISN'T? The plot and characters are well-developed, and It's the kind of movie that you just want to see over and over again. And, it seems to get better every time I see it (approximately 10 times)! The only flaw is the fact that if bootstrap bill had in fact taken a piece of gold (which we know he did; he sent it to Will) then he would have been affected by the curse. And..If he was affected by the curse, he would be immortal. So...How did launching him off a cannon into the ocean kill him? I guess that's why there's a "Pirates of the Caribbean 2"... I can't wait. As Captain Jack Sparrow might say, "Go see this movie. Savvy?"
10.0~It was a great pirate tale. godz_little_angel2009 Sign in Permalink I thought that Pirates of the Caribbean was a great movie. i thought Johnny Depp was great as the sexy captain Jack Sparrow. I cant wait till the 2nd part of this story comes out to see more of Johnny and Orlando. The computer graphics were great, they really made the damned crew come to life. Johnny Depp was the best man to cast as Captain Jack Sparrow, he really grabs the character and brings him to life. The action sequences in the movie were extravagant, how Orlando and Johnny danced around sword fighting and the visual effects of battle between two 18th century battle ships. This is definitely the kind of movie that brings the whole family together and has viewers asking for more.
9.0~It's got a bit of everything for everyone. squirrel_burst Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is a grand action film loaded with memorable characters, swashbuckling and great special effects. It's sure to please audiences and leave them roaring for more pirate adventures (which have been provided in the form of 3 sequels as of 2012). Despite a few shortcomings (the curse itself for example, is not well explained) it's just a lot of fun to sit through and it's good for the whole family (assuming the children won't be too frightened by the cursed pirates and can handle the action and violence). It's got everything you could want in a story: romance, action, humour, friendship, chases, even a bit of horror thrown in too. (On Blu-ray, August 11, 2012)
6.0~Good JonWithTheWind Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp was good as always. Also, the usual corny romance between the two main characters wasn't as bad in this movie. Overall, I recommend you see it if you like seeing movies. Good movie based on a ride, but Haunted Mansion???
5.0~The story it's from Monkey Island! arnaugols Sign in Permalink The film it's so good, but the story it's the same than one computer game called "Monkey Island", same story, same characters... Disney don't have new thinks? The first time I see the film I put a 10 for this film, it's very good, the story, the Capitan Sparrow do so good... but when I see the film for the second time I begin to remember some characters and Barbossa for example it's Capitan Lechuck in the game, Jack Sparrow it's Guybrush Threepwood. Capitan Lechuck it's the perfect pirate and it's a ghost, and Guybrush was an awkward teenager whose sole ambition in life was to be a pirate. I don't know, perhaps it's only my imagination, but I found very similarities.
10.0~A Real Surprise. gdiwitt Sign in Permalink Pirates of The Caribbean is a great spectacle of a film that is really a great surprise. Johnny Depp solidifies himself as a superb actor with this film, and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just as good. The special effects are great, and the landscape of the film is breathtaking. Kudos to Geoffrey Rush who is a very versatile actor for giving such a great performance as the villain, and To Jerry Brukhelmer for not letting this film become another watered down Disney product like The Haunted Mansion.
5.0~The Curse of Jack Sparrow Gabrielka214 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean are without a doubt one of the best movie series of all time, but as it happens, The Curse of the Black Pearl is the worst one of these movie series. The jokes are lame, Jack's mimicry not even funny. Elizabeth and Will make a boring couple and there is no chemistry between Keira and Orlando. The story is boring, confusing, twisting into such incomprehensible storyline and dumb scenes, that if you won't sleep yourself to death, then thumb up. But why did I bother to watch the sequels, when this one I didn't like? Because I happened to watch the sequels first and loved the story of The Dead Man's Chest and the sequel of its storyline in the third movie At World'd End. I completely got into the story without even watching the first one, so it seems. Meant as introduction this Curse of the Black Pearl is, but there is no introduction at all. You can well meet the characters in the sequels and don't need to be sorry for skipping this one. Barbossa as the main villain is lame, old, boring and inexpressive, nothing compared what is to come next. He doesn't even have his own soundtrack song, and well, speaking of the OST, there isn't much to say either. I promise, watching the sequels will make you laugh at sophisticated jokes and hold your breath when the REAL enemy comes. This Curse of the Black Pearl is nothing more than a fairytale for 10-year-old boys. The only reason why I've given it 5 stars are for the respect I keep for its two younger brothers.
5.0~Booooooooooooooring Elgroovio Sign in Permalink This is another one of those highly over-popular films like the Lord of the rings trilogy. Of the main cast, the only two actors that I liked were Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, but the rest, especially the over-pretty girl, all make me cringe. The people that made the film were obviously intending to make a swashbuckling classic, but instead they made a swashbuckling pile of cow diarrhoea. It is insulting in the memory of such real swashbuckling heroes of the cinema, such as Erroll Flynn. If this film had been made in the 1930s it would have been a million times better without a doubt, basically because it would be entirely different. I am going to get murdered by the entire world's population of women for saying this, but Orlando Bloom is nothing but another one of those really annoying pretty-boys, but, to be fair, that is just the opinion of an ugly teenager who has to go into school each week and watch all those bloody pretty-boys snogging whoever they want, while all the girls look at me and in disgust. But in my opinion, being ugly and being well aware of the fact isn't such a bad thing. It makes you wiser. But that has nothing to do with the film that I am reviewing so why the hell am I talking about it? Anyway this film is pointless and overlong and completely pathetic, and I am pretty sure that if pirates knew that this film was going to be made, they would have decided to become regular bank-robbers. 5/10 (I am giving it such a high score for Geoffrey Rush's sake. You rule Geoff.)
10.0~Great music and acting abrafocus Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the greatest movies of all time! Johnny Depp gives his best performance in this humorous movie that was inspired by a Disneyland ride, though I didn't really see anything in common, except perhaps the treasure and "dead men tell no tails" bit. *** Spoilers ahead*** Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings trilogy) plays William Turner, a blacksmith/ future pirate. Although he says he never will be a pirate, he does some things that prove he is a good pirate. WARNING! There are a few words that I would classify as bad, but you can mute the words if you know where to look. I own the soundtrack to this movie; I highly recommend it for those who love music.
10.0~Fun kdnor2011 Sign in Permalink The first Pirates of the Carrabean is really entertaining. It has a lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of special effects. All the characters are creative. Will Turner, a blacksmith trying to find his childhood friend, Elizabeth Swann, a hot heroine who certainly isn't a Damsall in Distress, and Captain Jack Sparrow, a wity, crazy pirate that can get out of any situation. There are many other characters too, but they would take too long too explain. My only problem with this film is the problem everyone seems to have with the third film, it's hard to follow. So I don't really care, I just watch the action, and effects. If you're one of the six people who haven't seen this movie, buy it on DVD, it's fun, entertaining, and is just plain great.
10.0~Pirates! What's not to love? TheHande Sign in Permalink I guess I am a bit of a nut when it comes to pirates, but there simply aren't enough films that depict this brilliantly caricatured era. Pirates of the Carribbean adds to the mix a tad of supernatural elements and makes a very standard plot into a fun adventure by adding several memorable characters. The special-effects add to the feeling of the film, but at no point does the film become too big. There's no plot to conquer the world. Everything in the film is very down to earth and personal. Johnny Depp naturally adds to the film with his brilliant performance as Jack Sparrow, possibly one of the most original characters I've seen in a long while. He's become one of my favorites alongside such figures as Darth Vader, Bond and Riddick. A very nicely done adventure. Brilliant movie!
10.0~I thought it was great . . . ChelleMToo Sign in Permalink Honestly, when I first started watching it, I was concerned, because the main pirate (played by Depp) looked like he had some mannerisms that I was going to find annoying. But I generally love Depp movies, and I'm so glad I stuck it out! By the end, well, they didn't really explain all his exaggerated motions, but, let's say it grew on me. This was a fun movie on every level, from just plain enjoying watching Depp do what he does best, to the effects, to the story. I kinda regret not having seen it on the big screen. I will surely be seeing the next TWO, which are in production at this time. During one scene, he takes a swing at seducing a woman. Having enjoyed watching Depp in a romantic role, I was surprised at how smarmy he came off as when he was making his moves. Even though he is an attractive man, he managed to make himself seem, unappealing? Is that even possible? But it was fitting for his character, which is a testament to his talent, as usual. The plot was interesting, they squoze all the ride scenes in, the effects were REALLY good, and the swordfight scenes are just plain fun to watch. Almost as good as the princess bride. :P
10.0~Best movie ever Italia_babe Sign in Permalink I love this movie. It among my top ten. Why do I love it so much? Well, for one thing, the Johnny Depp is one of the best actors in the film. He always comes through with a funny moment and provides comic relief. Also, the plot line, while a bit confusing, was clever and original. There were no holes in it and the plot was tied up. Also, many of the minor characters in their own way were funny. Finally, I thought the ending (which I won't tell you about) was also clever. Plus, you know, johnny+eyeliner=yum :-) <3
8.0~a modern star wars/indiana jones-esquire epic blockbuster with a punch! teaspoonof21grms Sign in Permalink This is the greatest blockbuster epic ever made! It is right on the same level as the Star Wars Trilogy, Indiana Jones Chronicles, and the Spider-Man Movies. The movie follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith. The Black Pearl, which is a haunted ship with a cursed crew, kidnapped the beautiful Ms. Swann (Keira Knightley) in order to undo the curse that was bestowed upon them by Cortes's gold. The reason was she was the holder of a gold coin that they stole, and they needed that coin to undo the curse. Sparrow and Turner are trying to track down and recapture the Black Pearl and Elizabeth Swann. It is a well paced story that must be watched closely for their are many new details revealed along the way of the quest. The set design is impeccable, and possibly the best addition to the film was Depp's incredible performance. He was flawless as Sparrow with great comical timing that made him really stand out in the dry acting submitted by all the other actors. He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination and probably should have won (i haven't seen mystic river). The only flaws were the skeleton pirates were a little lame and Orlando Bloom is possibly the worst actor ever, but he didn't ruin the film because we had Depp to look and marvel at so you forget about Bloom. Overall, this film is one of the greatest summer releases ever made and should go down as a great film in the eyes of critics and audiences. I can't wait for the sequels which will hopefully be as strong as the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Spider-Man sequels were. 8/10
4.0~Johnny Depp Does Cool Stuff!!!! The_Other_Snowman Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp is in this movie. He wears a cool hat and swaggers about like a drunken bohemian on the loose in a boarding school. I could watch him for hours. There's other stuff in this movie. Orlando Bloom possibly plays the hero, but he's about as boring as he's been in every other movie he's pretended to act in. Keira Knightley fails to fill out her dress, but that's okay because she's cute too. Geoffrey Rush plays another retired rock star, and between him and Depp the movie is nearly watchable. I stayed awake through this movie the first time. The second time, not so much. The third time, I'm not sure. I intentionally turned it on a fourth time while I was on a trans-Atlantic flight and needed to sleep. The plot is kind of unintelligible, with characters escaping and getting captured and being held in prisons and escaping again every five minutes or so, and no one ever bothers to clear up which ship they're on at any given moment. It's a little too lead-footed to really be swashbuckling. But anyway, it's got Johnny Depp. He's cool, right? He does stuff in this movie, so that must mean something. I'm not sure what, though.
9.0~Pirate Adventure I_Am_The_Taylrus Sign in Permalink SPOILERS This is a great swashbuckling type of film. It has great sword fights and Johnny Depp's acting is great. It is just too bad he didn't win the Oscar. It is about a group of cursed pirates trying to get the last piece of Aztec Gold to become human. The special effects and makeup are great. The music is great. This movie is a Disney film but that doesn't mean it is great for all ages. There is blood and language. The cursed pirates are kind of scary in the moonlight. Also, stick around after the credits that give a big clue for Dead Man's Chest. Overall, this is a great swashbuckling film. 9/10 Recommended films: The Princess Bride
10.0~Actually a kid's film, but enjoyable to all ages! RedFruityPie Sign in Permalink It is usually difficult for a film to successfully combine different types of genre and remain enjoyable and easy to follow. I expect it is even harder to do this when the film is developed for children's viewing. However, with this film that combination was, in my opinion, a success. Pirates of the Caribbean emerged as an excellent blend of romance, mild horror, action and adventure. Also, the comedy - provided by the wonderful Johnny Depp - makes it irresistible to watch at least once. The actors themselves give an outstanding performance, though none so outstanding as Depp himself. He plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate with only one thing on his mind. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is in love with the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightly). During their high seas adventure, we, the audience, get a chance to admire the superb special effects which help the entire movie hit us with such an impact that we will remember it for decades to come. I give this movie 10/10.
10.0~You're off the map mate. Here, there be monsters! tiamatq Sign in Permalink This is a fun movie that reminds me of The Princess Bride for it's great fight scenes and Johnny Depp's and Geoffrey Rush's wonderful characters. Though it's not nearly as witty overall, it's full of great lines (most of which go to Jack Sparrow), funny references to Disney's PotC ride, and good visuals. The special effects are keen and not made to scare, though young ones might be wary. The movie can run on a bit, but I really didn't mind (It meant more Jack Sparrow). I've read reviews stating that Johnny Depp is channeling a drunken drag queen in this movie, and that's a good thing. There truly is something hypnotic, sexy, and worth swooning over in the way he plays Jack Sparrow. This movie also encourages kids to eat their fruits... particularly apples. And if none of this has convinced you to go see this movie, then go to see the staggering amount of dental work. I'm not kidding, watch the credits and count the number of dentists who worked on this! Depp's and Rush's mouths alone must've kept several dentists busy for weeks.
3.0~not even average blockbuster Dilca Sign in Permalink really bad film. there is no script, lousy direction [Verbinski got even worse since "the mexican (2001)"]and poor (cliche) characters. ***************** spoilers ******************** what kind of pirate movie is this, without a bad guy?!? barbossa wasn't evil at all and english officer was a noble man. sparow was from beginning too obviously a good guy. it should be more mixed character. maybe more selfish or something. missed genre is another thing: too much comedy and action, not enough adventure. the worst are action sequences which are meaningless because pirates are immortal. camera angle is changing too fast so you wont see any decent sword fighting neither. just ONE sea battle doesnt contribute much to the piracy of the movie. **************** spoilers *********************** actors were more than average - depp was (probably intentionally) overacting, other were merely acting. special effects were nothing special. no better than in any other blockbuster. i liked the make up though.
9.0~This is a true classic connork97 Sign in Permalink There are two few action-adventure movies now a days that delivers such original characters, played by a truly incredible cast. When I first saw The Curse of the Black Pearl as a boy I was fascinated. There where Pirates, cannons, sword fights, treasures funny monkey's and a beautiful girl, What more could you possibly ask for. I can still remember when I saw Jack Sparrow for the first time. He may not of had the typical "hero" qualities that would see in somebody like say William Turner, but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant, he wasn't somebody we have experienced before. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say "Captain" Jack Sparrow. There he stood in all his glory, the anthem soundtrack blared as he stood on top of his wooden sinking ship, or boat... As he floats by the pirate outlaws hung by there necks, with a sign on them that states "pirates Ye Be Warned" he stops bailing his sinking boat in time to offer a kind salute, to his fellow dead pirates. Its not long in till we are swept away by a amazing story of a two men desperately trying to find the loves of there life. One a Pirate after his stolen ship, and the other, a working hard blacksmith boy, trying to find his true love. Luckily for them, both loves have been taken by the "crew of the dammed". Barbossa, the fearless pirate with a pet monkey, yes a pet monkey. It soon becomes apparent that everyone in the story wants something, and they will screw and back-stab anyone who gets in there way, honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends, everyone will become an enemy in time. After years of watching this film, it still reveals itself as nothing more but a great adventure movie, just plain fun. So why not give it ten out of ten. There is everything you want in an adventure movie, girls, fights and a little magic and mystery. Not to mention some of the best 1-liners you will ever hear, "you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner, you're in one", and my personal favourite, the very last line in the film, as Jack prepares to embark on more of his adventures he quotes "bring me that horizon" as the ship sales off into the sunset.
10.0~Excellent! A refreshing adventure and an extraordinary performance make an 10 grade film. Ang3lT0uCH Sign in Permalink It's a well recived movie, excpecialy today when this kind of movies has almost dissapeared and the ones that are still made are eithr for children or performed by really bad actotos and have a boring story. This one is just perfect, Jhonny Deep plays the role of a pirat excellent, adding a little humor to the plot. The same can be said about the others, that really transpute the viewer into that long gone world and leave us with a smile on our face.
6.0~The Best of Films, The Worst of Films bookboy-1 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean wasn't the best movie I've seen, but it wasn't the worst either. If nothing else, it was just plain escapist fun and a swashbuckling adventure ride. It's more style than substance and pretty much just captures your attention because of its cool effects. The plot itself is pretty much nothing spectacular or very surprising. Even though the movie has great actors like Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush, I kept on getting the impression that each of them could have somehow done better. Especially Orlando Bloom who didn't really seem to be making much of an effort. I'm told that there's a sequel in the works - two, in fact. So either the producers are leaving room for improvement, or just looking to make a quick buck.
8.0~It is such a sight to see, somebody stealing the show. Son_of_Mansfield Sign in Permalink Yes, Johnny Depp walks away with the movie or playfully struts away, to be more exact. He will get you through the first few viewings. Once Depp recedes, temporarily, into the background, you see the work of the good script by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot(Aladdin, Shrek). The script gives us not one, but two pairs of bickering buffoons, a ghost story, a little romance, a little adventure, a lot of comedy, and a pirate treasure hunt. It is unpredictable. This movie might have failed without it's superbly game cast. Geoffrey Rush has almost as much fun as Depp with several good lines. Jack Davenport nails the deadpan British style of humor perfectly and is contrasted nicely by the foppish Pryce. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not given much to do, but they make the most of their parts. Kevin McNally makes a fine salty dog. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook steal every scene they are in as a couple of silly pirate Abbott and Costello types with Agnes Burnett and Giles New as their lesser soldier counterparts. The real success of this movie is how it takes the old and makes it feel new again. (monkey brings medallion to Barbossa with Jack on it's tail)Barbossa: "Why thank ye, Jack." Jack: "No problem." Barbossa: "Oh, not you, we named the monkey Jack."
10.0~Phenomenal! TheLittleSongbird Sign in Permalink If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like "Stop blowing holes in my ship," that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.
8.0~Arrrrrr! Dockelektro Sign in Permalink Great to see that careful planning, structuring and audience studying pay off sometimes. The audience can at times be a strange beast, and can sink pictures in the same turf where others have been glorified. But Disney couldn't allow this movie to suffer the fate of Roman Polanski's "Pirates" or "Cutthroat Island". First major rule: stick to what you know, and always trust the school of Hollywood - thus, create a buddy-buddy formula, add the love interest, and then create a baddie, or even better, an army of baddies to go chase the heroes. The cornerstones of the typical american blockbuster are all right there, splattered on the screen, just pick them out. Second major rule: give the audience the very thing they're looking for when in the movies - exactly those things that they're not expecting. So assume the pirate theme and adapt it to the 21st century - and then come the bombastic the special effects. These two rules are usually gold, and when you tackle a movie genre that hasn't been touched for almost ten years, it isn't difficult to give people what they want to see. But this apparent ease of thought would trap Disney, so thank God for brilliant ideas - and one brilliant actor. Johnny Depp steals the show right from his unforgettable entrance, and never thinks of allowing some space for other things to provide comic relief. And neither do the filmmakers, and the public. As Jack Sparrow, the gallery of Depp-ish weirdness is complete with a full-on, iconic buckaneer, brilliantly crossing pirate stereotype with pop culture in a performance of rare dedication and method for a summer blockbuster. The result is the most memorable character of the picture, and also the entire blockbuster season. "Pirates of the Caribbean" could be in many ways another flop, but the producers made this movie by studying everything that made the others sink to the bottom. And also did Jerry Bruckheimer, whose "Pearl Harbor" left more bitterness in his mouth than memories in the entire audience. A refined sense of style, bombastic CGI skelletons and a script that only feels muddled when it seeks help in some of the chapters of the "Hollywood book of screenwriting", make this a winner, and one of the best popcorn-munchers of the year. Expect Peter Weir's / Russell Crowe's "Master and Commander", expect "Pirates of the Caribbean 2", and most probably seafaring adventures are back into the silver screen. Ahoy!
8.0~uh, yep Hail2 Sign in Permalink This movie was something really different for the movie-goer crowd. It's not everyday that you see a pirate movie. A good motto of Hollywood is do something no one's done before. That's one of the many good points of Pirates of the Caribbean. The fact that it's supposedly based on the Disney World ride is kinda lame, considering it's no much like the ride at all. A weird, deranged pirate by the name of Capt. Jack Sparrow is our hero. At first I didn't think he was reliable to the story line. Actor Johnny Depp claims he derived the character from the lead guitarist of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards. The plot is rather confusing and has one or two holes in it, never mind that at first it's hard to follow. Once you get the gist of it though you become swept away in the story line and the characters. With the main stars Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom it's rather hard to go wrong, regardless of prederived thoughts. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my favoritest movies- I got pulled into the drama and I fantasied with the characters. I'm not very hard to please so I give this movie eight stars out of ten. They could have made it easier to follow and understand. Other than that...
10.0~best movie ever accajat88 Sign in Permalink o boy what to say in this realm of technology and vampire stuff this movie came like it is heavy as johnny says .. the best actor i have ever seen so versatile and movie looks terrific its story its subject its cast all is just great . and off course all the characters were good but johny's performance was absolutely out standing , his way of speaking , dialogue delivery and strange movements which make him good , what to say he is the best. movie seems to be a bit hasty at some points but characters played it well all those bot scenes that ships islands especially the sets of that port royale no wonder why the movie did get so many Oscars..
5.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was an adequate experience as a first-time viewer tavm Sign in Permalink Okay, so I just finished watching this first Pirates of the Caribbean movie on ABC which means that there might have been some edits for either content or time constraints in the three hour slot. Nevertheless, I was a little entertained by some of the fight sequences and many of the lines and attitude of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character. I'm not completely sure he deserved the Oscar nomination for it but hey, he finally got the public recognition as a result so it's all good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush are also adequate here so this movie was a little enjoyable to me though I couldn't completely connect the disparate sequences that seemed to meander throughout. Still, like I said, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was pretty enjoyable so maybe I'll watch this again someday...
10.0~A pirate's life for me! Darth_Osmosis Sign in Permalink The best Pirate action since.. well, ever! Full of awesome swashbuckling action and good humor. Fantastical elements and a great cast of characters, (most notably one of my all time favorites -Jack Sparrow) make it really appealing! The main theme is just perfect for a movie like this!
3.0~How can this be? This is like a bad dream. A Jerry Bruckheimer film on IMDB:s top 250 list? Neon_Saint Sign in Permalink The first swordfight can sum up the whole movie. They jump on a board, one guy flies up in the air, he lands on the board again and the other one goes up. And the brain-dead audience laughs, they actually laugh - it's a sin against anyone who considers film an art form. In the words of Tyler Durden, `Murder, crime, poverty-these thing don't concern me.' And his right, it should not concern us as much as Pirates of the Caribbean. Because crime and poverty is things a fraction of mankind have to deal with daily. Stupidity on the other hand is something that affects everyone living today. What should concern us is that a majority of mankind's new favourite movie is on an intellectual level of Teletubbies. To actually criticize Pirates of the Caribbean through pointing out the lack of character development, the fact that every character and every scene is a cliché or the all-around dreadfulness of the script, is pointless. No one that can formulate an intelligent answer can deny it. I would instead like to share with you an epiphany I have had pondering this movie. The question I asked myself was why people have so different experiences watching the same movie? The answer is simply that the child enjoying Teletubbies have a different level of understanding than the adult. The same answer applies to why some people think movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean and A Knights Tale are `brilliant'. And thinks Citizen Kane and A Clockwork Orange are the worst movies ever made. This doesn't seem like such a catastrophe, we are all different, we accept that and get along anyway. But it is a catastrophe to quality filmmaking, because money-grubbing filmmakers without a sense for art will use the same pre-build Hollywood-scripts and recycle the same garbage for generations. Perhaps it's also a catastrophe for human intelligence. Not that a bad movie magically would drain the viewers IQ but it will in another way deprive the viewer from knowledge. Everything is a choice and through seeing a Jerry Bruckheimer flick instead of a Stanley Kubrick film the viewer loses an intellectual experience. How the loss of quality art would affect the democratic system in the long run, which only chance of working at all is if the average voter has a reasonably high level of understanding, is not that hard to imagine.
10.0~Without a doubt, the best pirate movie of all time! kristian_t_r Sign in Permalink This an absolutely excellent movie. It has humor and great action and is entertaining from the very beginning to the end. Johnny Depp's acting is fantastic. Some might say that they missed more of walking the plank in this movie. Well, then just remember that walking the plank is actually a quite made up story, very much brought to life by movie's like disneys Peter Pan. When the pirates actually managed to take a prisoner the did a lot more awful things then walking the plank. Torturing the people they managed to capture was the way the pirates entertained themselves. All in all this is just a geniously made movie, and deserves a 10 on the vote ranking.
10.0~A little something for everybody... PirateEvenstar Sign in Permalink I did not want to start this comment off by saying that this is my favorite film. But it is. Yes, I know that period films may not be everyone's cup of tea, and Disney films aren't for everybody. But Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl offers so many unique things to such a wide array of viewers, that it makes it darn near impossible to see it as a typical "Disney ride" film. For one thing, you've got Johnny Depp. Oh, the many faces of Mr. Depp. To me, Johnny Depp can do no wrong. That's because there is NO wrong for him. He puts himself everywhere, in every part possible, every complex acting gig he can squeeze himself into. He's not afraid to be out there or wacky and crazy...Which is EXACTLY what the character of Jack Sparrow is. Yes, he presents most of the comedy and witty one-liners. But he's more than just the comic relief. He adds an unexpected depth to the story, and beckons viewers to take a closer look at him. As do all of the characters. Keira Knightley presents a tame young lady on the verge of adulthood, who, when captured by the cursed pirates, unleashes a fierce fighter from deep within, very unlike any young women of her time. She grew up wanting to meet a pirate, and once she did, her life was thrown in a completely different direction. As an audience, we are expected to follow her journey, and we are also presented with an underlying theme of "there's more to this than there seems", and even characters like Knightley's Elizabeth Swann and Bloom's Will Turner offer prime examples of this theme. Orlando Bloom's acting is often described on the POTC boards as "wooden" and "lacking", but I say no to all of it. His acting is exactly what the character calls for. Will Turner is supposed to be sure of himself and over-confident in the beginning, and throughout the movie he grows mentally and physically to be able to support and back up his confidence. As Orlando Bloom once described, it's like Will is wearing a corset in the beginning (mentally, of course), tight and restraining. But through the period of the film, it slowly unlaces and he can be himself more. Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is evil enough, and even to his character there are layers. There is method to his madness. He is angry because he is living in misery and the same discontented state he has been in because of the curse. He harbors a lust for what he cannot have and a desire towards how he wishes he could live. There is depth behind the harsh, seemingly-cruel exterior. I think, in this sense, the plot and characters are held in a corset at the beginning, each piece held in firmly in it's place. But as the "corset" loosens, the pieces fall away, and come together how they want to be. Maybe not how they're meant to be, but how or where they have longed to be. This movie has more than comedy and a bunch of swashbuckling pirates and action. Yes, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, so you can expect some definite action on a grand scale, but the movie isn't just action. It's romance (between Will and Elizabeth), longing (from Barbossa and the crew), freedom (Jack's knowledge of it because of his ship), fighting (for what you truly believe in and where you are meant to be), and so much more. This is a film I believe everyone could enjoy. I mean, yeah, even if you hate it...You could always sit and make fun of it for the full 143 minutes. If you don't find yourself actually intrigued at some point, that is.
10.0~Great!!!!! jake7026 Sign in Permalink I recently saw this movie and immediately thought it to be one of the greatest movies of all time. It's funny, contains great action scenes and all the acting is outstanding. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey are all superb. Pirates of the Caribbean contains great camera angles. Johnny deep fits the roll of "Jack Sparrow", a clumsy and often referred to as the worst pirate alive, perfectly. Geoffry Rush is the perfect bad guy and Orlando Bloom can add "Will Turner" to his list of interesting and well played characters. The best scenes in the movie would be: 1) When Jack is talking to the English guards about him sneaking aboard the ship in an attempt to steal it and 2) Where the pirates invade Elizabeth's town and take her to the ship The movie is well directed and the music is great. There is never a dull moment and as I said before the camera angles are great. Pirates of the Caribbean should be enjoyed by viewers of most ages and will definitely be enjoyed by any fans of Fantasy, Action or Comedy movies!!! Overall - 9/10
10.0~A perfect blend of story and characters RCWjr Sign in Permalink The summer of 2003 had this film which came out of nowhere it seemed and took the box office by storm. Nobody gave a film about a Disney ride much of a chance. But through the force of a great story and even better performances, we got a very pleasant surprise. Nothing more to say about Depp that hasn't already been said. He is the force of the film. His "Jack" pushes the film from being a really nice ride to being a great adventure of a film. But praise doesn't end there, Rush, Bloom, Knightly, Davenport and the rest of the supporting cast are absolutely great. The other performances can be lost in the tour-DE-force that Johnny gives with "Jack", but the other players brought their "A" game as well. The effects are fantastic here as is the score. Every element of this film belied the perception that came from the industry and fans waiting on it alike. Who would have known that a film based on a ride would be this good? Verbenski deserves a lot of credit for taking this film serious and not giving audiences what the protractors and doom sayers said would be delivered. Instead he brought back the pirate movie in a huge way. One of the best surprises in a long time.
9.0~Entertainment at its best! dan-v-spurling Sign in Permalink Pirates is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It actually has a plot that leads naturally from one event to the next. The characters are portrayed superbly, there is plenty of action and adventure, and there are of course the twists of fate that make it a winner! Depp played his part to the fullest - a dirty, rotten, happy-go-lucky thieving, loving pirate. I am not usually big on Depp, but this time he did it right! The entire cast was chosen well. Nothing in the movie was so far out of reality that it makes you think, 'Yea, right. An M-16 on a pirate ship!' They didn't capture any airplanes in the sky, nor did they show a brief glimpse of the microphone dangling in front of the camera as I have seen done in other lack-luster films. It is a good story and it is fun to watch. I just know that the next Pirates movie is going to be at least as good as the first and I am waiting anxiously for its release sometime in '06. No matter which way you look at it, this movie is a winner. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and rent or buy it. Why didn't I give it a 10 rating if I enjoyed it so much? Well, nothing on earth is perfect - but this came close.
6.0~Typical Bruckheimer Fare dorthul Sign in Permalink As the subject states, this movie is typical Bruckheimer fare. Interesting special effects, minimal story, and too damn long. Thankfully strong performances by Depp and Rush pull the project through. Despite the gushing claims of teenage girls, the supporting performances by Bloom and Knightley are utterly dismissible. I'm sure they sold tickets though. All said, it wasn't a bad flick.
8.0~One of the Biggest Surprises Ever amandaroseobrien84 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was one of the most surprising films I have ever seen. I was very apprehensive going in. It was based on an amusement park ride! And I remember thinking "This is going to be bad" after watching the trailer. I think it was one of those trailers that cram in all the cheapest jokes the movie had to offer. But I went because Johnny Depp is my favorite living actor and my college friends had an obsession with pirates. I was blown away by how funny it is and what a great ride (hee hee) this film is. Depp really makes the film. It would probably be a completely forgettable movie with anyone else as Jack Sparrow. I can't think of a better example of an actor completely losing himself in a role and having as much fun as possible. Check out my full review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/22/pirates-of-the-caribbean/
10.0~Classic of my Childhood wardy_ynwa Sign in Permalink Genuinely visually enjoyable film with a decent age suitability. An absolute classic of my childhood and one that has great re-watch value. Definitely recommend - but surely everyone has seen it! The ensemble work well together on screen, which is not always the case in these kinds of films, so it makes a refreshing change. The cameos are also memorable. The sheer number of stars they managed to fit into this series as a whole is impressive in itself. One to watch!
10.0~Excellent Movie yongcheng_ Sign in Permalink As everyone here can see, many of the comments about this movie is positive. The Writing was excellent and i can give it a 10/10 for just its writing. There are tricks and twists in this story. I am a fan especially to johnny. He is a great actor and he comes up with actions which entertained its audience. Well, i hope that the next movie would be great. Also, in my opinion, this movie should be rated higher. Hence, for those who have not vote, watch this movie again and concentrate with their actors and the script. I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it.
10.0~Drink up me hearties, yo ho! piratebabe2727 Sign in Permalink From the first few moments of the movie, you know that you are in for a treat. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom pair up in this swashbuckling adventure that will have you laughing on the edge of your seat the entire time. Never without a witty comment, Depp plays the part of Captain Jack Sparrow absolutely perfectly. Bloom, slightly over-dramatic the entire time, makes you laugh almost more than Depp! This is my all-time favorite movie (I saw it 5 times in theaters and over 20 times at home!) and I don't know a single person who dislikes it! "A wedding- I love weddings! Drinks all around!" - Captain Jack Sparrow
2.0~Overrated and boring grant-210 Sign in Permalink I cant believe how highly this film and Johnny Depp are rated. I thought that Johnnny Depp as a pirate was about as believable as Tom and Jerry. He minced on to the screen looking like a young girl who was blacked up and given a false moustache and beard. His accent although better than Dick van Dykes effort in Mary Poppins was unconvincing, and the character was lame, effeminate and generally rather laughable. This would be great French and Saunders material.In fact Jennifer Saunders would probably be more believable than this! Action scenes were rather more convincing. sorry switched off, it was that tedious.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Bead_queen9 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie Johnny Depp(Captain Jack Sparrow) and Orlando Bloom(Will Turner) made a great team and the chemistry between them was great! Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightly) was the character I wish I was I mean she got to be in a movie with two amazing actors. Wow! If you are in the mood for romance, action, adventure, and a whole bunch of other types of movies, see this movie, it is wonderful! This movie was by far the best movie I have seen in a very, very long time. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has a lot of great qualities it is an excellent film for anyone, OK maybe anyone over 13 there is a bit of violence but other than that it is a great movie. where there is a violent movie teens will gather!
10.0~Cutthroat Island? What's That? kermitthefrog594 Sign in Permalink Forget all the bad pirate movies of the past - Cutthroat Island, for instance - and indulge in the first masterpiece of the 21st century. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was based on a piddling Disney theme park ride and starred Edward Scissorhands, Legolas, David Helfgott, and that skinny girl from 'Bend it like Beckham'. But this film packs a killer punch with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the notorious rock star/pirate with a resemblance to Keith Richards and the coolest hat on celluloid. Without him, we would have an enjoyable if messy romp with non-acting Orlando Bloom, undead pirates, and a hammy Geoffrey Rush. With him, we have an adventure classic. In fact, I could find only one problem with this film. A roguish outlaw and an innocent boy team up to save a princess from an evil warlord. 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' does bear striking resemblances to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope', but Han Solo's no Captain Jack. The film doesn't outstay its welcome. Dead Man's Chest, it's sequel, was a nice attempt and Johnny Depp does brilliantly, even without the surprise factor he's fantastic, but here's hoping At World's End returns to the original's brilliance.
10.0~Swashbuckling Fun lotrgurly Sign in Permalink This movie is filled with action and pirates. It has all this while also throwing in a major love story and a little humor, but also ties it all together into a exciting adventure about an ancient curse and what the character's must do. Johnny Depp rules the screen with his amazing impressions on his character's. He plays an very unruly, strange pirate. But this adds to the interest of the movie, and the humor. It's a movie one can watch again and again and still enjoy. Orlando Bloom's good looks and skills, Johnny's humor, and Kiera Knightley's tremendous performance, a perfect trio for a action packed swashbuckling pirate film. Who wouldn't want to see this movie?
9.0~You better start believing in ghost stories... you're in one! schultzclan6 Sign in Permalink One word: great. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is the best Disney film I have ever seen. The story was somewhat complex and contained less action than I had hoped for, but turned out to still be good. Johnny Depp played the fantastic Jack Sparrow (that's Captain Jack Sparrow!)a pirate who loves his ship and his rum! With the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he must fight captain Barbossa, the owner of his ship, and save Elizabeth Swann from his cursed hands! The movie is a little bit scary for children, but it contains great humor, great action and a great story. Disney has finally proved that it can create an amazing film!
10.0~My favourite movie ever on-the-road-so-far Sign in Permalink It's now almost four years ago that this movie came out and it's still my favourite movie ever! I just love the light-hearted, humorous and adventurous context which stands in total contrast to the sequels which are darker and more epic. The humour in Pirates is brilliant - snarky, sarcastic and the running gags are also working very well. I especially adore Barbossa's monkey Jack (who will get more action in the third part!) But - as everyone else must admit - the real highlight of the whole trilogy is our dear Captain Jack Sparrow - played most brilliantly by Johnny Depp. I can't even say how much I love the character he created! His way to walk, to talk, to drink and to manipulate everyone else without them having the slightest clue as to what really are his motives has completely blown me away. Johnny Depp sure gave the performance of his life with this role and I'm still so very, very mad at the fact that he didn't get an Oscar for this achievement. Sure, Sean Penn is also a great actor, but the fact still remains, that without Johnny Depp we would have never gotten to know our beloved Captain Jack. No one else would have played him like this and he really created something on his own, instead of simply reading the script and doing it in the straightest way possible. And that's why he should have gotten an Oscar! - But hey, there's still hope for the third part!
5.0~With a sissy for captain, this is a travesty of pirate movies William-of-Baskerville Sign in Permalink I thoroughly hate all the Pirates of Caribbean movies because they make a mockery of the complete genre, by the sole performance of 'Captain Jack Sparrow' as ultimate sissy captain. Which pirate in his right mind would ever accept him as his captain? He is the ultimate anti-pirate, and an insult to the spirit of all pirate movies. Without him the movie would at least have some merit, although it still would be mediocre. Rather watch Cutthroat Island with Geena Davis as female captain, she has more balls than Jack. Master and Commander is in a slightly different genre, but has a real captain on the reel. Or even better, watch the Horatio Hornblower series, where we see the development of an honorable midshipman into captain, in a fantastic historic period piece. Still five stars for the decent production values and a bit of a story.
1.0~I Can Not Believe How Many People Have Rated This Drivel So Highly! brdlybaum Sign in Permalink I can not remember the last time I saw a Disney film that was as bad as this is. Why do people who have had no acting lessons and are not fully trained actors continually get acting work at the expense of those that have been fully trained and therefore can act? Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves! There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good about this generic pirate film. It had two story lines in it both of them having been told and shown countless times in far better ways numerous times before I wouldn't be at all surprised. OK so I Told a lie when I said there was absolutely nothing good about the film, as there was on thing good about it, the closing/end credits! Once they come on it means, thankfully, this extremely boring, exceedingly tedious film that has been stre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-tched to as long as it can be can now be switched off!
7.0~Channeling Robert Newton bkoganbing Sign in Permalink This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure. But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island. In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure. The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago. This is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy.
9.0~Well, blow me down! ddruss Sign in Permalink First, I am not a fan of Johnny Depp. I usually can't stand the guy. BUT, he was incredible in this movie! I went to see it for Geoffrey Rush and the special effects. Depp stole every scene he appeared in. Even when he was in the background, he called attention to himself without hamming it up. I don't know why he wore 10X as much makeup as Elizabeth Swann, but it suited his over the top performance. Rush gave his usual great acting job. And, the other pirates in the movie made me laugh as well. The movie was much funnier than I was expecting. Bloom seems to be the person they are pushing in this movie, maybe because of the success of the Lord of the Rings, but he sank into the background in his scenes with Depp. It was well over two hours, but I don't remember thinking that it was slow. It flowed very well and kept me and my two children quite entertained. PLUS, the worst language in it was "bloody." Which makes a mother happy! I don't think it was much worse than watching cartoons as far as violence goes, but the pirates might scare small children. It didn't scare my small one, but I could see where it might. It was actually the best action movie I have seen in some time. I saw T3 three days ago and did not come away nearly as impressed with it as I did this movie. The special effects with the pirates were incredible! The animated people did not seem to move jerkily like I have noticed in other movies. They seemed liquid and to move as a real person would. I can't say enough about how entertained I was watching this film.
8.0~Start of a decent entertaining series. muvi-fan-73 Sign in Permalink Like its other installments, the elements of franchisee 'Pirates of the caribbean' have been handled well. The fantasy factor (in story), black magic, relationships, anti-pirates, pirates (mostly Jack), crew, etcetera are amazing like always. The visuals are worth mentioning as well. This is the first installment. The story revolves around how the crew of Black pearl along with the vessel is cursed and will they get rid of curse. This is the highest rated installment on IMDb, may be because it's the first one. For me better comes with some of the other installments. The character of Jack portrays a witty, selfish person but righteous as a hidden quality. It wins heart of the audience in general. It's worth to solely mention that. Final Verdict: It is a start of a decent entertaining series.
5.0~I Was Shocked royu Sign in Permalink I saw this movie in the cinema without hearing any reviews at all from any newspapers and without reading the reviews from this website. I came out of the movie thinking it was OK, although would have been much better without all that ghost garbage. It's one of those movies I just forgot about from the minute it finished, it left no impact on me at all. A couple of months later I was looking through the IMDb Top250 list and I was absolutely shocked to see this movie was in it, absolutely shocked. I clicked on it to see if it was the same movie I saw because I simply couldn't believe what I was reading. This? In the top 250? What's my point? Well my point is that I thought the movie was ordinary at best. Maybe it's just me? As soon as the ghosts came into play I was instantly turned off by this unrealistic pointless add-on, so maybe this is what sent me to sleep. If it was the ghosts or not, it doesn't matter, I didn't like it. The script and directing were good, so was Johnny Depp's acting. But Depps character gave me a pounding headache and the movies plot, in my mind, was absolutely terrible. Give me a realistic pirate movie, please, what a waste of talent on stupid ghosts.
9.0~One of the best movies i've watched. luisaawuah2 Sign in Permalink This Movie is simply amazing, it's funny, scary and so exciting. You never know what to expect and then just like that boom. I love this movie. The actors were great, the makeup was fantastic and the script was just perfect. everything about this movie was great. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.
10.0~Fantastic film for all ages! beefgoddess Sign in Permalink I have to admit, I was hesitant to see this movie because the idea sounded a bit childish, but upon seeing the commercials, I was hooked, and even taped one during a show just because it looked interesting to me. I waited until the movie was released on DVD before watching it and I sorely regret it!! After viewing ten minutes of the film I was hooked and rented the movie that very night. I then went on to watching it again and again, even renting the movie a second time just so I could watch it more. Johnny Depp is brilliant as daft Captain Jack. It is obvious that he truly enjoyed the character. His acting steals the show, even though the film is based around Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Geoffrey Rush is equally hilarious and evil as the undead Barbossa. Kevin McNally is thoroughly enjoyable as the older salt Joshamee Gibbs; the superstitious, story-telling pirate that Jack Sparrow visits in Tortuga. I truly believe anyone with a creative imagination will have a lot of fun with this movie. It takes you out of reality and throws you into a thrilling dreamworld with pirates, sea-faring, a love story, and hilarity.
9.0~A tale of love, war and power Harley66 Sign in Permalink Oh and what a movie this is. There is something for everyone in the family with this movie, romance, action, drama, horror, adventure and fantasy. A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.
6.0~I see it and enjoy it. heatherwthurman Sign in Permalink If you know Johnny Depp you'll know that this movie will be good in some kind of way. He really makes the movie what it is in my opinion. With his charm and all that. He can make a some kind serious movie relay funny and that's why i like this movie. This movie combines humor that will have adults and children laughing , and although it is a bit scary at times, is not too scary for younger children. I would say if you like pirates, Johnny Depp, or a good movie with action, comedy and romance then you really should watch movie.If you not see this film you miss this entertainment.
8.0~Wow, a pretty much perfect pirate Movie! apcolorado Sign in Permalink This film is amazing. It improves over the first one COMPLETELY, and gives the Movie a little feeling of horror (e.g. Davy Jones and his crew), But in the progress it kinda loses the charm of the first film, -Which I recommend you check out-, Well anyway, This film is a must have for anyone with a sense of adventure and loves pirate Movie's. The only thing I disliked is some of the characters, They brought the guy with the fake eye back along with that other guy who follows him everywhere, They also brought back the old crew of the black pearl, along with Will and Elizabeth and the commodore! All that is great but apart from Davy Jones and his crew (And maybe the cannibal islanders) film doesn't really has much originality,it uses the same formula as it's predecessor , which is great and all but, they could of changed something more. (I watched the DVD version)
7.0~A colourful, noisy,rumbustious adventure. raymond-15 Sign in Permalink Without a doubt this is Johnny Depp's film. As Captain Jack Sparrow he shows once again what a versatile actor he is. He bursts forth on the screen as a wily pirate character full of tricks such as distracting his adversaries with non-stop chatter. His swaggering walk unsteadied by a little too much rum and his flippant manner endear him to us immediately. He seems to fear no man, and despite his unkempt appearance has a way with the women too. Johnny Depp has a mammoth task. He is on the screen most of the time. The success of the film largely depends on his performance. Never once does he shirk this responsibility. Indeed he seems to enjoy every minute. The battles at sea with cannonballs flying through the air bringing down masts and rigging and gouging great holes in the decks are a triumph of set design. Wooden ships are very inflammable and lend themselves to some dramatic moments with everything aflame amid noise and confusion. There is almost too much to watch at one sitting. It is just as well because the story is pretty thin. The film especiaslly in the sword-fighting episodes is reminiscent of some of the early serials that once excited us at the Saturday afternoon flicks. Despite clash of steel on steel not much blood is apparent among the roguish-looking pirates who all look as if they need a hot bath. The make-up is right on target, a real credit to the artists. Much of the time Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa has to act with a monkey sitting on his shoulder. An excellent little touch I thought as it added to his nasty character. I could not take my eyes off the monkey. He stole every scene for me. If we may judge from the almost endless listing of credits, a lot of work was put into this production. It's loud and noisy and lots of fun and will be especially appreciated by those who grew up on pirate stories, and as in all those stories it's the good that triumphs over evil in the end.
10.0~Best movie ever made!!! arwengiverney Sign in Permalink "Pirates" is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made! Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Jack Davenport, and of course the esteemed Jonathan Pryce, come together to form the cast of this amazing, sea-faring adventure! 10 years previously, Elizabeth Swann mets Will Turner after he is rescued from a burning ship. Fast forward to the present, and Will Turner is a dashing young man (an unbelievably hot Orlando Bloom), hopelessly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth. But before he can declared his love, Elizabeth is kidnapped by pirates, cursed pirates looking for something that they desperately need. Enter Johnny Depp, the mildly tipsy, rogue-ishly good looking, and always charming Captian Jack Sparrow. He and Will set off to rescue the girl, and thus start an amazing journey full of ghost stories, curses, pirates, and of course, apples. Watch for the scene in the treasure cave, where Jack Sparrow, mildly concussed, attempts to beg for parlay... "par..parsip...pplla..."
6.0~WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS FOR CHILDREN maumora Sign in Permalink BE WARNED: THIS MOVIE IS FOR CHILDREN. Don't expect any kind of realistic characters, smart comedy, or even a good plot. It's just one more average Disney production aimed at entertaining children and jump-starting Disney's toy sales.
10.0~Really a good movie. frank_nitti Sign in Permalink I really loved this movie. The story is really cool, the special effects are well made and it's so funny. Jack sparrow did his job really well, he's the coolest caracter! I also liked the skelettons and the jokes that are in this movie!
10.0~Simply Awesome... hellwithuall_ak Sign in Permalink In short,this movie is not just good...It is awesome!!!Too good... The Curse of the Black Pearl is actually a curse that has been laid upon the pirates of the ship - Black Pearl.According to this same curse they shall not be able to die without fulfilling certain conditions...The movie is about this curse and revolves around four main characters namely-Captain Jack Sparrow (awesome acting by Johnny Depp),Will Turner(Orlando Bloom once more acting really well),Captain Barbarossa(Geoffery Rush) and Elizabeth Swann(Kiera Knightley)... Exceptional direction and picturization,and brilliant acting especially by Johnny Depp sets the stage for this all time great...A must-watch...Enjoy!!!
10.0~This was an okay movie. Boardbreaker03 Sign in Permalink I must admit, this movie was pretty good. But, the ending was cheesy. As Stephen King once said, "You can have a really good storyline, but it isn't as good as it could be because of the ending. After all, it's the ending that matters most in a story. Without something special to wrap it up, the story is worthless." With Pirates of the Caribbean, the storyboard directors should have been more choosy about what makes it in the movie. The ending of Pirates of the Caribbean makes it seem like the entire plot is a whole big love story, even though romance was shown very little throughout the film. Though, the hanging scene was good, the "As is mine" part wasn't necessary. Jack could've just thanked will and went on his way. And After Elizabeth's dream and before Johnny comes in, it was rather boring. I mean who CARES about Will and Elizabeth. It's setting up for a romance movie, when the movie should make the audience focus on the cursed pirates and Captain Jack, which is after all the focus of the movie. They could've just shown the part where Elizabeth puts on the necklace, then opens the window showing Port Royal. Then, the next part could be when Jack comes in on the boat. It would have kept the pirate theme alive, while still showing the movie from Elizabeth's point of view. There was a lot of action in this movie, so it should have ended shortly after a part with a lot of action. After the pirates become cursed no longer, they could've had Jack become captain, once again, and end the movie there. It would have made the people leaving the theater, thinking thet just came back from a really good pirate movie. Instead, they just remember the final part, so they leave thinking, "That had a really good love story in it." COMPLETELY forgetting about Will and Captain Jack's huge sword fight and the climax of the 3rd act. The movie was overall good, but I would've tweaked it a bit to make it perfect.
10.0~An Awesome, fabulous movie..**Contains spoilers** misteme2003 Sign in Permalink This is one of Disney's best. Based on the ride (although not a whole lot of reference..I went on the ride after having seen the movie) the viewers are in for movie ride of a lifetime. Full of excitement, surprise, and wonderful special effects, with an intriguing storyline behind it, well it's worth it's weight in gold. Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow was wonderfully casted. No one else could have done as spectacular as a job as him, with his quirks and oddities. He was "gyped" so to speak out of a well deserved Oscar in this one. As a woman, he somehow managed to be so attractive in this, despite his black and gold teeth, dirty hair and fingernails and constant inebriation. He has said he "modeled" the character after long time British rock star, Keith Richards and he had it right on the nose! No matter how hard you try, you can not dislike him in this movie..right down to his "eunich" comment to Orlando's character "Will" while fighting in the shop. The movie has a few twists and can be a little confusing (how is it that "Will" survived without becoming one of the living dead, when he was wearing the stolen medallion??) but if you watch it more than once or carefully, its there for the viewer to figure out (spells prequel). Geoffrey Rush is perfect as the villain, a shame he won't be in the "sequel". Ms. Knightley, a spunky, beautiful newcomer, perfectly casted as the damsel in distress. This is a must see. The song "Drink up me 'earties yo ho" worth it, Cpt Jack capturing his horizon, the skeletons in the moonlight..very Disney, but very worth it. The reason I gave it a 10/10, I can't think of any way to improve it. And it's one movie I am eagerly awaiting the sequel to. Hopefully, Johnny Depp will take home the Oscar for the next one, because he deserved it.
10.0~Pirates kicks a** sandlerfan316 Sign in Permalink This was by far the greatest movie I have ever had the honor to gaze upon, and I have seen a lot of movies. Johnny Depps winning personality and talent was perfect for this movie, and Orlando Bloom's career is starting off on the right foot being in both the Lord of the Rings movies and in Pirates of the Caribbean. Kira Knightly also shows incredible talent and should be a promising actress. I'll admit the only reason I went to see the actual movie was because I'm a Depp fanatic and also a big Orlando Bloom fan, and I expected the movie to be boring, because I didn't know what it was about. But i was so wrong, it was AMAZING, and I recommend everyone see this movie. It is good for all people because it was a comedy, love, drama, action, horror, and family movie all in one amazing little package. I saw this movie 4 times and intend to be first in line at blockbuster to buy it. That is all I have to say- oh and vote for this movie-it should be in the top 50, not near the end of the list.
10.0~One great swash-buckling film!! Pirate_princess Sign in Permalink As soon as I saw this film I knew that in the future it would be featuring in 'ultimate action films or greatest films' etc and it did! It was number 19 in Empires greatest films ever poll! An amazing feat considering its one year old! This film has everything - action, adventure, romance, humour, great locations (I'm sure the caribbean has sold more holidays now!), lovable characters. The actors cast are all perfect (even Keira!) and i cant imagine anyone else in the roles. The film is undeniably stolen by Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and deservedly so - hes fantasmic! An instant character that audiences all over the world try to recreate (without much luck!) Whatever people may say good or bad, please check this film out for yourself!! Im sure you'l love it!
10.0~Action, Adventure, Romance, and it will rock you 'til the end. lhuffenberger Sign in Permalink Funny, funny, funny! Nerve tingling action and adventure! Romantic Romance! Movie has a spunky girl character who doesn't talk like a little girl, is not afraid to step out of her place, doesn't have ten million layers of makeup, and isn't the last one to move when someone needs help! Excellent, blood chilling special effects! Kooky, yet clever Jack Sparrow! Adventurous, brave, daring, yet pure-hearted Will! Best movie ever (all my sympathy to those who have never seen it)!
10.0~How Disney brought back Pirates to the modern day breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com Sign in Permalink There are records of pirates that date back to very early times and there are still accounts of it today. When film began to become prevalent with audiences, there were also several films made that revolved around these individuals. The life of a pirate is one of that many seek to obtain even though most would deny it. Who wouldn't want to sail around the world's oceans plundering with your friends and having a good time provided no rules? It sounds like a lot of fun. Surprisingly, as dark as this particular career can get for some people, Disney is able to portray the fictitious world of pirates where it may not be all fun and games, but it still looks like a blast (pardon the pun). There isn't any element that feels out of place. After a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sees his love Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) captured by a band of pirates, he calls upon the help of a unique ally, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), another pirate. The writers behind the screen are Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. These guys are 2 of the 4 writers behind Aladdin (1992) and The Mask of Zorro (1998) - which has multiple swashbuckling scenes like this one. Each character has an equal amount of development and charisma to make them likable. Johnny Depp of course is the most memorable even though his name is not in the title. The film is directed by Gore Verbinksi who didn't know it at the time but would work with Johnny Depp much more after this movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have good chemistry and look good together as well. The captain in charge of the pirates is Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and he too puts in a good performance as the antagonist to the story. What may be surprising to viewers is just how well the writers were able to mix the violence with comical moments. This is either due to Johnny Depp's acting and rather strange facial expressions or even lesser important characters like Barbossa's men - Ragetti and Pintel. They are definitely not appealing characters but they still portray the charm needed to enjoy what they do or say even if they aren't on the good side. Again, going back to violence, the humor makes it more fun. The style of action portrayed here does involve swords, which feels similar to the Zorro series but is also different because of the settings it takes place in. How many high seas adventures are popular today? Not many. Besides swords, there's also cannon fire and shoot-outs for good measure. Adding on top of that is composer Klaus Badelt's score. Thankfully, Badelt includes themes for Jack Sparrow and the whole story itself. It's very catchy and once you've heard it, you won't forget it. I'm surprised too because although Badelt hasn't made a lot of great film scores, the one's he is remembered for is extremely good. Lastly is Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, which he gets a number of nice big views of tropical scenery although I'm sure a lot of it is CGI. There really isn't anything to not like about it. The characters are likable, the action and humor mix well and the music is quite memorable. If you want to see an updated look on old fashion pirates, this is the original movie to see.
8.0~Swashbuckling Pirate Adventure FilmFanInTheHouse Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003, Dir. Gore Verbinski) When Captain Barbossa sends his pirate crew to kidnap Elizabeth Swan and the last remaining piece of Aztec gold. A blacksmith called Will Turner joins a recently captured pirate named Jack Sparrow and goes off searching for Elizabeth. It's isn't until they all meet up, that they discover the real terrifying truth behind the Aztec gold, and why they need Will Turner and not Elizabeth Swan. One genre of films which you do not see a lot of are pirate movies. This could have helped the success of this movie. No one would have seen a high quality, big-budget pirate movie. Disney really pulled out all the stops on it's stars. There are a huge range of talent here from big stars like Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, to talent from the likes of Jonathan Pryce, Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport. The story is beautifully written. There are some great scenes with some wonderful witty dialogue. The special are impressive too with the skeletons looking so creepy with their creeping bones. Everything about this film was perfect and a fantastic start to the trilogy. "You seem to forget one thing." "I'm Jack Sparrow." - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)
10.0~This Is For Everyone! Sam_Loves_Friends Sign in Permalink I am eleven years old. And be that as it may, I am a girl, a girlie girl in fact. So you must be wondering, what business does a girlie eleven year old girl have watching Pirates of the Caribbean? Well, I'm bursting to tell you why. When I first heard of Pirates of the Caribbean I thought 'Oh! Not another Pirate movie!' But when the second movie came out, my father insisted that I had to watch it. At first I tried to get out of it, but then when I finally sat down to watch it, I fell in love. Jack's tricks, Elizabeth's sense and Will's courage are what kept me going. After I had watched it, I wanted to watch it again and again. Now I seriously think that my parents are sick of it. One thing's for sure, I'll never be sick of it. Pirates will never get old and this movie will be a legend forever!
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sahierge Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is without a doubt the best pirate movie I have ever seen. The tale begins when Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) discovered a pirate medallion around the neck of a young boy who washes up from a wrecked merchant ship. She has no idea that it is really a missing piece of Cortez's cursed Aztec gold, stolen by the crew of the Black Pearl. The pirate crew, commanded by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) needs the last piece and the "blood to be repaid" to lift the curse set on them when they removed the gold. In attempts to gain back this cursed treasure, the crew runs into the captive, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who was marooned by Barbossa and left for dead. Once Elizabeth was taken capture by the cursed crewmen of the Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sets free Jack Sparrow to help him locate the Black Pearl and rescue her. The cast is perfectly chosen and interacts with each other as if they had been working together on this film over many years. Johnny Depp plays a selfish pirate who is constantly calculating ways to manipulate others into helping him gain what he desires. His phenomenal acting was not only cohesive to piracy, but also added a comedic aspect to the film. He added a sense of comic relief to a typical adventure film by use of sarcasm, wordplay, and gesturing to make the scene humorous rather than somber. My particular favorite quote that depicts his wordplay is, "Me, I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you have to watch out for because you never know when they're going to do something incredibly stupid." He uses the wordplay to, it seems, confuse the other character into believing him to be truthful. After viewing the film, I was utterly convinced that the cast is a medley of pirates all working for or against each other to gain what each of them secretly desired. It is the audience's task to figure out which of the characters can be trusted and which ones have dishonorable ulterior motives. In terms of cinematography, the film utilizes the aspects of lighting to highlight the effects of the curse on the pirates and to show the authenticity of the time period. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush's character, states, "The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living' and so we cannot die, but neither are we dead." Lighting is a very important aspect of the entire movie because it shows the effect of the curse in action. The crewmen were forbidden to remove the gold from the chest, but they did so regardless of the warning and became cursed by the heathen Gods. Throughout the rest of the movie, the lighting is either candle light or natural lighting because of the setting. During the night scenes, there is emphasis on moonlight, when the pirate crew is shown, or there is use of candle light indoors. Whichever the case may be, lighting plays a very important role in the film. The costume designs for each character were carefully chosen and created to match each and every role. Some characters even wore colored contacts to make their eyes appear yellow or discolored, which shows how their life at sea has affected their appearances. Each pirate was made up to look unkempt and terrifying to show how pirates would not have the same luxuries as the upper classes. Elizabeth's character was cleaner in appearance and wore a more elaborate dress than those of the pirates. This film is full of symbolism and historical backgrounds such as the Black Pearl and the formation of the East India Trading Company. The East India Trading Company was against piracy and all for taxing shipping ports to gain profit from anyone sailing the seas. The Black Pearl, according to Captain Jack Sparrow, symbolizes freedom and his ability to sail the seas without feeling confined to any order or law. A ship has many different parts, but when they are as a whole, they form a liberating method of transportation, which actually becomes a way of life. Piracy becomes more of a culture than a history of rebellious sailors. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the most accurate depiction of historical piracy that has ever been shown in any film. It shows the nature of piracy at its finest and at its worst while adding a mythological twist to it. The cast, costumes, lighting, symbols and plot all come together to create this fantastic movie about pirates and fighting for that in which they believe. I highly recommend seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.
10.0~excellent bexx-boo Sign in Permalink What can i say?, its a brilliant movie. Casting is just right, especially with the fantastic Mr.Depp, he outshone everyone, and also gave the movie its humour, The story line was very original, and an ended most people wouldn't of expected. The special effects were very well done, especially the pirates turning into Skeletons, and looked very scary at parts. Jeffery Rush, also acted brilliantly with his part as the evil captain Barbossa, and orlando bloom as the young man, falling n love and what he would do for love. All i can say is i cant wait for the next movie and i bet it will be even better then the first.
10.0~I think this movie rocks Sugaplum143 Sign in Permalink I love Orlando Bloom in this movie BUT Johnny Depp is so on to it his character is really cool and is facial expression are the best I have seen yet he is awesome in this role and deserves a lot of the credit. I had fun with this movie and found it somewhat intriguing. I saw it twice so far and i still want to go and watch it again its that kind of movie for me The Hunks in this movie are brilliant at looking good even if it is in costumes i couldn't have chosen a better movie for my Saturday night out. Why's the rum gone!!!!!!!!
10.0~Great Movie, Love It!! tidaley Sign in Permalink I think that this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen. I own it on DVD and watch it every time that i get the chance. I can not wait for the next one. Hopefully it is as good as the first, but i have no doubts. Johnny Depp is a great actor and he plays the part of Jack Sparrow well. Orlando Bloom is great too. I think that all the actors played a big part in making the movie and they put it all together and made it come to life. Thanks to everyone involved!! The next one sounds really good and as soon as it comes out i am going to gather up all of my friends and we are going to go see it in theater. It is going to be really fun and i hope that it comes out soon because i can't wait.
10.0~Johnny Depp IS Jack Sparrow Historical_Analyst Sign in Permalink First off, I loved this movie. It is one of the rare few that I could sit down and watch for days on end and never get tired of. The cinematography was beautiful, the story was very interesting, special effects were stunning, and most of all, Johnny Depp didn't just play Jack Sparrow, he WAS Jack Sparrow. Giving all due credit to the other members of the cast, Geoffrey Rush who did a great job, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, although not nearly as experienced, still held their own, I feel comfortable making the assumption that most people felt Johnny Depp was the highlight of the movie. Facial expressions, attitude, dialogue, etc. coupled with the copious amounts of makeup made him the star. Overall, if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you rent it the next time you have some time.
10.0~Johnny Depp is this movie. Sirus_the_Virus Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fantastic film. I think Johnny Depp got his first Oscar nomination for it. In my opinion, he definitely deserved it. Johnny Depp is mostly the reason why I gave Pirates of the Caribbean such a high rating. Not only is it an amazing film, Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush make it very interesting. Depp and Rush play Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa, two rival pirates who are still having at it after so many years. Both Rush and Depp are great. The Plot: A medallion needs the blood of William Turner, who's father put the curse on this ship. So Will teams up with the greatest pirate legend, Jack Sparrow, to save his love Elizabeth from the crew and stop the curse. I love Pirates of the Caribbean. I actually love the entire trilogy, though the third film was weakish. The original film was the best without a doubt. The film wasn't a critical success, though it was nominated for five Oscars. Screw critics, Pirates of the Caribbea: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great film, without a doubt.
10.0~Stupefying! jdepps_girl Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is absolutely incredible. I'm very aware that many of the girls (ok, most of the girls) in the world that went to see this film probably just wanted a gander at the lovely Orlando Bloom.... well, I must say, it was really Johnny Depp who stole the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. His hilarious antics and insane actions made me laugh until I nearly cried. Mr.Bloom shows a lot of promise in the future as a successful actor. As Johnny Depp is considered the Marlon Brando of this generation, Orlando will most likely be named the Johnny Depp of the next. He plays Will Turner very well, starting out as a kind of awkward, geeky boy... and slowly molds into a brave and charming young man. Keira Knightley also deserves a word of recognition. Her beauty and talent are undeniable, and her character, Elizabeth Swann, was sweet and independent. I admired Keira's performance and look forward to seeing her in many more movies. Besides all the talented actors in this film... the visual effects were fantastic, and the screenplay was witty and exciting. I Definitely Recommend THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!
9.0~Rollicking and amusing carlabrams Sign in Permalink Just watched this on DVD. Very amusing, and pretty good family fun, too. There were several scenes where you could see the scenes from the ride. Other scenes were very cool. For those people who don't get it - it's a fantasy that only has a base in what really happened. The skeletons are there because they've been cursed! Actually, I mentioned to my wife as we were watching the movie that I was expecting to see the skeleton of Bootstrap come walking into the final fight, from having finally gotten free from the cannon.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) johnnychick Sign in Permalink The Black Pearl, a non-catchable ship, is legend to be "crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that Hell itself spat him back out". Is it true, that this ghost story should be unveiled to be a fact? Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp) and Will Turner(Bloom) go on a hunt to catch the Black Pearl in order to save Will's love interest, Elizabeth Swann(Knightley), whom the crew of the Pearl believe is the cure of their immortal curse. This movie is rather interesting. Even though Depp and Bloom are eye-candy, you can't help but love the movie. The special effects are fairly good. I praise the caster for casting this hilarious yet serious group. Well Done! Also, the two disc DVD set holds a great amount of extra's! Be sure to watch the blooper reel and Pirate's Diary! Great stuff for someone who wants to get behind the scenes!
10.0~Great creation mr-spock Sign in Permalink Good story, Great performance from Deep, great character creation, this Jack Sparrow is an absolute new kind of character, I think very few actors can create a character like Deep did. Great !.
9.0~Almost shipwrecked... hm25332 Sign in Permalink True to the tagline, I was blown out of the water by this film; for two reasons. I was more than a little afraid that "Pirates" would steer the same course as "Cutthroat Island". Which ended in a major shipwrecking, as I recall. The good part is the actors are giving everything they got. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are playing the eye catchers (blame the scriptwriters) and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are clearly amusing themselves, which works contagious on the audience. In fact, Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow kinda reminds me of Mick Jagger. Same accent, same moves. The story is the bad part of this film. In short: it drags too long. We could have done without an hour at least. The special effect are quite good and the sword fights are nice, but it takes the actors (especially Depp and Rush) to keep the boat from running on the rocks.
10.0~Terrific cinematic experience maple_leafs_kickass Sign in Permalink I wasn't a real big fan of movies until my friend let me borrow this cause he didn't have a DVD player at the time. Wow was it good I mean everything seemed perfect all the pieces were in the puzzle were put into the right place the music the acting the directing the scenery it was gorgeous and loads of fun Pirates of the Carribbean was without questioning the best movie of 2003 (this and LOTR 3). Johnny Depp was the best choice for Jack Spareow being the reluctant and funny hero along with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley providing the movies romance also did great along side the legendary Depp. Geoffrey Rush whom I didn't know of till the release of this movie was a terrific villain. The action was great awesome sword duels explosions at sea and the terrific element of fantasy makes this film an ultimate adventurous experience! The music was of perfect orchestration for this film. All this and with Gore Verbinski's slick directing it's so hard not to like this film. Can't wait till the second!
9.0~Yoohoo, yoohoo! marcus_stokes2000 Sign in Permalink *SPOILERS Of The Black Pearl* I had heard of POTC: Curse Of The Black Pearl when it first came out, but it sounded cheesy, and I never liked pirate movies, so I gave it a miss. But 3 years later, after having heard everybody singing its praises and taking the chance as it was going to be aired on TV, I recorded it, and watched it. I had to rethink my opinion of the movie, since I found it great. The story? The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed because they robbed a treasure which had been cursed by Maya Gods, and they want to get rid of the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of legendary pirate Bill Turner (who Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) killed because he had opposed to Barbossa's mutiny from Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), right before finding out they needed his blood to get rid of the curse) - William Turner (Orlando Bloom). Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates capture Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the daughter of the Governor, who said her surname was Turner because she was in love with young Will, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, who is none other than Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbossa (can you blame him?). In the meanwhile they are all being chased by the British fleet. Will the curse be broken? Will Jack Sparrow manage to get back his ship, the 'Black Pearl'? Will Elizabeth and Will get together? All I can say is that great fun will be had by all. Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl: 9/10.
10.0~Best movie Lexie-S Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean it's the most amazing pirate movie I've ever seen. I just love that the comedy it's combined with fantasy and a bit of drama.The actors are amazing. The actors are amazing,so talented , so flexible and dedicated when it comes to their role. I watched them like 20 times and I can't wait for another movie from this amazing series of movies. A film that truly deserves to be seen!Especially when you are an Orlando and Johnny fan.
10.0~Have you ever seen a movie and thought: Wow! I've got to see this again? line-andersen98 Sign in Permalink I saw the commercial for this film in the TV and I thought, Oh, I don't want to see this movie it is way to scary. But my parents got it for me at my birthday and I completely fell in love with the movie, its characters and the humor. It has the wonderful mix of action, romance and humor that only a few, too few, movies have. I have now seen it so many times that I have stopped counting. I know must of the lines by heart and I still thinks it's a brilliant movie even when I know the ending. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and even when he's not in focus he completely steals the picture. Keira Knightley is gorgeous and Orlando Bloom is so handsome, but Johnny is the true star in this movie you just have to see. I will recommend the commentaries on the movie, some of them are really entertaining. So see it again and again and again.
9.0~Too Much of a Good Thing futuretype Sign in Permalink When I saw this fifteen years ago I thought it was good. Rewatching it I found it in continually engaging with exciting scene after another. In my first viewing I dndn't care for the Orlando Bloom character but his role seemed to fit better second time around. The only criticism I offer is that it seemed to go on and on - perhaps it was ioo long.
10.0~"I'm Captain Jack Sparrow, Savvy?" emma-payne1 Sign in Permalink what makes this film so genius? is it Orlando Bloom's sword fighting skills and brilliant hat? no. Is it Kiera Knightley's comic moments with the Comodore and her incredible corset? no. Or is it Johnny Depp with a gun? HELL YEAH!!! an incredible movie well worth a watch for anyone who is still a big kid at heart.Orlando Bloom delivers a inspiring performance as our young love struck blacksmith oblivious to his pirate ancestry while Kiera Knightley and Jack Davenport give the film the light hearted comedy that keeps you laughing throughout. Onc again outstanding performances from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush set of the tone of the movie and with it's many action scenes no-one can say this film doesn't got out with a bang. and for all females reading who can go wrong with having Johnny Depp, Jack Davenport and Orlando Bloom in the same movie.this film really is complete genius. i only have one thing left to say "Welcome to the Caribbean love."
8.0~Drink up me 'earties, yo, ho!!! GoD-s-LoNeLy-MaN Sign in Permalink "Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is one of the best "light entertainment" movies I have ever seen. It is entertaining and that's its sole aim. It is funny and easily keeps you interested and despite its long runtime (more than 2 hours) it is never boring. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a very ironic movie which uses almost every pirate cliché there is. It parodies action movies with great self-mockery. Some lines and scenes are hilarious and the plot is creative. A very well written adventure, with twists and turns, and with memorable lines and characters. (love the theme music) I loved the character of Captain Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp who gives a brilliant performance. Keira Knightley also does a fine job. However, I did not like Will Turner, the character played by Orlando Bloom. I'm not sure if it is Bloom's performance and the way he says his lines that annoys me or if it is the lines themselves that do. He has some really cheesy lines. Funny and entertaining comedy/adventure movie. Honestly! **** 8.0/10 ****
7.0~Abandon all misgivings ye who enter Shiva-11 Sign in Permalink Say `Pirate Movie' in a crowded theater and you're likely to be facing a mutiny or a stampede, and for good reason: the rollicking adventures popularized by Robert Louis Stevenson and brought to life by Errol Flynn have, of late been replaced by overblown soulless drivel along the lines of Polanski's `Pirates' or `Cutthroat Island'. Jerry Bruckheimer and Johnny Depp to the rescue. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is quite likely the unluckiest pirate alive: after having suffered the ignominy of mutiny and being marooned, he finds his way to port in the one town that has a serious hate on for pirates. If that weren't enough to spoil his already bad day, Sparrow is thrown back into the fray when he promises young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) that he will help rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the young woman kidnapped by Sparrow's old enemies. Oh, and there's that pesky little curse to contend with Let me state from the outset - this is a fantastic movie that epitomizes what a summer movie should be. It features oodles of action  both in the form of swashbuckling sword fights and big time explosions, is packed full of accessible humor, boasts great special effects (note: not gratuitous), has beautiful and eerie locations, nasty villains, reformed heroes and fantastic performances. Am I making it clear that I liked this movie? Orlando Bloom is solidly low key in his first post `Lord of the Rings' outing, and makes good use of the martial skills he leaned while filming the trilogy. His character is equal parts tragic and noble, and he balances these the facets well. While Elizabeth could be rightly classified as the obligatory damsel-in-distress of the piece, she most certainly is not helpless  Knightley brings the same determined empowerment that she displayed in `Bend it Like Beckham'. You have to give props to any woman who can act and kick butt while bound in a corset and frilly fluffy dresses (and yet somehow manages to look even more beautiful while doing so  forgive me, I'm only human). Geoffrey Rush is deliciously devilish as Captain Barossa the dark hearted scoundrel of the piece, the, who dispenses death the with a smile. You know he's bad just by looking at the man's teeth! And then there's the Depp factor. Johnny Depp could long ago have been a major Hollywood star  he certainly has the charisma, the drive and enough talent for a few careers  however he's made a conscious decision to stick with character driven films, which are often only found in artsy or edgy films. Thankfully he chose to tackle this role with the same fervor Depp is hilarious as John Sparrow, the glib roguish pirate cursed with a streak of goodness and bad luck, who seemingly dances between madness and lucidity. To say that his portrayal binds the film would not be indulging in hyperbole, as he brings all the elements of the story and the characters together. Is that all there is you might ask? Not even close. ****Okay, I'm going to give you a warning here  if you haven't seen the trailers some potential spoilers lay ahead****. The CGI work in this films is remarkable on several fronts: the film does not rely upon them, they are not excessive and they actually enhance the film. The characters' transition from human to skeleton and back (there sequences are rapid and many) are amazingly fluid and realistic. Need more? The swordfighting are beautifully choreographed, the city sets are brilliant, the pyrotechnics in the battle scenes are pure Buckheimer (read: big, loud, and many) and the film is also fit for the youngsters. If you're in the market for a film that will appeal to anyone between the ages of 5 to 95 , look no further.
10.0~Great Movie abclka Sign in Permalink I thoroughly enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean. My Main reason I liked it is because it pulled me in. The scenery, the characters and the story has made me want to find out more about pirates and the Caribbean. Granted, I know this movie is not factual, but it has sparked my imagination. It would had not have turned out the same if Johnny Depp portrayed his character any different. This alone added so much to the movie. All the characters were done well. I just can't say enough about Pirates of the Caribbean. It is definitely a movie I have watched over and over on a daily basis and still cannot get enough. There is only one other movie I can say that about. It is a GREAT MOVIE!!
5.0~Hard Of Hearing bix171 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp's withering pirate parody is probably the only reason to watch this swashbuckler update, but he's been better elsewhere and his performance is typical of the film's major problem, namely the slurred, mumbling accents that most of the cast has adopted. It makes for difficult viewing: the needlessly complicated plot is hampered by an inability to understand much of what is going on (although the basic outline is elemental to anyone who's ever seen a film of the genre); you have to strain to hear explanations for the more mystical aspects of the story. It's a very generic piece of work; the director, Gore Verbinski, doesn't seem to have the ability to create any real tension or action sequences that arouse much excitement and consistently allows the set pieces to be interrupted by long stretches of exposition (thanks to a wordy script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio that could have used a few decent jokes). Verbinski chooses to keep the focus on Depp and while Depp is always welcome whenever he's onscreen, he has trouble connecting with the rest of the cast, which, though it includes the incredibly hammy Geoffrey Rush, has nowhere near the acting bravura he has. The remainder of the cast includes Orlando Bloom (who fails to impress after `The Lord Of The Rings'), Jonathan Pryce and Keira Knightley.
10.0~Wow! rubabyuk Sign in Permalink I've never seen a film quite like it. After seeing it at the cinema I craved to know and see more of this film and it's fantastic cast. Best bits are the homeage to Keith Richards Johnny Depp does, he looks so cool and stops the film from being too Disney if that makes sense. Bloom is the hero character, looking very handsome indeed, plus with Keira as the heroin, the film could not have more appeal! Yet it does, so many actors including Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa. Wicked film, the DVD that came out last week has so much extra to it, excellent! I trully cannot wait for the sequel, and I hate sequels!!!
8.0~Yo Heave Ho me Harties!!!! Stars-2 Sign in Permalink What a fabulous fun film !!! Johnny Depp should get an oscar for this one! He was so over the top it was fantastic!! A great swash buckling tale of olden times.Very Errol Flynn like. GO SEE IT HAVE FUN!
8.0~Great Entertainement julieyatkins Sign in Permalink It was great to see Jonny Deep back playing the sexy and mischievous character of Jack Sparrow. I did think at times the humorous lines were lacking a little enthusiasm when played, but Jonny still put them across nicely with his expressions (with those wonderful mascaraed eyes!) The introduction of sea-creatures as characters was a coup d'etat in the real sense of adventure into the unknown. It reminded me of my childhood stories when you longed for the unknown or unrealistic things to happen and wanted to travel to those far off lands... (like flying on the magic carpet with Aladdin) to the point where these adventure nearly seemed real. Then the climax at the end when Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) entered, you new your adventures were going to continue into the next episode. An entertaining film for the whole family...without the killings, swearing and overdone explosions !!
1.0~Didn't see what all the uproar was about. namallerbmu Sign in Permalink I was over my brother's house a few days ago and he made me watch this movie because I had never seen it and I wish I never did.This movie was really one of the most stupid and boring movies I have ever been witness to.The plot I really can't get into, none of the characters I think are believable as pirates.The other thing I didn't like was the fact of long the beginning was I mean I about fell asleep in the beginning.They should have never wasted their time making this piece of crap, they should've just thrown the script. I've never seen the sequels and I pray I never do for the fact that they will probably be just as bad as the first.
1.0~Overdone and contrived frank-w Sign in Permalink I went to see Pirates with the expectation that it would be a true pirate movie along the lines of Captain Blood with Errol Flynn looking like a man and Basil Rathbone as the perfect villain. I thought Johnny Depp with all the eye makeup looked like a girl with a moustache and acted too silly to be a real pirate. And the computer simulated scenes took it into the realm of fantasy and more like the Disneyland ride it was based on. I realize that, by today's standards, Captain Blood looks campy but the famous sword fight along a spit of sand between Blood (Flynn) and Captain Levasseur (Rathbone)stands as a Hollywood classic which none of POTC comes near.
6.0~Pirates of the Caribbean a classic?...Yo Ho Ho! DavidSim240183 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was the surprise success story of 2003. Pirate films have not fared too well on screen over the past 30 years or so. It was a film that took its inspiration from a theme park ride (which is pretty crass self-promotion if you really think about it). And the star was Johnny Depp, an actor who, up until that point had avoided big-budget extravaganzas in favour of edgier material. In spite of the odds stacked against it, it made a splash at the box-office and was quickly hailed as a modern classic. I've always felt the Pirates of the Caribbean films are rather overrated. Pt 1 has an easy appeal and is not an unlikable film. But its not quite the barnstorming swashbuckler that people make it out to be. The sequels only upped the scale and wound up being capsized by it. Still, at least Pt 1 is straightforward. Its no classic, but at least you can keep track of the story. Something that could not be said for the sequels. I think with POTC, Disney were trying to make a pirate equivalent of The Princess Bride. An adventure story on the one hand, with a whole level of knowing humour on the other. Where it takes all the expected clichés and wittily subverts them. When this is done right, you can produce a very entertaining experience. TPB is the undisputed champion in the field. And the same was done with Westerns in the excellent and very underrated TV series The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. But POTC is not on they're level. It feels amusing more than it feels funny. And its also much too long. Clocking in at just over two hours, it lacks the snappy pace and perfect running times of the above examples. Something that only got worse as the sequels went on. Still, Pt 1 does have its moments. The jokey tone of the film is established as soon as we get our first glimpse of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Its a very funny scene. Jack is standing on the crow's nest of his ship, purposefully looking out to sea. Then the camera pulls back to reveal that's all that's left of it. And just as the ship is about to go under, Jack casually steps off onto the dock of the nearest port. Its a scene that makes you think this is going to do for the pirate genre what The Princess Bride did for fairy tales. Its all the more disappointing then that the best gag in the film comes right at the beginning. Nothing else in the movie quite matches the hilarity of that scene. It so perfectly captures the balance between straight-faced adventuring and tongue-in-cheek humour. But nowhere else in POTC does it achieve the same level of success. Gore Verbinski directs it all with high-octane energy, throwing in everything you'd expect. Swordfights, battles, romance. But the plot has a thinness that the film never really escapes from. I think the problem may be that since its genesis is in a theme park ride, the writers have had to construct a scenario while working within very narrow margins. Certainly it never opens itself out to the possibilities or sharp deconstructions that come with the genre. Not like William Goldman and Rob Reiner's treatment of The Princess Bride. Where the film is more successful is in its casting. And Pirates of the Caribbean has a fine one. Johnny Depp expectedly rises to the occasion, putting his own unique stamp on the part. There has never been a pirate like Captain Jack Sparrow. And there never will be again. Depp's inspiration for the part was Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones because he thought pirates were the rock stars of the high seas. With a Keith Richards slur, a drunken swagger, and a fey flailing of his hands, Depp cuts and thrusts away with the entire movie. Orlando Bloom, in his first role away from The Lord of the Rings does just fine as Will Turner, the simple blacksmith out to rescue his lady love. Equally up to the action and dramatic scenes, this young man is one of Hollywood's rising stars. The exquisitely radiant Keira Knightley is wonderful as the spirited Elizabeth Swann. She brings a refreshing injection of modernity to the old cliché of the damsel in distress. And you mustn't miss Geoffrey Rush as the vile Captain Barbossa. He throws himself into the part with real theatrical gusto. A villain you just love to hate. Aside from Johnny Depp's performance, what makes POTC rather unique among the genre is the inclusion of a fantastical element. Barbossa's crew of pirates are under a curse, and are really the undead. Like the pirate genre has been crossbred with The Evil Dead. Gives a whole new meaning to skeleton crew! Its never quite as scary as it should be (this is a Disney film after all), but its a nice spark of originality in an otherwise very traditional movie. The CGI effects are really excellent here, even if such effects do seem somewhat out of place in a pirate movie. The script thrusts and parries its way to a surprisingly low-key ending. What should have been an epic battle at the end feels disappointingly lacklustre. And sadly, I'm afraid that is much of the problem with Pirates of the Caribbean. It never really goes for it with full wind in its sails. Its a pleasant film when its on, but it never wittily deconstructs itself like you imagine the writers intended. Its better then its sequels, but where it should have been a grand, high seas adventure, it sadly never gets out of the harbour.
8.0~Great show. MovieKen Sign in Permalink I recently rented Pirates of the Caribbean, and it was a great show. The best thing about this movie is that it was very entertaining, and it is easily the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time. This film has it all - humor, romance, thrills, action, mystery, and suspense. I wish I had seen it in the theater, but the DVD was great anyway. As far as the plot, I honestly wasn't really expecting anything too detailed or deep. After all, this is a Disney film, and one based on a ride at a theme park. However, there are several unexpected plot twists and turns, and it's hard to know which people you're actually rooting for in the film. The characters are interesting and they do some unexpected things from time to time. The plot was much more interesting and enjoyable than I imagined it would be. One thing that really impressed me was the CGI. I'm not a big fan of computer-generated graphics, and especially when they're inserted into live action films alongside human actors. But this was very well done - as well-done as any film I've seen. Finally, a comment about where this movie ranks. Don't get me wrong - this is a very entertaining show, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I rate this film pretty high on my own list, but I'm surprised to see it on the IMDb Top 250 films of all time. It's a great show, but I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250 films of all time. Nothing against this film, but I would think there would be at least 250 films made since 1940 that would be better than this one.
1.0~Overly long gnovak-2 Sign in Permalink Lots of action but overly long. Could have been cut by a half hour very easily. Some interesting special effects but the characters are difficult to relate to or really care about. Sheer fantasy that might appeal to those who want some mindless escapism. There are better films to spend your 140 minutes on. The special effects seem to be derivative of other modern action or horror films like Matrix and The Mummy. Most of the acting in this film is rather wooden and the actors seem to be just going through the motions, hoping it will soon end. But it doesn't. It just keeps going on and on and on. The musical score is the best part of the film. It is hard to believe they are making a sequel to this movie, but money talks. It was obviously a big hit and must have brought in a ton of money at the box office. I will take a rain check on the next installment.
7.0~Above-Average Summer Blockbuster JamesHitchcock Sign in Permalink The pirates who infested the Caribbean in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may, in real life, have been a murderous bunch of cut-throats, but Hollywood has generally seen them as swashbuckling heroes, as in the Burt Lancaster vehicle "The Crimson Pirate" from the fifties. "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is a modern film in the same tradition. It is said to be based on a Disneyland theme park ride, although in this context the phrase "based on" probably means little more than "sharing a name with". The film is set in Jamaica during the late seventeenth century, presumably before the destruction of Port Royal in an earthquake in 1692, as part of the action takes place in that city. There is, however, little attempt at period accuracy, and some of the costumes and uniforms on display seem to date from a much later period, in some cases as late as the 1770s. There are a number of other goofs; why, for example, would anyone need a warming-pan in the tropical climate of Jamaica? The plot is a complex one, which I will not summarise in full. It centres upon the rivalry between Will Turner, a blacksmith, and pirate captain Jack Sparrow for the love of Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of the British Governor of Jamaica. Despite their rivalry, and Will's detestation of all pirates, the two men have to join forces to rescue Elizabeth who has been kidnapped by Hector Barbossa, captain of the pirate ship the Black Pearl. Barbossa and his men are under a supernatural curse, laid upon them when they stole a treasure of Aztec gold. It transpires that Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl, but lost his command when Barbossa, against whom he has sworn vengeance, led a mutiny against him. The studio did not hold out great hopes for the film; at one time Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner even wanted to drop the production. In the event, however, it proved an unexpected success, both critically and at the box office, and has spawned three sequels to date. The fact that a major character dies towards the end of the film might suggest that the producers were not anticipating a sequel; the character in question was miraculously resurrected in time for "Dead Man's Chest". There are, I think, two reasons for the film's success. The first is that, despite a complicated and often nonsensical plot, the story is an entertaining one which moves along at a fast pace. The film stays true to the traditions of the pirate film with some good action sequences, including an excellent hand-to-hand duel between Will and Sparrow. The second reason for the film's success is some highly inventive casting. This was the film which first made a major star of Keira Knightley. The lovely Keira had already had a big success in Britain with "Bend It like Beckham", but was less well-known in America or internationally. In a traditional pirate movie, Elizabeth would doubtless have been played as a helpless, fragile damsel-in-distress. Today, feminist theory frowns upon this sort of portrayal of female characters, so Elizabeth becomes feisty and determined, but Keira is able to suggest an underlying fragility and vulnerability even when her character is at her feistiest. Geoffrey Rush was rather cast against type; I had always previously regarded him as the star of serious films like "Shine" or "Elizabeth", but here he plays Barbossa as a swaggering, semi-comic pantomime villain. Orlando Bloom has a difficult task; Will is, nominally at least, the romantic lead, but he is also rather strait-laced, and at times he seems rather dull by comparison with the film's real star character, Captain Jack. For it is undoubtedly Johnny Depp who steals the film. Depp is sometimes an eccentric actor, but he is hardly ever a dull one. (OK, he was dull in "Chocolat", but then that was a very dull film). The original intention was that Captain Jack Sparrow should be played as a straightforward swashbuckler, based upon the pirates played by the likes of Lancaster or Errol Flynn. Depp, however, subverted this intention and turned Sparrow into a sort of 17th century rock star- he claims the character was based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones- with a slightly slurred diction and a more than slightly camp manner. To traditionalists this must have seemed like an outrageously eccentric interpretation of the role, and yet somehow it works brilliantly, contrasting nicely with the more straightforwardly masculine Will. Depp even received an Oscar nomination for "Best Actor", a remarkable achievement for an action-adventure summer blockbuster. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for lifting "Curse of the Black Pearl" well above the normal standard of such blockbusters. 7/10
9.0~Swashbuckling is back. Fred_Maxwell Sign in Permalink I didn't expect much from a movie that was made after an amusement park ride, but I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised. This is one of my favorite movies. It has everything. A great cast, a great story, great action, and wonderful visuals. You'll believe you are back in time and living with cutthroats. But wait there's more, you also have a supernatural element that makes this like Lord of the Rings meets Black Beard the pirate. The whole idea seems ridiculous, but with Johnny Depp as CAPTIAN Jack Sparrow, he makes it all work. Too be fare Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is the actual hero of the story, but without a doubt Depp is the star. The movie would not work without him at such a great level. Then there is Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, who is as lovely as she is adventrous. Knightley really is a great actress and her character is essential to the story so she isn't just another pretty girl in an action movie, though undoubtedly she is absolutely beautiful. I won't go into the story since others here have already, but I will say that if you love pirate movies or action movies or comedies or romance or horror movies, this movie has it all and it's all top notch. This is a must see and one of the best in the decade it was made.
10.0~Still holds well after all these years hgrahovac4 Sign in Permalink Since Dead Men Tell No Tales is coming this May, I decided to re-watch this introduction to the franchise after reading about how the directors want to bring back the style of the first one. I have to say, after 14 years this movie still kicks ass. You know deep in your heart that's it's a Disney movie but from that opening scene and the arrival of Jack Sparrow (Captain Jack Sparrow), you are in for an awesome +2 hour ride (irony) through this fantastic dark world created by Gore Verbinski and the crew. What can I say about cast? Depp owns Jack Sparrow, with his own twist on Keith Richards (seems funny that the character won't die just like Richards). Geoffrey Rush nails his role as Barbossa, the mutinous first mate who took over the Black Pearl (seems odd that he's a privateer now). Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play serious Disney characters (one is an unconventional girl who is interested in pirates, while the other is an underdog trying to prove his Worth). All in all, this movie is a blast to watch and is probably one of the few blockbuster movies from Disney that you can enjoy over and over again. My only problem now is, that those Norwegians don't make a rip-off of this one for Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge as it's called in some territories).
10.0~YAY! A Pirate's Life For ME!!! Capt_Nez_Obiwan_Sparrow Sign in Permalink When I first heard that Disney was going to be making a movie inspired from the theme park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, I laughed, `Oh my God, they're getting desperate for new material now.' The trailers came out for the movie, featuring sword fighting, skeletal ghost-pirates, and the seemingly out of place Johnny Depp; I was very much intrigued. I walked i nto the cinema opening day, having no expectations about its entertainment or general value. Silly me, I forgot to heed the warning from the advertisements: `Prepare to be blown out of the water.' I absolutely loved the film from beginning to end! Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great movie because of the magnificent actors, the engaging story, and the reminiscence of some much loved old-time adventure films. At first, the prospect of a pirate that walks and talks like Rolling Stone Keith Richards with the haughty egomaniacal mentality of Warner Brother's Pepé le Pew may seem rather outlandish. However, Johnny Depp manages to make this blend very credible and comically entertaining as Curse of the Black Pearl's purveyor of eternal piratical adventure, Captain Jack Sparrow. A mouth full of gold teeth and a often slurred cockney accent make a wonderful source for a symphonic cacophony of witty lines such as the soon-to-be classic retort to a snooty British naval commodore's observation that he is the `worst pirate I've ever heard of.' Depp's Captain Sparrow smugly replies, `But you have heard of me.' It is the opinion of some critics that Depp's portrayal `steals' the show (you say `steal,' Captain Sparrow would say, `Commandeer: it's a nautical term'). However crucial to the success of this movie, Depp's performance is not the only one noteworthy. No one could surpass Geoffrey Rush's gritty, undead persona that is the spirit of the delightfully, fiendishly cunning villain Captain Barbossa. Taking the more traditional route in terms of pirate look, speech, and mannerisms (did I hear him say `Arrr'?), Rush nevertheless accomplishes freshness to his character that establishes him as an archetypal but menacing `baddy' who is threatening not only in his cursed skeletal form but also his yellow-toothed, yellow-eyed, fully-fleshed leering scallywag. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann respectively, fit very nicely into their pegs of the star-crossed lovers thrust into this grand adventure that is lovingly referred to by its fans as `POTC.' The story, by Shrek screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, has the feel of traditional epic adventure movies with a tongue-in-cheek humor employed to hint at the movie's theme-park ride roots. In one scene, a key-carrying dog cocks his head at three pirate prisoners whistling and waving a bone to lure the mangy mutt toward their cell door. A parrot slowly screeches through the rolling fog an eerie forewarning of threat: `Dead men tell no tales!' A scene with Will Turner and Jack Sparrow touring the pirate island of Tortuga reveals buccaneer party antics such as bar brawls, busty babes, and of course, lots of rum drinking. Such is the soul of the famous attraction in Disneyland, California. You will never get to a moment in Pirates of the Caribbean where you will be remotely jaded. Around every corner are spooks to make your skin crawl, sword fights to quicken your pulse, and tension relieving wisecracks to split your sides. The comedy is often very refreshingly intellectual for a so-called kid's movie. Pleasingly, a lot of the humor is geared toward adults yet still appropriate to present to kids. Many adults found themselves laughing more than their children. A couple of well-known, classic movies come to mind to which I can compare to Curse of the Black Pearl. They are: Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Princess Bride and Star Wars. Curse of the Black Pearl has the fundamental nature of the classic adventures of George Lucas' ultimate American hero, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. (AKA Indiana Jones). Captain Jack Sparrow is our new `Indy.' He fences villains and dodges perils on quests requiring bravery, faith, and a little help from his friends-old and new. Will Turner, in exchange is the new Wesley of The Princess Bride: the lover turned pirate. The situational absurdity and word wit of The Princess Bride is imminent in Pirates of the Caribbean in scenes such as Jack Sparrow's final escape from the British navy and his accord with the commodore. Pirates of the Caribbean also shares the element of total immersion into the world of its characters (and a fan following sure to eventually match) with the original Star Wars film. Fans want to dress like the characters and they debate technical and philosophical aspects of the film with others (such as `How are Will and Jack able to hold a overturned rowboat under water, trap the breathing air within it, and not float to the surface of the ocean?' and `What more specifically are the motivations behind Captain Barbossa's severe hatred of Jack Sparrow?'). Thankfully, fanatics will have more to ponder and discuss when the film's sequel is released some time within the next few years. The principal actors have expressed passion and interest in a chance at meeting with their alter egos for a second, and perhaps even a third time. Frankly, I am enthusiastically and impatiently awaiting the arrival of the continuing tale of Captain Jack Sparrow and his trusty ship, the Black Pearl.
9.0~Review about The pirates of the Caribbean : The curse of the black pearl davelock-00029 Sign in Permalink The movie is action , fantasy and adventure. Well , the story in the 16 century, when a royal ship save a child called William Terner , Elizabeth Swan found a golden necklace belong to the kid . After many years later, Elizabeth drowned in the ocean, the golden scale necklace shot a strange heartbeat in the ocean. The golden necklace invited a ship with cursed cure , they kidnapped Elizabeth because they thought that she is Terner daughter, the royal ships and William Terner with Jack Sparrow trying to save her. The movie isn't based on a book . They shoot it in Bahamas and other places. The stars of the movie are : Johnny Depp , Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom , Geoffery Rush, Jack Davenport and Kevin McNally , but the main roles are Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swan and Orlando Bloom as William Terner. My favorite character in the movie is Jack Sparrow, because he's funny and smart in some way. I recommend for 13+ to watch it.
10.0~Rollicking great fun. It works b.c of tongue-in-cheek Depp. Ben_Cheshire Sign in Permalink "But where's the rum gone!" All Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, who's Erroll Flynn meets Keith Richards) wants is to drink rum, swagger and regain control of the beloved ship he was cast from, The Black Pearl. Its convenient that he stumbles across Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who both may be exploited to get the Pearl back, and has a mission of his own, rescuing the princess, which Depp can go along with... Rousing, hearty, swashbuckling good entertainment. If Hollywood blockbusters were always this much fun (and always had Johnny Depp to bolster them and make them tongue-in-cheek), then i'd say more power to them. Its travesties like Pearl Harbour that insult the public's sense of taste. If you can overlook the lack of effort and skills from Orlando Bloom (doing his best Matthew Broderick impersonation - which is easy, just make your face as blank as possible) 8/10. Its a masterpiece of the order of Back to the Future and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It lost big points from me because i found Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann to be corny and cliche, and am still amazed that people consider what Orlando Bloom does "acting." Plus, and maybe this is my fault, but i saw it three times within the space of a month, and by the third time its appeal was waning. It seems that unlike something like Mr Bean, or something as visually beautiful as Lawrence of Arabia, it doesn't have unlimited replayability. That probably means that its not to deep. Which it isn't - its very surface entertainment - which means you can only reap so much value from it. "And really bad eggs... Drink up me 'earties, yo ho!"
10.0~excellent! weescot10 Sign in Permalink This was a great movie. Whoever did the casting, I compliment you. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are hilarious. Also, Keira Knightley was delightful. I loved the comical essence that Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush bring to their scenes together. It's an amazing movie. If you have not seen it, you're missing out. I look forward to the sequel, though I'm not sure how the third one will turn out. Anyway, it has a great plot(which will remain a secret), a great cast(Johnny Depp + Orlando Bloom=HOT!!=D), and a wonderful performance. Jack Sparrow is hilarious!! Props to you, Pirates actors! Aspiring young actress(I hope) and huge Johnny and Orlando fan, weescot10
9.0~The movie that revived the swashbuckler! suzy-60 Sign in Permalink Somewhere inside this movie is a rather pedestrian summer swashbuckler about two strait-laced earnest lovers fighting for happiness. But with a bunch of talented screenwriters and the movie's real star, Johnny Depp in a now-legendary performance as lovable scoundrel Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie became something else. We had the strait-laced lovers, properly yearning from a distance. Then--wow--Captain Jack, and then BOOM! The Undead! Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa putting in a performance almost as wonderful as Depp's, purring his way through the delightful, witty dialogue. Jack Davenport putting in an oddly sympathetic performance as the requisite Navy stuffed-shirt (who became a full-blown heartthrob in the sequel). Kiera Knightley in the role that made her famous as the Governor's pretty young daughter, and Orlando Bloom, who hadn't yet learned how to act yet was fine as the earnest, smitten, puppyish, chivalrous, thoroughly decent and rather square Will Turner. Like all movies, this has a few problems, from Bloom's stiff acting to the end battle, which goes on repetitively for about ten minutes too long; but Captain Jack and Barbossa are always somewhere ready to save the day. The subsequent sequels (which I love) can never be exactly the same as this one; Captain Jack wasn't as astonishing the second time around and Elizabeth became rapidly more clichéd as an action chick. The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie has become bigger and yet more legendary in the light of its sequels; and while the "Good or not?" argument will go on for many years concerning them, this first movie will always have a place in every heart that secretly enjoys a pirate tale.
9.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: More Than a Kid's Ride zennaclare33 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean has become much more than a ride at Disney World: Gore Verbinski has transformed this children's ride into a summer blockbuster. From the eccentric character of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), to the sword fights, and of course the romance, this movie has something for every moviegoer. Verbinski has created a classic that incorporates adventure, fantasy, and romance into a film that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. This tale of adventure centers around the bizarre character of Captain Jack Sparrow, who's crew, years before the plot begins, planned a mutiny against him and left him on an island to die. Ironically, the crew of the Black Pearl later became cursed, and the only way to lift the curse lies in the hands of Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley), daughter of a Governor. When the crew captures Elizabeth, her oldest friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with Captain Jack to save her. The story that ensues is full of energy and an ongoing sense of adventure that will keep you captivated through all 143 minutes. The key performance of the movie belongs to Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, he brings his crazy pirate character to life. From Depp's mannerisms to his wild antics, his offbeat humor shows off his likability and diversity as an actor. Captain Jack is impossible to predict and will keep you guessing what he'll do next. His character brings a fun sense of unpredictability and comic relief to this film, making Jack Sparrow nearly impossible to dislike. Now what is a summer movie without a little bit of romance? Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom) serve as this movies love sub-plot. Their love story is a classic fairytale: a poor boy falls for a girl who is out of his league, while a wealthier, more affluent man is courting her. She is kidnapped, so the poor boy goes to save her and they fall in love. While their love story is a predictable one, it doesn't necessarily take away from the plot. Elizabeth isn't your average damsel-in-distress; she is an intelligent, independent woman who often times saves herself as well as others. While the romantic aspect of this movie is relatively foreseeable, Knightley and Bloom do a fantastic job at keeping the audience interested in this storyline with their incredible chemistry. Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that is a must-see on the big screen. It's visually remarkable, from its battles set on the seas surrounding the Caribbean, to the "living dead" beings that are the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, this movie is so action packed that is might even make you feel sea sick watching it in the theaters (but not really). This timeless film will be loved for many years to come, and it's adventurous plot will have you on a ride for it's entirety.
10.0~An E-Ticket Movie travisimo Sign in Permalink After working on an internship at Disney World and becoming a devoted Disney fan, I was absolutely psyched for the Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The only other movies that matched my excitement for Pirates were the new Star Wars movies, and let me tell you, Pirates did not disappoint! I dragged my parents to see it during the first weekend and was a bit saddened when the experience was over. Fast-forward to Christmas, and my ever-observant parents give me the DVD. I watch it again, and it's just as good as before, if not better! My only complaint from the first time I saw it was that the movie was a little long, but watching a second time, I was never bored or was never looking at my watch. Every minute is jam packed full of action, humor, and excitement. As so many people have noted, Johnny Depp absolutely steals the show. I was a bit iffy when I first heard he was cast because of movies like From Hell and The Ninth Gate, but he has created one of the most memorable characters of all time. His performance in this movie will be appreciated and enjoyed by people for years and years to come. Along with Mr. Depp, the acting ensemble in this movie is quite good. Geoffrey Rush uses his Oscar clout in a great role as the evil Captain Barbossa. His stature in this movie results in a very fun and formidable villain. Orlando Bloom also does a good job as sort of a naive citizen who becomes a brave hero for the love of his life. Which brings me to Keira Knightley who is just so H-O-T you can't take your eyes off her. I think she is definitely going to have a very prestigious movie career as already indicated in the successful Love Actually. So without making this review way too long, you can tell that I love this movie. It's definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time. The special effects are great. The story is smart and involving. The acting and direction are phenomenal. And most importantly, this movie is just fun, a main ingredient that most movies should strive for. My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)
2.0~Tedious,Tiresome....and far too long aleator Sign in Permalink I can't understand why so many people are raving about this film. To me it was just one long yawn. It conformed to a current style of film-making which sadly involves substituting boring stunts and ho-hum special effects (all of which have been seen countless times before)instead of a decent storyline and real atmosphere. This sort of treatment was fine during the 1980's when Indiana Jones and the like seemed fresh and fun but surely young cinemagoers are entitled to something more intelligent in 2003 - such as a plot that makes sense, straight acting and some semblance of historical accuracy. And another thing.. where on earth did Johnny Depp get that accent from? He sounded and looked like an inebriated Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones!
7.0~Did not meet my expectations jlw96 Sign in Permalink After months of anticipation, Pirates just did not live up to my expectations. I know it is a Disney flick and based on a ride, but I was hoping for a little more realism. Plus, it was a bit overlong. I found myself wondering when it was going to end before it even ended which is never a good sign to me. I also did not like the cheesy ending. On the other hand, the hottie factor was definitely high between Orlando and Johnny. Though they both played their roles well, I think the award for best acting in this movie should go to Geoffrey Rush. He was great. I admit the film had plenty of laughs and some of the one-on-one fight scenes were interesting. Though in this day and age, I guess I expect more blood and guts. This is definitely a family movie, so kids, go see it.
10.0~That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen. So it would seem. - A line from the movie... stiva Sign in Permalink My all-time favorites. One of the best. I loved this movie. I enjoyed this movie. Very funny. Very entertaining. Awesome movie. Johnny as Jac Sparrow, Oh! my, can I just say wow. He was incredible. All the characters did very well. The story was awesome. The dialogs suited very well. The introduction of Jack Sparrow was awesome. The life of pirates was shown and explained very well. I won't go further into the story as it would spoil everything. A movie worth watching. A fun-thrilled adventure. Awesome special effects. Awesome music score. Watch this movie. You'll enjoy it. Buy this DVD. It's worth the money. It's worth the time.
9.0~Good Movie, Great Actors twinkle2416 Sign in Permalink this movie is really well done. I loved Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. They played off of each other really well.They seemed to have a great on screen/off- screen relationship. The script was good and the animations of the Black Pearl's curse was just amazing. The end scene after the credits with the monkey was AMAZING! I wish that we never had to say good bye to Elizabeth and William in the third movie. The movie was great and i highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of pirates and Johnny Depp. He was BRILLIANT in the movie. Johnny is known for being crazy and having a dark sense of humor and Captain Jack Sparrow is just up his ally. Captain Jack Sparrow is crazy, funny, and he likes his drinks. He's hilarious and a great hero.
5.0~Arr, this movie be overrated! dr_foreman Sign in Permalink There's a slew of classic films that haven't made it into the IMDb top 250, but at the time of writing, "Pirates of the Caribbean" has achieved a comfortable place among the best films of all time - presumably because Kiera Knightley is hot and Johnny Depp is funny, right? I mean, I can't think of any sensible reason. Truth is, this is a fun little potboiler that is way too long (people complain that Harry Potter is padded?) and completely lacking in anything resembling drama. The script has the same cringe-inducing qualities as the average Hollywood blockbuster, including the Mandatory Irksome Catchphrase that is continuously spouted by characters even though it wasn't funny the first time ("they're not rules...more like guidelines!"). If Depp didn't spend the whole movie wobbling and acted brain-fried, viewers would all be bored to tears. I must confess that the sets and costumes are impressive, and I enjoyed seeing the spectral pirates marching to attack the ship. I can see liking this movie - I can even see loving it - but a classic? I think everybody gave "Pirates of the Caribbean" an "8" because it's a crowd-pleaser, and somehow that's enabled it to rise way above where it ought to be in the rankings, which is definitely somewhere below "The French Connection." P.S. Forgive a quick aside about Roger Ebert. I like his reviews of classic movies, but he seems out-of-touch when commenting on recent ones; he thinks "Van Helsing" is better than "Spider-Man," for example, and he labels the third Harry Potter the weakest in the series. Most bizarrely of all, he argues that Kiera Knightley is not attractive in this movie. Does anyone, in the entire Universe, agree with that assessment?
10.0~The Pirate Movie that Started it All joshfedderson Sign in Permalink Disney made a truly amazing story when they came out with the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I remember going to the theater and watching it for the first time with my parents and loving it. Now I am a true pirates fan and love the series. It was our first introduction to the famous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow and his behavior. It also introduced Will and Elizabeth the two iconic lovers in the series. The story is about a young man who falls in love with a young woman and their paths cross with swashbuckling pirates. The story was good about the cursed ship and it's crew and the cursed treasure. This beautiful story has brought on four other movies and has a great legacy. Nothing can beat the original Pirates of the Caribbean. I am watching all of them right up to the new fifth installment. The Pirates life for me. 10/10 for Disney's first Pirates.
2.0~how could this piece of crap get ANY academy nominations... sarahpartridge Sign in Permalink this is straight up kids fare. I mean I just saw the last twenty minutes on TV and it was horrible! It reminded me of the original Treasure Island, which I saw at age 10 or so. The "romance" was horrible, the dialogue was horrible, it was unbearably corny, Johnny Depp turns into a skeleton man and then back, why I don't know, Orlando Bloom was cute but not much use. Johnny must have done this in order to get the free dread extensions, which were also horrible and changed ornaments every five minutes---would he have time to do his hair while waiting to get hanged??????????? ARrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhh the gold stuff looked like stuff you get at Burger King. Ick!
3.0~Definitely one of the most overrated movies ever mmxmmx2 Sign in Permalink It's been a while since I've seen it, but at least there's a chance now that it will fall out of the top 250. I even bought the DVD of it because everyone said it is sooooooo great, and I actually hoped that it might be something like a film version of Monkey Island, which might be the best adventure computer game ever made. I was totally disappointed, it was supposed to be a comedy, but only moderately funny, and I dragged myself through watching it (maybe I fast forwarded it, I'm not sure) and sold the DVD afterwards. I really don't get what's so great about it? Just an average Disney story, a well known, good looking actor and a huge marketing hype, so that even all the movie critics and the Oscar jury believe that it is a good move doesn't make it good. If it's not entertaining or contains a great, unusual idea, it could at least have contained some serious message, but of course also didn't - so I just don't get it why everyone likes it. At least I got most of my money back, but I still hope that some day there will be a real movie using the Monkey Island Plot. What I've learned: Never buy a DVD (at least not for full price) just because everyone says it's great.
9.0~Thrills and spills aplenty. Merklin Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is an entertaining and funny swashbuckling adventure that offers old fashioned thrills and spills . And good ones they are too. The story is engaging and the performances are surprisingly good. Johnny depp is mesmerising as the seemingly forever drunk jack sparrow and Geoffry rush makes a great pantomime like villain as captain barbosa. The film has a timeless authentic look,and speaking of visual stuff, the cgi is amazing. In this day and age where cgi is so frequent that we've become a bit demystified to it , the films CG zombie pirates look fantastic.They so look real Its incredible . My only gripe with potc is the surprising lack of black people in the movie.I mean, its called pirates of the Caribbean, not the pirates of europe ,you know? the Caribbean is and was made up of black people and i think that it was wrong to avoid that. Apart from that flaw though , the film is an effortlessly fun and entertaining adventure.Who would of thought that id give a positive review to a movie based on a disneyland ride , eh ?
8.0~Monkey Island the Movie mintho Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie in the theater with a couple of friends last year. When we were talking about the movie on our way home I realized that I was the only one who really liked it. I guess that if you are watching this movie with the expectaition to see a realistic pirate adventure you are going to be disappointed. When I saw the movie I was instantly reminded of my favourite computer game of all time: The Secret of Monkey Island. If you know what I'm talking about you basically know what to expect. I gave it 8/10
10.0~Pure excitement! Sup_Kitty Sign in Permalink This film wraps together the perfect measures of fun, action and adventure. Every part of this film is intriguing. It never grows old, but keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Johnny Depp, as always, thrills audiences with his wonderfully believable character: the infamous Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush once again bring life to the screen, and Kiera Knightly proves herself to be the shining star she really is, and establishes her place among the other lead actors. This action packed story is a film that the whole family can enjoy.
9.0~A movie truly a whole family can enjoy jcvdxxx Sign in Permalink For kids, they can enjoy the pirates outfits, fight scenes, and Asian exotic settings. For adults, they can enjoy the script that talks about honor, changing world, love, destiny, meaning of life ... etc. One famous Hong Kong director (Wong Jing, whose recent hit was "I Corrupt All Cops") suggested Cptn Sao Feng's (Chow-Yun Fat) costume design is racist and his participation in it is a disgrace to his own people. I cannot disagree more. There are good guys and bad guys characters in this film - his character happens to be a bad guy, so of course his costume design got to give a "bad guy" impression to the audience. Furthermore, his role is a second or third tier of actors/actresses - he can't dress up like a prince from the east and steal the main characters' thunder. Lastly, betraying is a tradition in the pirates world, according to the storyline, thus his betrayal to his fellow pirates doesn't reflect any ethic values. Instead, it shows how the government likes to use the betray tactic to create wars among the pirates. Concerning his performance, he got better performance opportunity in this movie than "Dragon Balls: Evolution" and he did a great job. If not better than other actors'.
8.0~An Unforgettable First Adventure ThomasDrufke Sign in Permalink What has now become a multi-billion-dollar franchise once started as an ambitious risk by Disney. Make a feature length film based on a ride at your theme park? That just didn't seem like something logical to do at the time. However, with a talented group of actors, a swashbuckling script, and one hell of a musical score, the first Pirates of the Caribbean is an absolute joy on all fronts. Perhaps, never really being topped in any way by its successors. Starting a new franchise is bold these days, which is why Disney made the right move in hiring Johnny Depp as the charming and sometimes irreverent Captain Jack Sparrow. An even better move was not leaving the entire film up to Sparrow to lead. Complementing the zaniness of Sparrow is the elegant but fierce Elizabeth Swan and the mysterious and brave Will Turner (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom respectively). All of them are great, but may not prove to be as fun if not for the incredible visual effects, makeup, and action. This felt like the first major blockbuster of the 21st century, and the rest of the series certainly ranks up there. One of the best things this series, and particularly the first film, did so well is create a mythology and universe surrounding Pirates in and around the Caribbean. It happens gradually in 'Black Pearl', seemingly allowing viewers to adapt to the unknown shores of the series without feeling overwhelmed. A lot of it's fun swordplay and grim family history, but the supernatural elements play just as well. Immortally cursed pirates just begin to mark the lovable weirdness of this film. Almost as well known as the characters and the film itself is the score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. Zimmer is always remembered as the one who created the iconic theme, but Badelt should also be credited, as should a few other unknown composers at the time who chipped in. But really, the movies would not be the same without the perfect music played over the action and adventures. This film is lengthy and does feature an annoyingly pesky English Navy who won't go away, but Geoffrey Rush's turn as Captain Barbosa and an equally (if not more) memorable turn from Depp as Sparrow makes the first film the best in the series. As fun as the action and over-the- top humor and adventure are, the thing you can always come back to in these films are the characters. The movies never quite captured the same entertainment as 'Black Pearl' did, but that wasn't for lack of trying. +Action & adventure are unmatched +Score +Memorable characters +Set up the mythology well -Lengthy 8.8/10
10.0~excellent excellent film! gmdanger7 Sign in Permalink I would say this is one of the best films i have ever seen. One of Johnny's best and Orlando too! Well put together with an amazing cast! Johnny really stole the show with all his funny sayings and such..."But why is the rum gone?" Truly an amazing actor I'm glad they chose Johnny for this part he's sooo great! Geoffry Rush also did an excellent job..people dont seem to give him as much credit as he deserves..(maybe just because he's not hott) but i dunno he was amazing. ahh yea and the amazing 18 year old Keira. Great great job! I love this movie and if you havnt seen it...GO!
6.0~Special Effects: 10, Storyline: 2 scott-1429 Sign in Permalink I am a HUGE fan of both Depp and the original Pirates. Naturally I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism as I do with ANY sequel. My daughter (15) had seen it twice and raved about it. So my 13 year old son and I went today. As we walked out, he said EXACTLY what was going thru my head: "I was kind of bored". Me, too. Special effects do not a movie make any more. We've come to expect that. Something that NEVER changes, though, is the critical element of a strong plot, something that "Dead Man's Chest" lacks. As near as my son and I could figure, the whole plot line was that everyone wanted Davy Jones' heart to control the seas. Yawn. The rest was a showcase for some admittedly fantastic special effects. Another gripe I had with this movie, as I do with many nowdays, is that the trend towards such utterly authentic dialogue almost makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Okay, maybe it's because I'm "old" (51) and my hearing sucks. But the dialects used by Naomi Harris (Tia Dalma) as well as the usual cast of ragamuffin sailors, was often impossible to understand. I love the realism; I hate the fact that I missed so much of the dialogue. It's hard - almost impossible - for a sequel to live up to the expectations of an original. Only a very few ("Aliens" for example) can come close or achieve it. In my opinion, and my son's, "Dead Man's Chest" fell a bit short. Am I glad I saw it? Absolutely. I was moderately entertained. Would I see it again or buy it on DVD? Absolutely not.
8.0~Didn't think it looked good to start with lwlridesnow Sign in Permalink I've heard tons of people talk about this movie but I've never actually seen it. I thought it looked like a goofy movie not very serious. But I decided to watch it and I actually really enjoyed. There were a few jokes that I found pretty funny but not too many to make the movie cheesy. Storyline was amazing as well.
9.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Darth_Hoodlife91 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Disney ride becomes a full length theatrical hit that may be as if not more exciting than the ride. Pirates throws you right into the action and never stops. We begin with a young Elizabeth Swann, daughter of Gov.Weatherbee Swann who's ship rescues a young Will Turner from a wrecked ship which was destroyed by our villains which I will mention later. Eight years fly by and Elizabeth and Will are young adults. Elizabeth is set to be engaged with Beckett a side character in this who plays a more important role in the sequels to come. Jack Sparrow makes his "grand" entrance by sailing to Port Royale on a sinking ship, tries to commandeer a new ship, then rescues Elizabeth. After his heroic attempt, it is discovered he is in fact a Pirate and is sentenced to death. That night, the villains seen earlier make their appearance in Port Royale as they are looking for cursed aztec gold which Elizabeth possesses. Believing she is the descendant to Will Turner's father who's blood was needed to undo the curse, she is taken hostage. Will breaks Captain Jack out of jail and they set foot on a journey that takes them to many places and battles. I will not spoil the rest. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the first in a trilogy of movies based on the Disney ride of the same name. This movie features pretty decent performances from its actors; Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly. It features some great swashbuckling action but some of the swashbuckling scenes aren't so greatly choreographed which brings me to some flaws of the movie. Captain Barbossa really isn't that menacing of a villain. He is charismatic and charming sometimes wicked even, but he's no Joker, he's no Darth Vader, by far no Hanabal Lector. Sure the scenes were Barbossa and his crew turn into undead pirates are great example of the special effects in this movie, he really isn't a menacing villain and he doesn't have much of an evil plan. This movie is just meant to be fun. It doesn't have a complex plot, its a very simple plot even, but it is just meant to be good ole brainless(well I can't call this completely brainless though) summer fun. Once you see this, you will be wanting to get on this ride again, I promise you. This is definitely one of the best Disney movies in quite sometime due to the declining quality of Disney movies excluding Pixar who has yet to make a bad movie to date. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, despite the flaws I mentioned(the good by far outweighs the bad here), 10 swords out of 10! Coming Soon, my review for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End. Which one will be the best of the three? Find out soon!
9.0~fantastic. fboncuk Sign in Permalink i have nearly seen this movie and told myself why didn't i seen it before. johnny depp was performed a good character as pirates jack sparrow in this film. if there is anybody who has never seen this before should be quick. because the second series of this film will be presented in 2006. it would be unlucky to be late before 2006. pirates barbosa was performing a good bad fellow in this film. he was bad man but very very humorous indeed. we can say it was a full action and adventure film. you are always worried about the people and the always find a way to escape any bad situation.barbosa was performing a good bad fellow in this film. the bad guys in this film have very very good expression. they all play their role satisfactorily.
10.0~Great family movie Allisgirltalk Sign in Permalink This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)
10.0~Wonderful and funny silverqueen3312 Sign in Permalink I really loved this movie. The movie was very funny and better than the ride ( and this is my second fav ride at Disney world) I bought the movie the day it came out on DVD and love all of the extras. This is one of the best movie buys I have made in a long time.
4.0~victim of too much hype disdressed12 Sign in Permalink what do you get when you have a movie that is over-hyped it can't live up to the expectation?you get pirates of the caribbean.my hopes were through the roof for this one based on all the ads and great reviews.man,what a letdown.this isn't necessarily a bad movie,but it is nowhere near as great as i was led to believe.the acting was okay,and there was some humour,but i think it tried to be funnier than it actually was.there are many films made with very small budgets,including marketing, and many turn out to be fine and sometimes successful films.i guess hollyweird just doesn't get it.then again, i guess i don't get it either since i believed all the hype and went to see this movie.i give it 5* out of 10 based mostly on the acting and some humour
9.0~A Refreshing Piece of Old Fashioned Swashbucklery WriterDave Sign in Permalink It's not going to be the best film you see this year, maybe not even this month or this week...but it's refreshing and entertaining all the way through thanks to some smart direction, a clever script, and a delightfully off-kilter performance from the master of such turns, Johnny Depp. Here's the reasons I liked this movie so much: 1. Johnny Depp is a hoot. Jack Sparrow is by far one of the strangest yet most endearing anti-heroes ever to grace the screen. You never know if he is drunk, crazy, or cleverer than you. All of Depp's quirks and mannerisms and line readings keep you constantly off guard and entertained. 2. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of some of the biggest film travesties ever ("Armageddon," "Pearl Harbor") actually hired a director who can sustain a shot, control epic scenes, pace a film, and set atmosphere without tricky camera movements or overused special effects (finally a summer movie where the effects aren't wall to wall CGI and actually seem special). By delivering this after "The Ring" Gore Verbinksi proves he is the best for-hire/hack director working in Hollywood. He's into the old-fashioned razzle-dazzle type of film-making, you know the kind that doesn't give you a headache and has some scope and where you can actually tell what is going on in big action set pieces. He can do family films ("Mouse Hunt"), horror thrillers ("The Ring"), and now big-budget action adventures. Though he shows no signs of being an auteur or having any kind of grander scheme to his work, I can't wait to see what he tackles next. 3. The film has a bloated run-time (almost two and a half hours) but it's not because it takes itself too seriously or knocks you out with set piece after set piece. You see, for the first thirty to forty minutes this film actually provides exposition and develops characters. What a novel idea! I had almost thought Hollywood forgot how to do that. 4. Last, but certainly not least, Kiera Knightly. She's got spunk, she's hot, has a British accent, and some of the most natural acting chops of any young actress working today. It made me forget that it was based on a Disney theme park ride and that Big Jerry B bankrolled the whole shebang. All in all a heck of a good time.
10.0~This movie really rocked my boat! funky_little_angel Sign in Permalink I loved "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"! It had a bit of everything thrown in -- action, comedy, romance and very good special effects! I heard it was good, but not as good as I thought it was! It's definitely one of the best films of 2003 so far. Johnny Depp was great and carried the film very well. It wouldn't have been as good without him, because he really gave life to his character, Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were also really good, and Geoffrey Rush was excellent as the evil Barbossa. Overall, a wonderful movie!
10.0~wary of joining the bandwagon? c_dyan84 Sign in Permalink Having been disappointed many times by big blockbuster movies that, er, don't really hit the spot, I anticipated PoTC to be another movie to enjoy a bit then forget. It was, after all, branded as a goody-goody Disney movie with a bunch of heartthrobs casted in it. Big deal. How much can an undead pirate ensemble hold our attention and keep us in our seats? Well. Directed by 'The Ring' man Verbinski, produced by big time Bruckheimer, scripted by the writers of Shrek, and casted with eccentrics like the long-lost Depp, PoTC was a project that called upon an unusual combination of dedicated adventurers and artists who unabashedly engineered the movie to the extreme, purely for the audience's enjoyment. I mean, Johnny Depp with real gold teeth and eyeliner, and Geoffrey Rush with a pesky monkey on his shoulder? And it's not just the big guys who did all the magic--watch out for those supporting characters and little details in the set that would keep you smiling. Oh. And, I'm not the only one who has been surprised--and impressed. PoTC garnered FIVE Oscar nominations today, including a Best Actor nomination for Depp's, shall we say, savvy performance that won't be easy to forget. Trust the Academy on this. And why was PoTC so great? Because the people behind the movie simply delivered their all, man. PoTC is romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and horror, all in one package, perfect for the cynical, the innocent, and those in between.
10.0~An excellent film madj88 Sign in Permalink I was lucky enough to go to the European premiere of this film , and I thought it was amazing. The special affects are brilliant and Johnny Depp is great, i thought that he alone made the film , as he made his character so unique and he was hilarious (the eyeliner is so cool). I found Orlando Bloom a bit disappointing in the film , as I thought that he didnt put much feeling into his lines, and didnt stand out amongst the other more lively characters .The action is excellent , and the skeleton pirates are extremely realistic and scary. This film overall is excellent , and well worth seeing for Johnny Depp(Captain Jack Sparrow)if anything.
10.0~best movie of the year countchocula69 Sign in Permalink this is the best movie i saw all year. johnny depp was the most hilarious pirate i have ever seen(although i thought he did a very convincing job).anyone who hasnt seen this yet please do. it will be one of the few movies i saw this year that i will buy on DVD
10.0~Walt Disney's Classical Films since "Mary Poppins" jrez018 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is one of the action and adventure films I ever saw. Orlando Bloom's performance as Will Turner is great, and Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow is brilliance. This film is like taken over by Johnny Depp and his character Jack Sparrow. He'll make you laugh with his hilarious, NOT Mediocre, jokes. He'll take adventure to the next level. This film should be seen with the family unless you don't want your children to see scary, frightening moments in the film. This film is still one of the most classical Disney films since "Marry Poppins", "Peter Pan", "Beauty and the Beast", and "Snow White". This film will make you laugh and make you guess what's going to jump out of the screen.
9.0~great movie, greats actors, great johnny depp ChristopherGermany Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie about two weeks ago in Germany and I must say this movie is great! If I think of the acting of Johnny Depp I am really stunned, he is sooo great, although his way of speaking in this movie is better in english is his output marvelous. I think I don't have to say anything about the story because it was a simple hollywood-like story, with its ups and downs and with its happy end, but the film was here and there really funny and the special effects are really good too! Orlando Bloom was really good too and I think you will see more movies with him in the future. The only question that stays for me is that I really don't know why it is important that Mr Bloom has to give his blood, there is not really an explanation, but who cares - the movie was so good that you can forget about this faux pas. Go and see it at your cinema because the effects are not so good on a standard tv set.
7.0~Depp saves the day b-mclean6 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a nice 100-minute movie with an extra hour of inane plot twists thrown in - who edited this thing? Johnny Depp's performance is the one thing that makes this movie enjoyable throughout. Without Depp, Pirates is just another bad summer block-buster movie with too little plot and too much special effects trying to cover it up. I'm a bit amazed that the Oscars saw fit to nominate his performance - one of the boldest, riskiest acting jobs ever allowed in a summer release. I know all the accolades went to Sean Penn's overdone performance in Mystic River. But, I'd give the nod to Depp for single-handedly pulling this movie into the enjoyable category. Afterword: Pirates II has come out, and the first hour is abysmal. Depp seems bored, and there's even less of a story than in Crrse of the Black Pearl. Barely worth renting.
10.0~excellent movie containing all ingredients! alias_spy-girl007 Sign in Permalink this is one of my favourite movies because it has a mixture of everything... there's action, romance, funny scenes, historical background etc... most of all, jack sparrow couldn't have been more perfect!!! and no one could find an actor who could do it better than the exceptional johnny depp who loves to act bizarre characters such as this one!! he's genial and the movie is nothing without him. but apart of johnny depp, even Orlando bloom gave a very good performance and so did the other actors... but jack sparrow made the movie lighter and more enjoyable (to avoid saying funny!) hope the sequel is as superb as this one!!
1.0~Skulls and bones rowmorg Sign in Permalink Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure. The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious. It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD. Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland. Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film. His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it. Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through. As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist. If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed.
4.0~I can't believe people liked this movie! laxcat Sign in Permalink Maybe I'm just getting too old for these childish popcorn munchers, but I found this movie to be tedious and contrived. It was SO predictable, in fact, that I was quoting lines before they even happened. Do movie audiences still NEED to see a man leaping from a second story balcony to avoid an explosion? This movie was so packed with stereotypes and shallow eye-rolling dialogue that there is little to no room for any creative originality. If it were not for the always delightful Johnny Depp, there would be little need for this movie at all. Splice together ten of your favorite Hollywood Frontal Lobotomies in to one big safe happy crapfest, and you'll achieve the same result. In short, the movie was entertaining, but not deserving of any special attention.
2.0~Mediocre, but good special FX and comedy smokehill retrievers Sign in Permalink Aside from Johnny Depp's Quirky performance -- always worth watching -- this was a pretty lame attempt at action-comedy. The special effects were of course competent, and the camera work was good, but the writing and plot were thin and amateurish. Perhaps I should not have expected more, given that it's just a Disney SFX vehicle with a bankable lead, but I thought this fell far short of the hype. The apparent premise that some of them were dead and cursed to go on and on ... it seemed to change somehow toward the end, as if no one was sure what the rules really were. It's set up of course for a seQuel, probably even lamer than this one. I wouldn't have minded if I hadn't paid four bucks to see the thing on Pay Per View, but I guessed wrong on this one.
10.0~Splendid movie chelseaxxx181 Sign in Permalink When I watched the movie for the first time, I really loved it right away. Maybe those gorgeous boys like Orlando and Johnny help a little bit ;), but even so this movie is funny, exciting and so on, in short: fantastic! Even now after watching him almost 10 times I still can't get enough of it! Johnny is really perfect for the role as jack, actually the whole cast is magnificent! If you haven't seem him yet,I would recommend you to drop everything, rent the DVD and make yourself comfortable on the sofa! You'll gonna love it! In a few days Dead man's chest will be out in my country, I'm really looking forward to see him! Let's hope he will be as good as the first one! (I'm from Belgium so excuse me for my not so great English =) )
10.0~AWESOME rjjockers Sign in Permalink I don't understand why you people have to put this movie down so much? Did you have a bad experience with pirates or something? I mean, seriously, they already have a domestic gross of over 300 million!, that's pretty good for a lousy movie, don't you think? I think that is was successful because of the fact that it connected with the most visited ride in America, and that it was a jerry bruckheimer film which gives it quality right away. Plus the fact that it had Johnny Depp and his character that just blew me away. In closing, this was a movie that might not get an Oscar but is still an excellent movie. -Ryan
8.0~A resounding live action comeback for Disney. SmileysWorld Sign in Permalink Since Walt Disney's death,the Disney company has continued to produce films that can be considered classic,but the majority of those films are animated and you know what they are.As far as their live action films,there has been a steady decline in quality over the last thirty years.In Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl,we have what we can safely call a resounding comeback for the Disney company in the live action department.it is a virtual retelling of a classic Disney story,but it is nonetheless appealing.Johnny Depp exudes an inescapable charm as Captain Jack Sparrow,and a lot has to do with him shaping the character after a certain Rolling Stone band member.The remaining cast,Keira Knightley (who is nothing short of lovely here),Orlando Bloom,Geoffrey Rush,as well as the countless others play off of Depp very well.The cast,the action,the humor,and overall storytelling are outstanding.I would not recommend it for smaller children,as it can be somewhat violent in places,but you and your older children will have a good time with it.Walt Disney would be pleased.
8.0~Above Average First Insert of the Franchise thomasporter-43693 Sign in Permalink While I have seen this movie three or four times, I re-watched it this past summer in order to prepare for the 5th insert. I am 20 years old and enjoy adventure/action movies. However, I am cautious when I see "Disney" on a movie. This movie begins with well created context and helpful details to set the plot of the movie. The witty comments and actions of Jack Sparrow challenge the logical sensible actions of William. As the movie plays out, the plot does a good job of staying on track. With that being said, the 2 stars I did not give to this movie would be for the beginning of the movie being action filled and witty and while Depp keeps the witty ideas present, in my opinion, the high point/climax of the movie felt like the slowest part. All in all, re-watchable, fitting for most above 12 years old
5.0~All Swash and Little Buckle film-277 Sign in Permalink Pirates is potentially a terrible film rescued solely by the talented cast and crew. The plot is as lame as a wooden legged sailor. The directorial kiss of life is apparent right from the entrance of (not so) Able Seaman Depp with a beautifully crafted and acted introduction to the Keith Richards inspired pirate. As is so oft the case from Hollywood a simply shocking plot never stands in the way of the lure of gold. The pirates in this case are the accountants of tinsel town. Geoffrey Rush hams it up in equal measure with Mr Depp and must wonder whether his digital skeletal pirate is as transparent as the plot. Laughing all the way to the bank is the phrase that springs to mind. Enjoy at your leisure but expect to have sacrificed a few brain cells by the time the credits appear.
10.0~2 words: Johnny Depp bekelleher Sign in Permalink This movie is just plain, old-fashioned fun. And Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush are the core of this film. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, try as they might are completely overrun by these two shining stars. And we come back to Johnny Depp, he was nominated for an oscar for his role in this film and after seeing it you will understand why. Johnny's traditional affinity for quirky roles is evident in this character of Jack Sparrow. The eccentric, slightly drunk, incredibly dashing and mischievous Pirate Captain. His fellow pirate in the movie and once friend, now rival Captain Barbossa is played to perfection by Geoffery Rush. Rush also opts to not to play his character straight and it is to his credit. I adore Rush, his comical character in "Shakespeare in Love" brings back fond memories. The two pirates steal the show and Johnny the hearts of all the girls in the audience (provided that you like a lot of black eyeliner and dreadlocks on a man.) The other characters pull off slightly dry and less intriguing roles with enough stuffing to hold the film together but not do much for it. The film is wonderful to watch though. It has an enticing and rather odd story line and how wonderful it is to watch Pirates sail the seven seas. This is a movie that Hollywood has been dying to make for years and in it they have created a fun ride and a blockbuster.
10.0~The greatest movie I have ever seen! Pirates4ever Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean has passed up all of my other favorite movies. I saw it 5 times in the movie theater, and my father told me that I wasn't allowed to see it anymore. This movie was very well done. Casting was great, and slipping some clips in from the ride at Disney Land was brilliant.
10.0~Excellent Film Savvy Fandemodium Sign in Permalink When I first saw the film as a trailer I definitely wanted to watch it. I mean it had Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom what more could a girl ask for. The film in my opinion deserves 5/5 stars. Not only did it have a strong cast but also it was also filmed excellently. The film had an essence of comedy, bags full of action and adventure. Plus the special effects were mind blowing. Now it wasn't only the film that was brilliant the ships were magnificent and the costumes were certainly authentic. The Black Pearl and the Interceptor in my opinion were indeed classy ships. I certainly can't wait till the film is out on DVD/VHS. My recommendation is to see it anywhere possible.
10.0~if you didn't like this movie you should grab a beer and try it again HappyHamtaro Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed seeing this movie in the theater, but it wasn't until I got home and viewed it on DVD with a few beers that i really found it to be one of my favorite late-night views. This really is a great feel good movie for when you've just come back from the bar or are busy drinking the night away. My suggestions, think up a good Pirates of the Caribbean drinking game and have away. Great movie, Great fun sober or otherwise.
10.0~I love Johnny Depp jessalynnfhlax Sign in Permalink I absolutely am in love with Johnny Depp and this movie. This man is so unbelievably HOT. I've seen so many of his movies and he is a brilliant actor. The way he captures his character as a drunk pirate, a good guy one moment bad guy the next, just amazes me. He is the ONLY person on EARTH that could fit this role... he is perfect! OH, and did I mention how incredibly gorgeous he is. WOW. I have been in love with him for SO long, and he just keeps getting hotter as years pass. I can't get enough of Pirates one and two. I have both movies on my iPod and I watch them constantly. I know everything there is to know about these two movies. Go ahead, ask me anything. I cannot wait until the next one comes out, it is going to be so incredibly amazing. I can't express my love enough. The writers did and excellent job (I love Disney movies) and the actors did just as good (especially Johnny). I love it! It is so sexy the way he talks. I love it when he says "Welcome to the Caribbean love." Ohh la la! His body movements and facial expressions are picture perfect and no one could have done it better. I think I am head over heels in love. Every girl is in love with some actor and Johnny is the one for me. And he is just SO SO SO SO INCREDIBLE Forever and ever BABE
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean is best movie of the year. Especially with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in it angvil_the_great Sign in Permalink This movie is brilliant. It has the two best and H.O.T.E.S.T men EVER. I mean Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. They're just brilliant together and funny. If you haven't seen this movie you must be nuts because its the best film of the year!(so far) Its got a bit of everything: action, romance, and comedy. It setting in old times and in the Caribbean so its set in a beautiful place, especially of Johnny Depp. This is a must see movie!!!
9.0~Great Family Movie swimmer1205 Sign in Permalink This movie was a great family movie night event. My fave character was of course Captain Jack Sparrow as he seems to bring humor into everything. The plot was not predicting as I would have thought, so I enjoyed it very much. It is generally not good for younger children for some violence but my 8 year old brother was thrilled with it. Of course he loves Star Wars. I was glad to see that there were movies that came out later and have been very happy with all of them. I hope that the next one coming out will be as great. The Black Pearl definitely earned its way to a family fave. I definitely recommend to any family with older children. The movie gave a happy feeling throughout the house. It is just a perfect little thing. I can't seem to find a fault in the movie. It was excellent and well put together.
7.0~Save this for a rainy day tiff_strauss Sign in Permalink If you read reviews of films in various newspapers and magazines, you will eventually notice trends in writing styles and points that are made in the discourses of the reviewers. In short, when they find something they think sounds important, they all focus on the same topic, and in a manner which seems meant to show off their petty vernacular skills, they make sophemoric quips and plays on the title of said flick, and/or gobble up several pages of the calendar section with mindless tripe that doesn't really get the reader anywhere. Not that a film critic really serves much purpose in the world, and thus shouldn't be taken too seriously, however, it is the fact that they are given so much attention for their interchangeably identical opinions that they should be avoided at all costs. Their recurringly similar reviews quite literally ruin movies, for they build an impression of a film before an individual has even seen it. In some cases this can be a good thing, i.e. advice to avoid a surefire disaster, or something like that. Yet when said impression is not met by the actual viewing of the film, disappointment inevitably ensues. This really only concerns films that would have been a nice little surprise, where one walks out of the theater and says, "That was just a fun movie." People who read film reviews don't get that pleasure anymore, and so, when a reviewer says, "i wasn't expecting anything, and this turned out to be enjoyable, the audience then goes into the film expecting something that they otherwise would not have, and then, don't enjoy the film as much. This was the case with Pirates, where there was such a deluge of reviews claiming that this was a terrific, fun summer movie, with a bravura performance by Johnny Depp, that by the time one actually saw the movie, it seemed dull and pointless. Been there, done that sort of feeling. I say, damn the reviewers for taking what was a nice little movie, and blowing it into something that it wasn't, so that it seemed like an umpteenth viewing of Star Tours up on the screen. You new everything that was going to happen, every quirk and eccentricity, and so, it wasn't new, fresh, or really anything. In short, I advise people to ignore reviews, and see a film for themselves first, to determine what they want to think about a movie. This would probably have been a nice little diversion, so I would recommend it, if only on the grounds that one carries no expectations into it, so that they are not disappointed.
10.0~SUCH A GREAT FILM!!!! dockerykelli Sign in Permalink Such an amazing movie to start off the franchise!!! The overall cast made the movie even better! Such a great storyline filled with lots of action, laughter, & a blossoming love story.
7.0~Fear of a Black Pearl Planet ThurstonHunger Sign in Permalink So many things could have gone wrong with this film. (And to hear tale from some of the commentary, many did). I mean c'mon...four writers create a script based upon a theme park ride? This could have all the charm of a film based on a video game like such classics as "Super Mario Brothers" and "Street Fighter." Now to be fair I haven't seen either of those nor ever will, but neither had Johnny Depp at the helm. Much has been made about his swishbuckling here, but I dare anyone to see this and not keep his/her eye on the Sparrow. In the commentary, he and director Gore Verbinski talked about some of Depp's original ideas for the character...including a prosthetic nose. Hmmm, maybe that's where the Keith Richards' idea originated? To see the best use of a faux nose so far, see Vincent D'Onofrio in the excellent "Salton Sea." But back to these high seas, high crime and high entertainment. Look the ride itself had to be made suitably accommodating to put a lot of different butts in seats, and so was this film. But think of all the other action/adventure blockbusters that simply went bust. I recently saw "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" which despite Alan Moore's impetus wound up extremely ordinary. And we had to elect Schwarzenegger as governor just to prevent him from making any more films after "The Rise of the Machines." So for the people who complain about the plot, to make such a popcorn movie, you have to traffic in larger-than-life myths that *need* to be familiar. Lover's need to be separated, one must promise her love to another to redeem her true love. Toss in an absent father (Bootstrap is about as dead as Luke Skywalker's dad was.) Allow there to be a chase and make sure the original chase is after the wrong goal or gal or gal's blood...and your on your way. So the key here, like the ride itself is not in revolutionary twists along the way but an attention to detail as we are moved along. The pirates' code and parley, splendid spectral special effects, the tie-ins to scenes from the ride. Little bits of the dialog..."Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt"..."Welcome to the Caribbean, love"..."Impersonating a cleric of the Church of England..."I want you to know that I was rooting for you mate"..."Cotton, he says you missed a spot." (As spoken by a mute man's parrot and translated by the first mate.) This film is more than clever enough, and looks gorgeous, even on the small screen...though I and you imagined reader should have seen this on the big screen. The use of CGI was less "siege" and more "see." Verbinski largely forsook his first name and avoided egregious amounts of gore. Yes it's as inflated as a Macy's Parade balloon, but its the smaller things that keep this afloat. I'll give it one stars for each of the seas, and hope we don't get half as many sequels... 7/10 By the way, the DVD I got from NetFlix was only IBM PC compatible for the bonus features. Not only Captain Barbossa is a fan of Apples, raise the flag for a MacIntosh Mutiny!
10.0~Awesome Movie! random_guy23 Sign in Permalink This movie is awesome!Johnny Depp is brilliant and very funny! Orlando Bloom does a nice job of Will turner and Keira Knightly was excellent as Liz swan. Amazing action scenes and brilliant sets, this movie has it all. Good directing by Gore Verbinski and well done acting! This movie is recommended for all pirate lovers and other people who just like movies with loads of good actors. Johnny Depp is by far my best actor, but that does not mean that the others aren't. This movie is probably one of the best in the world and is very, very well done. The ships and battles are incredible. The ghosts are very realistic and funny (the guy with the glass eye) and a amazing sword duel to finish. Outstanding!
10.0~Johnny Depp turned an OK film into a masterpiece swasbuckler! jdkraus Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp brought the film ALIVE!!! I thought this film was a typical advenure shooting banging up, cutting up swas buckler. Ifn't wasn't for Johnny Depp, this film would not have done half as good. He should have won the best Actor award for this film, but had to lose to Sean Penn, because it was a Clint Eastwood film, and it was a drama. This film would fit well for all ages both kids and parents. However, the skeleton pirates look freaky like the dead in The Lord of the Rings Part III. This film should have also won best Make-up art for Johnny Depp. The only problem with this film was some corny bits, and some parts that should have been added. This film was an out of an ordinary swas buckler than Treasure Island or any other film. The action sequences were descent, the humor was non-stoppable from Johnny Depp, Orlando bloom was the real good guy hero, Geoffrey Rush was he hateful, and slow thinking villain, and the girl was a real hotty and cuty! this film is an honesty triumph over The Lord of the Rings Part III! It is ranked among the top five best movies of the year!
8.0~Entertaining yet slightly shallow and formulatic summer blockbuster that only surprises in the acting department stamper Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is your traditional summer blockbuster: it has good special effects, a lot of action, a few pretty faces and not too much of a story. But that is not all. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which usually means that it is very high on the entertaining side and nothing more. Pirates of the Carribean fits that profile almost exactly. It is entertaining (although slightly longish when the cave is visited for the second time), that's for sure, but the makers of this film have succeeded in doing something that I had not yet seen in a summer flick of this magnitude (or maybe I have simply forgotten). They have chosen a cast, that was so superb on the one side, that it almost all of the other actors became mere puppets. Yes folks, I am talking about Johnny Depp. He is just amazing as Jack Sparrow. It is not that he is amazingly funny or something, but he just manages to surprise you over and over again. Then there is the accent and of course not to forget that strange way of movement he has throughout the film. Jack Sparrow might be quirky but he is not in your face' quirky and that is something I also liked about that character. Johnny Depp ruled as Jack Sparrow and outshone all but one of his co-stars who became mere puppets in the Jack Sparrow Show'. The exception was (of course) Geoffrey Rush, who was very solid and did a good Job as Captain Barbossa. The rest of the cast, well I've said it and I'm not sorry for telling the truth: you acted decent, but in the presence of Mr.Depp you faded into the background. Concluding this review I'd have to say that the acting was the only surprising thing in this film. There are some typical one-liners which either fall flat or which I just do not consider funny (SPOILERS AHEAD), like when the pirate in the cave says: `I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!' (SPOILERS END). This sort of thing simply does not do it for me. Also I thought that I, as a viewer, was not involved' deeply enough in the love between Elizabeth and William. Jack Sparrow was just too overwhelming and I feel that the film could have actually done without about everything but Jack Sparrow, without losing it's appeal. This is well made, light-hearted summer entertainment though and not some film you are supposed to think about. Worth watching once, maybe even twice (for seeing Jack Sparrow again most likely), but then it should be left alone. 8 out of 10
1.0~Pirates Seek To Suck Your Wallet Dry Davole45 Sign in Permalink This movie is among the most utterly overrated piles of garbage I have ever seen. Containing one of the most linear plots, Pirates seeks to appeal to the most basic of minds, while most people of average or better intelligence hope their feet fall asleep so they have something to take their minds off of the movie. I had no intention of ever seeing this movie, but my sister wanted it (for what reason I do not know) so I got it for her for her birthday and decided to watch it. I can honestly say that I would have felt better burning the $10 I spent on it and watching the pretty flame for a few seconds. Action movies are inherently bad, but this one shines among the worst of them. This is the type of movie that would keep President Bush contented for hours, but if you want to see a real movie that will tickle your senses, I suggest you pick up Shawshank Redemption or Donnie Darko.
10.0~Best Disney movie in my opinion. bloodmage05 Sign in Permalink I'll admit, I didn't know much about Johnny Depp before I saw this movie back in 2004, a year after it came out. But now hes my favorite actor. It is probably one of my favorites because of great acting from Depp, Bloom, and Knightley. I also enjoyed how there are the different scenes from the ride at Disney land/world. Cpt. Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) was by far my favorite villain of all times. I honestly cant think of any weaknesses in the movie what so ever other than the CG isn't up to date anymore. Over all I think that the entire cast deserves three flaming thumbs up(if thats possible) I highly recommend to everyone. I think I'll be Jack Sparrow this year for Halloween...
4.0~Starts off great but quickly becomes tedious Maciste_Brother Sign in Permalink I'm not much of a fan of Disney movies, pirates and Johnny Depp so I was really reluctant to see this Disney flick. I was pleasantly surprised by how the movie started. I was actually riveted, by the funny action and the amazing performance of Depp. Like I said, I'm not a Depp fan and I usually can't stand him in anything but as Jack Sparrow, Depp is totally amazing. Depp created a real character here, no matter how campy he is. Unfortunately, once the pirates invade the port and the story concentrated on them, the film became really tedious and I didn't care about anything. The film should have concentrated more on Sparrow and the two other characters. The pirates, or ghosts, are devices and it's almost impossible to care for them. The story became sillier and sillier and Depp, who's the ONLY good thing in this movie, went missing for long periods of time. Bloom and the actress were pretty much flat. And this film is very LONG!!! Oh well...
10.0~HOW GREAT THIS MOVIE IS!!!!! katala Sign in Permalink i love this movie it is one of the best i ever saw. i loved johnny depp in it. the way he acted was so great. orlando bloom was really cute and loved his acting even though he is still so young. i bought the movie the day it came out and watched it about five times in the theaters. for all the people that did not watch this movie i think that you should watch it.
9.0~hmmmmm khoye Sign in Permalink I was going to wait for video for this one, but I got sucked in at the last minute. I must say that this was a very good movie. Rush was solid, Knightley and Bloom were pretty good, and Depp was outstanding. I am NOT a Johnny Depp fan, but he really surprised me in this role. He plays the part of the pirate extremely well. This is not your usual Jerry Bruckheimer film, it is pretty toned down from the explosions and such. Don't get me wrong, it has it's share of action and entertainment, just not your "The Rock" type of movie. All in all, I would reccommend it to all over the age of 13-15 or so.
10.0~Should be a Classic Rcwilkinson123 Sign in Permalink 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is undoubtedly the best pirate movie of all-time- and this is including the Errol Flynn films. Yes, Johnny Depp does make a better pirate than Errol Flynn as well. Depp is the charm of this movie, which only adds on to a film that has a lot going for it: Disney-ride charm, endearing and classical characters, fantastic shots, courtesy of Jerry Bruckheimer, and an engaging story. Standing on its own, separate from the debated other two pirate films which make a trilogy, 'Curse of the Black Pearl' is a treasure that should last for years.
6.0~Mediocre Roller Coaster Ride + Outstanding Johnny Depp agitpop Sign in Permalink I have to admit that I also really enjoyed this movie a lot in 2003 when it was showing at the cinema and I also thought it was one of the best movies of this year. The strange thing is: I ve seen it again on DVD now and it - for some reason I can not explain - rather bored me. It has great actors, fantastic settings, but the story is not more than "okay" (it has some far-fetched useless halfhearted twists in it) and in the end one feels like having seen a teaser for Walt Disney parks ... and that s probably what the film actually is: a roller-coaster ride with some narrative lengths (it s far too long for a real exciting roller-coaster ride). Johnny Depp s acting is absolutely outstanding though (selfironical overacted, rather camp without being really gay). I also believe that Depp himself would not say that it s one of the best movies he played in (hopefully not), but probably one of the best payed jobs he s done (hopefully). Without Depp the movie would probably be quite boring and "cheap" (in the meaning of "cheap tricks"), with Depp it s at least well entertaining and particularly quite funny. At last: this is definitely not a movie one has to see twice. While other movies develop a higher quality after being watched for the second, third,... time this movie loses a lot of quality when seen for the second time. 6/10
5.0~didn't deserve so much hype in the Summer 2003 dbdumonteil Sign in Permalink Like musicals, the pirate movie fell a little into oblivion these last years. There were endeavors to revive it but ended either in artistic failure. "Pirates" (1986) by Roman Polanski enters this category, a project whose preparation was long and arduous and in the end, it was a very impersonal amount and Polanski's absolute nadir of his career with the desultory "What?" (1972). Then, "Cutthroat Island" (1995) was a contender for the genre but ended in a financial fiasco. Nearly a decade later, Gore Verbinski with whom, a good majority of cine buffs had unearthed in him palpable skills in directing with the chilling "the Ring" (2002) and under the command of the Disney firm embarked on a new ship. Direction: the pirate island with the well-intentioned will to restore once for all the reputation of the pirate movie. Unfortunately, he didn't arrive at the end of his trip. His ship fell through. It was a profitable blockbuster for the mighty producer Jerry Bruckheimer who once again lined his pockets. Artistically, well let's be as nice as possible and it will be hard because I had relied on the director of "the Ring" to rejuvenate the pirate movie and to deliver a solid entertaining film. My hopes were blighted. It was maybe a mistake to have entrusted him a big-budget film. He seems to have been dwarfed by Bruckheimer's omnipotence. However the latter's trademark is present in virtually each shot, each image of the venture and there's nothing wrong about it: exotic landscapes, lush scenery, lavish costumes, grand score, a whiff of epic movie, pursuits galore, naval engagements, a dash of fight and fusillades sequences and of course, perhaps the indispensable element: swashbuckler which was a specialty of French cinema in the sixties, helped by the unparalleled Jean Marais. There was everything in the same package which brought out a conducive odor to entice and charm the greatest number of viewers. Alas! "Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" is partly plagued by a derivative directing which can't live up to the enormous means and budget the film had at its disposal. Verbinski had been more inspired with "the Ring". However, one can feel a buoyant will from Verbinski to film his story. It's true, there's a perennial humor difficult to resist, fast-paced action. There were also visible efforts on the costumes and scenery. Everything to inspire a good amount to dream, liberty to the audience. But Verbinski sedately shoots Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)'s adventure to find again Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and in the end, the whole smells the reheated. The movie also could have gained by being curtailed of about half an hour. Verbinski's vehicle is also handicapped by its scenario and it's perhaps what hampers most the success of the film. "The Ring" had a quite strong screenplay in store but here, it's a snap, slick one. Yes, there are some neat twists to keep the audience interested until the tail end but it also encapsulates major, unacceptable drawbacks which are nonsensical in the story as a whole. So, the malicious pirates took Elizabeth hostage to help them to find a treasure which would make them human beings again (at night, they turn into living dead) but isn't it an excellent opportunity for them to reinforce and establish their power? No, instead they want to become mortal, flesh and blood men again. Then, in the first minutes of the film, after Elizabeth took Will in, she's looking at the sea and as the mist clears away, she can see a pirate ship because of the black flag. The pirate ship is close enough to enable the crew on board to see Elizabeth's ship, so why isn't there a naval engagement? It's also hard to swallow the story of Will's father and the scenarists could have found a better and less far-fetched way to make Depp and Knightley meet. The latter wears a dress with a more than fitted waist and because of this, she falls (from a high height) into the sea (you have to see the sequence to understand it and to realize how ludicrous it is). But fortunately, Depp was in the surroundings... you can guess the rest. There's also some filler in the scenario (when Depp and Knightley are on the desert island). The actors partially redeem the whole. Johnny Depp plays his game well. His mix of gravity and mockery spices up the story. Geoffrey Rush also takes the lion's share about the quality of the acting. But Orlando Bloom delivers a rather wooden acting and Keira Knightley doesn't really display skills of thespian. "Pirates of the Carabbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" is plagued by a shoddy story which should have been more stringent. There are also flashy special effects and a mundane directing. To some extent, some qualities of "the Ring" which had contributed in cementing its stance of winner have turned into drawbacks here. Once again, there's no accounting for taste but this blockbuster isn't the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. But the majority of the audience doesn't seem to have this problem. A sequel will reach the streets this summer. Will it be worthwhile?
4.0~Another childish flick jhmb2003 Sign in Permalink This movie, as 99% of Hollywood's productions, was made for kids and teens, or people who think they are still kids. I don´t want to say it's bad or stupid, it's just...like a floppy, disposable, toy. As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?
10.0~Brilliance. Sheer brilliance. Woody53 Sign in Permalink This was an excellent piece of work, in my opinion. It was a movie that balanced good acting (Johnny Depp was awesome, and Orlando Bloom was surprising), good action (any fan of fighting and war and adventure should see this), and sheer knee-slapping humor! Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) provided many one-liners and spur-of-the-moment quips that made me laugh my butt off....The skeletal pirates were well-done and the score was very fitting. I can't think of any flaws right off the bat, except that Tim Curry could've been a great addition! The movie is a tad on the longer side, but you won't notice, because you'll be so busy laughing and crying to the bumbling, dimwitted antics of the worst pirate you've ever heard of....but you HAVE heard of him! I highly suggest this movie....10/10!
9.0~Great movie danielthone Sign in Permalink This movie was a great into to all of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, setting the bar high straight away, Johnny Depp was the best choice for Captain Jack Sparrow and no one else could play it better, All in All, a great movie for the whole family to watch. I would recommend this to all people who like to go slightly back in time to the age of pirates and stolen treasure. The story is also great with little surprises along the way, These little twists give extra levels to the story which may not have always have been there. THe graphics for this movie are exceptional for the day and age it was made. THe way they left it was a great way for them to continue it onto the next movie.
10.0~"Prepare to be blown out of the water" theinaniloquent Sign in Permalink Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead. Disney movies personally suck. They only once were good but stuff nowadays just lost all of it's magic. The whole movies that can live up to it's full power is Pixar. Then in 2003, this happened. The Curse of the Black Pearl is the first installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Haven't seeing the sequels as of yet, this one is truly a gem. The action sequences (for one) are completely breathtaking. You'll actually care about the characters and everything that's going on. The acting is pretty good too, especially for a Disney movie. Johnny Depp plays a drunken pirate, and a good one at that. He deserves every one of his awards. Then we come to the score, which is AMAZING! It increased your adrenaline level and it is really unique. I have never been fascinated with pirates or anything, but this film is just awesome, and every aspect is amazing. As of now, I'm getting ready to watch Dead Man's Chest with entirely HIGH expectations! And listen to the tag line, you'll be blown out of the water! 10/10.
7.0~An Entertaining Movie NadiH Sign in Permalink If you want to see a entertaining, light, shallow movie, you've come to the right place. Pirates of the Caribbean's blend of comedy and action works wonderfully creating a truly fun movie to pass the time. The cast, for the most part, is great, especially Johnny Depp, who turns a interesting character into wonderful, show stealing one. This contrasts with Orlando Bloom, whos character is already boring compared to jack sparrow without Blooms acting adding to it. Yes this movie is one of the most entertaining movies i've ever seen, but it is little more. While Depp's character is memorable, i can hardly remember the details of the plot any more and the movie has little artistic value. If you want to see johnny Depp, I can suggest What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Edward Scissorhands, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as some alternatives, but if you're just in the mood for a movie that lets you sit back and relax, look no further than Pirates of the Caribbean.
10.0~Best movie I've seen since-wait...this is the best movie I've ever seen! abbyz_09 Sign in Permalink The writers did a great job on the script, as well as the actors/actresses did on the set. I didn't actually understand it until the second time I watched it. Then it finally hit me that this movie had the best twists and catches.
7.0~B Adventure surrounds excellent performance by Depp LivingDog Sign in Permalink This is an excellently made movie except for the script. There is one pleasurable twist, but that is not enough to carry the already predictable plot. Also, there are many lines which detract from the adventure and make it almost as much a comedy. That's fine if done in moderation (in my opinion), but this is done to excess and makes the movie appear more as a kid's adventure flick than an attempt at making a story. This movie is only worth watching to see Depp's performance. Johnny Depp is superb as Capt. Jack Sparrow - utterly convincing. Yet the rest of the cast seems contrived and fail to carry any weight. They act as if this is a "made for TV movie." It could be the directing, but then how would one explain the same directing that Depp received? The mechanical special effects were ok (6/10), while the rest: production, lighting, photography were excellent(9/10) and the computer graphics were superb (10/10). They brought something new to computer graphics - well articulated skeletons as well as the immediate switching between body and bones in different light. Overall, in my opinion, the movie earned a 7/10. -Zafoid PS: A slight node to political correctness occurs in a few scenes thus downgrading the already flawed movie. Definitely see it for Depp. -Z
9.0~Johnny Depp! audreysaucerman Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp stole the screen with his funnier than hell character that made this movie. He is the ONLY reason I loved "Pirates," although the entire cast was perfect. Bloom and Knightly were also good, but they were the more serious touch to the movie. Depp made it comedy. Definitely a worthwhile film to buy!
10.0~excelent! ACM1216 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. my brother got it for christmas and i've watched it at least once every day since. (ok a little obssesive i know)i can't get enough of this movie. each actor did a great job. But the one that really stands out it is good old Johnny D not to mention he's hot but he has a lot of talent. his portrayol of capt. jack sparrow is what makes this such a great movie to watch he's funny charming and witty. my suggestion is to go out and buy the DVD. it has a whole CD of special fetures that are just as good as the film. i rate this movie 9/10
8.0~One fine movie InvisableMirages Sign in Permalink This movie is by far my absolute favorite. The drama, fights, romance, humor... EVERYTHING fits perfectly within each other like a puzzle. This whole story starts out with action right away. THe Governers daughter, Elizabeth, played by the gorgeous Keira Knightley, is kidnapped by pirates. Not just any pirates. Cursed pirates. And supposedly, Elizabeth's blood can lift the curse as she beholds a medallion, one of 882. However, her blood is not who they need, Will Turner, a blacksmith, is truly the one who can lift the curse. And of course, what's a movie without romance? Will and Elizabeth are in love. Captain Jack Sparrow, played by the wonderful Johnny Depp, is along for the ride, in hopes for fetching back his beloved Black Pearl, who was stolen from him by Captain Barbossa. Leader of the cursed pirates. All in all, this movie is amazing. Everything is played out perfectly. The plot is great, the acting is fantastic, the special effects are superb. Well done.
9.0~Jack is cool! ughy Sign in Permalink This is the most favorite movie I have ever seen. The stage is surroundings of the Caribbean sea of the 17th century. Elizabeth and Will love each other, but it is not possible because they differ in social standings. One day, Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates who lead captain Barbossa because she has Will's gold skull medallion. Then, Will go to save Elizabeth with Jack who is a pirate put in prison. This is an action-packed movie. Viewpoint is Jack's performance. Jack, played by Johnny Depp, acts marvelously. Viewers are probably almost heart-stopping. One thing I regret is the plot. It is also a Romantic Comedy, but the plot is a kind of basic rescue story. Anyway, I love this movie. I think it's definitely worth watching for everyone!
10.0~Deserved an Oscar, Needed an Oscar greenday840 Sign in Permalink Okay, now this review comes a decade later. Even after all was said and done one still can't get over the fact that Johnny Depp did not receive a Oscar for this one. Blah... Blah.... Blah, I know that most of you have read several reviews of the movie since 2003 and I am not going to bore with how great the acting was, how the humour worked and the VFX was amazing but I am not. The only reason for this review is that the Academy missed another opportunity to revive itself in the minds of the common audience. Jim Carrey was snubbed so was Steven Spielberg (Read The Truman Show and Saving Private Ryan ) Jack Sparrow will be considered as an icon in the next 50 years. Never before we had seen a character with such indulegence in himself and slyness beyond the usual. The Academy could have recognised the fact and given the Best Actor award to Depp instead of their usual winners. Nevertheless, the character will remain etched in the minds of all POTC fans. Whenver the name Johnny Depp comes up, I am sure most of us will remember him as Jack Sparrow. Now, Bring Me the horizon.
8.0~Hugely entertaining with a top notch performance by Johnny Depp jimbo-53-186511 Sign in Permalink I have never been a massive fan of Johnny Depp in the past, but I must admit that his performance in Pirates of the Caribbean was nothing short of perfect. He really stole every scene that he was in and really helped in making this a fun and entertaining feature. What's also great about Pirates of the Caribbean is that the story itself is both captivating and compelling. Basically, the Pirates of the Black Pearl led by Barbossa (brilliantly portrayed by Geoffrey Rush) kidnap the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley)after they discover that she has the missing gold piece that they need to lift the curse of the Black Pearl. Upon realising that she has been kidnapped, blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) calls upon the help of eccentric pirate Jack Sparrow (amazingly performed by Johnny Depp)to help in the mission to rescue her. Turner recruited Sparrow as he is a pirate himself and was a former ally of the Pirates of the black pearl and therefore he knows where they will be heading. A crew of pirates are hand picked to assist in the rescue - there is one scene where Sparrow asks a couple of questions to one crew member, but this crew member can't speak as his tongue got ripped out so a parrot does his talking for him. Genius! POTC combines all of the elements of great film making; good acting (particularly by Rush and Depp), impressive special effects, humour - Jack Sparrow is utterly hilarious - check out the scenes where he gets slapped by several different women and the scene where he is marooned on an island with Knightley's character. These scenes are absolutely hilarious. There are also plenty of battle sequences to keep fans of action happy too and these battle scenes come fairly frequently so the film never becomes dull. If you like films that have a mix of humour, action, combined with a compelling story and pretty impressive special effects then look no further.
10.0~Welcome to the Caribbean, love LightningSparrow Sign in Permalink It'a almost 3 years since I saw this for the first time. And who didn't think: "This It's going to suck big time"? I did, but somehow I still ended up in the cinema, and saw the movie. I was VARY surprised when I walked out, and remember saying to my self: "This is actually good!" The movie has it all.. Good vs. bad, love and the funniest pirate you probably ever is going to see. Johnny Depp as (Captain) Jack Sparrow is not your everyday pirate, and some will probably still wonder what is he doing? Johnny does a great job and get every part of Jack to work so well. It makes me want more of that character. Orlando Bloom as Will is I my opinion good as well. Who else could be a little bad boy and still have some nerd-style over him? Keira Knighty as Elizabeth challenges the god girl question. Can you really be a god girl, like you have been your whole life in a pirate-world? Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is more dominated than the others characters, without make the other characters look small. That's a god balance between them all. And lets not forget even the smaller parts, but I think you need to see the movie to get to know them. You mat think: Is it still worth it? AYE! Specially if you are going to the the next 2 movies.. Look at me. It's now 3 years later I still can't get enough of this movie.
2.0~Distraction for the brain dead steven-f-freeman Sign in Permalink If this is among the best from Hollywood, I don't think I'm going to another for a long time. I know I'm in the minority, but I just don't see the point of this movie. Its plot was totally predictable, filled with all the usual silly impossible heroics. The protagonists, by all rights, should have been killed many times over. The movie also had a rash of other implausibilities, e.g., no one on the protagonists' crew died despite sustained mortal combat against a superior foe, who by virtue of a curse, could not die. The ending was especially nonsensical: several times throughout the movie, Orlando Bloom had been condemned to death (of course, he implausibly escapes each time) after having saved the life of the beloved fiancée of the commander (and daughter of the governor). Then at the end, they simply lets him and his accomplice go?!?! Even the Johnny Depp character, which admittedly had some charm and craftiness, didn't make sense: why was he seemingly quasi-drunk all the time, slurring his syllables? And why all the eye-makeup? In the end, I wonder about all the money spent on this movie, and about a society in which a silly, pointless fantasy can be lauded as among the finest cultural outputs in years.
9.0~Geoffrey Rush's performance better than Johnny Depp's Gundersonm Sign in Permalink I'm probably the only person on Earth that believes this, but I think that Geoffrey Rush's performance in Pirates of the Caribbean was better than Johnny Depp's. I agree that Depp is spectacular as Captain Jack Sparrow, and his performance makes the movie much better, but Rush's performance as Captain Barbosa is by far the most outstanding in the movie. The movie wouldn't be nearly as good without Rush's performance. The next time you watch the movie, pay special attention to Captain Barbosa (his mannerisms, the way he delivers his lines, etc.). You'll agree with me. Geoffrey Rush is very over-looked and under-rated in this movie.
6.0~Fun to watch, but too long and lacks purpose Denver53 Sign in Permalink Pirates certainly was interesting. In fact, some of the droll, dark humor was very unDisney-like (and enjoyably so). But the movie ran about two hours, and would have been better at 90 minutes. Much of it involved sword fights and plot twists that didn't add much. The plot was like a thread that would be dropped for 10 minutes, then picked up again. Johnny Depp was superb. What a strange character he created. It begged the question, though, of how this goof could have lived more than 20 minutes as a pirate. Finally, and a minor spoiler. if you end up cursed for stealing Cortez's gold, didn't the governor's daughter steal the gold from the unconscious boy? Just wondering. A good movie, which is a step in the right direction for Disney, but undisciplined and meandering. We gave it a 6.
8.0~this movie is amazing ike324 Sign in Permalink This is a amazing movie and well put together Johnny Depp is amazing as Jack. Gore did a great job and more people need to do more movies like this. Jerry Bruckheimer has recently put together some very well done movies. This one and Natational Treasure and King Arthur. He also did Pearl Harbor. Kiera did a nice job, she a great English accent. Johnny Depp job was really good. I can not wait until the next part of the trilogy comes out.it has a well drawn-ed together cast and crew. The story line is a match to the wonderful ride, and the movie part those mechanical characters in the ride to life. And I hope the next one is as big of a hit.
9.0~Disney's Best Movie! jofitz27 Sign in Permalink Have you read the summary? I really, never thought I'd say that. By I have. How could any Disney film get better than an all time classic, the Lion King? Five names: Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp, Kiera Knightly, Orlando Bloom and Geoffry Rush. They have, marvellously, created the best Disney movie of all time, and by far the best movie of 2003. Yes. Even better than Lost in Translation. This film is splendid because of so many reasons: for one, the acting is top-notch and so believable. Two: they blend in many different aspects immaculately. It's funny, suspense, fast-paced and overall, simply brilliant. Disney's Best and most well done movie is not "Snow White" or "Alice in Wonderland". In fact, not even "Steam-Boat Willie". It's there most recent effort to date: Pirates of the Caribbean. Final Analysis: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)
9.0~The best pirates movies ever Priest_of_disorder Sign in Permalink This one of those movies which you want a GOOD second part of the history, buy you find that the money destroys the movie, this part of the movie shows a great pirate Jak Sparrow, the way that Deep acts in this movie is very natural and makes a great acting, everyone fits on its character and the plot of Barbosa seeking for that Cortez's gold is very original. I haven't seen the third part because ¡the second one was so awful!, in my opinion the acting gets loosed (just look the difference between Jack Sparrow on the 1st movie and the 2nd one) and its one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. Remember, thats the second part, but i totally recommend this movie, its very fun and it got too much nominations, but finally it deserves them
8.0~Ok Now I see What I have Been Missing canadianfreak_17 Sign in Permalink Since July everyone has been telling me you have to see pirates you have to see pirates. So i listened to them and rented it. I just finished watching it and now I see what I was missing. The action, the effects and the best performence of 2003 by Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow which should get him an oscar nod. I stress the word should because it's highly unlikely but never the less he should. I was stunned how fast moving the story was it seemed to be quite fast for a 2 hr plus movie. The whole 2 hrs though was an exciting ride with thrills and chills. The effects could give Return of the King a run for there money I think. Anyway in one line AWESOME!! 4 out of 5 Stars.
8.0~Drink Up Me Hearties, Yo Ho... brando647 Sign in Permalink I remembering being completely uninterested when I first heard of this film. Understandably, seeing as how a movie from Disney based off of a ride from their theme park didn't sound as if it'd provide the strongest foundation for a feature film. It wasn't until my girlfriend of the time convinced me to watch it that I finally agreed and I'm really glad I did. This movie was nothing close to what I was expecting, blowing away every expectation I'd set for it...it was funny, exciting, engaging, and wasn't as PC or family-friendly as your average Walt Disney film. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as he embarks on a quest to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). What Jack doesn't know is that Barbossa and his crew have since acquired a curse, giving them immortality...at a price. Honestly, the story actually appears to have stronger ties to the characters of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and William Turner (Orlando Bloom), but let's face it...the pirates are better. Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have really outdone themselves with this film. They have managed to bring together some incredible elements to create a memorable film that was easily one of the best movies in 2003. The production value was incredible, with excruciating detail apparent in everything from the costume design and make-up to the beautiful set design. Throw in a cast that was top-notch (and that includes the supporting players) and you've got a great conglomeration. We all know how hilarious Depp was in his iconic role as the not-as-clueless-as-he-seems Captain Jack and he alone is worth seeing this movie at least once. Equal in every way is Geoffrey Rush as the evil Barbossa, who's performance I don't feel is getting enough attention. The movie could've focused on Depp and Barbossa without all of the other plot devices and it still would've been great based on the skill of the two alone. Keira Knightley was beautiful in her role as Elizabeth and seemed to pull her weight against the heavyweight stars; Orlando Bloom, on the other hand, didn't wow me but he also didn't weaken the film. I'd wrong not to include kudos for Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally and the rest of the great cast who brought the film to life. Seeing as how the major plot device involves undead pirates, the special effects were a crucial element. For the most part, they never disappoint. There are a few moments where the CGI was a bit too apparent and it throws you back into reality for a moment but only for a moment before the characters draw you back in. Writers Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert did an awesome job turning nothing (an amusement park ride) into something and Verbinski took that something and created a fun, funny and most importantly memorable summer film.
9.0~Ah, but you have heard of me. Spikeopath Sign in Permalink The crew of the Black Pearl are cursed by something most unimaginable, the only way to lift the curse is to return a lost Aztec coin to its treasure chest home. In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago. It's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, tho that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin. It's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun, and this this is the reason why Pirates has few peers, it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously, the audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, it is having fun because so is the film and so is crucially, its impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley {perfectly cast}, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture. The subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place, The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10
10.0~The most fun you can have at the movies without making out lucas-42 Sign in Permalink That's right. This movie is pure fun. No, it isn't the best or worst movie of all time ever. But guess what? It's entertaining, captures the spirit of the ride and a swashbuckling adventure with some awesome special effects, great acting and a script that doesn't even take itself seriously leading to some very very funny moments. Mr. Depp, great job. We wouldn't have such a good movie without ye. I laughed, I cried and... I got confused for a second at one of the quickly said jokes and then figured it out and laughed some more. Fun fun fun.. what a good movie this is. Best movie of the year. If you don't think so. Oh well. Guess you lack what makes life truly fun. If you liked it but don't think it's the best of the year. I agree. I changed my mind. Just the best movie of the summer. STILL, go watch it! you'll like it! ... I didn't use one stupid, corny pirate-related joke at all in that review. Aren't you proud? "and really bad eggs"
9.0~Superb, great movie, great cast titannz Sign in Permalink This is the first comment I have ever written about any movie. What made this movie for me was the absolutely amazing performance given by Johnny Depp. I don't know what the criteria is for giving out an Oscar but by damn this man deserves one!! This is a FUN movie that I believe everyone would enjoy. Excellent special effects, great fight scenes and Johnny Depp is just superb.

Lots of people wont agree with the EVER part, but its just gr8! its exciting, romantic(kinda,not really my thing) and funny!

Your really missin out! CYA ALL LATER!
3.0~I was way more bored than entertained Zoooma Sign in Permalink After watching one of the greatest pirate movies ever made (Captain Blood,) I decided to finally give this a try. People are astounded that I have never seen a PotC movie. Nope. Not one. Never. Why? Not interested so much in the Hollywood machine. They do make some good films, and give plenty of regular people jobs, but I'm not a sheep, thanks; I'll stick to watching what I like to watch and if I watch a "Pirates" movie someday then so be it. Well, someday arrived tonight and I must say, I am not impressed. Nope. Not really. Johnny Depp has some funny moments but two hours of him acting like that is too much. And Captain Jack Sparrow is barely a pirate. A leader of men? Give me a break. He's pathetic. There's some good acting from Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport, but Depp's hammyness is borderline mental and helps ruin this movie. And what's with the CGI skeleton pirates? I thought this was gonna be a pirate movie. It's McDisney junk food that's only mildly entertaining at best. I was more bored than entertained. 5.3 / 10 stars --Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener
8.0~Spoilers Kempywood Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl, directed by Gore Verbinksi (The Ring, and more importantly creator of the Budweiser Frogs) and starring Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands) Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) Keira Knightly (Love Actually) and as the bad guy Geoffrey Rush (House on Haunted Hill) put this together with a superb cast of extras and back of actors and you have a great cast. That's exactly what Verbinski was able to do for this movie. It all starts with the Governors daughter Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) as a young girl and her meeting with Will Turner (Bloom) although I thought this was a clever idea at first it did seem a little cheesy but mainly for one reason. A certain Mr Gibbs (Kevin McNally) is on the ship and shares his thoughts on Pirates, well they're not the thoughts of love let me tell you, but yet later in the movie he has become one?!?! Maybe I missed something along the lines but I don't think the drink alone will have destroyed his naval career and led him to a life that he so hated. Anyways I digress. This is the point in which Miss Swan sees the feared and fabled ship the Black Pearl, now personally after seeing the wreckage that she saw I'd probably try to stay away from pirates but not our miss Swan, in-fact she's probably more suited to being one herself than being just the Governors daughter. Soon enter Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) and his rum induced drunken state that seems to last the whole 137 minutes that this movie lasts (not that I blame him, so long working alongside Mr Bloom and I'd probably be drinking too) Sparrow is probably one of the best thought out and acted characters I've seen in a long time really, too often you see wooden performances because actors just turn up and read the script to the camera, Johnny Depp has gone into a lot of effort to make what he thinks and what is a believable character (hence the Oscar nomination) his great escapes from Captian Norrington are although not breathtaking are cleverly thought out. But what is a good pirate movie without a great villain? And that's exactly what Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew (including the Office star Mackenzie Crook) bring to the screen. This cursed band of pirates have only one thing to look for and that's the piece of amazon gold that currently resides around the neck of Elizabeth (remember the first part with Turner? Well he was wearing this gold around his neck and the lovely Miss Swan took it from him, yes that's right politicians and their families are just plain thieves) so when Elizabeth hides her last name fearing that they're just after the Governors daughter she chooses the wrong one in Turner. So the ride begins and the story is told of Will's father being a pirate on the Black Pearl who like the rest of the crew was cursed, the curse? Well whenever the moon hits them there true selves are brought to the surface. Great CGI is used for these exceptional looking crewmen which just adds to whole experience of the movie based on the Walt Disney ride, but in the whole was it worth the price of admission? Well if I'd paid when I saw it at the cinema.yes it would have been fortunately for me I was working there at the time so I got to see Pirates not only for free but about three days before the general release. Overall I'd give this movie 9/10 just lacking in that one aspect about Mr Gibbs I'm afraid Gore, otherwise fantastic
8.0~Undoubtedly entertaining and swashbuckling fantasy Stampsfightclub Sign in Permalink Blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) seeks the help of a pirate (Depp) to rescue Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) from the most haunted ship in the seas, the Black Pearl. Nominated for 5 Oscars, the first instalment of the Pirates trilogy is a fine swashbuckling adventure that depicts the legend of pirates in a way that is dark but also humorous and dramatic. Johnny Depp (Ed Wood) is Oscar nominated for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate with a muddled agenda, and a humorous muddled personality. Depp depicts the Captain in a way that is outrageously funny, none more so than the first viewing as you will have never seen anything like it before. The improvisations by Depp including a fine last line are superb. Timing and sophisticated approach to the man without a plan is sweet acting at its very finest and though the sequels have diminished the protagonist (not to mention awful parodies in spoof films) he is undoubtedly different. Keira Knightly (Pride and Prejudice) and Orlando Bloom (The Calcium Kid) are as poor as each other and are always in Depp's light. Geoffrey Rush (Shine) is almost as fine as Depp with a talented depiction of evil and wisdom. Depp's performance aside, the best element of this 2003 picture is the story. Though for me it took a couple of watches to fully comprehend, the narrative revolves around a haunted ship known by the folks as The Black Pearl. This element of the film is a symbol of freedom and an element of mystery that gives the characters chance to look upon and hope for the best. But it's the use of Aztec gold that really gets your mind working. The puzzle of the curse that is affecting the crew is a weird and wonderful element of the narrative that raises as many questions that it doesn't answer. There are twists and turns, none more so than right at the end in a final showdown if you like. The plot is mainly consistent but the political edge frequently undermines the tale of legends and pirates. Based on a theme park ride, Pirates produced millions on release and wasn't long before two sequels were drawn up. These undermine this first with poor scripted and effect driven stories, but will never take the shine of this fantasy adventure, which is a mostly finely acted and frequently entertaining picture with a certain character that you won't forget in a hurry.
6.0~overrated movie muterlater Sign in Permalink When i went to see this i expected alot more of this movie, especially since everyone said it was a good movie. After seing it i had a mixed feeling about this movie, if it didnt had Johnny Depp it would have been an total flop. He saved the movie in my opinion, perfect acting and funny till the end. This movie gave me the idea i was looking at a movie for kids of the age of 12 or something... fun too watch at home but not in theatre.
10.0~Hi yazaddaruwala90 Sign in Permalink Best movie Captain Jack Sparrow goes in search of the Trident of Poseidon in order to control the seas. Little does he know that his former rival, Captain Salazar, is waiting to avenge his defeat.
7.0~Disney fires one across the bow with winning 'Pirates' gregeichelberger Sign in Permalink Originally published on June 11, 2003: Let's face facts, Johnny Depp's record in films has been pretty good throughout his career. From his early efforts, "Edward Scissorhands," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and "Benny and Joon," to later work in "Don Juan DeMarco," "Ed Wood" and "Sleepy Hollow," he has maintained a steady run of decent performances. He has also never been nominated for an Academy Award, although his terrific work in "Ed Wood" did earn him a well-deserved Golden Globe nod. Oscar neglect, however, may end with his latest entry, Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl," which, like many of his other roles, does not disappoint. And even though he is not working with his favorite director, Tim Burton (this movie is helmed by Gore Verbinski, "The Ring"), he still does a marvelous job. Based on the wildly popular ride at Disneyland, which, in turn, was inspired by an episode of the 1950s TV series, "Davy Crockett," the plot has Depp as the leading man,the bumbling, mascaraed pirate captain Jack Sparrow of the ship, The Black Pearl. Marooned on a deserted island as the result of a mutiny, he thus missed out on the curse the vessel was plagued by. Given a blunderbuss with one bullet (in which to end his misery), he nonetheless saves it to gain revenge against his mutinous first mate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, Oscar-winner for "Shine"), but there is a catch. The crew of the ship has now become part of the living dead, so it may be a bit difficult to dispatch the traitor. Along to aid this cause is blacksmith William Turner (Orlando Bloom, the elf in the "Lord of the Rings" films), who was found adrift as a young boy wearing an Aztec medallion (part of the whole curse thing), as well as Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly, "Bend It Like Beckham"), the daughter of the British provincial governor (Jonathan Pryce, "Brazil"). Depp, even though a dashing handsome man, is in rare form here, not afraid to look ridiculous or take a pratfall or two, but at the same time, engages in some amazing swordplay and derring-do athletics. He also carries his British accent amazingly well, albeit he does sound a bit slurred and inebriated, much like Dudley Moore in "Arthur." With Sparrow's motley crew of handpicked pirates chasing the Black Pearl, the Royal Navy is also in tow, searching for Elizabeth. Conclusion has all three groups battling it out in a somewhat frightening denouement. Picture is also peppered with not only sharp, intelligent dialogue not usually found in a Disney film, but features some obvious scenes taken directly from the ride itself. Also, the cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, "Dark City," "The Mexican"), visual effects (Joel Behrens), costumes (Rochelle Best) and makeup (Greg Cannom) are top-notch and spot-on, giving this film a feeling of complete authenticity. All in all, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a fun, wonderful adventure, not unlike the attraction from which it came, one I am proud to say is still one of my favorites. Beware parents of younger children, however, there are some scary sequences and frightening characters as well as some violent scenes which give this movie a PG rating - the first ever for a Disney production.
10.0~Captain Jack Sparrow arrives kosmasp Sign in Permalink And he has a great entrance. A really great one, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! Even if it's only the first scene with Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow! While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different. But kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie "genre" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now! A great adventure with a crazy/great guy in the middle of it!
1.0~Why I gave it a 1 JR-79 Sign in Permalink I gave it a 1 for the sole reason that I don't think this movie needs to be in the IMDB Top 250. It's a good enough movie. Probably a 6 or a 7. But how many times has the plot of "girl wants to marry wonderful poor guy but father wants her to marry mediocre rich guy and wonderful poor guy winds up saving her" been done already? It's a nice movie with good special effects, and it's entertaining. But this movie with its plot shouldn't rank as one of the greatest movies ever.
8.0~Johnny Depp was wonderful flwrchildx3 Sign in Permalink This film was fun for the whole family. We all enjoyed it very much. Johnny Depp did an amazing job, as did Orlando Bloom.The costumes and sets were amazingly done, as was the dialogue. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys adventurous, amusing films.
10.0~Best pirate film in years SkienHigh Sign in Permalink This is by far one of the best movies in my collection of DVD's. Pirates of the Caribbean is the best rendition of a traditional pirate movie plus all the special effects and budgets of our day and age. Johnny Depp was the absolute perfect character to play Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom couldn't have played the part of Will Turner any better. The casting crew did their homework and compiled and all-star team of actors and really knocked this movie out of the park. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 because there isn't any other pirate movie out there in the market to compare this one with. Better yet, I haven't seen a pirate movie at all that was worth anything except this one and I must say, I have been duly spoiled by it. I hope they come out with a sequel, because I can guarantee you that I will be one of the guys waiting outside the theater just to be the first one in.
10.0~my favourite film ever ever spotteddalmation_101 Sign in Permalink I adore this film because it has everything, sun, sea and Johnny Depp (Orlando and Keira for those of you who don't share my passion.)I was ABSOLUTELY astounded to watch this slip by any Oscars although Depp received a few minor awards. Totally first class acting from the man as the irresistible Captain Jack Sparrow, loosely based on Keith Richards. Sparrow swaggers and burbles his rum-soaked self across the Caribbean on a quest to reclaim his beloved ship the Black Pearl from his mutinous first mate Barbossa and involves young Will Turner (Orlando B) who's trying to win over Elizabeth Swan (Keira K). So follows the most exciting and funny adventure on the seven seas with some really great quotes. If you haven't seen this already I'm shocked and suggest you go out and buy it now (you'll want it in hard copy, trust me.) Potc2:Dead Man's Chest London release is 7th July 2006 and they are in the process of filming Potc3. Long live Captain Jack Sparrow.
9.0~WOW! rdwind Sign in Permalink This is one of those rare movies that captures your attention and keeps it all the way through. The magic of this film is something that makes the rest of the movies (Harry Potter included) seems mild in comparison! Johnny Depp, while not delivering his best performance, was consistently loveable and hate-able. He never fell out of character and he is one I loved to hate. The Pirate ship was truly a masterpiece. The shocks of ghosts surround and hold you close while making you squirm through ghosts and flesh. The pirates are absolutely terrifying when seen for what they are. While I do not recommend this for the squeamish or the faint of heart. It is a family film -- but only if your kids are teenagers! Don't be fooled into believing that you should take the little ones to this -- it is not a child's movie. Enjoy!
10.0~a wonderful movie. Great acting by all of the cast and a brilliant plot! pjdlh815 Sign in Permalink fans of Lord of the rings and star wars will love this movie. Excellent job by Disney and the cast + crew. I am definitely going to see the sequel. lots of things from the ride. I was never a fan of pirate movies before I saw this. I think this is one of the best Disney movies ever. Jhonny and Orlando work so well together. Action packed and funny at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet go see it soon. Three thumbs up. just an Excellent movie. One of the best movies ever. I am now done with my summary. Good bye. thanks for reading. thanks, pjdlh815
10.0~A Pirate Story for the ages yztherumgone21 Sign in Permalink Sheer, Unadulterated brilliance!!!!!! Depp steals the show. The story is perfect for everyone and at the end you 'll feel like you just walked out of the most awesome rock concert ever! Oh, and if you weren't already, you WILL be in love with Johnny Depp! The other characters are perfectly cast as well, especially Bloom whose performance harks back to Errol Flynn and Kira Knightly who pulls off the strong and surprisingly funny damsel. Geoffery Rush is the most perfect pirate villain we've seen in forever and you just can't get enough of he and Johnny's scenes together. The DVD also has a really fun commentary with great insight into the writing and acting narrated by Johnny, Gore, and the writers.
10.0~pirates of the Caribbean piklyscmik Sign in Permalink pirates of the Caribbean is a excellently made film that will make your side hurt with laughter and your mind sour with delight as actors like Johny Depp and Orlando bloom join together to make this film a complete success and of course you can not forget people like Kirea Knightly and Geoffrey rush who help make the film what it is. this is one of Walt Disney's best non-animated films that i a have ever seen and would recommend it to anyone although it is a twelve i think that any member of the family would enjoy this excellent film. if you are into fantasy/action films then this is differently the film for you it contain the right amount of fantasy to make you realise that it is a film not a true story. it contains the right amount of action to keep you watching and the right amount of horror/mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat therefore i give this film 9.5 out of ten
10.0~The Black Pearl kokoona Sign in Permalink I think this film is spectacular because it presents you a new and stronger character: a ship. The Black Pearl inspired me suspense and curiosity. The film gives you the sensation: "I want to be there". The backgrounds are great, Johnny Depp has an amazing facility to interpret a drunk pirate ( how strange..., is it a "casuality"? ). I think Johnny Depp is the best actor in this moment, and I'm so proud to say: "I love I'm". I really wish Vanesssa Paradise to disappear... but we are talking about the film, I don't find enough mistakes to say: "This film is crap". And if it is, well, I really don't matter, I love this film, I love when Johnny says Elizabeth Swan: "Easy on the goods, darling" ( I wish being Elizabeth Swan in that instant ) and finally, I love Johnny Depp. Sorry if I have spelling or writing mistakes, but I'm a thirteen year-old Mexican girl... 10/10
4.0~Nice costumes and sets, so-so plot Carrigon Sign in Permalink Well, I liked the costumes and the sets. You could tell they spent alot of money making this movie. The skeletons were fun. But as far as the plot goes, half the time it just felt like this confusing mess. And while I loved how Jonny Depp looked in this film, I didn't like the way his character was written. I felt like I was watching Richard Simmons in a pirate costume! I think I would have liked this movie better had it been more of a horror film instead of an adventure movie. I think it would have worked scary. I would have liked Depp's character to have been tougher. I guess this movie is okay if you like pirate films, but it just wasn't what I wanted. I would love to see it redone with alot of horror, but I know I'm dreaming. So, see it for the costumes, but don't expect it to be a great film.
7.0~two thumbs up: read this monz120 Sign in Permalink I think this movie is basically a classic...if you look it is on the top 250 movies on this website and it very well deserves to be!!! It may be scary for children under the age of 12. I have seen this movie multiple times and can't get enough of it. The part that was my favorite was when Elizabeth Swan was trying to hide from two pirates and soon hides in a closet, and they find her and she demands parlay. Pirates of the Caribbean does move somewhat slow and is a bit over two hours. But it is worth the time watching, and when i went to the movies to see it I knew I wouldn't be wasting money on a ticket. I would call this a family movie, so watch this while you relax with your familey.
6.0~Good but overrated, too. Superunknovvn Sign in Permalink 8.0 is a much too high rating for this good but not great movie. I like the fact that a movie finally does justice to pirate stories. It's strange that this genre, which sure holds a few adventures in store, hasn't been too successful until "Pirates Of The Caribbean" hit the screen. Anyway, "Pirates..." is just that, a funny adventure in the tradition of "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy". It's got everything: ghost pirates, abandoned islands, a beautiful governor's daughter and a brave young hero (or two heroes that is). The dialog is witty although I feel that it could be even wittier. The direction and the special effects were not too special (nothing compared to Gore Verbinski's great job for 'The Ring'). It was funny to see Steve from "Coupling" and Gareth from "The Office" on the big screen for the first time. They should have brought Jeff in as well! All in all "Pirates..." is a fine popcorn movie and surely the summer's best Blockbuster. I hope that maybe after the success of this movie, Hollywood thinks about turning "Monkey Island" (the classic adventure game by LucasArts) into a movie. Just a thought.
9.0~The best adventure movie of the year! daria84 Sign in Permalink So far I have seen this movie 2 times and I can't get enough of it. This movie is so great, it's so well done, Gore Verbinsky (sp?) has done an outstanding job directing this film, his skills to tell stories and to make them look amazing is shown here. The story is about a curse upon the Black Pearl and their crew, they search the way to get rid of the curse. The characters are very well developed, everybody in the cast makes does a great job portraying their characters. Especial mention to Johnny Depp, who does a great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, his accent, way to express himself and even his aspect is so real! Orlando Bloom does a good job as well, as Will Turner, and of course, the great Geoffrey Rush, one of the best actors at the moment. I just love every single one of his movies, and this one is one of his bests. He is so convincing as the evil captain of the Black Pearl Barbossa, he's one of those villains who are extremly evil, yet charming. The especial affects are unbelievable, it is great to see some pirates become skeletons and suddenly change to their human shape. ILM did an awesome job in this movie. The music is also a key thing in the movie, it's just perfect, it suits to every single scene of this movie. As a summary, I believe this is probably the best movie of the year (Adventure genre that is), this is definitely a must see for everybody, kids, old people, teenagers, everybody will enjoy this movie. 10/10
10.0~Great summer movie fun aquachem Sign in Permalink This movie is what summer films should be all about. Fun, good plot (even if it is based on a Disney ride), great special effects. Johnny Depp should be nominated for an academy award for his performance. He was the movie! My granddaughter and I saw it 6 times this summer (I know, I know, but what fun it was!) and I have to admit I saw it a couple of times with other people. Now mind you, my granddaughter and I are huge Lord of the Rings fans, and this movie cannot compare that way, but it was a terrific, fun way to spend a rainy summer afternoon. Everyone should see it at least once, just to see Johnny's marvelous makeup! HA!
10.0~Depp deserves the Oscar slash3r66 Sign in Permalink PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is one of my favorite films of 2003. Johnny Depp deserves an oscar for the starring role, and owns the film from the time he hits the screen. Great job all around, the film looks cool, and the special effects are flawless. Admittedly, when I first heard about PIRATES, the idea of a motion picture based on a Disney theme park ride seemed just plain asinine. When I saw the trailer it seemed like it may work, but I wasn't totally convinced just yet. But when I saw the film in the theater, I was completely blown away. Now, having watched it again on DVD, it still holds up as one of the best of 2003. Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow is incredible. He says that much of the persona was inspired by Keith Richards, either way it's an outstanding performance all through the film. The mannerisms, gait, look, everything totally works. Geoffrey Rush turns in a fine performance as Sparrow's nemesis Capt. Barbossa, and clearly loves this role. The rest of the cast is totally solid, and there are also references to the Disney ride, which totally work in the context of the film. This movie is visually stunning, and the effects look flawless. I actually preferred the look of the undead pirates in this film to the somewhat similar treatment that the army of the dead had in RETURN OF THE KING. If you have not seen PIRATES, by all means check it out. It's a great popcorn movie that entertains without being condescending. Cool to see Depp get the Oscar nom, and it would be even cooler to see him win. Now that he's won the SAG award, it will be interesting to see what the Academy has to say.
7.0~A nice surprise edimondo Sign in Permalink I went into this one expecting not to like it, but went with some friends who just have to see a movie ever weekend. I was surprised. I laughed out loud, I got into the adventure and think it is something truly worth seeing on the big screen.
6.0~YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun evanston_dad Sign in Permalink Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), "Is he making this up as he goes along?" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series. I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, "The Curse of the Black Pearl," but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because "Pirates" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel. That sequel, "Dead Man's Chest," takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. "Dead Man's Chest" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about. So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, "At World's End," gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The "Pirates" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival "Star Wars" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass? The "Pirates" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America. Grade: "Curse of the Black Pearl": B "Dead Man's Chest": C- "At World's End": A-
10.0~This is the best movie I have seen in my entire life! I've seen it at least 50 times! canadian_chicken_37 Sign in Permalink This movie was absolutely perfect in every aspect. The casting, script, direction, set design, makeup, and costumes were exquisite. I'm glad Gore and the others decided not to kill off Jack Sparrow. It just wouldn't have been the same without him in the sequel, if there would even be a sequel if they killed him off! It would be like Hollywood without the legendary, white, gleaming sign. It would be like a book without words. It would be like the walk of fame with no stars! It would be like....well, you get the point. I'm sure many agree. Man, I hope they don't make the mistake they rallied around in the first one and make him die in the sequel. That would just defeat the purpose one making the second and third one. Let's just keep our fingers crossed for now. Only time will tell.
9.0~A great, true swashbuckling adventure! Audie-T Sign in Permalink This movie was everything a great pirate movie should be, and more! Instead of adding more praise and point out some flaws, which previous reviewers have already done, I will say this: Johnny Depp may be the coolest character that sweeps you away but Geoffrey Rush is actually the better pirate. You will realize this during the scene where Barbosa points exactly the same out to Sparrow. The bottom line: Sparrow has a heart and cares about doing the right thing while Barbosa is one evil son of a b*** who'd sell his own mother if it would make him a profit. Oh, and the true star of this movie, of course: The Pirates! I felt so sorry for them in the end. But looking at the sequel currently in production and seeing the names of supporting cast, perhaps I have nothing to worry about.
8.0~Finally, A Decent Pirate Movie Back On The Silver Screen. GeorgeRoots Sign in Permalink The first movie after all these unnecessary sequels, still remains the best movie. When I first watched "Pirates of the Caribbean" at the age of 11, it breathed new life into pirate movies that seemed to have been absent since "Hook" (1991). Luckily with a fantastic score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, plus fantastic performances from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's debatable who steals the show, as director Gore Verbinski creates a movie that is anything but slow and visually wonderful. "Captain" Jack Sparrow (Depp), searches for a ship and crew in order to get revenge from Captain Barbossa (Rush), and claim back his ship the legendary "Black Pearl". Unfortunately along his way, he also manages to involve Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and local blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Who become entangled with the villainous pirates and their quest to break an ancient curse. Saying all that. I suppose I would like to jokingly shoot myself in the foot, and say what are the point of all these wonderful fight scenes if they're cursed skeletons who remain pretty much invulnerable? Regardless, the styles and influences definitely hearkens back to the Golden age of Hollywood. The choreography is swift and for as much as the CGI is wonderfully rendered, a majority of effects are practical thanks to the films impressive budget (Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer). Final Verdict: One of the better live action Disney movies, and probably the best movie ever based on a theme park ride. 8/10.
8.0~A sure reminder of what a trip to the cinema should be about. axlrhodes Sign in Permalink The first and best by a country mile POTC film.It embodies everything that is fun about blockbuster cinema, great leads,relentless fun,fantastic music,clever script and a fizzing little story.The film arrived with no expectation, the trailer puzzled most folks but the film gathered momentum through glorious praise and word of mouth reviews.Others have said it but Johnny Depp is amazing in the lead role.The guy has played some distinctive roles in his time, Ed Scissorhands etc, etc but i feel that this is his defining moment. This is the role that people will remember him for.He improvises the character to wonderful effect and is joined by fun performances from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Gore Verbinski has proved himself to be adept in the big league and even though the sequels clearly lacked inspiration,the best of his talents are on show here as he allows his Depp to work his magic.The following films have somewhat tarnished the look of this film by being overlong and largely boring but as a standalone pirate adventure film, look no further than this.
10.0~Wonderful Orchestral Score ksimon-5 Sign in Permalink The music to this movie is very beautiful and greatly added to its success. It is both majestic and somber, but also exhilarating and intense. I was so impressed with the film score that I bought the soundtrack CD. The music is by fellow German Klaus Badelt a friend and contemporary of the excellent film composer Hans Zimmmer (Gladiator)....with numerous musical influences or references to Motzart and Beethoven and others throughout. I also hear the inspiration of another great pirate movie film composer named Eric Korngold who wrote the music to Captain Blood and many others that starred Errol Flynn. I only buy a film score if I feel that the music can stand on its own minus the film. Not all film scores can do this, but the movie music of the top film composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith do hold up quite well on their musical merits.I want our High School band director to do a corps-style marching show based on the music to Pirates of the Caibbean
8.0~Johnny Depp Is Ready for His Close-Up wes-connors Sign in Permalink "From producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl', the thrilling high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist. The roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), steals his ship, the 'Black Pearl', and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping the governor's beautiful daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). "In a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the 'Black Pearl', Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead," according to the DVD sleeve description. This first "PG-13"-rated Disney film unexpectedly became the first of a "Pirates of the Caribbean" feature franchise based on one of the company's amusement park rides. It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so, plan accordingly), and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, is quite a nice modernization of the classic "pirate" story. The film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling, swish-buckling, swaggering, and staggering "Jack Sparrow". Depp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon, original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice, with Depp being rewarded with several "Best Actor" awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley "Box Office" Top 10 stars list (#6, with a bullet). Actually, it conformed something already a reality among moviegoers - Depp in the cast made a film worth considering, and Depp as the star made a film worth shelling out the bucks to see. ******** The Curse of the Black Pearl (6/28/03) Jerry Bruckheimer : Gore Verbinski ~ Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush
10.0~Harrr...This flick delivered shivers down my salty spine!!! teo-sun Sign in Permalink Ahoi there!!! "Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" is one of the most funny, exiting, action-filled, spectacular masterpiece of this genre! One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the "salty" feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist. In conclusion, this is an adventure masterpiece, incredibly entertaining for everyone who have a little pirate-child inside! HARRR..... where's my bottle of rum???
10.0~Unbelievable scottishrose Sign in Permalink This is my single favourite movie in the entire world. I'm serious. Ever since I got it on DVD just a week ago, I've watched it every single day. I'm close to memorizing all the dialogue and I know every shot. As I write this, it's paused on the television in my room. The reason I love this movie so much is mostly the character work. The cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) instills such fear in me, and at the same time, draws a burning sense of pure pity for his plight. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), while a fine lady in all respects, is feisty and vivacious as well. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is a good friend and a fine man, modest and brave. However, the character of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is by far the most excellently played character I've ever seen. You can see deeply into his personality, simply by the motions Mr Depp goes through. It is clear that Jack, while a pirate, is indeed a good man. He is honourable and stands by his word at all times. His main goal in life is simply freedom; all of his crimes were to further that goal. He also dislikes taking away the dignity of his adversaries. He would never commit mutiny or murder for that reason. The one thing I even remotely disliked was Orlando Bloom's wooden acting. He seemed to be only able to deliver his lines in one tone, one personage. It was fine for the first half-hour or so, but after that I was mostly just waiting for his parts to be over and so we could get back to Jack Sparrow's screen time. The score for this movie is absolutely STUNNING. It's filled with powerful strings and strong brass, and it has been soaring through my head ever since the first time I saw this movie. All in all, this is a masterpiece. By all means, I encourage you to see and purchase this amazing film. You will not regret it, I guarantee you of that.
8.0~A good entertainment shadowman123 Sign in Permalink Jhonny Depp adds to his list of already enigmatic characters played probably the one he is most famous for playing - Captin Jack Sparrow , during the 2 hours of curse of the Black Pearl it was hard to think of anybody else who could pull it off as well as he did. The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of those summer time movies which you have to be in the mood to view and many years later finally... that mood had arrived for me. On the whole I was not left disappointed as it kept me hooked through its swash- buckling antics and I can see how the angles were curbed to keep this a good family film. The plot was fairly straight forward with our anti-hero pirate trying to recover his ship back whilst taking revenge on a group of super natural foes along with the entire naval fleet and the meeting a few characters along the way . The special affects were very good , not to mention the stunts and the sword play all brilliant although its never really taken to the level I had hoped for but hey again this is a family film!!! Jhonny Depp was the man who kept me in my seat , whether it be the action or the catchy one liners he makes it very apparent why he is one of the most versatile actors to have emerged onto the big screen. Orlando Bloom although I am not a fan of his he pulled his weight through out the film very well indeed UNLIKE in Troy where he was nothing short of an annoying pep-squeak and I really enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance through out the film (not just eye candy)and every body made full use of the scenery to the brilliant make-up and costumes really made it worth while. Too conclude The Curse of The Black Pearl is one of those films which are worth a check at on summer's day with your family or worth a rental if your looking for a bit of light action/fantasy I mean I may just be a little too old for Pirates now days and the action was not taken to the level I had hoped for but instead it was saved by brilliant performances all round. THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL: 8.1 OUT OF 10 'You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner, after all your in one!' - Captin Barbossa (played by Geoffery Rush.)
8.0~Very, very entertaining rbverhoef Sign in Permalink 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It is not really great, but every single aspect is terrific and that makes sure you don't see its flaws very easily. One of the flaws is the logic, but in a film like this things are not supposed to be logical, so why bother asking that kind of questions. The story, pretty standard with the usual twists, is actually quite good, or at least good enough to keep our attention. I could tell you about it but I think it would sound too silly; it kind of is. We have stories about a curse and a pirate ship called the Black Pearl with its Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), we have a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), we have a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who loves Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). She loves him too but she is about to marry Norrington (Jack Davenport). Her father is Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce), not the most unimportant person. What curse there is on the Black Pearl you have to see for yourself. Neither am I going to say why the curse is there. Let me just talk about the good stuff. The visual effects are marvelous. Everything looks (and sounds) great. Locations, costumes, makeup. The sword fights and the battles between the English and the pirates are exciting, there is never a moment you are bored. It is not all fighting and visual effects. In the quiet moments we have the most wonderful performance from Johnny Depp. His Jack Sparrow is one of the characters from the movies you are going to remember and the fact that he earned an Oscar nomination for this part says enough. He is so good you almost forget the other actors. Geoffrey Rush comes close to Deppp as the villain Barbossa and actors like Bloom and Knightley play their parts quite well. Unfortunately for them they are always in the shadow of the perfect Depp. There are more good things that make this film entertaining, but I would have to go in detail. I think I have given you enough reasons to see this film (and believe me, Depp alone is reason enough). For a very good time 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black pearl' is as good as it gets.
2.0~Many Enjoyed it But You May Not the-evil-cult Sign in Permalink I watched this movie with some friends at the cinemas a long time ago and I'm reviewing it now because ads on TV about the sequel jogged my memory. I can see now that Curse of the Black Pearl is very popular among IMDb members, especially among females and young people. If you are a young female you are much more likely to think you enjoyed this movie than if you are an old man. That's what the demographic breakup statistics say. I remember being very disappointed with this film and one reason why I was disappointed was because it was so long. I remembered getting up at the end of the film and because the film was so long my butt was aching as if someone had jabbed a needle in it. I am not averse to long movies but this one in particular was just not at all entertaining. The first reason for this lack of entertainment I think is the behavior of the characters. Johnny Depp's character is deliberately crazy. If one of my friends were to act like that in real life I would stare at him and after some time I would ask him, "Man, what is wrong with you?" In this movie, I am consistent with my behavior and badly wanted to ask Johnny Depp's character what was with the crazy behavior, but of course Depp is just acting and I obviously can't talk to the character through the theater screen, so that just left me feeling frustrated. Most of the movie is filled with humor that I didn't find funny at all, but many in the audience obviously thought it was very funny. As with the Depp character the humor was just crazy and weird, but of course humor is very subjective so it's a matter of taste I suppose. Another issue I'd like to bring up are the fight scenes, which I thought were very disappointing as well. The reason is because they were very plain. Usually in a fight scene I like to see something coherent. I want the camera to stay and I want the fight participants to engage in intense, suspenseful, but also aesthetically pleasing fights. The fight scenes in this film don't have that elegance. A bunch of people just get together and the camera cuts and shakes as if we're looking at everything from the perspective of a drunk man. The plot is another sorry part of the movie. That woman (as you can see I'm not good with names) was your typical annoying pretentious woman and at the end when she kisses the guy I actually said out aloud in the theater, "Oh, please!" How clichéd can you get? It's like a fairy tale your parents might read to you as a kid.
1.0~Could have been much better Doffer Sign in Permalink The Lighting and color was OK in some areas but for the most part it wasn't colorful enough and the lighting was underdone. There needed to be more focus on shiny appearance of gold and classical cherry wood and golden lighting. I remember some of the Disney stuff from the early 80's a picture book in particular that features the dog holding the keys at a dungeon and a massive cave system with beautifully illustrated treasure. This movie was nowhere near the standard of that. It came off looking as synthetic as the black pearl pirates in their ghost form. I'm all for CGI in movies but it was very poorly done in this movie, some of the worst I've seen. I wanted this movie to take me to the place i remember from the picture book I had as a kid unfortunately it failed miserably. Its such a shame more effort wasn't put into the fine details
10.0~Praises not Curses on the Black Pearl bostonbrown Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favorite movies. I forgot how much I truly loved it until I watched it again to prep myself for the sequel. Here are a few reasons why it is a such a great movie: 1. Original - A lot should be said for original movies. One of the things which makes this movie so great is that it is an original movie. In this generation of re-makes, comics turned movies, real-life stories turned movies, it is wonderful to be able to watch an original piece of work which is different from others you may pull off the shelf. 2. Good mix of genres - This movie is an action movie which uses wonderful humor, and yet also has a sort of sci-fi feel to it, with dramatic undertones. This is a difficult task for movies to accomplish, and the people who worked on this movie did a wonderful job of it. I think they used appropriate amounts of humor and drama mixed with a lot of action to keep you involved at every emotional level. 3. Great acting - Johnny Depp is my favorite actor. He has an amazing ability to transform into his character. In this movie, he displays this ability to us yet once again. It's like you forget Johnny Depp is in the movie and you think that Capt. Jack Sparrow is a real individual. Some people I have spoken with thought he was a little over the top, but it was his extreme acting that helped make this movie such a success. When you mix in the attractive, well-acting Keira Knightley (who looks stunning in this movie) and the superb acting of Orlando Bloom (I'm becoming a big fan of his) and Geoffrey Rush, you have a melting pot of great acting. 4. Fun story - Sure there may be a hole or two in the story, but if you look hard enough, you'll find some in every movie. That being said, this was an amazingly fun story. I could not help but to be entertained as the story moved along. I didn't want the story to end, and thanks to the second and third movies coming out, it won't! 5. Clean - There are not many clean movies made anymore. It's nice to have a great movie which has no language issues or sensual scenes. This is almost impossible to find these days. This movie is proof that you can make a great, clean movie for both adults and children (if they don't get spooked easily) to enjoy. I could add some more items, but these 5 should be enough to show why this was such an excellent movie. I can only hope that the second and third ones match up to the standards which the first one has set.
8.0~Hugely entertaining! p_j_taylor2003 Sign in Permalink Hugely entertaining film. Depp as always is fantastic and his take on his character makes the film in my opinion. Great special effects, good twist on the pirate story, although its still typically Disney, the same formula is there,but hey its for the kids! The only grievance I have is Orlando Bloom,who is becoming very annoying (why do I always think of Percy from Black Adder!). He just comes across too goody-goody and doesn't seem to be able to give anything different to his characters. He should take a leaf from Mr Depp in that department! I am looking forward to seeing the sequel because I reckon there's a lot of miles left in Capt Jack Sparrow. 8/10 (9/10 if Orlando wasn't in it, sorry girls!)
10.0~Plot Hole Answer? jonathanando33 Sign in Permalink Why do the pirates of the Black Pearl need Will Turner's blood to lift the curse? Easy peezy and this is (not clearly) explained in the film. Because Will's farther, Boot Strap Bill, was sent to Davey Joan's Locker, after the treasure was taken from the casket, therefore he could not appease the cure for the treasure he stole. Therefore, the blood of his siblings must be used to represent him as the pirates return the gold to the casket and appease the curse. Hope that helps in explaining the plot hole, well, that's how I and my mates saw it. This is one of those rare films I can watch again and again and again, because it is so entertaining! I love a good swash and buckle like the rest of em' and this is one of the best!
10.0~If You Run For Gold, Go For Jack Sparrow berberian00-276-69085 Sign in Permalink Since my family clan has Lore for Piracy, I feel obliged to write this review ... Ha-ha-ha, you got this - it's a joke! My family name is so awkward that wherever I go, they asked me whether I'm a Barbarian or maybe coming from Barbary Coast. Funny thing I didn't changed it for Anglo-Saxon and retained my Armenian denomination. Otherwise, "Pirates of the Caribbean" (2003) is a swell movie but nothing special within the "Swashbuckler" genre. I repeat "Swashbuckler" here, because if we make search with a topical word and we get avalanche of information. Predominantly, from Wikipedia and other sources you get idea for sword and chivalry adventure where an archetype is difficult to choose out of multitude of heroes, from various lands and different historical ages. Now, where are we - Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew. I presume every kid is aware that this is fantasy movie, not based on real persons or events. It gathers the fame of another Indiana Jones franchise; albeit, Archeology here is substituted with Piracy but no specific location or time is pin-pointed. Seemingly, this was originally a Video Game that was adapted for Big Screen. And since I don't want to look stupid (I am too old for Video Games or any other Sport), let me proceed thus. Johnny Depp cashed this Movie marvelously. He is exactly my age but looks some 10-15 years younger. He retained his acrobatic physical shape that we remember as early as "Benny and Joon" (1993). I wish him luck. So much so for the other cast and director Gore Verbinski. I want to comment something on Piracy Lore. That task came not to be so easy. Else, there are lot of facts in Internet but you don't have gold on tip of your tongue. As mentioned, I have huge library but things are scattered here and there. Most of my knowledge came from fiction literature - a genre known as adventure novel. Those marvelous assets in my library were gathered carefully and painstakingly, some 40 years from time. Many of those people in Antiquary Business which I collaborated with are now dead or mentally dysfunctional. But their ancestors continued the Job willy-nilly: here a book nicely illustrated, there a cover with colorful picture. We didn't have computers nor graphic design was available. We were self-made men, product of Technology Age that was at brink of Revolution. You don't have to be President to realize this. Plus, young lions were always around ready to devour, ain't they! Yet, I didn't get to my point and never will. Piracy is Neverland, heroes are like Peter Pan never growing old and living in their dream. Neverland is fantasy world seldom explored. Read the novels from Scottish writer J. M. Barrie and you will find Neverland. It is a world more fantastic than Alice's Wonderland. Have lot of fun ... P.S. If you want more, you can get access at http://www.roman-daventures.com/. This site is dealing with miscellany of Adventure Novels and their Authors. Sorry, it is in French.
10.0~Amazing Fun Adventure movie !!! EloCinquanta Sign in Permalink Just love this movie !!! One of my favorite movie ever. It was so long since I didn't saw a real good Adventure movie and it was a great discovery !!! This movie is just PERFECT in every way. Perfect story : Pirates, haunted ship, lot of comic moments Perfect music : beautiful music by Hanz Zimman Perfect actors : Johnny Depp is just amazing playing Jack Sparrow, it's probably the most important part of his career. And even if it's for a "family movie" it's a great one. He gives something very unique and fresh. It would have been so boring to have a "standard" hero like in every other pirates or adventure movies. This time it's almost an "anti- hero" but that we love even for its bad sides which is so fun. Perfect cinematography : Caribbean must be one of the most beautiful place on Earth where I dream to go one day. And the fact that the movie has really been shot in these amazing places give something more to it than if it was done in studios. Same thing for the ships and decors that we can "feel real". Well it's a great movie to watch and re-watch. A huge fresh moment, pirates, sun, sea and rum !!
10.0~my favorite movie of 2003 - entertaining, lovely kwongers Sign in Permalink Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining, fun, rousing, and exciting adventure-movies of the year, `Pirates' is far better than you think it is. Basically, it is about a pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who teams with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue a maiden Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and seize back `The Black Pearl,' now captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). The exact plot is rather difficult to explain but not difficult to understand. Even though it is based on a Disneyland ride and produced by Jerry `Kaboom!' Bruckheimer, `Pirates' succeeds because it's so full of charm, humor, wit, and absolutely terrific ensemble acting. Almost every single existing review of this movie commends Johnny Depp for his funny, original, and wacky take on Captain Jack Sparrow. And that commendation is well deserved; Depp looks like he's having a lot of fun and he's inviting the audience to share it. His numerous and hilarious facial expressions are worth the price of admission alone! (He truly is one of the most talented and under-appreciated actors of todayhe is totally awesome; I can't say enough good things about him.) Because Depp steals every single scene he is in, many critics haven't left room to write about a number of other really terrific performances in the movie. Geoffrey Rush is funny, over-the-top, and pitch-perfect as Captain Barbossa. There is one scene where Rush shines more radiantly than anyone else on the cast: when he is forcing Elizabeth and Captain Jack to walk the plank, Rush har-har-hars and swishes his sword and also has the funniest facial expressions. I also enjoyed the performance of Jack Davenport, as Commodore Norrington; he provided the perfect counterpart of the craziness of Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa. `Pirates' is clearly focused on character acting, which the director and screenwriters have obviously held to be of more importance than explosions and cannons and skewering of people (although there is lots of that too). To comment (to PRAISE, actually) on a few other things, I think the screenwriters did a fine job of mixing wit and humor into almost every single line of this movie. Captain Jack and Barbossa clearly have the best lines and I can't remember a time where I laughed more in a movie. Also, the violence is tame and rather harmless; I appreciated that. There is nothing too graphic. The visual imagery is absolutely superb and the set design is fantastic; the costumes (especially the pirates costumes) were genuine-looking and looked really well on the actors. It's total eye-candy. And lastly, I can't say enough good things about the music. Klaus Bedelt's score is heroic, bold, and entirely memorable. The music accompanied the movie perfectly but still sounds perfectly marvelous even without the movie. Everyone involved in the `Pirates' production ought to be incredibly proud for bringing such a magnificent adventure to the big screen. I can't wait until the sequel! `Pirates' is definitely my favorite movie of 2003.
9.0~A pirates life for me prod74 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie the first time I watched (when it was playing in the theaters) and I loved it again when I watched it yesterday. And I bet I'll love it the next time I watch it. It's a fantastic movie. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie. Did I mention I loved every minute of it? This one has everything: good and entertaining story, well written script, fine direction, good acting (excellent acting in the case of J. Depp), great costumes and locations, nice looking effects, humor, cool characters, swordfights, ghosts, romance, great villains. WOW!! In short, this movie is awesome. And besides, pirates are cool! The best thing about the film is, without a doubt, J. Depp's character: Jack Sparrow (sorry, I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow). Depp delivers an outstanding performance, effectively shadowing everyone else, as the goofy, somewhat crazy pirate captain, proving once again he is a great actor. If you expect deep ideas and dealing with important issues you won't find it here, but if you just want to be entertained and have a whole lotta fun I strongly recommend Pirates of the Carribean. I give it 9 out of 10 simply because of the fact that it provides 2 hours of great fun no matter how many times you've seen it.
10.0~The original pirate movie reborn F1-Phil Sign in Permalink Where to start? How to say something not already said? Damn convention. Pirates is a classic swashbuckling film. The plot is a little contrived, based as it is on the ride of the same name at DisneyLand. That said it is thoroughly entertaining. Johnny Depp is unsurpassable as Captain Jack Sparrow and basically makes the film. The storyline is essentially a rite of passage for all three main characters - Sparrow, Will Turner (Olrando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), who work their way to a secret island burgeoning with treasure to break an Inca curse inflicted when the crew of the Black Pearl took Inca gold and spent it for their pleasure. After collecting all but one piece the crew of the Black Swan encounter Miss Swann who holds the remaining piece. After all sorts of complications the inevitable conclusion occurs with the curse broken and a number of potential plot lines left open for a sequel. This film stands on its own as a classic, any sequel will have a lot to stand up to.
10.0~Best Movie Ever!!!!!! dina_td Sign in Permalink This was the best movie that I have ever seen! First of all, Johnny Depp did a fantastic job playing Captain Jack Sparrow. He was both brilliant and extremely hilarious. Geoffery Rush was great too. But the guy that I fell for was definitely Orlando Bloom. I've been in love with him ever since I saw The Lord of the Rings, but this movie really let show us how good he can be. His performance in this movie was amazing! So all I can say is that if you haven't seen this movie, go see it right now, because you won't be able to tear yourself away from it. Enjoy!
4.0~Overlong, dumb, dull action/adventure for the cognitively challenged. Fidelio111 Sign in Permalink In theory, Pirates Of The Caribbean really could have been a good film. What with Johnny Depp playing the campest pirate ever and a young couple at the centre of it who just want to get together were it for those damn undead pirates and the woman's fiancée. Such inspired ideas however admirable can not salvage this film. Under the hand of director Gore Verbinski, Pirates Of The Caribbean dispenses with character development, comic timing and structure in favour of constant frantic movement and an eagerness make sure that something is exploding, somebody is falling down a trap or Johnny Depp is eliciting a wisecrack every two seconds. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are hopelessly bland when they should be appealing while the visuals suggest a much cheaper film than its $115 million budget would have you believe. Some critics have noted that Pirates would have benefit from a 45 minute truncation of its running but even in its first quarter of an hour, I found myself getting bored. The script is also weak, with Saturday morning cartoon show level humour and not one inspired moment. The only notable thing about this film is the clever CGI used on the undead pirates and the lenience (and some might say praise) with which critics have graced it. Do yourself a favour and see Disney's Peter Pan instead, it's a funnier, more technically groundbreaking, more artistically credible and infinitely more entertaining pirate film than this two and a half hour bore. It'll probably keep your kids more entertained too, not to mention it being more suitable for them.
10.0~Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom samanthakennard Sign in Permalink I think that Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are excellent in the movie. They are both so cool as well as being fantastic actors. If you see a film and you don't have good actors in it then it will spoil the film. This is proberly one of the reasons the film Pirates Of The Caribbean is so good. There are certain parts in the film which they both stand out amonst other actors but I can't tell you as it will spoil the film! The other actors are excellent as well but those two are just the best.
10.0~WOW lilkid4eva Sign in Permalink Best movie i have ever seen- well actually a tie with bend it like beckham. POTC RULESSSSSSSS! the plot was awesome, and johnny depp was the greatest. hes my favorite actor- and really hot. orlando bloom was great too! hes really hot too, haha. geoffrey rush was incredible as the captain barbosa. kieri knitely's performance was just as amazing as everybody elses. i dont know what else to say. this movie was filmed with action and funny as hell!!!! well anways, if you havent seen this movie- you are really missing out, i mean REALLY. o yea, and i know this is totally off the subject- but if you haven't read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, read it! thats the best book, just as this is the best movie!
9.0~Quite simply, terrific fun! Mr_PCM Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl When the first Pirates of the Caribbean film came out in 2003, expectations were low. Recent swashbuckling fare in the cinemas had been disappointing to say the least (Cutthroat Island anyone?) and this new Disney adventure was based on a theme park ride! Early production news was generally greeted with trepidation, rather than anticipation - which made Pirates of the Caribbean such a wonderful surprise. 2 hours of rollicking adventure that harks back to the glory days of Errol Flynn and the like, and more recently films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Such was the impact of Pirates of the Caribbean that it not only spawned a trilogy (with a fourth in the works) but completely refreshed and re-launched the family adventure, leading to enjoyable imitations such as National Treasure – and even providing the impetus for Spielberg to finally get round to making the fourth Indiana Jones movie. Even Johnny Depp can be grateful for this juggernaut of a franchise; his outstanding show-stealing performance reinvigorated his career and thrust him into the mainstream of Hollywood, as well as landing him a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination. The plot (such as it is), opens with a suitably creepy nautical fog scene – which proves somewhat deliberately disingenuous for what is to come. After a misleading tone is set, a plot develops which revolves around a band of bloodthirsty pirates searching for some treasure or other in order to free themselves from a curse, with our swashbuckling heroes in valiant pursuit, trying to save the captured damsel in distress. So far, so predictable. But what makes Pirates work is that it knows how corny it is, and rather than trying to disguise it, director Verbinski and producer Bruckheimer (who has his explosive and exaggerated fingerprints all over this yarn), turn the corny all the way up to 11. What follows is a true piece of enjoyable escapist cinema. It may not be highbrow, but it sure is entertaining, and Johnny Depp is truly a revelation as Captain Jack Sparrow. For all his previously eccentric parts in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and the like, this is the role which will forever define him – and Depp is fine with that! The treasure is little more than a macguffin, and it is the characters – particularly Depp's Sparrow – not the plot, which provide the basis of what is a very entertaining film. Yet while Depp does steal the show, it is not solely his film. Orlando Bloom does (barely) manage to expand his emotional range from that seen in Lord of the Rings, and Keira Knightley manages to display for the first time the contradictory qualities of feisty modern heroine and elegant damsel in distress that gave her success in Pride and Prejudice and The Duchess. Geoffrey Rush however, is the equal to Depp in scene-stealing stakes, and provides a fascinating villain to the piece. All the ingredients for a fully enjoyable epic adventure are here. Exotic locations? Check. Stellar (largely British) supporting cast? Check. Swordfights and chase scenes? Check. A scene-stealing heroic lead who dishes out one-liners galore? Check. Finally, an enjoyably hokum plot with some macguffin or other at its centre? Double check. All of these elements combine wonderfully to make Pirates of the Caribbean greater than the sum of its not-inconsiderable parts.
9.0~Best pirate movie of all time?? Drew48 Sign in Permalink When it comes to adventure-type movies, Pirates of the Caribbean takes the cake. With its quirky characters, great storyline, and realistic setting, it's no wonder why it spawned a sequel. So what's this movie about? A pirate, Jack Sparrow, is on an adventure to take back his ship (The Black Pearl) after his nemesis Captain Barbossa stole it from him. Barbossa also kidnaps a woman named Elizabeth. Turns out, Elizabeth has a coin that Barbossa and his crew are after. Meanwhile, a man named Will Turner joins Jack in an attempt to get Elizabeth back home safely. I truly can't think of anything negative about this film (hence the 5 star rating). The first thing I have to point out in terms of what's to like about Pirates of the Caribbean is the actors/characters. I truly feel that each and every actor that was cast in this film was made for the roles they were cast for. From Elizabeth's innocent yet strong personality, to Will's tough yet lovable side, and to Jack's overall silliness, everyone will find something they like about the characters. When it comes to pirate movies, there's only so much you can do with a storyline. So, of course, this movie's storyline has to have something dealing with bad pirates as well as treasure. Although the storyline may seem typical, there's enough twists and turns to keep you watching. Aiding the twists are a generous amount of jokes and humor to keep the whole family entertained. Additionally, the setting and props and costumes are incredibly realistic. So much so that I *wish* I could be there with them. After you watch Pirates of the Caribbean-The Curse of the Black Pearl, you'll be rearing and ready to watch the sequel. I just can't get enough of this movie.
10.0~Highly... underrated (yes, still - despite 8.0 average!) prodigy-25 Sign in Permalink I find this movie brilliant, a true work of art. And the same applies to sequels as well. Unfortunately many people are totally unable to see past their stereotypes (or are just plain dumb), which is the sole reason for so many negative or subtly negative reviews. 'Oh, it's Disney? Based on a ride? 5/10 then', 'Not written/directed by someone famous? 5/10', 'I can't get what it's about... hmm... 5/10 for J.D.' And so on, and so on. In fact, "Pirates" is a movie with meaning, not only with much action. There are many action scenes, sure. But it's also highly symbolic (whether it was intended or not). I'll give just a couple of examples: ***SPOILERS BELOW*** Jack's arrival to Port Royal on the mast of a sinking boat. Can anyone say something like this never happened to him in real life, even if it wasn't that spectacular? Then Jack has to bribe a customs officer so that his name isn't mentioned in records and right after that he steals a small money-pouch. There're people walking around but the theft seems to go unnoticed. This isn't illogical as it may seem. Or at least it's not any more illogical than our society where all people steal from each other in more or less obvious ways and everyone pretends to notice nothing. Likewise, Jack's ship - Black Pearl - is a metaphor of freedom. (When it's first mentioned there's funny guards' conversation about 'is it real or not' and 'can any ship with black sails be the Pearl'. The Pearl is elusive, 'nigh uncatchable'. It hardly brought Jack anything but trouble, not to mention the price he had to pay for getting it. Yet he settles for no other ship.) I could mention more of such interesting ideas (for eyes to see that can), but don't want to spoil too much. Still people choose not to think. Indeed, why to make your brain work when you can easily criticize, that Will is a smith's apprentice instead. (Actually to anyone familiar with mythology it does make sense that a young hero is a smith's apprentice. And yes, I know why people are against something that actually does make sense. But that's off-topic here.) Bottomline: I loved pretty much everything about this movie and its sequels. 10/10 from the heart.
10.0~Ghosts and pirates.. whats not to like niteboon-2 Sign in Permalink Did someone actually get something right out there? Swashbuckling at its best. Excellent cast. Depp was as usual extraordinary in the role and it as a whole hit everything the current movie genres are missing. Good Story, good costumes, Great fun, even Keira Knightly couldn't spoil it if you ignored her acting and let her just look pretty. Please lets not ruin this great story with a sequel of epic nastiness that taints the good name. (you know what I'm talking about you star wars trilogy directors) Big thumbs up. I have been waiting for a film like this for a long time.
1.0~This film made me sob my heart out jeremycorbyn Sign in Permalink The fact this film showed British soldiers at the peak of the British Empire's savagery terrifies me and makes me deeply concerned for everyone that watches it. I thought British Imperialism was a dreadful thing and dead so why do we need to remember it in films? This film makes me deeply regretful and saddened by my ancestor's mistakes and makes me ashamed of my country, it made me so sad I cry like a little girl every time I see it and it makes me wet myself. The thought of a young lad going to see this film and thinking the British soldiers are in the right and honourable men petrifies me. The acting in this film was terrible and Barbossa's death was just stupid, made no sense at all. This film should be banned in order to stop people from potentially liking the long dead British Empire and the brutal white soldiers that made and maintained it. British Imperialism petrifies me more than Nazism. The Pirates in the film also gave me nightmares and all the Pirates characters including Will Turner were simply too savage to enjoy.
10.0~#1 movie of all times mathieuchampagne1990 Sign in Permalink This movie is the best. If you like boring pointless movies this is not the movie for you. Curse of the black pearl is an awesome film full of humor, the acting is incredibly well done and the cgi for the moonlight effect is just spectacular. Johnny Depp really gets into the character of Jack Sparrow, to his rocking boat walk to his slurring speech, I can't imagine Jack Sparrow any other way. The story is also very well done, pirates cursed for an eternity unless they return all the coins and blood of those who stole from the treasures of Cortez, and ironically Jack was saved from this cruel unrelenting fate by being betrayed and abandoned, and by killing bootstrap bill turner they got rid of the coin and blood they so desperately needed. Overall this movie is by far the best movie in modern times, filled with action, comedy, suspense and enough twists to keep you entertained but not enough to confuse you out of your mind, want to see a good movie, this is it.
10.0~Better the second time around. sourapple Sign in Permalink When I first saw this, it was boring and long. But Johnny Depp rules. The second time I watched Pirates of the Caribbean, it was better. And Johnny Depp rocks. The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story. All in all, wonderful effects, brilliant dialogue... good movie. It is Disney. What a change.
10.0~The film was an amazing display of creativity. bryn-turner1 Sign in Permalink The film was a credit to the actors and directors who made the film. the music was an awesome display of creativity and the person who wrote it deserves great praise and acknowledgement. i think the plot was an awesome display of creativity and understanding of how views will react to certain situations, also the film feels real to all thoughts watching it. also the music adds a great amount of feeling and depth to the movie as well as giving the viewers hearing a rollacoster ride, and making the viewer wishing they were at a live cosert listening to the music performed live, the people who performed this amazing peace of music also deserve as much credit as the actors who were in the film.
9.0~A Fun Flick that will make you sit at the edge of your seat OriginalMovieBuff21 Sign in Permalink I was extremely anxious to go see Pirates of the Caribbean last year in the summer when it came out. I saw it two days after it came out and I really liked it. In a way, I think it could be seen for all ages. Heck, it was a very fun film with lots of funny lines by my favorite character in the film, Jack Sparrow. The action was neatly done and for a PG-13 film. The shooting on the ships were so cool like Master and Commander's. Johnny Depp could've been an oscar worthy actor in it. Keira Knightley was great to and she is really hot, indeed. Lucky Will gets her. Ha funny stuff. Overall, this was a great film with impressive action and a perfect comedy mixed very well into it. 8.5/10
9.0~Lousy poster, great movie bewestbrook Sign in Permalink The poster doesn't do justice to this movie. It has single-handedly brought the genre back from the dead. Yes, the plot requires actual concentration on the details, but that's part of the fun. The pacing is fast when it needs to be; the camera can linger, too. Depp is a wonderful pirate: cocky, self-assured, disarming, dangerous, single-minded. He flouts the rules and rulers with the aplomb one expects of an outlaw. He brings a particular zest to the role that he skews in interesting directions. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann (see Maureen O'Hara in The Black Swan) is one of the few fully-realized female characters in a genre film. Her bravery and longing for adventure are clearly shown as traits held even as a child. So it's no surprise to see her reject the proper suitor and insist on meeting the pirates personally. Orlando Bloom is pretty, but pale except in one smashing fight scene. Fun, fun movie with great outtakes on the DVD. Go see it; then rent Captain Blood, Against All Flags and the Black Swan.
6.0~A fun movie with a great performance by Depp MovieAddict2016 Sign in Permalink (Note: this review is from 2003.) In its fullest, "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Curl" succeeds as entertainment. It is one of the great adventure films of this year, jam-packed with chills and thrills. It's a rousing swashbuckler with a great cast and a great story. But, ranking in at 143 minutes, it goes overboard on scenes a few times. Just a few. When "Pirates of the Caribbean" first opened, my Website was bombarded with desperate letters from frenzied fans of the film, all asking me to post a script for the film. It is perhaps the most requested script I've ever had people write to me about. It's amazing what an impact a film such as this can have. It stars Johnny Depp in the lead role as the infamous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, the worst pirate the film's Good Bad Guy has ever heard of. "Ah, but you have heard of me," Jack says. Jack used to be the captain of a deadly ship named the Black Pearl, before a mutiny took place at the command of Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), who left Jack for dead on an island where he drank rum for three days and got a permanent case of sea daze. But Jack survived, and now with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he will track down Barbosa and claim his ship back. Will is not in it for the ship, however, but rather for the young girl, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa in hopes of removing a curse put upon him and his crew after they removed gold coins from a cursed treasure chest. By the moon of the light, Barbosa and his idiot crew turn into skeletons. They cannot die, they cannot feel pleasure. They are "cursed pirates." First, they must restore all of the golden coins to the treasure chest, then pour the blood of a Turner over the stash of treasure. Captain Barbosa thinks that Elizabeth is the late Bootstrap Bill Turner's daughter, but he never had one -- his single child was a boy, and the boy is Will, who is coming to save Elizabeth from a doom that he himself should be facing more than anyone. Confused? Don't be. When you watch the movie it will all make sense, because it just does. The main element that carries along "Pirates of the Caribbean" well past its expiration date is the casting of Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow. In a constant drunken stupor and with a splendidly funny rough British accent, Depp has finally hit payday in a mainstream motion picture. He's been cast in cult favorites over the years, specifically those directed by Tim Burton ("Edward Scissorhands," "Ed Wood"), but he's been around since "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Platoon." He hasn't exactly gotten major recognition over the years, and though movie buffs know him by name, mainstream filmgoers probably wouldn't recognize him at first. Not now, however. Now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon. Depp, at forty, has finally gotten a mainstream break. Also helping the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa. He's a dastardly villain with bad teeth and, we can only assume, bad breath. He's good at being a bad guy, but because the film is rated PG-13, a big step forward for Disney, he isn't allowed to be quite as vicious as he probably would be. And, I can only assume, the rating prohibits him from taking advantage of poor Elizabeth while she is held captive aboard his ship.... The movie's score is by Klaus Badelt, who has been getting his big break lately with films such as "The Recruit." It's a good score that fits the film's tone of pirates. Pirates are everywhere in this film, and at one point a character remarks that it's good to be a pirate, or something like that. I just wonder: If that's true, why does Disney prohibit pirating of its films? Har, har. "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is one of the better entertainments of the year, helped primarily because of a great cast and witty script. But the character that will stay in your head long after this is over, more than any other character in the film (including Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's father, who I have not mentioned before now and I think I should have), is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's going to go down in the books as one of those famous film heroes. And what saves him from becoming another gung-ho hero is what helped Harrison Ford make Indiana Jones so likable: He's an apprehensive and cautious hero with wit and loads of dry humor and funny one-liners to spare. He's not the type of hero who is necessarily always looking out for the best because he wants to save the world, but rather because he knows it's sort of his duty to do so. And he does so with apprehension. It's a key to making a great screen hero, and Johnny Depp succeeds where I can only assume most modern action heroes would fail. Let's just hope the rumored, upcoming back-to-back sequels don't sink to Davy Jones' Locker, eh?
9.0~A great adventure at sea! MihaiSorinToma Sign in Permalink After losing his beloved to a group of fierce pirates, Will the blacksmith teams up with a notorious pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, for an attempt of rescuing her. Unknown facts will come to life and soon both will find out that there's more to each other than they would have imagined. It's an adventure full of action, suspense but also laughter, which introduces the now famous Jack Sparrow and his pirate deeds, especially regarding the young blacksmith. Their journey will prove to be full of unpredictable, for better or worse, but it will always be accompanied by tons of jokes, puns and funny moments. It features a couple of great and well described characters which do a really good job in maintaining a very enjoyable tale set at sea. Together with a good plot, they end up making a pretty impressive movie. Add into the equation a couple of great actors and some great special effects and you end up with this great achievement. What I enjoyed mostly about this film, besides its catchy atmosphere, is its comical side. It manages to be very good, in moments when you least expect it, without seeming to forced or desperate about it. It kept me interested till the end, especially due to its lack of predictability, thus it managed to be a very good movie. I have to note that I wasn't impressed by the plot. Although good, it wasn't something that will blow your mind or something. A little bit of polish could have made this one a true masterpiece.
7.0~Pirates FTW! KineticSeoul Sign in Permalink For a movie based on a attraction ride, this is pretty good. But I still found it a bit overrated because of the big praise it got when it first came out. This movie is something kids and adults can enjoy, but it doesn't excel to something more than that. The trailer for this movie was more better than the movie itself, but for going in a direction where it's watchable for the whole family. It's done pretty well for the most part, although it comes off a bit silly at times because of it and not really in a positive way either. I personally didn't really like the humor in this although some of the audience might like it. Johnny Depp has created a iconic character because of this movie, and he liked this character a lot himself. Jack Sparrow is a fun and interesting character to watch on screen and is the character that stood out the most. The other cast members did really well with their roles especially Geoffrey Rush who plays Captain Barbossa. The movie was fun a ride, however it got pretty old after it got shown in school way too many times. Overall it's a good movie that the whole family can enjoy, but it's still a bit of a overrated movie. 7.8/10
10.0~It was the best movie I had ever seen parand-71339 Sign in Permalink No amount of words will be enough to describe how fantastic this masterpiece from Disney was. Johnny Depp became my favorite actor 5 seconds after watching this movie. Though I do despise of Will Turner and his stupid girlfriend, those to were always an obstacle for Jack. I love the bond between Jack and Barbosa, their frienemies. I say I despise Will and Elizabeth because #1: Will betrayed Jack and reported to Cutler Beckette using dead bodies (cruel!). #2: Elizabeth chained Jack while faking a romantic moment and forced Jack to call her a pirate, a title way too cool to be wasted on a pathetic girl such as Elizabeth. There are so many more reasons but those are my main two and if anyone has a different opinion I totally respect that. I actually admire Will for going through so much to save Elizabeth.
10.0~Fantastic Film You Cant Miss It ! ! ! kayleysuperbabe Sign in Permalink This film is absolutely mind-blowing!I watched it the first time and was very impressed with Johnny Depps performance as Captain Jack Sparrow.He really put his effort into this film and suited the part very well.I was also impressed with Keira Knightleys performance as Elizebeth Swann she too suited the part very well.I am very glad that Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is coming out next year!!!!I think that the beginning was fantastic and introduced the characters well.The storyline as a whole was very impressive.This film is fun of laughter,romance,action and a lot of drama!This is a film you have got to watch!!!
6.0~Too Much Comedy mickyw33 Sign in Permalink Disney gets a little too goofy for my tastes. Depp's lines weren't really all that funny and niether was a lot of the other unnessecary comic relief... that is unless you were 12 year old or younger. Which is really what this movie is meant for anyway, the kids of summer looking for a good swash buckling Disney flick so they can play pretend pirates in the back yard with their friends. Nice special effects, decent plot, bad characters and couple of decent fight scenes make for a 6 outta 10 in my book.
9.0~Better than expected BriannaBee Sign in Permalink I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie because, quite honestly, I really did not expect to enjoy it at all. Although not a classic piece of filmmaking, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining.
8.0~Best Out Of All The Pirates Movies!!! KalKenobi83 Sign in Permalink Watched Pirates Of The Caribbean With Johnny Depp(Edward Scissorhands) as Captain Jack Sparrow. Also Starring The Lovely Keira Knightley(Bend Like Beckham) as Elizabeth Swann, Orlando Bloom(Lord Of The Rings ) as Will Turner, Jack Davenport(The Talented Mr. Ripley) as Commodore Norrington,Zoe Saldana(Crossroads) as Anamaria,Jonathan Pyrce(Brazil) as Governor Weatherby Swann also Starring Geoffrey Rush(Les Miserable) as Captain Hector Barbosa The Films Main Villain ,The Film was Dramatic,Thrilling and Fun An Amazing performance from Johnny Depp as the Witty Jack Sparrow also the film was the best pirate film to date as it was mysterious and had an awesome seven seas vibe.

1.0~Good...and bad..... sethn172 Sign in Permalink Well, I have to say, this movie was such an exciting experience!!!!! I rented this one stormy night on DVD and boy, this movie was so exciting!!!!! This movie, of course, is based on the theme park ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I liked all the action and stuff in there; it was awesome!!!!! I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers ("Is that a plane?????" - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from "Walt Disney Presents," which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998. Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!) This is a "BAD PERIOD" movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A "Disney" movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!! So basically, Disney now robs of its usual audience in the "Bad Period." "PIRATE DVDS OF THE EAST: THE CURSE OF THE MPAA'S FOCUS" is a film that, while it appeals to us adults, JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO CHILDREN!!!!! Bad idea! -1000000/10 for making a grown company cry!!!!!
5.0~Good film but overrated, enjoyable & fun but not a classic med_1978 Sign in Permalink I have just finished watching this film. I must say it was better than I had expected from the trailers. However this is not a classic film. This is an enjoyable action adventure with some comedy thrown in (and some skeletons too). I must say just because a film is mildly enjoyable does not mean it is worth in excess of 6/10. I did not find this film to be anywhere near as good as "The Mask of Zorro" and Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow was a bit over the top & eccentric(which was obviously the intention). I found this film to be of a similar level if a little better than "A Knights Tale". It seemed to me though that having been made by Disney it was aimed at 10-16 year old viewers and although entertaining did not appeal to me as a film I would watch many times over.
8.0~terrific movie made more terrific by Depp cherold Sign in Permalink When a movie has an actor whose performance really stands out, especially in some mindless action pic, it's tempting to just give him all the credit for the movie, but I was surprised to find that there is a lot more to recommend the movie than just Depp's fascinating performance. The movie as a whole is quite amusing, the action is well handled, especially the highly entertaining sword duel between Depp and Bloom and it's really pretty imaginative for something that was created just to capitalize on the success of an amusement park ride. A movie like this is clearly designed to have a great, flashy performance. Depp was hired for that role and did it beautifully, but if not Depp, the producers would have undoubtedly gone for another actor who could give an over-the-top comic performance. You could actually have a pretty good movie if you replaced Depp with someone more generic, but the movie couldn't really work without a big performance here. The producers were very fortunate to get Depp, who is a wonderful and inventive actor. His gives Jack Sparrow a loose-limbed charm that makes you suspect he's always slightly drunk, but while a quirky pirate he still gives you that Errol-Flynn sort of swashbuckle. I wouldn't want to in any way diminish his credit, but I just wanted to point out that the movie is consistently well-acted and stylish in its own right.
10.0~Go see this, Savvy? krysta18 Sign in Permalink I see a lot of movies, and this one is the best one that has graced the silver screen for a long, long time. This is the perfect movie to go see again and again - whether you're alone, with your parents, babysitting a child, with a group of friends, or your boyfriend; There is something for everyone. The cast is incredible, but hats off definitely to Johnny Depp. I've never been one for the actors themselves; I think a movie is good based on the basic plot, storyline, and if the actors and actresses can pull off a half-decent job of making it believable. But Johnny Depp was absolutely incredible in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow! I am very, very impressed. In truth, until reading all the other comments posted about this movie, I never even realized it was a "long" movie; the time seems to fly by when watching it! The plot is great. Some people may feel it's a "same old" type of story, but there is just something about the film which gives it an edge-of-your-seat excitement and anticipation. Yes, the "good guy" wins, and Orlando Bloom does get the girl, but the outcome is not quite so black-and-white as all that. In fact, certain places throughout the story raise an arched eyebrow in the more detailed observer. For example, has anyone stayed through the credits to see the very very last scene at the very end of the credits? Be forewarned: you will have to dodge brooms and ignore the exasperated sighs of cleaning people as they manouever around you, and yes, the lights will be on, but stay until the last credit rolls. You will see what I mean about leaving it open for something else. I have been on the Disneyland ride, and found it a favorite. I was thus overjoyed to see scenes from the ride in the movie. My personal favorite was the scene in the prison, when the men are trying to get the "mangy mut" to help them escape. I loved thsi attention to detail that reminded people that yes, this is a Disney movie, in case some had forgotten amidst the skeletal ghosts and slashing swords and the figure that results from the beautiful heroine wearing her dreaded corset. There were no holes in this plot that I found. To the individual who didn't think it was mentioned why the blood of Orlando Bloom's character was neeeded, Geoffrey Rush's character explains that each of the gold coins had to be brought back together in order for the curse to be broken. In addition, each of the pirates had paid for their "sins" of taking the cursed treasure with their blood through time. The only pirate who had taken a gold piece, not returned it, and did not give any of his blood to "the cause" was the unseen character of Orlando Bloom's father. Just to clear up any misconceptions. This is an excellent movie, whether you want to see a romance, a happy ending, a plot with a few twists thrown in, an adventure, a fantasy, or anything inbetween. This movie cannot come highly enough recommended. Definitely getting 10 out of 10 rating from me, and that's only because there isn't a higher rating available.
9.0~Captain Jack sparrow's first adventure in search of his beloved pearl and kill his mutinous first mate Barbossa. DeppGirl30 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl released in 2003 is still in the list of the best. The cast includes Johnny Depp,Keira Knightley, Orlando bloom ,Geoffery Rush. The first half of the movies mainly features on Captain Jack, will and Elizabeth. The relationship between Will and Elizabeth comforts the factor of romance in the movie. Captain Sparrow and Will turner together procures a crew with different intentions .Jack wants to get back the black pearl which he was once the captain of. But Barbossa his first mate send him for mutiny. Later the trio fights barbossa and kills him. A curse prevails over the crew of the black pearl including Barbossa. The characters are filled with fun and enthusiasm. Mention not the intelligence of Mr Sparrow. He is intelligent and equally no word is found to describe him. Johnny depp at his best. He is twice marooned on an island where he spends time drinking rum. It is shown that he has an interest in Elizabeth. But her heart is throughout Will's. The second half of the movie breathtaking and nail biting. The last fight between Jack and Barbossa is the best fight scene in the movie. The music is another big factor in the movie. Hans Zimmer is at his best. Jack's theme and Yo Ho A Pirate's Life for me was sung everywhere is still sung. The Visual effects of the movie is equally beautiful as the score. The catchy dialogs at the right moment are remembered. ~This is my first review. Please forgive if there are any mistakes. I'll Try to do my best in the next.
9.0~beautifully done MattyAndAnnika Sign in Permalink In beginning my review on Pirates of the Caribbean I sat back to watch all of the films back to back in order. I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley, and of course I really like the Pirates films. Now in the beginning cinematically it seemed a bit as if the scene was on a stage in a green screen and it showed pretty badly, yet this is one of the very few graphical/cgi issues that really stuck out to me. Acting within The Curse of the Black Pearl for the most part was great, and of course the cast seemed to grow into their characters more and more as this film started to take shape. I do love how the story starts and unfolds as I do believe at this point this is one of my favorites within the film collection, of course until I get to check out the newest in development film. The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderful movie, it's great for family, it's filled with action, comedy, and a beautiful tale to follow. I love how the characters stories individually began to unfold nicely timed throughout the film revealing the love term development of the Pirates films. The Curse exposed was my favorite part of the movie the graphics were awesome.
5.0~Overwrought, turgid, grotesque roycaldwell Sign in Permalink Overwrought, grotesque, turgid. At the end they are fighting and fighting, Barberousse (who does not have a red beard) and Sparrow, and we ask why because neither can die. On and on and on and on they go, while elsewhere all kinds of mayhem occurs. This film has a mixed tone - unlike Sinbad: it tries to be a swashbuckler, but must fall into line on the current craze for realistic effects and graphic violence. We watch brutal, winner-take-all-and-death-to-the-loser battles, as the heroes quip and prance, and just out of frame the ghouls plunge swords into the chests of soldiers we have just seen fall. In Sinbad, no one seems to die - and that is fine by me. Johnny Depp swishes drunkenly through his role; Orlando Bloom is appropriately dewy and earnest; the girl is luminous, fiery, resourceful - like every heroine in action films these days. This film fell seriously in love with its main effect: the pirates turn into ghouls under the moonlight. You want to see a great swashbuckler, invite your niece or nephew or the kid next door, and check out Sinbad.
1.0~Contrived . . . and not very well jobeblanc Sign in Permalink Is this a story that inspires, captivates and entrances? That's what it's creators think it is. And far too many gullible viewers think that this is art. But what is great about it? A little bit of swashbuckling action to begin with, and nothing new. Then the whole pursuit, cove, cave thing. Not only was the storyline descending into the abyss but so was the film. Really, what was all that cave foolishness worth? Not my time. With the talent and the budget sunk into this project, 3/4 of the directors alive today with a good writer in tow could have made this into a movie!
8.0~Great Movie only for the older individual!!! KatiesKreations Sign in Permalink It was a great movie as far as the action, but it did have some stuff that we could have done without. The dress code I would say would have to be one of them. I prefer women with more clothes on, a modest dress code would have made this movie a better one. It was fun seeing the funny oddball actor Johnny Depp. This was the first movie I had ever seen him in, and the first time I had ever heard of him. He was a really fun character in this one. I loved his accent!! My favorite line... "I can't breathe!" (splash!!) -Elizabeth Swan "you know he's only a blacksmith...No, he's a Pirate" Great for the older individual! wouldn't recommend the younger (age 14 and under).
3.0~Whoa is me. sumytra-2 Sign in Permalink Whoa is me. Johnny Depp didn't take this film very seriously. I know it's not a serious film but actor decisions are and either he or the director made some very bad choices for the Captain Sparrow character. He was so swishy. Who is the hero in this film? No one. I didn't care about any of these people. In addition, this is a two joke movie: 1) Look mom. The pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight at least 1567 times. Isn't that fun? 2) Look mom. An eyeball has a fork in it and it rolls along the ground and it falls out of that guys face and...Isn't that fun? Nope. It isn't fun or funny or interesting after the first time. And although the combat scenes are well choreographed - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!! I fell asleep twice. I was sooooo disappointed. I really wanted to like this film.
9.0~"That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen." classicsoncall Sign in Permalink If you're ever in the mood for just a flat out entertaining flick, you can't go wrong with 'Curse of the Black Pearl". I wasn't writing these reviews when this movie first came out, didn't even know there was such a thing as IMDb. So I'm finally getting back to it this many years later and even though I'd forgotten a lot about the story, I was blown away all over again by the outrageous antics of Captain Jack Sparrow and those transition scenes where the skeleton pirates manifest in the moonlight. In fact, the story itself might be incidental to the special effects and physical stunts that highlight the action in the film. Johnny Depp of course makes the movie with his swish-buckling (yeah, I misspelled it on purpose) approach to the character, and you couldn't ask for a more fetching lady in distress than Keira Knightley, although she managed to hold her own against most of those menacing pirates quite nicely. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush round out the rest of the principal cast, and each did a superb job. I've never gotten beyond this movie's sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest', but watching this one again inspires me to go forward and check out all the rest.
10.0~One of the gr8test films depp has ever done! zoeg21 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp the tremendous actor stars in yet another strange, yet wondeful film where his charactor is always wacky! He is the most exellent actor i have ever had the privilidge to watch and admire. Johnny takes on the role of captain jack sparrow magnifisenly, he makes the charactor totaly unique and simply marvolous. Plus which makes things even better is that he looks really sexy too! hehe. next to the almost normal charactors William Turner and Elizabeth Swan, Johnny looks out of place, yet BEAUTIFUL!! This is one of my favourite roles that Johnny depp has played aswell as he in sleepy hollow, edward scissor hands, chocolat, once apon a time in mexico, blow, from hell and many many more including his most recent film secret window (which was a success!) This film is a marvel because of the true actor that is johnny depp
10.0~Captain Jack Sparrow Steals It fcukluva Sign in Permalink As I had not really seen many films with Johnny Depp in before; I didn't quite know what to expect. But as I have a particular love of pirates i decided to give this one a go. I was not disappointed. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is definitely the star. He portrays a pirate superbly and makes the film what it is. Keira and Orlando are also excellent. The story is adventurous and gripping. With Jack and Orlando making a great pair and the storyline getting better and better. Will not say more as I don't want to ruin the plot line but see this film!!! It's great!
8.0~Great Chemistry Between the Leads! ShelbyTMItchell Sign in Permalink Really a great film and great chemistry between the leads as we see that it is really Johnny Depp known for choosing character roles and story lines rather than blockbusters as this movie made him his popularity soar as wisecracking Captain Jack Sparrow. The movie has wit and charm. Along with great acting and great writing. As there would be three more sequels to the movie franchise. With Depp in the lead role. Orlando Bloom as the simple yet sword trained lovestruck young man, who helps Captain Jack as his soon to be love, Elizabeth Swann played by a then 18-year old Keira Knightly is kidnapped by the antagonist of the film, Captain Barbosa played by Geoffrey Rush who would later be a good guy in latter films. As Jack wants revenge against Barbosa after he stole Jack's ship among other things and much more. A mighty fun time for this Disney feature and Johnny Depp and company making it more amusing!
10.0~My favorite movie of all time WITHOUT A DOUBT calico000007 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. There is so much action and adventure, goodness I just love it all. Johnny Depp does a great job playing Captain Jack. Captain Jack is so comedic yet so tough and "piraty." Orlando Bloom is so great in this movie. Not to mention that he looks great in a pirate costume, but he is perfect for the part he plays. He plays a sensitive yet brave young man who tries to save his love. Kiera Knightly also does a wonderful job playing the beautiful but slightly tom boyish girl who falls in love with pretty boy Will. This movie has it all; romance, action (sword fights man!), mysterious music, and awesome special effects and costuming. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age, it's one of those movies you just can't miss. 10+++++!
9.0~Reminds us that Hollywood was once wonderful... breadman8 Sign in Permalink ..and uplifting. There was a time when this is why people went to the movies. No pretentious advocacy. Just high caliber entertainment. (Good music too) What? Johnny Depp can even take his young kids to see it. Pirate Jack Sparrow is an all-time characterization. Geoffrey Rush boosts the wonder of storybook pirates to a level not seen since the original "Treasure Island". The Brit officers are great foils for Depp and the pirate crew is all that one could hope for. Great lines sprinkled throughout. Rush's response to the Lady's demand on pirate ethics is classic. "..it was more of a guideline than a rule". The old adage -always leave them laughing- was transgressed for me as the film went a tad long. This movie will be watched 20 years from now...long after "American Beauty" or "Syriana" are utterly forgotten.
8.0~The best movie I've ever seen 9thgraders Sign in Permalink It's an action, adventure and science fiction movie. It was directed in 2003 by Gore Verbinski. In this film there are famous people like Johnny Depp (who plays the captain Jack Sparrow) and Lucinda Dryzek (who plays Elizabeth Swan). It was written by Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, Ted Elliot and Jay Wolpert. This movie is about a woman named Elizabeth Swann who has lost her father. She falls in love with a man named Will Turner. They meet the Captain Jack Sparrow who wants to take his boat back: The Black Pearl, off the hands of the pirate Barbossa but there is a curse in the boat... In this film, there is the famous song and I really like it. The specials effects are so magnificent and the cast's acting is so real, the actors are very good. To me, it's a very good movie and I love the movies with action and adventure with pirates. It's the best movie I've ever seen.
10.0~Jack Sparrow, chameleon extrordinaire. dandelion-1 Sign in Permalink I enjoyed the film in the theatre and the DVD adds yet another layer to that enjoyment. The background information reveals that the producer, director, writers, and actors were relatively relaxed, but thoroughly dedicated to creating a very entertaining story. They were doubtless intimidated by the recent theatrical failures of the pirate genre, and that only spurred their dedication. To our benefit. But the leading man and the writers were not completely trusted. The deleted scenes are quite telling. A number of them illustrate Sparrow's more sober and somber and ruthless characteristics and reveal him to be an even more ambivalent character...perhaps more than the makers of the film could credit the audience with accepting....but what a fascinating character he is. Hopefully, the sequels will allow Depp to fully inhabit this chameleon. I look forward to the possibilities.
8.0~swashbuckling excellent pirate movie parsleylion Sign in Permalink a witty script sees Depp steal the show as Captain Jack Sparrow in a role whose origins might have an interesting story to be told. The film is cliche stuff with the men witty, backstabbing, dishonourable rogues and the women suiting themselves, slapping men about, changing their minds without rhyme or reason and everyone living happily ever after. Pure fantasy, see it but don't believe it.
10.0~brilliant wattiex3 Sign in Permalink Johny deep is a work of art he's like the Mona Lisa of acting. Orlando bloom,Geoffry Rush and Kiera Knightly are very good supporting actors.but jack sparrow is the sturdiest yet smartest person I have ever seen It' is an extremely funny movie and deserves to be in the top one hundred.I do not think any body else could have played the part.my hat of to you Johny deep.the rest of the crew as I said were very smart.But th greatest part of the movie was he jack sailed in to the docks right back at the start.Orlando Bloom has a very good role but I do not think he is up to taking the lead role in a movie.Geoffry Rush is a great evil man and would have been just as good as Johny and Kiera knightly is developing into a good actress well done to pirates of the Carribian
10.0~Fantastic Film, A Must See ccmcdow Sign in Permalink Films often draw inspiration from literature, historical events and pre existing works, and screenwriters and directors adapt books the theatre and older movies into modern films. Movies have followed this pattern for a long time and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. This being said, however, creativity and demand for original content often causes deviations in patterns, and inspiration will often be drawn from unlikely sources, once classic resources have become dry. Disney has always been creative in developing imaginary worlds and fictional story lines, in many cases adapting them into rides at their massive theme parks. Creating outstanding story lines requires innovative thinking, and in the case of pirates of the Caribbean, Disney did just that. They reversed their typical cycle of adapting rides after movies and instead drew inspiration for a movie from a ride, thus creating Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The theme park ride had been around for some time, and predated the movie by almost 36 years. The content that the ride offered could be easily adapted into a film given that it depicted a historical time period rather than a modern event. Disney easily and adeptly transformed the idea of swashbuckling pirates from a ride into a movie. Simply put, Captain Jack Sparrow takes the movie and straps a jet pack to it, launching it into the ozone. Captain Jack Sparrow's character brings the storyline alive and makes for a truly engaging film. In my opinion, Johnny Depp's portrayal of Sparrow is one of the best performances in any movie and is one of my personal favorites. His eccentricity and peculiar mannerisms as Sparrow make the character incredibly interesting and dynamic. Despite seeming drunk at many times Jack is, in reality, very intelligent. Jack uses his wit to be very humorous and often borders inappropriateness. The fact that Disney produced this film is about as shocking to me as it is to hear that the writers originally thought Depp's performance was terrible when it ended up making the movie. Robert Ebert, a renowned film critic had this to say about Depp's performance, "It can be said that his performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie" (Ebert 1). Ebert follows this statement with assurance that he is not criticizing Depp's performance but rather praising it for its originality and ingenuity. The film is actually graphic in many scenes and has very subtle yet noticeable sexual connotations and adult humor in many instances. This being said it is still able to appeal to younger audiences but might come off as scary to some younger kids. On top of Depp's outstanding the performance the film does a tremendous job balancing out how much of Jack the viewer gets by including Turner, a much more level headed and traditional character. It is also interesting how the characters all seem to be chasing something. Jack is chasing the Pearl and Barbossa. Barbossa in turn, is chasing Turner, while Turner is chasing Swann. This creates an interesting dynamic and constantly keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. The brilliant settings also help make the film great. Despite being only set in the Caribbean, each location is very unique and often exaggerated. For example the island Jack is marooned on is absolutely gorgeous with perfect blue water and white sand while the Barbossa's hideout is jet is black and grim. Another fantastic location comes with the film's depiction of Tortuga. It is shown as a drunken mosh pit of gluttony where barbaric pirates drink themselves to death and fight one another yet this is all shown in a very comedic way. The Internet Movie Database rates the movie an 8.1 out of 10 which compared to many other great films is actually very high considering the highest rating given to any movie is a 9.2. Depp's acting, the other supporting characters' essential roles and the brilliant plot as well as locales make the movie a fantastic film that will set the standard for pirate films for a very long time.
8.0~Highly entertaining blockbuster. theshadow908 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean tells the story of a group of cursed pirates who kidnap the governor's daughter and take her aboard a ship called The Black Pearl. The woman's young suitor, Will Turner, teams up with the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow, the rightful owner of the Black Pearl so they can both retrieve what is rightfully theirs. A journey filled with action and adventure unfolds, and along with it, one of the most entertaining films of 2003. What fascinates me the most about this movie is how great it is, and how much of a success it is, and it's based off a ride at Disneyworld! The first movie based off a Disney ride, The Tower of Terror, was a TV movie with Steve Guttenberg. The three that followed, Mission to Mars, The Country Bears, and The Haunted Mansion, were all flops. When I heard about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I wasn't very excited. After seeing it however, I was blown away. The movie is a visual stunner. The special effects are awesome, and the set pieces are some of the most amazing things I've seen on film. The dialogue is witty, with a few jokes meant to go over the little ones' heads. Not only that, but they actually managed to get a great story out of it. The acting is amazing. I was never a fan of Orlando Bloom, but he does well in this movie. I really enjoyed Geoffry Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa. As always, Johnny Depp proves with a knockout performance that he can play any role he wants, however he wants, and it will be great. Overall, this is an amazingly entertaining film, perfect for all ages. I recommend it to everybody. 8.5/10
8.0~Finally, some entertainment AurumStarFinder Sign in Permalink This film has several good reasons to go and see it: 1) It's funny, exciting well worth seeing. 2) Its got Johnny Depp. Reason enough. You'll like Jack Sparrow far more than Will Turner, I can guarantee that. 3) Geoffrey Rush. Again, enough reason to see it. I wouldn't call him frightening, just scarily cool, dark and ugly. Very different role to the voice over of Nigel the Pelican. If you like him 4) Orlando Bloom... not good reason. He's pretty. Can't say much else about him though. He was better in Lord of the Rings. He's better being silent, elf-like and graceful. 5) Keira Knightley... *shudders*... is better off playing people like Jules in Bend It Like Beckham: half friendly and half bitchy. Bizarre face: she's got a dazzling smile but a really pinched disgusted look the rest of the time. Not the best choice foe Elizabeth Swann. 6) Johnny Depp again. 7) It's fun. Really. And its got really impressive effects. It might not be the best pirate film to come out for a while, but it enjoyable all the same.
8.0~Yo ho, yo ho, this movie is for me! moviemanMA Sign in Permalink I can remember going to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida as a little kid and there were certain attractions that stood out in my mind. One of the best was Pirates of the Caribbean located in Adventure Land. This swashbuckling adventure into the heart of a pirate raid and imagination. The ride depicts pirates pillaging, drinking, eating, and having what seems to be a successful raid. In Gore Verbinski's epic tale of a cursed ship and its crew trying to find their lost treasure, johnny Depp stars as the worst pirate ever, Captain Jack Sparrow. He encounters Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) after escaping from an island prison and his love interest Elizabeth Swann (Neira Knightley). The three find themselves in quite the mess. When the Black Pearl sails into port, all hell breaks loose. Led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), these pirates will do whatever it takes to find their treasure. After taking Elizabeth away because she has the missing piece, Will and Jack must find a crew brave enough, or dumb enough to chase the Pearl. The story featuring scenes from the ride in Walt Disney World and Walt Disney Land in California, causing this film will trigger a lot of memories for fans of the ride. The film also tells a great story with action, romance, and comedy. Depp is brilliant as mumbling, sometimes heroic Jack Sparrow, getting himself nominated for an Academy Award. Another interesting aspect of the movie that is well done is the computer generated effects like when the pirates are seen in their "true form". This gives the movie an eye candy effect, bringing in more viewers. Overall, this film is spectacular. Appealing on all levels of cinema entertainment. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a movie not to be missed. In the words of Jack Sparrow, "Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate,". This one is no exception.
10.0~A new classic, just good summer fun. The best film of 2003 Karpy9 Sign in Permalink I didn't think I would like POTC when I went to see it but I couldn't have been more wrong! The movie was pure entertainment from start to finish filled with humor, action, and adventure. Once again Johnny Depp does what he does so well by getting lost in the character of the infamous Jack Sparrow. Depp is sensational, this is why he's the best actor out there right now. Newcomer Kiera Knightley was a pretty face and very good in POTC and Orlando Bloom fit the bill proving his talent past Legolas of LOTR. And of course, Geoffey Rush was just so fun to hate as the grimy and nasty Barbossa, a superb villain, the summer's best villain. Gore Verbinski is on his way with The Ring and POTC, even though he sadly looks not to come back for the 2005 sequel to POTC. This movie is great, forget Cold Mountain and everything else, this film is the best of 2003. The only film I could do this to this to this year. A perfect 10/10.
7.0~Ok but needed subtitles. Gubby-Allen Sign in Permalink Certainly the chunks of the film that were not in English could have done with subtitles. Orlando Bloom was the only one who seemed to speak clearly all the way through. A slightly below average film. A ok plot but with an ending you could clock from a mile away. The fighting scenes (which 99% of the time never interest me in any film) seemed particularly pointless here given that the enemy couldn't be killed. As said several times the two pairs -the 2 pirates & 2 guards (English too- there was a surprise) were pathetic characters. That was the biggest problem with the film it tried to be funny & failed and couldn't seem to make out whether it wanted to target itself at kids, adults or everyone. Consequently, with such a laid back plot, it became difficult to keep concentration with the plot, who was cursed, why, how etc etc. Still, it was an ok story, had some good scenes, kept me reasonably interested and was acted well. 5/10
10.0~This film is the best pirate film ever, at the moment anyway. OrlandoBloomrulz Sign in Permalink This film has to be one of the best Pirate films of al time, it has comedy, good action, brilliant stars, and sexy actresses (keira knightley) i love this film because it is such a side breaker, it had me in stitches so many times, an all time classic, i don't really want to see the sequel though because i am afraid that it will be rubbish and will spoil the first one, i am going to see it anyway just to see how it goes but i have confidence that Johnny and Orlando will bring yet another great swashbuckling movie to our screens. I regard Johnny as a hilarious joker who has obviously had one to many drinks down the pub!, nevertheless he is great in this film and a great actor altogether. I also liked Orlando Blooms performance, he is one of my favourite actors and is great with a gun or sword, i mad a reference to a gun because of Ned Kelly another one of his classics, one i must publish a review on, i am new around here so i am a bit rusty about it all bit i am sure i will fit in fine.
10.0~Superb missminime Sign in Permalink I really liked this movie because it was generally quite fast-paced and kept the viewer interested. There were a few parts in the movie where I can imagine some people would get confused but I think the movie later explains itself. I think the dialogue was good and the acing was excellent. I really liked the character building throughout the movie and I also like the little characters too. I think the scenery was amazing with all the detail which I think plays an important part in any movie but especially this one. I think that this movie is appealing to younger children because of the whole pirate and sword-fighting theme but older people because the more deeper side of the storyline. I hope POTC 2 is just as good and well done to everyone on set specially Johnny Depp! ;-)
9.0~Pirates Scores Big Booty at the Box Office! ducatilvr27 Sign in Permalink Inspired by Disneyland's classic ride, Pirates of the Caribbean is a film of lovable characters, an eerie underscore, and action-packed plot. The story runs a bit long and becomes slightly tedious to watch towards the end, yet a typical Disney happy-ending saves the day just in time for the viewers to walk away pleased with the movie and secretly wishing they were pirates themselves. The film possesses all the classic characters and scenarios of a romantic Disney adventure, including the young, fate-seeking hero, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the comedic relief and clown, witty Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the uptight straight man, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), and the ruthless villain, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Of course, let us not forget the leading lady, young miss Keira Knightley, playing the governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann. Situated in the British, Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Swann wishes to live the life of a pirate and not a governor's daughter, while her admirer, the impoverished blacksmith, Will Turner, wishes to deny his own pirate roots. Once mischievous Sparrow enters the town with his agenda of rounding up a crew, stealing a British naval ship and retrieving his rights as captain of the Black Pearl pirate ship, havoc ensues. The entrance of the damned Black Pearl's crew into Port Royal is quickly summoned by the last missing piece of treasure, which calls them when Swann falls into the water with it (a gold coin) wrapped around her neck. The pirates sac the town, stealing Swann and headed to return the treasure and break their curse. The chase is on, once Turner springs Sparrow from jail, for the ship and its desired possessions. And that's just the first 20 minutes of this event-filled 2 hour and 23 minute movie. The hero's luck runs out, but just when all hope is lost, Sparrow devises a plan to save his ship, get Will his girl and escape the grips of both the cursed pirates and dim-witted British navy. Filled with an excellent cast and first-rate special effects, Pirates makes it easy to truthfully accept the unbelievably fantastical events of the film including sword fights, pirate ships on the open seas, cannon warfare, and caves of treasure. Director Gore Verbinski brings out the best of his actors, who enable the sometimes-cheesy script to flow smoothly and as convincing dialogue. Depp's typical ability to create a quirky and enchanting character is again fulfilled in his drunken pirate role. He brings out the character's bad luck but determined nature, making him the admirable good/bad guy. Depp's humorous line delivery and outstanding timing nicely accompany his scruff appearance, adorned with eyeliner, a bead-embellished wig, and braided goatee. Rush also performs his role of the evil pirate convincingly and with his usual gifted acting talent. Bloom slips nicely into his usual typecast role as the love-driven romantic young lad, and his opposite, then seventeen-year-old, British actress, Knightley brings the adventurous, bold, and beautiful identity of Swann to life. Though none of these characters exist in the Disney adventure ride, there are two similar scene's that lovers of the ride will recognize, one being the stop at pirate infested Tortuga Island. The storyline does become a bit boring and redundant, as the minutes turn to hours, creating the feeling of déjà vu. Yet, the scheming scoundrel Jack Sparrow saves the day, and the audience's attention only to sacrifice himself to capture by the Royal Navy. Don't worry, though, it all ends well as a good Disney movie should. Along with watching an action-packed, historical fantasy and obtaining some great new words to add to daily jargon, such as 'savvy' 'parlay' 'commandeer' and 'ecumenically,' I somehow feel more complete. And just when that sense of completeness fades, the sequel, promised by the title's saga specificity The Curse of the Black Pearl, will probably be in theatres.
8.0~Favorite PotC movie! bfidler-711-155767 Sign in Permalink Love the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The Curse of the Black Pearl is my favorite because it was the first.
9.0~Excellent Adventure, that is highly entertaining, with amazing performances, however it goes on a bit too long callanvass Sign in Permalink This is an excellent adventure that is highly entertaining, with amazing performances, however it goes on a bit too long. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is awesome if a little overlong, plus Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are all simply amazing in this. Orlando Bloom surprised my by giving a very good performance, and his chemistry with Keira was on big time, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Sparrow and Elizabeth are on the Island, and there both drunk on the rum, then Keira gets rid of it, and Depp's reaction just cracked me up!. Johnny Depp, gives one of my favorite performances of all time as Jack Sparrow,and the sword fight between him and Rush was extremely cool, plus the special effects were great!. I thought the dialog was very clever, and I can't wait for the two sequels! plus it's extremely well made and written as well. All the characters are extremely likable, and the opening is especially cool! plus I loved the ending as well. This is an excellent adventure, that is highly entertaining, with amazing performances, however it goes on a bit too long, still I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Gore Verbinski does an excellent! job here with wonderful camera work, great angles, and plenty of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is amazing!. Johnny Depp is amazing as always and is incredible here, he plays one of my favorite character of all time in Jack Sparrow, was hilarious, extremely likable, wonderfully mysterious, had some of the coolest makeup, and was just tons of fun to watch! (Depp Rules!!!!). Geoffrey Rush is amazing as the evil Barbosa, he was simply chilling, and I loved his accent, he also had some awesome makeup, and had one of the coolest sword fights ever with Depp, he was clearly having a ball, I loved him!. Orlando Bloom is surprisingly very good here, he was likable, had some good scenes with Depp, and didn't annoy me like usual, I dug him. Keira Knightley is incredibly gorgeous, and is amazing here as Elizabeth Swan, she adds charm to her role, had very good chemistry with Bloom, and gives one of her best performances to date! (Knightley Rules!!!!). Jack Davenport is good as the arrogant Norrington, and did his job well. Jonathan Pryce adds comic relief as Elizabeth's father he was funny. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5
10.0~The Best! fireflyrocks168 Sign in Permalink POTC is the best film ever made! How can it be no. 212 on the Top 250 films! It deserves to be much higher so keep voting!!! The acting is amazing apart from Orlando maybe but even he is OK. How could anyone dislike this movie. I give two thumbs up and if anyone disagrees they haven't watched it properly. I can't wait for the sequel and hope its as good as the first. It will be if its the same writers. Anyone got any info on the sequel? I've been looking all over the internet but there's nothing please post on IMDb if you know anything! Vote 10/10 for the film now!
8.0~Yes, it was cool gishgirl04 Sign in Permalink This movie i like you know. But when i first saw it, it was complicated. It was like "what a waste of time". Too many stupid ghost-stories. You know i really think that of some movies the first time, but in the 2nd it was just "oh my god, its good". And its a movie really worth buying. I'm definitely gonna get it because Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley is awesome. Its a real adventure that takes to dead pirates and wannabe-pirates. Its like full of comic but that what makes the movie all good. Most disgusting of this movies was when one of the pirates lost the eye all the time, I really wanted them to cut out of that one.
9.0~absolutely wowing f-55750 Sign in Permalink This film in itself was something else being the first of it's series it did in fact live up to it's potential.Johnny Depp is phenomenal in his part as Captain Jack which was expected. Also Orlando Bloom in my opinion made this movie in his own weird but awesome way. The action is awesome and the suspense is intense. The series couldn't have started out better. I gave this 10 stars because if u ask anyone if they have seen the pirates of the Caribbean they would say of course, not to mention everyone for the most part thinks this series is one to put in the books. My review is simply a thumbs up and if u haven't seen this series yet i strongly recommend you do because these movies are fun for the whole family. I say 10/10. Great movie
10.0~Love this movie! Vsangelever13 Sign in Permalink Wow... i love this film, its just amazing! The actors, effects, the stunts. The list goes on! And not to mention the to hottest pirates ever! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom! Johnny's hotter though. No one else could have played Jack Sparrow and pulled it off but Johnny, hes just brilliant! Hes eccentric, mischievous... hes a swashbuckling pirate. And his costume! So unique and new. He is the most talented actor of our generation. All of the sets and fight scenes were superb and so well in detail and the other pirates looked like what you would imagine that pirates of that time would look like, with their teeth all dirty and nasty. This movie is outstanding and so is the second pirates... I would say Dead Mans Chest is better than this one. But this movie is hard to top!
4.0~Offers fun times but little else rebeljenn Sign in Permalink 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is an old-fashioned adventure pirate film, combining new animation techniques with humor, romance, and pirate battles. The film is not a great film by any means; it is simply fun. The film moved a little slow in some places, and I was not impressed by Johnny Depp's performance at all. The film really had little to offer in terms of an original story, but if you are looking for a film that is fun and something to liven up a dull evening, this film is okay. Children and adults can both enjoy this. It's not great, but it can probably be enjoyed by a wide audience. I give this a 4/10 because I did not think it was anything special.
6.0~A good, but overrated movie which was improved on all counts in the sequel Ziya90 Sign in Permalink The Curse of the Black Pearl was almost loved by many critics and according to some of them, it was a masterpiece. Then, why? You know, critics don't like such kind of movies, the movies which they call blockbusters, they underestimate such kind of movies and don't give high ratings. Even the sequel can be an example. As I see, they did not like the second movie as many people did not. Firstly, I want to say that I don't categorize movies as blockbuster and non blockbuster. What I am trying to say is that Curse of the Black Pearl has nothing different or unusual that would make even critics appreciated, instead, it was engrossing, entertaining, but a so so movie. Just another adventure movie. I slightly enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but mildly entertaining, so I cannot say a lot of fun here. I had expected much more by trailer. I think that I can tell my thoughts more clear above The King Arthur. Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie. I was entertained by The King Arthur, but just by some scenes, it was not uninteresting, it was engrossing, but no more than that. I had rented it, watched, was entertained, then gave it back. It was a so so movie, it was not a new Gladiator, it was not a new Excalibur. This first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie, if you ask me. It is an engrossing pirate movie with ghosts who look like flesh and blood, but turn into ghost by moonlight. Cool! As for Johnny Depp, one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Sparrow is remarkable, interesting, but he cannot even touch Jack Sparrow in Dead Man's Chest. In the sequel, this character is much more interesting, eccentric, colorful and funny. However, his performance in all The Pirates of the Caribbean movies is outstanding, especially in the second movie! Jack Sparrow hides a secret, it is unfolded at the last part, but it ruins the character, it kills the humor of the character. I was just disappointed, but not so important. Before the sequel was released, I had been sure that the second movie would surpass the first movie by far on all counts and I was not mistaken about it.
9.0~I love Pirates! whatever_123 Sign in Permalink This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time! I never was really into pirates until I saw this movie. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the most comical characters I've seen! Half-drunk all the time, stumbling around, and charming the ladies, Sparrow is never boring to watch. The chemistry between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is amazing! Kiera Knightly did a fantastic job, and Orlando Bloom was very good too, and very handsome! They were perfect together, I think. The story was very creative and original. It's very piratey and exciting. The special effects are incredible, for the early 2000's. I enjoyed watching the cursed pirates going in and out of the moonlight, changing from normal humans to skeletal undead things. The action sequences kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is truly a classic. I'm sure this movie will be remembered for a long long time.
10.0~A fun action adventure film. Caz1964 Sign in Permalink One of the best pirate films I've ever seen,it has everything in it from damsel in distress,swashbuckling sword fight scenes,a ghost ship maimed by a skeleton crew{now thats what i call a skeleton staff}parrots and The Royal Navy in hot pursuit,now what more could you ask for in a pirate movie.Johnny Depp gives a really good performance as Captain Jack Sparrow,who captained the ship The Black Pearl,only to have it stolen from him and left marooned on a Caribbean Island by Captain Barbosa,played by Geoffrey Rush.Barbosa and his crew are under a curse and they are part of the undead the only way the curse can be lifted is if they have the blood of Will Turner{Orlando Bloom}but by mistake they kidnap Elizabeth Swann{Kiera Knightly}believing she is a Turner.Jack Sparrow wants to recapture his ship and with the help of Will Turner who wants to rescue Elizabeth,they set out to find them.This film has many action scenes and some great special effects,especially when the skeleton crew are fighting the navy.What i also found really good was the way most of the lead actors camped up their performances,making it really funny especially Johhny Depp and Jack Davenport.But i think for me its Geoffrey Rush who steals most scenes,as the unscrupulous Captain Barbosa.
8.0~No Curse Here timhayes-1 Sign in Permalink Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is without a doubt one of the most fun rides to come along in quite some time. Starting from the Disney ride, the filmmakers have fashioned a good old fashioned pirate romp that combines action, adventure and comedy almost perfectly. Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, a flamboyant pirate searching for the ship that was stolen out from under him when his crew mutinied. First off, this film belongs to Depp. His performance is s near perfect that it is almost divine. He brings such a character to Sparrow that you can't help but love him even though he is a pirate. Starring as the new captain of the titular pirate ship is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He is truly the evil pirate that you love to hate and if anyone comes close to Depp's performance it is Rush. Rounding out the main cast are Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. While they try, they are just not in the same league as their more esteemed co-stars. Still, Pirates is good fun and a throwback to the old days of cinema. Enjoy!
8.0~One of the best pirate movies ever. filipemanuelneto Sign in Permalink This film is set in Jamaica during the mid-eighteenth century, when the island was controlled by the British. In this atmosphere of danger, the mastery of the seas is disputed by the Royal Navy and the ferocious buccaneers of the Caribbean. The young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a swords-maker, lives peacefully in Port Royal and secretly loves Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), daughter of Governor Swan (Jonathan Pryce), whom he owes his life. Everything changes after the city was attacked by the pirates of the "Black Pearl", a ship on which hang stories of frightening curses. The girl is abducted and Will ends up coming out looking for her, accompanied by Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a permanently drunk and clumsy pirate, who will do with him the most unlikely pair. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other collaborators. This film was a pleasant surprise to many people, as the pirates movies were normally associated with ticketing failures and had such a strong stigma that virtually disappeared from movies for years. So, this movie not only re-popularized the theme but also returned to pirates movies some respect. Let us begin by the actors: Bloom and Keira Knightley didn't surprised me much because they are used to play the good guy roles, they are comfortable with it and they have great talent doing it, not to mention that, even then, Keira showed great interest in historical or period productions. Who truly stole the show were the major antagonists: Geoffrey Rush (who made the villain, Barbossa), is an consecrated, experienced and respected actor, with an unquestionable quality and an excellent diction, but he outdid himself in this film. He looks like a figure jumped out of an adventures book, like "The Treasure Island". On the other hand, Johnny Depp played the perfect antihero, capable of the worst wrongdoings or to demonstrate feelings of great nobility. This two characters, thought outside the box, fit perfectly in the two views that we have concerning pirates: the romanticized view represented by Barbossa and a more historically accurate perception, immortalized by a drunk and sly Sparrow, who enters and jumps of any awkward situation without worrying too much about it. The scenarios are excellent and computerized animation and the special effects team were up to the challenge. I must refer particularly the vessels used, by the accuracy of the reconstruction and these beauty (although I don't believe that any pirate has ever used ships as large and heavy as those). The costumes and characterization were also impeccable and the plot was invented in an original way, trying to escape a bit of the theme "pirates running for a treasure" emptied of attractiveness, crossing it with some more interesting sub-plots. This film is well worth the price paid for the DVD or movie ticket. Besides having established and popularized Depp and the pirates movies, it entertains the public very well, holding our attention until the end.
8.0~Superb, Intense Action with Witty, Clever Humor rneil95 Sign in Permalink It seems only fitting that the film that started the billion-dollar franchise is also one of the best films that Disney Pictures has ever released, and also one of the best adventure flicks ever made. "Pirates of the Caribbean" has a little in it for everybody, great action sequences, sharp, hilarious comedy, stellar characters, a great story, and of course, Jack Sparrow, who's impossible to not adore. The film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who teams up with a blacksmith Will Turner as they attempt to rescue Elizabeth Swann, Will's love interest, who has been captured by a cursed crew of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, captained by the evil Barbossa. However, Jack has ulterior motives in their mission, and from there the film takes off on one of the most exciting and enjoyable action romp of the decade. The characters are all brilliantly fleshed out and interesting, and sympathetic, but the character who steals the show is Captain Jack. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime with Jack, masterfully crafting a character who is incredibly sly, charismatic, funny, and yet constantly gets himself into stupid situations. Never has a character like this been committed to film, and it's immortalized through Depp. He absolutely makes this film leap from good to great. The film's special effects, while somewhat dated by today's (and the sequel films) standards, still maintain a sense of charm to them and the stunt sequences are all fabulous. The action is intense and entertaining, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The swashbuckling never gets old, and the film is always great fun. Thanks to this film, the pirate genre was redefined from silly and hokey, to what "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" gives audiences: a strong story intertwined with intense action and humor. It's one of my personal favorite films, and definitely one of the best films to bear the Disney name. It's great, and I absolutely recommend anybody who wants to enjoy themselves with a movie to see it.
9.0~Depp saves this unbearably long film smartstrigz Sign in Permalink If I had to tell you whether or not to see this movie in one sentence, I would say this: Go see this movie purely because Johnny Depp is in it. I know that that is what virtually everyone has been saying, but there is so much truth in it. As my subject line says, the movie was decent. It had action, a good plot, and good actors. The script was not too awe inspiring, there were few (but very clever) funny lines, and the special effects were not as good as we've seen in other recent movies. On top of that, the movie drags on for what seems like close to four hours (it actually runs about 2 and a half). The movie drags on and on, and after a long day of work and other activities I was tempted to go home and get some sleep because it seemed like the movie would just never end. However, one thing kept me watching: Johnny Depp. He is absolutely brilliant in this film. He stands heads and shoulders above everyone else in the cast. His take on the role was completely original and the few funny moments that there are seem to always be led by onto the screen by him. You just don't ever know how he's going to react to things next, and you never know exactly whats going through his mind. From the minute he came sailing onto the screen you could tell that he would command this film, and indeed he did. Even the ever rising Orlando Bloom (who I had a serious hard time not looking at him and thinking 'Legolas') was barely noticable when next to Depp. Besides Depp, the movie also scores points for its score. It's not always something you think about when reviewing a movie, but the music in this film really fit perfectly with the action/adventure theme and gets you into the battle scenes. Overall, its an entertaining movie but one that will keep you checking your watch almost constantly. The pace can be slow, and the lines cheesy, but its saving grace is Depp's astounding performance. If for no other reason, go see it just to see Depp.
10.0~A fantastic new age pirate film with everything! helz_belz1 Sign in Permalink Set in the 17th century, a time where Pirates ruled the Caribbean, we meet Jack Sparrow (Depp) an unpredictable pirate and Will Turner (Bloom) and honest blacksmith who loves the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann (Knightly). When Miss Swann is captured by the evil Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew of treacherous pirates who plan to use Elizabeth and her necklace to lift their curse, Will seeks out Jack and the mismatched pair go after Elizabeth, the Black Pearl (Barbossa's ship), adventure and revenge together. This movie is a great movie with fun for all the family. Johnny Depp really brings the film to life with his fantastic humour and great acting. Everything fits and the special affects are great. Watch it if you enjoy action movies with humour such as the Mummy Returns.
7.0~my notes sstrunks-05245 Sign in Permalink Fun epic adventure movie. lots of great action scenes and sequences. surprisingly good story for this type of fun summer blockbuster. lots of great characters, especially Captain Jack Sparrow. amazing musical score by the GOAT Hans. the only thing that brought it down for me was the cheesiness and goofiness in some of the scenes. made it seem just a bit outdated. probably a 4.0 quality movie otherwise (about 5 viewings)
10.0~& really bad eggs ... miaow_kiss Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean; the Curse of the Black Pearl is one of a kind. The movie is very fantastic & the staff must have worked very hard to accomplish such a legendary film. Jack Sparrow (Depp), the poor pirate who could have saved his own life & obtained a fortune, rushes to save somebody else in a terrific adventure which you would never forget. Choosing Johnny Depp for this role made the character perfect. I believe he's the most hilarious person you might ever see & his performance as Jack Sparrow was the most flawless & the most powerful work. I've seen it so many times I can quote practically the whole movie start to finish & it never gets boring, mostly because Johnny Depp is so tremendous.It 'is' a family/kids movie & it is 'not' too scary, but you would enjoy it anyway, & if you wouldn't, i wouldn't argue, wouldn't call you stupid & would respect your opinion. Savvy?
8.0~An All-Around Action-Thriller Summer Movie tabuno Sign in Permalink 13 July 2003. Though a bit violent for small children and a bit long in some places, Pirates has tidbits for all movie goers, old and young, male and female. There is the romance, there are the fight scenes, there are the ghost/horror elements, there are the cute comedy bits that all make up for a rather fun, entertaining film for everyone. Johnny Depp almost steals the show with his anti-hero antics. The movie ultimately stands up to honest scrutiny for all characters for the most part by the end, though perhaps Barbossa could have been even a more complex character making the movie even more dramatic and riveting. The climax avoids the usual melt-down to action and blustery fury, using instead a more moderate and superior ending device. Overall, Pirates rates eight stars out of ten.
5.0~Depp is the only real treasure here Buddy-51 Sign in Permalink God bless Johnny Depp, for without him "Pirates of the Caribbean" would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects. But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture. He is the real treasure here. "Inspired" - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, "Pirates" takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew. Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him. There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here. Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and "avast me, hardy" dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment. For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - "Pirates of the Caribbean" would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat. His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary. One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one. He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn. One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him. For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting. But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film's phenomenal box office booty. Like any good pirate, he deserves it.
8.0~Disney's successful bet on 21st century cinema peqdavid5 Sign in Permalink Disney's recipe for a multi-millionaire franchise: Mix some good pirates, with Johnny Depp as the main ingredient, (make sure they're warm-hearted and technically losers), with a few infra-world evil pirates, in a semi-real Renaissance world, spiced with a love story and with lots and lots of laughs. Heat it up for 2 hours approximately and you'll win more than any President would earn in a lifetime. If that sounded a little bit too rude for you, I assure my intentions weren't bad. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a very entertaining and funny story about the 4 most appreciated treasures of life: love, family, power and money. Jack Sparrow is one of the most interesting characters in movie history, an eccentric but in a very strange way, a human being like ourselves. Special effects, make up, music, costume design and art direction are just magnificent. The villain, excellent. Plot and direction are quite good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are just nice. Even though, we find in "Pirates..." a very different face of Walt Disney Studios, more mature and quite changed for trying to adapt to the 21st century audiences. I must say: Nice way to go, Bruckheimer, keep up the good work and I'm looking forward to watch another high-quality franchise like this.
7.0~The Good & Bad Of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl' ccthemovieman-1 Sign in Permalink I very much enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it but lost interest on the second viewing, for some reason. It's the usual Disney adventure story which means the same good and bad traits I usually find, namely: THE GOOD - Nice camera-work and very slick-looking on DVD. Interesting characters, mostly here the ones played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's difficult to find a role in which Depp doesn't play someone odd and/or fascinating. The story has a good mixture of drama, action, suspense and humor. Keira Knightley is attractive as the female lead and the story is interesting for the full 133 minutes (the last 10 minutes are ending credits.) THE BAD - Once again, the messages are "laws are made to be broken;" "rebels in society are the good guys while authority figures are the villains," and the girl wants the poor man over the rich man, etc. etc. That all is so '60s clichéd by now, you'd think the Baby Boomers in Hollywood would grow up, but apparently not. These traits are in almost every film, including a worldly outlook on everything, which includes glorifying occult nonsense. Disney will never change. OVERALL - A fun movie, thanks mainly to Depp, director Gore Verbnski and his cameramen, and successful enough to spawn a sequel.
10.0~Need more Disney like this. beegboy2020 Sign in Permalink This movie works so well on a variety of levels. Despite being so outlandish, Depp's pirate is clever, creative and believable ... except that he doesn't seem like he'd ever be able to back down a crew of pirates; to wit, his crew abandoned him on a desert island. That he could come back over and and over would create respect in many and, sometimes, those who seem craziest are most feared, so perhaps he could do it. Verbinski knows what he's doing but I wish so much of the movie hadn't rested on Depp's shoulders. That being said, it still works beautifully and Depp's acting is spot on. I guess it comes down to this: When you're watching the movie it can be totally absorbing and any criticisms spring to mind only when the lights are up and I've moved on to other things. I've seen the movie several times and get sucked in every time. If I were to judge a movie only by my thoughts after it's over, that wouldn't be fair. I believe you have to judge a movie mostly by what's on your mind during it and give much less criticism after wards. The movie IS the moment, not the trip home.
10.0~Though supposedly a movie for Orlando Bloom.... midnightatten Sign in Permalink A movie that was suppose to have Orlando as lead, is taken by my beloved Johnny Depp. I have been a fan of his since I can't even remember how far back. I not only drool over him, his talent is true and original. How many sexy males do you know that would or could pull off a very believable rendition of a punk-rock pirate named Jack Sparrow. The plot is almost perfectly mending to all genre's and pulls anyone in by its diverse levels of movie goers. If you like action, comedy, and anything with Johnny Depp, this is the one to see. I recommend other Johnny Depp movies, and that you keep watch on Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom for other upcoming movies to see that they are savvy actors and actresses.
6.0~Depp adds needed ingredient rosscinema Sign in Permalink This easily could have been your run of the mill pirate movie but thank god Johnny Depp is not only a terrific actor but one that adds real "Character" to his characters. Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to "Boot Strap" Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with "Mouse Hunt" he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film "Bend It Like Beckham". Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale.
10.0~one of the most original movies xbabibluangelx Sign in Permalink Not too many could pull of a pirate movie like that. I'll be honest, when i heard there was a pirate movie coming out, I laughed. Pirates? Was the audience two-year old boys? I wouldn't have gone to see it if my friend hadn't told me how good it was. The actors were phenomenal, and the script was so well written. Johnny Depp gave an outstanding perfromance as the legendary Jack Sparrow. He portrayed his character so well, a rough, take-no-crap tough man, but somewhat sweet on the inside. Kiera Knightley had a character with same same kind of personality as Jack (except not as happy-go-lucky while drunk). Orlando Bloom, oh my gosh! I never thought I could find a man with long hair sexy, but he just completely....ugh, it was great! His acting, his character, his look, all fantastic. Please Hollywood, make more movies like this!
10.0~I LOVE JOHNNY DEPP! skoolgrl928 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp is the SEXIEST man alive!!! I love him! Pirates was awseome! I think that Pirates won Johnny a whole new variety of fans. Johnny is the best actor in the world!! He is sooo perfect for every character that he has ever played! He brings life to everything! I love Johnny Depp!
10.0~All in all a good review !(Johnny Depp) e_russon Sign in Permalink I thought that the film was wonderful! I enjoyed watching this film as it was almost heart felt. Johnny Depp played a great part as Captain Jack Sparrow, i have watched many of Johnny's films and so far i would have to say that this one beats the rest. Well Done you Johnny! Sorry about the Oscar ! :( : ( It was a really well made film ! Can't wait for the sequel ! I am hoping for new exciting adventures as Captain Jack and his crew take on the black pearl ! I also love the play-right and the comedy that the movie holds after watching it the second time, you hear things that you don't hear, when watching it for the first time ! excellent, i loved it all !
9.0~The joys of Attraction edu-82268 Sign in Permalink Two major constituents make Pirates of the Caribbean a cinematic attraction: dynamic inventiveness and the great spectacle. The first is seen in the encounter with the sword between Bloom & Depp in the Forge, where we exploit all possible springs of accessories, planks, beams, gears, for a high-flying fight that sends us back to the beautiful hours of aerobatics of a Errol Flynn Some 70 years ago. The second is played in the pretty successful effects of the zombie pirates passing under the lighting of the moon, including this very nice underwater walk.
10.0~favorite!!!! lilkid4eva Sign in Permalink i love this movie. johnny depp was excellent, and i must admitt, he was pretty hot for like an old guy- u know. rush & bloom were both great, i especially thought that this one one of orlando bloom's best! kiera knightly was brilliant as the young miss elizabeth swann. i thought that this was an absolute must see, it is definately my favorite movies. well acted and well written, this was great!!!
3.0~Jack Sparrow is back yashtalli Sign in Permalink "Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male," a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie. With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!) I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.
7.0~As Fun as an Amusement Ride noralee Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is an over-the-top romp that's just plain fun. Gee, much like an amusement park ride. Too bad the roster of good actors (including from British TV comedies "The Office" and "Coupling") were clearly directed to lay it all on broadly (except Jonathan Pryce who is very atypically laid-back and therefore wasted). Orlando Bloom doesn't get to do too much, Geoffrey Rush has a ball being a villain, while Johnny Depp steals the show with his loopy pirate captain (I like most folks comparison of him to Keith Richards). I figure the only reason he plays it sort of drunken and crazy is to not add an unintentional romantic triangle with a very contemporarily feisty Keira Knightley. For all the action, there's too many close-ups and not enough opportunity to take it all in from a broader perspective. Stay through the extensive credits (and, evidently yes, they did film some of it in the Caribbean) to see a cute plot coda. The music is so bombastic and continuous that it's not completely attributed to just Hans Zimmer but to a large team. (originally written 7/16/2003)
9.0~A Wonderful Accident chi-cerca-trova Sign in Permalink OK, here we go... 2 years after initially seeing this movie, it finally hit me. This movie should have been absolutely terrible. It had a mediocre plot, terrible screen writing, Disney (which, at this point in time, if it didn't have Pixar attached, it sucked). The initial character development and interaction was contrived and shallow. So, why such a wonderful movie? Because of the people behind it. Everyone talks of Johnny Depp, whom i will agree got robbed of a worthy Oscar that year. He is an excellent actor, whom was hilarious and refreshing in what could have been a cliché role. But, we cannot forget the ENTIRE cast. Geoffery Rush, once again adding his own ingredient to a meal already been had, played a devilishly enjoyable villain. Orlando Bloom gave us proof that he can, in reality, handle dialog with other characters, and i believe successfully broke the chance of possibly being type casted. Keira Knightly added a visually stunning character, which would have been understood from the beginning. But, she didn't allow her character to fall into such an easy "no-so-damsel-in-distress" role, which has been played again and again. In essence, it was the people involved that made it what it was. While i'm concerned for the sequel, this is truly an adventure classic, with very little cliché's, awesome and intriguing characters, beautiful and fluent choreography, awesome set design, and most importantly, a cliché' and boring plot/script in the hands of true talent, who were able to break it from the Blockbuster purgatory that it was doomed to.
10.0~Lightning in a bottle neil-476 Sign in Permalink The trailer looked like fun, and we'd been on the ride, so we decided to go and see this pirate movie. The eerie opening was effective, and this was followed by some mild intrigue and romance as Orlando Bloom's apprentice swordsmith clearly wished to romance Keira Knightly's governor's daughter. And then Captain Jack Sparrow arrived, in one of the best movie entrances anywhere, any time, and the film took off. It had a strong story, lots of eye candy, humour, action, knockabout slapstick, excitement, swashbuckling adventure, a dramatic and memorable score, an eclectic cast on top form, terrific special effects, lots of nods to the theme park ride, a cracking script, and a fabulous central performance from Johnny Depp. Completely unexpectedly, it turned out to be one of the best and most entertaining family films of recent years. Superb.
8.0~Who would have thought? It's actually good. Citizen_Cam Sign in Permalink You wouldn't have thought a movie based on a ride would be any good. In fact, most rational people would think it was dreadful; a horribly cynical marketing exercise. Imagine my surprise, then, at Pirates of the Caribbean. While it would be perhaps exaggerating to say it is a cinematic masterpiece and one of the great movies of our time, it is a solidly entertaining film and wins brownie points on a number of levels. Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow (the Captain bit is very important to him), a pirate who has no ship. When he comes to Port Royal, the happy-go-lucky Sparrow is caught by the marines and sentenced to hang, but he escapes when the dreaded Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of evil scum of the earth (scum of the sea?), attack the port and kidnap Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), the daughter of the Governor (Jonathan Pryce). Why do they kidnap her? Because she has the last piece of a cursed treasure they plundered years ago, the return of which coupled with their blood will lift the curse upon them, the curse that has turned them into walking corpses. Of course, to say more gives away the plot twists, of which there are several. As a viewer, I spent most of the time trying to figure out if Sparrow is good or bad. Whose side is this guy on? Depp&#8217;s performance is a very curious one. He speaks in no particular accent, seemingly Irish, Australian and cockney all in one, and he leaps about the screen, smiling an odd grin and making witty repartee with the others. Depp apparently copied much of his performance from Keith Richards - now that I know that I can see the resemblance (perhaps Depp has a future as a mimic?). He is a pirate, no doubt about it, in that he can never be trusted too far; but how far, of course, is one of the points of the film. The rest of the cast are good too. Orlando Bloom plays the blacksmith unwittingly caught up in Sparrow's wake, mostly to save Elizabeth from the pirates, and does a nice job of the 'young man at sea' routine. Rush, one of my favourite Australian actors, is well cast as the villainous, cursed Barbossa (his eyes and voice always make him seem like a bad guy) and Knightly is sufficient in the role of the damsel in distress, although she comes into her own several times in the film, which is good to see. Unusually for a film like this, the plot and script are actually pretty good. The twists keep coming, the story makes sense, and there's plenty for the characters to do. There are also some very good action sequences, including the Governor's battle with a severed hand (you have to see it) and the final fight between Sparrow and Barbossa. Pirates of the Caribbean is not a movie you go and see if you're into thought-provoking, meaningful and uplifting film-making. Fortunately, I'm not. I like to be entertained, and Pirates entertains nicely. It's funny, dramatic, suspenseful; what more can you ask from a film? Well, actually you can ask for a lot more, but Pirates isn't that kind of film. As it is, it earns points in all categories, and while it's not a master stroke by director Gore Verbinski, it is a solidly entertaining movie, with a yo heave ho and even, at one point, a bottle of rum. Arrrrr. And so on and so forth. Good-o-meter rating: 8/10
5.0~Pirates of the Over Rated Something Or Other benjamin_lappin Sign in Permalink One of 'the' most over rated films of the twenty-first century, this film is truly abysmal. I know those of you who have posted positive reviews will be searching these pages for negative comments so that you can then go on to berate us, will loathe me and this brief summary but it is true. The film is a one man band, and therein lies its most fatal flaw and its only saving grace. Johnny Depp, arguably one of the most, if not the most, well rounded actor of the present times, provides a captivating and mesmeric performance as "Captain Jack Sparrow" and is truly a delight to watch, from his accent, to his well timed humour, to just about everything that goes wrong for him...and that's about it. Take out Depp, and you have a Shakespearean tragedy without the Shakespearean part. Orlando Bloom has already proved in recent times that he is completely incapable of carrying a film. He does not only not have the stage presence, but his acting varies from poor to woeful, and always with that unnecessarily husky voice, to show that he's conveying either aggression, passion, fear, loathing and just about every other emotion under the sun, as he is just so damned monotonic. Knightly is THE most over rated female actor of the present day. I hear people raving over her acting skills, yet this and Pride and Prejudice have been the biggest films she's starred in, one flopped and one was carried through by Depp, hardly a sparkling resume. Not only is she incapable of acting (like Bloom) but she has THE WORST line in cinema of the 21st Century "Try Wearing a Corset"....no thanks. Honestly, she delivers it in such a matter of fact manner as if it were part of a recipes serving suggestion, "you could try adding a touch of basil or garlic or even wearing a corset" The film is entertaining in moments, but follows a very predictable and very typical Hollywood formula which is starting to get really old, really fast, and with the new one on its way, is only going to get older and more decrepit. So welcome to Pirates of th...zzzzzzzzzz....oh, sorry...Is it over yet?
8.0~Solid swashbuckling adventure paladeen Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a solid swashbuckling adventure of the type that reminds of me of better times. In fact, it made me recall The Princess Bride, another film in a similar genre. Performances are fine here, if a bit over the top on many occasions. Johnny Depp is a scene stealer: the audience is just waiting for him to reappear while the other characters get serious screen time. The heroine is sexy, Orlando Bloom is the typical white hero, lots of funny situations. Cliche ending, but what do you expect? The film should have ended sooner, and some of the snappy comments were rather stupid. So, it's not a masterpiece but, all in all, a very solid piece of cinematic entertainment. My rating is 8/10.
10.0~Absolutely great wildkitty Sign in Permalink I expected this to be a drippy movie but then I broke down and rented it, now I own it. I laughed through it and was stunned at how similar Orlando Bloom looks like Errol Flynn in it. I loved the tongue-in-cheek humor. This movie is great and I hope there could be a couple of more sequels to it with the Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp and some of the others. I have some great story lines for sequels to this movie. This was humorous and was a great spoof on pirate movies. I have a full collection of Errol Flynn movies and this gets to sit with them as one of my favorites. Errol Flynn would have loved this movie as a man who was supposed to have had a fantastic sense of humor. The costuming, ships, and the special effects of changing them from men to skeletons was a very cleverly done.
8.0~good movie KyleFurr2 Sign in Permalink This is a good movie directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow who in the first scene is looking to steal a ship because his previous ship was stolen from him. Bloom plays a blacksmith who is in love with Knightley but she is the daughter of the Governor and is asked by a top guard to the governor if she'll marry him. Their is a lot of plot to the movie and at almost two and a half hours the movie doesn't even seem that long. Rush makes a great villain who tried to kill Depp before and Depp is looking for revenge. It's a good movie and i can't wait for the two sequels coming out next year.
5.0~Johnny Depp is Awesome, Pirates is Not CrassActionHero Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge movie. However, quite a disappointment. Pirates starts off right. The first appearance of Jack sparrow is quite funny and effective. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Sparrow. His performance is top notch as the dubious and ragged pirate. The story is unconvincing. I truly never understood the curse at all. Pirates does have some excellent sword combat. We see one between Sparrow and Turner(Orlando bloom)does quite well. The dialog here is mostly lame. It would have been better with good dialog or if these two just fought without saying a word. Some later combat is just lame. Your opponent is a undead monster that can't be stopped by your sword. If the two were living, then the combat would be much more satisfying. The sword combat does suffer from being repetitive as well. Johnny Depp aside, the acting here is okay. Nothing breathtaking. Keira Knightly is great eye candy, but seems like wasted talent here. Orlando Bloom is not bad, just over-acts his role. Keep it simple kid. There are many others but the only other one worth mentioning is Geoffory Rush. He has one line in this movie that is just juicy. Every time I hear it, it just rules. The Special FX are amazing. Convoluted story aside, the skeletal pirates are dazzling to just look at. Never has the undead looked this good. Most of the comedy does not work well here. There are exceptions to that though. Example, Jack Sparrow, no matter the situation always gets annoyed when he is not referred to as "Captian". Another is The Black Pearl is getting damaged during a sea battle and during all the danger, Jack shouts out: "Stop putting holes in my ship!". Depp is good like I say. Pirates also suffers from overstaying it's welcome. It's just too long of a movie. Also, one sequence of scenes that should have been immediately sent to the cutting room floor are the scenes with the Govener dealing with a severed hand. Useless and plain annoying. I did not much care for the pirate with the fake eye either. The Last Word: Pirates, not a terrible movie is not engaging enough either. There are some high marks and lows. To many characters and a difficult story. Depp is the best. Jack Sparrow is very likable. Pirates just could have been a much better movie. **1/2/*****
10.0~Astoundingly Good jenhowdesh Sign in Permalink The acting: brilliant. The action: CGI at it's finest. This is PG-13 for the skeleton crew and it's possibility of provoking nightmares in younger children. If you have kids that are 10 and up, you won't mind sharing the couch. There's no blood. All of the death and violence that you know has to be in a movie like this is so tastefully done it's almost shocking in this day of blood by the gallon. Beautifully filmed and scored, you won't want to leave your seat for anything. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish. Pirates is completely unexpected in it's eloquence and detail. Too many films take their big budgets and blow the film, while this one shows them what they should have done. To say we can't wait until Pirates 2 comes out would be an understatement. We are eagerly awaiting it's release and once you see this one, you will, too.
9.0~Spectacular Summer Fun!!! shawny11_2001 Sign in Permalink I came out of this movie last night with a big smile on my face. I hadn't had that good of a time at the movies in a long time. This is an all-round fun time at the theater, one that you will regret if you miss it. The acting is superb on all parts, from the barely noticed crew that Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) hires to the big wigs themsevles, this is a winner. Johnny Depp is absolutely deft at Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush oozes evil as Captain Barbossa, Keira Knightely pulls of the character of Elizabeth Swann very beautifully (both physically and actorly) and Orlando Bloom is always a joy to see. The writers should be handed medals, considering all the other crap that Hollywood has put out in 2003. (Minus X2, Reloaded, Finding Nemo, The Hulk) Gore Verbinski shows the audience that pirate movies are not dead, they just need a story, great actors, lots of action, and humor that isn't boring. All the shows last night were sold out, so it looks like Disney has come up with a true winner for a change. Now, go see it and have a fun time at the theater.
10.0~A new disney classic ThermalHeat Sign in Permalink It's been along time snice disney came out with a flick like this. One day this will be one of those classic disney films they show durring recerational assembles at your elementy school's adutorum. Johnny depp is unforgateable as jack sparrow. I love it when an action movie is capable of apealing to the masses Hopefully the sucess of this movie will cause disney to update that dated ride this movie was based on.
7.0~Shiver me fey timbers. dunmore_ego Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp as some kind of transvestite, in a swinging, swordfighting fey-quest over the high seas of The Caribbean, with Orlando Bloom as his blacksmith girlfriend, and Geoffrey Rush as a grumpy old man in a Halloween pirate costume. Keira Knightley's square man-jaw causes untold distraction; Jonathan Pryce gads about in a wig slightly smaller than Dee Snider's hair during the Stay Hungry tour, and Jack Davenport tries to take it all seriously, for which I'm sure everyone laughed at him behind his back. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is as entertaining as it is ambitious, as rollicking as it is ridiculous, as boyish-action-movie as it is gender-bendingly-ambiguous. Supposedly based on the boring Disneyland boat ride of the same name - without all the gender bending - if anyone ever has this much fun on that dank, irritating boat ride, I'll eat my triangular hat. Somehow, Disney's accursed homogenizing hand could not stultify this film's pure adrenalin bumrush. Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, who rocketed out of left field with his mascara on overdrive and his personality on sideways; he alone imbues this movie with its unique charm. For some reason, his aggressive effeteness lends an authenticity to the swashbuckling that none of the other "Halloween pirate" performances can. His drunken, insouciant braggadocio drives the film like a 1st rate Ship-of-the-line, beating to windward, guns blazing (and I do mean 'blazing'). Matter of fact, there were secret talks held with the Oxford English Dictionary on whether to replace Anthony Hopkins's picture with Depp's, next to the meaning of the word "fey." Filmed in the Caribbean (St. Vincent and the Windward Islands of the Grenadines), PIRATES somehow avoids looking anything like the Caribbean. Must be that homogenizing Disney touch. Geoffrey Rush is aye-me-hearties Captain Barbossa who stole Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl, which Sparrow spends the whole movie trying to steal back. Keira Knightley is Elizabeth Swann, daughter to the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), betrothed to a stoic British Commodore (Jack Davenport), but in love with Jack's girlfriend, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Director Gore Verbinski frames Knightley's opening shot from an angle that makes her look busty, rather than her sad reality of being flatter than the Earth Before Columbus. Her pancake ironing board pecs are probably the reason that with all the kidnapping she undergoes by pirates, not one of them thinks to drag her into the hold and rape her - they must think she's a skinny boy. And since none of them are Catholic priests, she's not considered sexual property. It looks very eerie cinematically, but with all those holes in the sails, how does the Black Pearl ever sail? Oh, that's right, she's supernatural. Then why does she "sail" at all? Why engage in a "chase" to "catch up" to the Commodore's ship? Why not just appear alongside in one fell swoop? For once, the work of four writers looks justified (Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, Jay Wolpert) with the wealth of ideas on screen. Bold, brash, criminal adventure, involving Aztec blood amulets, hidden treasure, lots of yo-ho-ho barrels of rum, double-crosses and triple-crosses (Sparrow: "Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly") and fencing the likes of which we haven't seen since Basil Rathbone and Errol Flynn (which does get tiresome when everyone is fencing for no reason, i.e. if you can't kill each other by fencing - due to being supernatural beings - why bother?) Bouncy-bouncy music by Hans Zimmer, moving us like the shifting deck of a schooner: coy, ominous, frolicsome, and rope-swinging-across-chasms epic, transporting us out into the salty breeze and briny seas - or at least to a water tank in San Francisco. I'm sure the PIRATES movie has made the Disney ride infinitely more popular - though no less boring. --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).
6.0~Good start to a long-lasting franchise Horst_In_Translation Sign in Permalink The very first "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie was a huge success at the box office and at awards ceremonies. It was no°3 at the box office behind the final "Lord of the Rings" chapter and "Finding Nemo". Also it received 5 Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Depp (his first nomination ever) and also an SAG Award for him. That is also why there have been 3 sequels already, no°4 is safe and number looks likely too. The first one (just like 2 and 3) was directed by Gore Verbinski, who kept reuniting with Depp after his exit from the Pirates-franchise. The writing team already worked together on animation classics like "Shrek" and "Aladdin". My favorite part from the script was possibly the "saving the one shot"-storyline and the final shot was one of the highlights of the movie. I was a bit surprised the crew went according to protocol at some point as they seemed extremely loyal to Sparrow initially, but I guess it shows that you can never trust pirates. Thank God Captain Sparrow survived all these dangerous situations early on like the hail of bullets after he saved and threatened Elizabeth Swann or when he almost gets hung near the end of the film. Actually that could have been a nice ending if they hadn't done all these sequels. A bit unexpected, but somehow different. I also thought Geoffrey Rush did a good job with his character (but that's a given as it's Geoffrey Rush), the main antagonist to Sparrow. His death scene near the end was pretty special. I guess they did not plan to include him in the sequels, but they were wrong. Let's see how they bring him back. Another antagonist, the commodore, I was really fond of. I almost cheered for him more than for Bloom's character (just like Sparrow). It was actually nice for a change to see the rival to be displayed in not such a bad light. I found him likable and you could even call him a hero. Knightley did a solid job too and I liked Depp as well. I'm not his biggest fan, but here he convinced me and made me laugh too. He is a very costume-oriented actor if you look at his body of work and Jack Sparrow may very well be his most memorable role. Orlando Bloom unfortunately still does nothing for me. He is all about his looks and little about being a talented actor in my opinion. This franchise started right after "The Lord of the Rings", so they cast him as a crowd magnet I guess. The film is mostly a family movie. Here and there, there is a bit of violence, like ghost pirates cutting throats of Navy officers, but it's all not too graphic or very fast over. Another strength about the film is the music. I am a bit surprised Zimmer was completely snubbed by everybody that awards season as his soundtrack is certainly one of the most memorable from 2003 and pretty much everybody has heard the main theme.
6.0~Some Complaints bigboybhatia Sign in Permalink I was not thoroughly impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean, as I had heard several glowing word-of-mouth reviews. I have to admit that Johnny Depp's performance was quite hilarious and was the best thing about this movie. One complaint is that the movie is way too long. They could have easily chopped 30-45 minutes from this film without sacrificing anything. Another complaint is the level of violence. I am a horror fan, and certainly am not against violence in the movies. However, the impression this movie gives prior to watching is that it is a Disney-esque film. I think the PG rating is too leniant and the given the stabbings, shootings, and blood that abound in this film, they should have raised it. 6/10
2.0~... and it shall be more terrible than you could possibly imagine. RiffRaffMcKinley Sign in Permalink That's not exactly true of this overblown, over-budgeted, over-long, and over-praised piece of garbage. I've seen plenty of things that were worse. But this movie, which is somehow at the time of this writing on IMDb's Top 250 page, was something I greatly anticipated seeing in theaters. But I, like so many other fans of genuine cinema, was deceived and betrayed. That is because this movie is just another in a *huge* line of recent (dating back to the '80s) films that favor massive amounts of special effects, action, and star power over any semblance of substance. The special effects are good at certain parts (I like the curse reveal), but you can tell they sucked up *far* too much money. And the action is well-conceived, but a two-year-old could execute it a darn sight better. And star power? Don't get me started-- it's sad to think that Johnny Depp has ever been considered as being in that category. He has no talent, no taste, and no respect for either himself or his audience. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have potential-- but it all goes seeping out of their heads from just being around Depp (watch the movie; I think you can see the leaks!) While not wholly poisonous, this dim and dull "blockbuster" is pretty terrible. This is another high-profile example of the recent cheapening of the American cinema.
3.0~Gack! GastricReFlux Sign in Permalink Okay, what the hell happened? Yesterday, I checked here to see what people were thinking of this movie, and judging by the comments, it looked like a good movie to see with my girlfriend. Ugh, not even close. I gave this movie a 3 in the vote, and that was for its only redeeming feature, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Without the characterization he gave, this movie had nothing, nothing to hold my interest. The love story was uninvolving. The pirates were kind of cool, and the action was decent. But you know things are going bad when at one point in the movie, you're laughing because the lead actress's lipstick glaringly sticks out considering her circumstances at the time. Set in colonial times, and lacking access to anything remotely resembling Revlon, I couldn't decide to laugh or groan at such poor makeup, direction, and review. The only reason I would recommend this movie to anyone is if someone is a fan of Johnny Depp. He was excellent. But rent it, don't spend your money at the theater for this.
8.0~score one for (Captain) Jack Sparrow and the Disney brain trust Marc_Israel_365 Sign in Permalink This movie is simply a lot of fun due to the legendary premise, not fully understand until it is right in front of our nose, and how can you not adore Johnny Depp's dead pan Keith Richards impersonation as a pirate for Disney and their theme park mentality. This odd combination is one of the funniest screen personas ever created, adding a prideful element of egocentric status to this likable adventure. Orlando Bloom is noble as he chases the beautiful Keira Knightly, but it is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa that adds the fairy tale element as the smart and commanding villain pirate, while the silly British army, always a step behind, adds a bit of comic belief. The Disney special effects complete the fun and certify this film and The Black Pearl as Disney magic.
8.0~Genre not cursed at all. shinymc_shine Sign in Permalink Slightly overlong romp that will put a smile on your face from beginning to end. After the moronic Bad Boys II Jerry Bruckheimer has redeemed himself with this fun, humourous swashbuckler. Johnny Depp never fails to amuse.
10.0~Best movie that went straight to the top of my list! slytherinseeker11 Sign in Permalink This was one of the very best movies that i have watched so far.....went to the top of my lists straight away. And i think everyone should know that J.Depp was the best in that movie and deserved a major major award. He should be congratulated with his acting....it was awesome...the moment i saw him...i decided he was my favourite character. HE WAS THAT GOOD. Orlando was pretty good too and Keira as well but the main person that grabbed my attention was Depp. In my opinion, the spotlight was on him! This movie also has one of the best story lines....i can't wait for the second one.....i don't know...i love pirates and all that kind of stuff...so that's another reason of why i liked the movie.
10.0~A brilliant movie that transcends normal blockbusters to become the best film of the year.(SPOILERS) rosemary-17 Sign in Permalink when i went into this movie i was expecting to see an average film. i really only went for Johnny Depp who is one of the best actors of this era, never failing to give a superb performance. but on the whole i wasn't expecting to be impressed. i am delighted to say that for once i was completely and utterly wrong. from the start with Jack Sparrows (Depp) brilliantly funny entrance, to the end, the hilarious fall off the balcony, i was laughing none stop. there is no weak link in this film. the script is brilliant, mixing the right amount of plot without making it too confusing, and with so many witty gags to keep even the most unconvinced viewer amused. the direction is also spot on and the action is great. the acting is also very convincing with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner playing the Errol Flynn number, Keira Knightley doing the damsel in distress come feisty heroine routine and Geoffrey Rush hamming it up with the best of them. however, top honours go to Johnny Depp as, like always, he steals the show completely. his Keith Richards meets Pepe Le Pew character is the funniest and most inspired performance he has ever done (and that's saying a lot) and does not fail to keep you amused and excited from start to finish. his changing character from kidnapping Elizabeth, to seemingly turning against Will and then eventually becoming the hero is interrupted by scenes where he is truly playing it for comic value and does it effortlessly (his fight with Will at the beginning, being marrooned on the desert island and when he is about to be hanged at the end are among the funniest bits in a very funny film). his swaggering, drunken, hopeless yet heroic character is the best thing to come out of films in a long time and will keep you laughing long after the film is over. the only slight criticism would be that it is about 20 minutes too long, yet i cannot think which bits i would have them cut out as i loved every moment of it (and, i ask myself, can you have too much of a good thing.} overall, this film would always have been a success, but having Johnny Depp on board (no pun intended) saved the film from being just another hollywood blockbuster with no heart and turning it into something extraordinary with one of the best performances of his career, leaving the competition all out at sea.
10.0~Absa bloody lutly brilliant justbethy Sign in Permalink This has become one of my favorite movies ever. Not a Depp fan (hes usually to creepy) I find myself captivated with his antics and acceptance of bad luck. his English accent is downright excellent..specialy if he MEANT to sound half cut throughout most of the film. As for Bloom He is most definety an actor with a future...I wonder if Legolas is to Frodo what Han Solo turned out to be to Skywalker..(In other words Mark Who..??) And Miss Knightley what a beauty. A REAL beauty. And dear Jack Davenport after coupling how great to see him in a movie playing quite the opposite and still be excellent bravo Jack. (and twas nice to J Pryce on screen again after been gone a few years..something wicked this way comes is still a fave..:).This film still has my lmao even after a dozen re runs...my 4 and 6 year old kids love it my 15 y/o girl loves it even my hard to please hubby loved it...At last a movie for both sexes and all generations. Its a winner.:D
10.0~a wonderful movie a surprising classic loserrt27 Sign in Permalink A movie based on a disney ride is getting to be a phase!This is a surprise it was amazing!Johnny Depp is great in this movie and Orlando Bloom shows that he can be more than a great elf!The effects are really well done and the fight scenes were well put together and all together was an excellent movie!This is a little scary so young kids might be scared of the scenes where the pirates show there true selves.But a well deserved treat for the movie fan looking for a good entertaining movie with everything to offer action adventure a little scary and yes even some comedy!Johnny Depp should have got the oscar for this movie!this unlike the haunted-mansion is great just because it is based on a ride don't look it over it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time
10.0~Best Picture / Best Actor / of 2003 leolady21 Sign in Permalink I have seen this movie 7 times and would see it 7 more. I have the soundtrack C.D. and I am on a waiting list for the DvD. This is the best movie of 2003. and Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. (his performance was absolutely amazing) This movie is what movies are meant to be - To take you to another place in time, to forget about all the things of the real world, To enjoy your self. to pretend, to have fun, to be young. I am sick of hollywood telling us how to feel and live our life's. I think they forget who pays their salaries. We do and we want this movie to win every award. Because it deserves it. I know it will not happen they have their heads stuck up their ___________ So all I can do is watch it again. Buy the DvD and Wait for the SEQUEL
9.0~funny, long story to read if your bored Jessie300 Sign in Permalink NO SPOILERS TO BLACK PEARL BUT DOES HAVE A SPOILER FOR DEAD MANS CHEST!! Read if your bored....long story To start of, i don't start my own threads so i hope this is the right thing...haha well anyways, i'd like to share a (what i find to be a very funny story) of what me and a friend and my brother did in celebration to Dead mans Chest. It was about a week before July 7th, i suppose and we were all very excited and wanted to do something to celebrate, but as we were camping there wasn't much to do. So, what we did do, was pulled up a long log that was fairly thick and named it the Black Pearl. From there, we sat on the log (in the water) and paddled it out for almost 1Km. Soon it became dark and freezing cold and we weren't thinking straight.As we realized we could die (we were sooo tired and cold) we began waving at speedboats that passed. Finally, after an hour and half, a boat picked us up. And so, yes it really happened, i abandoned the Black Pearl just like Jack meant to do. I almost cried. It was very funny though. So yeah, my dad gave us hell when we got back, but it was a good laugh and we gave Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Mans Chest a life threatening expedition in its name. Hope you enjoyed.
6.0~This movie is just OK. maxmages Sign in Permalink As a kid I've loved pirates and adored pirate-movies, as growing up I do not even know how many times I saw the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, how often I quarreled about it. Man, this was my favorite movie. When the fourth Film was released, I wanted to watch the first one to get rid of the bad taste and the terrible memory of all the other movies. I took her on a weekend time, put myself in the right mood, had a big plate of pancakes on my table and saw, after a long time, the "Pirates of the Caribbean 1" again in the atmospheric light with my freshly purchased boxes and the best sound... And Now: The plot is relatively complicated tolled for such a simple pirate adventure, all locations look quite chic so I think it's a shame how much time on the water or on ships spend. The special effects are pretty cool, I like the eerie atmosphere and the actors manage to convey it correctly, making you feel like you're part of it. Even the costumes and make-up contribute to the impression that I do not see actors but I really see these characters. I think Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were born for these roles. I'm sooo happy to see again Disney movie with action and sword fight instead of musical numbers. But: This movie was just below my expectations. It was not so exciting, not so cool, not so funny, not so thoughtful and not as creative as I thought or remembered. And to my astonishment, the movie is not nearly as good... as I thought. The movie was still good but, maybe I had lower demands as a kid, maybe the movie is still good but my taste and expectations are now too high, maybe the movie was never good was never that good to begin with and as a kid I tolerated it more or anything else happened so I can say today this movie is just OK.
8.0~Fun, especially if you like Johnny Depp martiia Sign in Permalink If you need a reason to see this movie, it's Depp's performance as the eccentric Jack Sparrow. I think it's cool he received an Oscar nom. Keira Knightley had some good jokes as well. Orlando Bloom is okay, although I'd like to see him in a role other than the pretty hero dude. The only other thing I've seen him in is the LOTR trilogy. I agree with the others, the movie could have been shorter. But it's entertaining enough to pass time. If you have 2 hours to waste, this a nice movie to watch.
2.0~Boring diggler_inc Sign in Permalink This is the most over rated film since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The Film is beautifully shot and is nice to look at for the first ten mintues or so but then it gets so boring and your mind begins to wander. I am just glad I didn't pay money to see this big-budget piece of garbage. It is unfunny and unexciting. Skip it.
8.0~Depp and Rush play 'Pirates'. vip_ebriega Sign in Permalink My Take: A charismatic and hilarious performance by Johnny Depp is the icing of the cake in this terrific, if somewhat overrated, summer flick. After all the talks, the publicity and all else in its hype, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN premiered in theaters during its release date with a bang. This is a summer movie with a hype that reaches the moon, but this one actually lives up to it. PIRATES is very long, too long in fact even for a big-budget event film, but for half of its running time, PIRATES is a good ride. Special effects and action scenes galore, the real treat is Johnny Depp, delightful as the drunkenly quire Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who lost his ship, the Black Pearl, to another captain (Geoffrey Rush), who is also curse with eternal damnation when they are damned to walk the earth as undead seafarers. After the crew of the Black Pearl invade the peaceful town of Port Royale and kidnaps the Governor's Daughter Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) aids the help of Sparrow to find her and get her back. Swashbuckling action and a lot of special effects ensues. In fact, so much of these action and effects occupy the entire picture, yet the film does what every summer movie does: more. So much more of the stuff that already is plenty in this film gives us too much of the bargain. Special effects after special effects do get tedious after a while. Still, for a summer movie, PIRATES kept its promise, and, here's the question: Did it live up to the hype? Sure it did. Although imperfect, legions of fans will not be disappointed. Rating: **** out of 5.
10.0~A lot of people really loved this film. I'm one of them Calina Sign in Permalink Until about a month ago, The Two Towers was unique for being the only film I had ever gone to see in a cinema on more than one occasion. It's not unique any more, and to a great extent, it's also overshadowed. I've been to see this gem more often...There are a lot of high points to this movie...namely, it's what a trip to the cinema is all about, transportation to another place, if even for a couple of hours. Oh sure, Middle Earth is another place too, but it's not exactly fun, is it. I enjoy looking at it, but do I really want to walk through the cinema screen into the battle at Helm's Deep? I think not. Escapism. Sure, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush give the ultimate performances in it. But lots of things about this movie worked for me. The set design, the special effects, the weather...and tiny little details that you wouldn't miss if they weren't there, but which added to the movie big time. If I had to list a favourite movie of all time, I used to say The Princess Bride, or the first Matrix or whatever mood I am in. But I've seen this one five times now and it still is not tedious, still fresh...and it's pretty much there. I'm not surprised people loved it. It's a fairy tale, and funny how things like them seem to last...
10.0~Unmissible onb161 Sign in Permalink A movie you just have too see over and over again. Brilliant performance by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, they both deserve an Oscar. The story line is quite simple, basically captain jack and will turner both pair up to save Elizabeth, but little does will know that jack use to be captain of the black pearl. They eventually settled there differences and travel to isla DE meurta to find Barbossa and his crew as they have held elizabeth captive to end there curse. but boy did they make a big mistake, they needed the blood of will turner the son of boostrap bill. 10 years ago barbossa and his crew left jack on an island and stole his ship, and he wants it back. It's a fun packed action film that will make everyone laugh, starring johnny depp, geoffrey rush, orlando bloom, and keira knightly. If they put as much effort into the second movie as they did with the first movie, i'm certain it will be a hit!
9.0~Not your ordinary pirate movie drsampath000 Sign in Permalink When one sees the cover of this, they might think, oh another bad pirate movie. But In pirates, the acting was good, the actors were good-looking, though Keira Knightley looks MUCH better with her hair down, the swordplay was realistic, the storyline was good, no plot holes. Disney went out of the PG section, which is good. This movie could be appreciated by all age groups, children will like the swordplay, older people will like the story. Don't get turned off because it is a Disney movie, it isn't too childish like too many of them are. They will be very successful if they step over the PG line more. I give it 9/10. Just hope the sequel doesn't mess up like too many sequels do.
10.0~johnny deep abhipatel_1312 Sign in Permalink Great Movie And johnny deep Is a well actor all time and p.o.t.c series is a great movies of all time. Comes close to recreating some of the bigger-than-life wonder that we experience at the movies in our childhood. Depp is a fey, hilarious wonder.Argh! This be an awesome movie! It's a fun adventure with plenty of humor, well done special effects, and great acting. Bummer that this is the only one that doesn't suck in the series. "The Curse of the Black Pearl" is not a flawless film; there are some plot points that don't add up. But it's very unique and makes good use with what the genre has to offer.Here -- in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high- seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural -- Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious.
8.0~That rare bird, a decent modern pirate movie. slimjack Sign in Permalink Pirate movies have fallen on hard times as of late. There hasn't been a decent one since the mid-fifties. Attempts to revive the genre have generated a series of expensive flops like Cutthroat Island and Roman Polanski's Pirates. Despite the dismal track every ten years or so there is yet another attempt to get it right. With the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl persistence is rewarded. Though not on a level with Captain Blood or The Crimson Pirate, Curse is still is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that successfully combines modern action with a traditional sea saga. The Black Pearl is a ship with a cursed crew doomed to an undead existence until they return all the Aztec gold they unwisely pilfered. After years of ghostly plundering they manage to gather all save for the one piece currently in the possession of the beautiful Elizabeth, the Royal Governor's daughter. Can her true love, the pirate hating blacksmith Will, keep her safe from the crew's boney clutches? Or does she need the help of the completely loony Captain Jack Sparrow? Sparrow is a hilarious addition to the Hollywood Pirate tradition. He is a seadog sure to strike terror into the hearts of the fiercest scallywag though not because of his dazzling swordplay. Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as if he has downed one too many grogs on the way to the gay pride parade. He flounces, weaves and mumbles his way about the Caribbean absolutely sure that he is the very model of a modern pirate captain. That his adversaries aren't as sure of his seafaring abilities as he is doesn't register in his hazy worldview. Depp's Belle of the Poop Deck routine works fabulously. He gives the movie a pixilated charm but if it's an old fashioned shiver-me-timbers pirate you want there is Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Rush `arrhs' it up for all he's worth and even makes you feel a little sorry for the murderous old sea dog. As Depp and Rush keep the glorious tradition of ham acting alive others in the cast are left struggling to keep up. While Orlando Bloom seems stogy as Will the insanely beautiful Keira Knightley is in no danger of being overshadowed. Her Elizabeth comes across as the most competent character in the movie. You get the feeling she could have sorted the plot out quicker without the blundering help of Sparrow and Will. The rest of the cast is filled with a great assortment of character actors who fill out their colorful parts nicely. In fact, it's safe to say it's the performers who make this movie despite the extensive special effects on display. Curse suffers from the usual modern summer blockbuster problems what with frenzied editing, sloppy plotting and a leaden approach to comic timing. Complicating matters is an out of control sound design. Background creaks, booms and clangs are blasted out of proportion and every footfall thumps like a brontosaurus tread. All this drowns out the actors so potentially funny lines are lost. Art direction is also problematic. For example, the skeletal crew is so stuffed with detail that between the quick cuts and frenzied pace they come across as a perambulating blob. A further drawback is the cinematography. For some reason the normally sunny Caribbean looks as bleak and cold as the North Atlantic. While all this is annoying it shouldn't stop you from seeing Curse. It's a charming movie filled with the sort of enjoyably preposterous performances you rarely see nowadays.
10.0~It is the best!!! - SPOILERS sabiqs_worlds Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies i have ever watched. First of all Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hilarious. If he hadn't been in this movie it probably wouldn't be as good. Secondly this move has a great storyline and lots of action with it. Although Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) becomes rather annoying in trying to win Elizabeth Swanns (Keira Knightley)heart by saving her. However I was happy that at the end Will Turner tried to help Jack Sparrow escape. Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) is awesome in this movie. Although he looks really old in real life he is really great in the Pirates of the Caribbean. Jack Sparrow is really great and hilarious in this movie. He adds a lot of excitment and is a great pirate same with Barbossa. This is with out doubt one of the best movies ever. I hope that the second one will be just as good.
10.0~william turner subway0000 Sign in Permalink so if the cursed ones can't die, then I guess william turner (will's dad, the pirate) was alive all ten years or so in "davue jones locker" wasn't he? maybe he escaped after all and he's alive - maybe for part 2! :D
7.0~An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie Quinoa1984 Sign in Permalink Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often. Curse tells of a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer, despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night, he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree). One thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people, and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating, it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqué. For instance, at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it), and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place, and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed, once again under the moonlight, and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies. The action scenes, however, are the weakest scenes of the film, which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay, but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse', the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness, but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-
10.0~"Welcome to the Caribbean, Love." potc_fan360 Sign in Permalink When my family first got this out, I thought it might be okay. It. Was. Brilliant. It's an interesting plot, but, as you can probably guess, it was Johnny Depp's slightly odd, Keith Richards-based, cunning Jack Sparrow ('scuse me, sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) who steals the show with his madness and classic one-liners. However, this does not mean that Depp was the only good member in the cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley work well together and Geoffrey Rush is his usual excellent and versatile self. Plus, the script was good. It was really nice to see a Pirate movie that's made for the modern-day audience, or even a modern pirate movie at all. I recommend you watch this; it really is a work of genius.
9.0~Easter Egg geragmx37 Sign in Permalink Don't forget to watch the final scene. If you are patient enough, wait until the credits are over and you will be rewarded with one final scene. I won't tell you anything about it, you have to see it for yourself. Like this one, there are many films that have inserted one extra piece of the story. Some times you have to expect the unexpected, a twist in the plot right in the final scene. Why directors include such easter eggs? Maybe they expect that a film-goer like you should see the entire movie, his whole piece of art. So, run to your video store o videoteque and place the VHS or DVD in your player and enjoy. Remember: the story is not over till it's over.
10.0~This film was awesome lauraclarke_1091 Sign in Permalink This film was the best film I have ever seen I was over the moon when I found out they were making another one!!! Johnny Depp,Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom were definitely the right people to choose to make this such a great film. The plot of the storyline is excellent but i am a bit worried that the next one will not be as good although i will still look forward to it and seeing all our favourite characters again whoa!!! The creators of this film were so lucky to have worked with such talented people. I just thought i would say that there is one mistake, near the beginning they tie Johhny Depps hand s together with iron bar thing but when he slides down the rope he puts his hands down the bar an in real life he would not be able to do that!!!
8.0~savvy? blanche-2 Sign in Permalink 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl boasts a large British cast, consisting of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightly, Jack Davenport, Orlando Bloom, and Jonathan Price. Impressive. Their acting is good. But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann, his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest. Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears, Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it, the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock. There are some great special effects, suspense, and humor in this overly long film, as well as some wonderful acting, but Johnny Depp steals the film. His hilarious Jack Sparrow, based on Keith Richard, is fantastic. He makes this a film a cut above the usual adventure film by giving such a quirky performance. As he would say, savvy?
9.0~You really can make a good movie about an amusement park attraction!! consultrandyb Sign in Permalink I don't want to reiterate all the other comments here, but I have to say one thing for Disney enthusiasts. If you are still thinking there is no way that they could make this movie-connect it with the amusement park attraction, and have it be compelling, you are absolutely wrong and are missing a real joy. Some other comments here have touched on some of the connections but they have by no means done justice. If you are a real fan of the amusement park attraction and have paid close attention you will not only recognize scenes but will be amazed by the incredibly similarities of makeup and dialog. To think that someone was able to write a screenplay that accomplished this and the director was able to reproduce these few seconds so well and still make a compelling movie is amazing to me. If you are a Disney nut and haven't seen this film do it today!!!!!
5.0~And this made over 300 Mio. US$ at the Box Office? Luigi Di Pilla Sign in Permalink I expected more and I am disappointed. I mean there could have been more suspense elements cause sometimes it was boring and too long. They could cut at least 30 minutes. I have to admit that the special effects and the picture were great. It is not a must see and I would recommend it to teenies. I won`t see the sequel. Watch instead "The Ring" from the same director which I really enjoyed. My wife and I vote not more than 5/10. Just average. On IMDb too overrated. I still cannot believe that this made over 300 Mio. US$ at the box office. I hope Hollywood will create more precious pearls than this black pearl.
10.0~Best movie ever goofy_gurl_48 Sign in Permalink I think this movie is the best movie ever. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were awesome in this movie. Geoffry Rush and Keira Knightly were also very good in this movie. I recommend this movie to a Johnny Depp fan or a person who loves any type of movie. Because this is the movie for you!! I loved this movie so much I went out and bought it. If you are a Johnny Depp lover I also suggest to watch: The Ninth Gate, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Secret Movie. If you have any other good Johnny Depp movies please e-mail me at goofy_gurl_48@msn.com. Can't wait for Pirates 2 to come out. I want to see that so bad. It is the most wanted sequel of the year.
6.0~Ahoy Hokum susanxx Sign in Permalink One for the kids as this is certainly not adult fodder. The special effects are excellent, the story is weak and Johnny Depps accent is something to ponder over. Seriously overlong in running time even the kids would get bored before too long.
10.0~A Great Action Movie! Jonas_fan11 Sign in Permalink This is an excellent movie, I especially like all of the action and adventure! All of the actors and actresses are amazing! They really got into their acting and tried really hard, and it definitely shows! After I saw this movie I have been addicted to the Pirates of the Caribbean movie series! There are a lot of sword fights and if you totally and completely hate action and or adventure please don't see this movie, but if you like action and adventure even the tiniest bit, you will love this movie! After I saw this movie I wanted to see the second so badly! This is a totally stupendous movie, I most definitely want you to see this as soon as possible!!
9.0~follow Capt Jack Sparrow in his search for the Black Pearl psinyde Sign in Permalink a Disney work of art! if Disney ever did make a good movie [not animation], then this is it! Casting Johnny Depp was the smartest move they've made yet. Follow Captain Jack Sparrow as he searches for his lost ship, The Black Pearl, which he lost to mutiny. On his way, he finds a young swordsmith - Will Turner, who is in love with a young lady [the governor's daughter], who becomes prisoner on the now cursed Black Pearl under it's new captain, Barbossa. The special effects are amazing, the acting is superb, and the sets and costumes are wonders. Disney obviously rolled out the big bucks to make this movie a big hit! Interresting and fun enough for adults, great for kids.
10.0~Excellent directing and casting. AmyJay666 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is one of the best motion pictures I have seen. Every single section and production team of this film excels as the film is brought together. This film is perfect when showing how diverse a role Depp can play. With the amazing accent and crazy actions it truly does show his imagination and how much effort he can put into a role. Also, the supporting actors, Kiera Knigtley, Orlando Bloom and Geoffry Rush make this film excel in its genre. With the perfect amount of action, comedy and romance - perfect camera angles, stunts and special effects this certainly is Gore Verbinski at his best.
3.0~Just bad TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews Sign in Permalink When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting to see a movie that was decent at best. I was very surprised to find how unbelievably bad it was. The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10
8.0~A pirate film that inludes everything that it needs. kevve@mail.be Sign in Permalink Normally, pirate movies aren't my favorite because of the tremendously special effects. But this movie has it all: the special effects are great, good humor, a beautifull girl, nice story and last but not least an amazing act as pirate by Johnny Depp. I already had big expectations of the acting from J. Depp after seeing Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but still it was a pleasant surprise. I realy enjoyed this movie from the beginning till the end.
10.0~Disney Plagues for Further Films davorinlonac Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a brilliant film, being filled with action, adventure, scares and comedy. Johnny Depp plays "Captain" Jack Sparrow as one of his most loved roles. The story line is cool and tells us of some things that happened before the actual events that take place in this film. In my opinion there should be a prequel trilogy to teach us more of what really happened in the Caribbean so many years ago. Anyway this film is just so fun to watch but you really can't get your hopes up with the sequels. When the appalling fourth installment was viewed by myself I really found it stupider than the rest and just lacked in all details this film perfected. A fifth installment is scheduled for 2016 and will go by the name: Dead Men Tell No Tales. That title was rumored also to be the title of the fourth film but indeed it wasn't. With this upcoming sequel, I hope it is much like this and can retain balance to this film franchise. Thee only bad thing about this film is that it plagued all further Disney live action films, it sets too good of an example for other films to beat, The Lone Ranger for instance. Anyway this is Davorin Lonac wishing you farewell and if you enjoyed this review please check out my other ones for more fun...
7.0~COULD AND SHOULD BE BETTER... matija-trost Sign in Permalink ...judging by high ratings on Imdb. But still watchable enough that 2,5 hours goes by pretty fast. On the other hand, this movie will soon be forgotten, why? Well, for the story itself, i believe. It provides already seen stuff: a love story (a terrible part of the movie, since you can't feel any chemistry between Will (lousy play by Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (a mediocre play by Keira Knightley), pirate duels (some of them way too long) and a simple story (meant for kids and not so intelligent adults), without any twists. On the other hand, there's Johnny Depp, which is the main star, what he proves by great acting. With a slightly more capable director and screenwriters which could change the script and made it in a love story with Jack & Elizabeth (heh, like in Beauty & Beast), this movie will certainly gain some points with more demanding viewers and become a classic romance movie. Too bad, since the sound part is also great. Since it's not a classic, but somewhat between, only (but still good) 7 out of 10.
10.0~Ahoy mateys, this be one cool movie! lee_eisenberg Sign in Permalink Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! That's what I feel like having watched "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"! I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too. It all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage. Enter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. "POTC: TCOTBP" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus "Mouse Hunt" and "The Ring" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me...
8.0~Depp and Rush shine Polaris_DiB Sign in Permalink Everybody likes pirates! (Well, not the music industry, but whatever...) Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him. Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son. It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares. Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie. His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable. His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him. Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed. Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them. Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well. Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp. It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments. Very quotable, stuff like, "Where's the rum?" which is bound to stay in fanboy lingo for ages to come. --PolarisDiB
10.0~Madness that way lies, matey, aharr Jim lad etc. HarvSurf Sign in Permalink This is the kind of movie we should be telling Hollywood to make. Yes, it has big names in it. But they're also proper actors, not celebrity gurners (Willis) or a famous ass with celebrity baggage (J.Lo). Putting real actors at the heart of a daft summer flick like this results in the creation of uniquely appealing characters like Capn' Jack Sparrow. Yes, it's got a huge budget and superb special effects. But they're there to serve the story and blend seamlessly with the action - not to replace story or character. (Are you listening, Wachowskis? Anyone care to greenlight LXG II? Thought not.) Proof that there's life in the House of Mouse yet... Good gags, good characters, a few nasty shocks for the kiddies, and no bloody Phil Collins songs. Uncle Walt would be proud.
8.0~The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl jboothmillard Sign in Permalink Based on a really popular attraction at the Disney theme parks in Paris and Florida, this is a really good film from director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring). A long while ago, a ship crew found a young boy floating in the ocean, he later became a blacksmith. By the way, when he was found as a kid, the young daughter of the ship to a necklace he was wearing with a piece of Aztec gold. Now years on Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) the blacksmith one day meets the man who knows about the gold, and the pirates that seek it. Jack Sparrow (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp) and Will are now on the trail of these pirates when they kidnap the daughter (with the gold), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). The pirates are on the so-called cursed ship called The Black Pearl, lead by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Basically they want the piece of gold because it is the last one they need to lift a curse off them. Also starring Jack Davenport as Norrington, Jonathan Pryce as Governor Weatherby Swann, The Office's Mackenzie Crook as Ragetti and Lee Arenberg as Pintel. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Makeup, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best Sound. Johnny Depp was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Orlando Bloom was number 17 (with Viggo Mortensen), and Depp number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Depp was number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Bloom was number 5 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Keira Knightley was number 9 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!
10.0~terrific movie, worth watching!!!! marcs_babydoll_44 Sign in Permalink this movie in definitely one of my favorites. i have watched it over and over again and the plot never bores me.if you are looking for a worthwhile movies to rent out for the night or even to buy then this is the movie to choose. the acting in this movie is extraordinary. the only down fall is that i watched it and i thought it maybe should have been rated MA because there was quite a bit of violence. apart from that it is still one of my favorite movies of all time. johnny depp is absolutely amazing in this movie and i have never seen anyone act drunk as well as he does. he pulls off the pirate character perfectly. orlando bloom and keira knightley are amazing in it to and orlando is an absolute heartthrob and will get you watching it time and time again!
10.0~Refreshing Crystal-Allyn Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was an excellent movie for the family and especially young boys. There are hardly any movies that families can enjoy...things like Lizzy McGuire and Freaky Friday are directed toward teenage girls - Pirates of the Caribbean can be enjoyed by male or female and people of all ages. POTC has everything a good movie should have: action, fighting, pirates, unspoken love. The story was intriguing and so were the characters (Jack Sparrow in particular)... I would be interested to see if the sequel will live up to it's predecessor - most of the time sequels are rather mediocre. The cast is great. Orlando Bloom has a lot of talent and it's nice to see him making a name for himself, and it was wonderful to see Johnny Depp introduced to a new generation - he is finally getting the recognition he deserves.
4.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl desertdweller Sign in Permalink POTC: TCOTHBP was occasionally interesting. What can one expect, the movie is based on a ride? Keira Knightley fills well the lovely young woman role. Johnny Depp is occasionally hilarious and interesting. What largely lacks for POTC is the story (hey, I understand, the ride was supported by effects and posing too, but it is only a few minutes long) and... well... the male second. While one can certainly understand Orlando Bloom's Will Turner's interest in Keira Knightley's Elizabeth, one can't, however, understand the reciprocation. I understand actors' withering beside Johnny Depp's irresistible, on-screen energy and force of personality, but poor Orlando Bloom nearly puddles beneath the glare. For LOTR all he had to do is stretch his neck and furrow his brow and that, beneath his lovely, light locks is what we needed from him there. Unfortunately for us, it seems that producers haven't yet realized that is all he can do. Geoffrey Rush ranged from over-the-top (which worked) to occasional attempts at being a sympathetic character (which didn't). There are some decent moments of entertainment including some laugh-out-loud funny lines involving Captain Jack Black. But this is not a keeper -- at most, a renter, preferably a borrower.
1.0~The worst film of all time Markus_Ruby Sign in Permalink It's so bad, i'm not even going to bother wasting any time on this. Suffice to say, the dialogue is forgettable, Johnny Depp acts drunk for 2 hours+ and he got an Oscar nomination????? Orlando bloom is flat and monotonous, and keira is just the eye candy. Plus, the movie does'nt seem to end, EVER!!!! It just goes on and on being smug and thinking it's funny. I guarantee people will look back on this film in a few years saying "what the hell was i thinking?" If you are over the age of 21 than there are good odds that you will not, i repeat WILL NOT enjoy this film. When i heard of POTC, i was expecting something witty, adventurous, surprising, romantic, exciting and full of great characters. Something along the lines of The Princess Bride but with a huge budget. But, instead we got this twaddle. A film that did well in America but comparative poorly everywhere else. I've learnt my lesson now. I'm not going to watch a film if it is doing well in America and just okay everywhere else. Don't get me wrong, i love America, but sometimes i have to wonder at the intellect of it's youth! (meet the fockers made $277m in America and only $113 in the rest of the world. Need i say more?) Another thing i will do before i go and see a film is look it up on IMDb and see who the writers are and who the directors are. If you don't like their previous work, you probably won't like their new film. What has happened to Hollywood. It seems to me that 1999 was the last great year of Hollywood with original ground breaking movies like The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile, Toy Story 2 etc. But i guess, now with dvds, Hollywood producers know that if a movie sucks at the box office, it will find an audience on DVD and eventually make it's money back. I guess thats why they'll give the go ahead with any movie idea these days. I just heard that they wanted to make POTC back in the 1990's, but the script was rejected. 95% of the movies i've seen in the last five years i hate. I officially hate Hollywood!!!
9.0~Great Movie westonfreaky Sign in Permalink This was one of the best movie that I have ever seen! I didn't see this film at the cinema, but I really wish I had because it has instantly become one of my favorite movies of all time. I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humor. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing "Yo ho, ho ho" for days and days to come. A "pirate's life" is plenty the life in "Pirates of the Caribbean", an worthy, intelligent sea-faring adventure guaranteed to leave you, at the very least, plenty satisfied.
7.0~Awesome _ Depp! hallywall10 Sign in Permalink And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney "adventure" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect? And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience... I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen "Pirates" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, "Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?" And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?
10.0~Should have remained a single film wolfbeem Sign in Permalink Pirates is an instant classic and will be remembered for generations to come, assuming that the poor reputation of the sequel does not overshadow its wit and brilliance. The first story is a pop-up book adventure with cartoon-like monsters and a villain whom we all have loved to hate. The film stands on its own, and Johnny Depp brings to life the lovable pirate Jack Sparrow, who exhibits questionable loyalty and hilarious wit. I hope and pray, as a serious fan of the film, that the fine reputation of this excellent film will not be soiled by the sequel, which was apparently slopped together to entertain vid-head teenage boys. Evidently, the writers did not realize that the film's appeal was in its deep and evolving character relationships, not its special effects, and making everything bigger and more revolting was not the key factor in a successful sequel. I for one, among many I'm sure, have been harshly disappointed after three years of tense anticipation for the story of lovable Jack Sparrow and his companions.
3.0~Overrated Alex_Glass Sign in Permalink Could their be a more over-rated film this year. While okay in part, I think the main reason behind it's success is the fact that some people take a liking to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. It has problems classifying what type of film it is. Not enough action to be a action film. Not enough laughs to be a comedy. It has also been put up for major awards, yet it is clearly a blockbuster. 'Its both of these,' you may say. That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles. A plot that i could predict in my sleep and a boring script prevent it from being good. What could have been a great 90 minute blockbuster has been stretched to 2 and a half hours on a plot that cannot manage it. *1/2 out of **** p.s. It has been hyped up recently. If you have'nt seen it yet, don't.
7.0~PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN (DIDIER BECU) Didier-Becu Sign in Permalink I am really a sucker if it comes to oldfashioned adventuremovies that's why I like Indiana Jones so much and it's a delight to see that in 2003 a piratemovie has been made just like those with Burt Lancaster. Nothing changed, pirates still drink and they're still smarter than the Marine but this is a perfect movie if you wanna enjoy yourself with some Hollywoodnonsense. And really...the performance of Johnny Depp is splendid!!!
7.0~Errol Flynn must be spinning over this one helpless_dancer Sign in Permalink So different from your usual pirate film; really puts it to all the robber of the seas pictures from the past. Still it is not what I would call a terrific film or a masterful comedy. Entertaining yet sluggish in spots and simply too long. Depp shone as the strange, so unlike Long John Silver, pirate from Hell. Kids oughta love it.
8.0~It's hard to not like this. nathanielderyckwilson Sign in Permalink It's hard to imagine a better movie for watching when all the family is round. This swell throwback to the swashbuckling genre manages to hit all the right notes and still be so au courant. They realize this sense of a different time and place with such expertize and vividness, you believe you're in a new world of vintage adventure and peril. It makes the rather daring move to add a supernatural antagonist but the judgement is just right. The use of good humour from all characters but especially the inimitable Captain Jack is a rare treat in adventure comedy where everyone's chemistry with everyone else is impeccable. Thrilling, captivating, funny and also pretty terrifying in fits in starts this will make you fall back in love with blockbusters. The sequels kind of wrung out the charm but the first one is a masterpiece of easy to watch, satisfying adventure.
1.0~why's this film rated so good ??? Jamie_Seaton Sign in Permalink as you can see I've not rated this film bad because there is a few qualities about it such as Johnny Depps acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow is quite comical and the graphics were good too. there was a lot of floors to the film too, a lot of cheesy bad acting is the worst. i just hated some things about it. its well overrated too, to be rated 8.0 on IMDb is a very lucky achievement for this. Orlando Bloom as Will Hunting and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan are also among the cast and do a fairly good job. i do think Johnny Depps acting in this clouds over the other actors, he has done a very good job of this. the action and graphics have a big part to play in this almost epic feature. overall this film does deserve a watch but has been well overrated.... a good thing about the film is that there isn't really anything like this film around. was a good watch.......... 6/10......... j.d Seaton
10.0~This is what movies should be like!!! drobedeau Sign in Permalink Watching this movie was the most pleasant surprise that I've had in a movie theatre since I was dating... this movie reminded me so much of years gone by when movie making was based on great stories as well as great character development and excellent acting...these days, movie makers rely so much on special effects to cover the incredible shortcomings of modern day storytelling and talent... Mr. Depp and the others were perfect for their roles... and, even though the special effects were spectacular, they didn't seem to be the reason for the movie... other motion pictures of late seem to be made just because some guy sitting at his computer can do something amazing and have it look fairly real, to which they then build a story around... the effects in Pirates simply added to the movie... and the references to the Pirates amusement ride made the whole experience even more fun... I wish that more movies were like this one but, alas, after seeing the latest movie trailers, I'm saddened by the lack of talent that hits the silver screen
10.0~A most Excellent Movie so professional DMcIntyre Sign in Permalink This is a must see movie Johnny Depp & Co deliver the most entertaining film I think I've ever watched. From the Actors to the Producer, Director, Extras, Sound, Music, Costumes and special effects it is brilliant a film to watch again and again I cannot wait for the sequel in 2005. The Ultimate feel good Movie with a little Horror, Excitement and Swashbuckling thrown in.
5.0~While not accursed, this film is definitely no pearl dkiltz Sign in Permalink I'm surprised about the great rating this movie got. It's basically just stereotype and rumination of old themes. It's done in an ok way but there's nothing really special. The effects were up to date as one would expect. And yes, Johnny Depp is a very good actor. But was this movie witty, inventive, creative or... pensive? None. To make it a good movie it should have had some of these qualities. Once the curse is revealed the plot drags on lengthily. Yes, you know right from the start who is at the bottom of it (after all, you don't cast J. D. for nothing). And yes, the 'love' story with the two youngsters and the evil Brit (the villain is British, how new! yawn) is genuinely disingenuous. Don't get me wrong, I always enjoy love stories, this one too, and a young'un that fights for his love is always engaging. But they would have done the actors more justice if they'd missed out on some clichés. I wouldn't watch it twice. As a friend of mine put it 'it's a silly movie'. Come to think of it, I think that's a compliment.
7.0~Good film geraldcoffey Sign in Permalink I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'. That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future. Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.
9.0~Vintage pirates with a modern twist shonkored Sign in Permalink Many look back in time and see pirates as tavern burning pillagers. Where others see sea shanties and wonder. The Black Pearl, a ship not all are familiar with. The Queen ans Revenge or the Dauntless are particular vessels which struck fear into the hearts of sailors worldwide. This film captures the best of both worlds, each line delivered is another towards capturing your inner pirate and set sail across Babinski's world of jolly bloody pirates! On the side I will say the casting could have had some more consideration. I feel each member of this cast are great actors. But some do not suit their roles. I may not be the only one but, I feel casting directors care less about the authenticity of their choices. Do not cast a part if all you are buying is the fans who will follow regardless.
10.0~Johnny Depp as we've never seen him before! gufiboss Sign in Permalink Arrr matey, it's about time these landlubbers made a good old-fashioned pirate movie! I for one felt the need for this kind of action and in my opinion, this movie is brilliant. Just the breath of fresh air you need after the usual gore fest in movies today. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a great achievement, successful in being both fun and thrilling at the same time. It's the kind of movie that you either love or hate, but for a fan of the genre, it's a true blessing and a must see. I haven't been so excited about a movie in a long time and I believe that we need more movies like it, because it appeals a lot to the kid inside everyone. We've all imagined ourselves sailing the seven seas, sword fighting with anyone that comes in our way. "The curse of the Black Pearl" really fires up your imagination and the special effects add to the great feeling of reality the movie gives you, as it takes you into a world long forgotten. Johnny Depp surprises with his role as a pirate captain and is probably one of the last actors you would expect to play such a part. Nevertheless, his performance is outstanding and I can't remember him being so witty in any other role he's played. In conclusion this is a movie you can really enjoy and something the movie industry forgot about, that certain something that makes the seventh art so great: a fun adventure. You'll feel like you're 12 again! I certainly hope there will be a sequel.
9.0~Pirate. thesar-2 Sign in Permalink This movie will always hold a special place in my heart. Way back in 2003, while on an island (San Juan Island, WA to be exact,) my then- boyfriend and I checked out the only movie theatre on the isle. Personally, I didn't want to see Pirates of the Caribbean, but it was either that or Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde since the movie theatre only had two screens. And while I saw part one of that, I was even less interested in seeing that. So, with only two screens, two choices, we opted for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Now, this movie had been out for awhile, and everyone raved about it. Still, even with the draw of both Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, as well as the vast positive feedback, I was hesitant going in. BOYwas I wrong. This movie grabbed me from minute one and never let loose. From the incredible score to the excellent special effects – that STILL hold up today in 2015 to the fantastic characters, this proved to be an instant classic. (To clarify, 12 years later, that statement holds true.) It was extreme adventure, with plenty of action, humor and perfect blend of gray areas for the good/bad guys. Now, the follow-ups, including the 2 that completed the "trilogy" and the stand alone featureI implore you: DON'T WATCH THEM. I've currently seen this original 3-4x, but the subsequent ones, one time apiece and pretty much despised them. They were FAR TOO LONG and clunky. Granted, Captain Jack Sparrow is a once in a lifetime character, but he should only be enjoyed in small doses, such as this original chapter. The lines were hilarious, the cast/characters great on their own and the action was exciting. The Disneyland ride happens to be my favorite exhibit at Disneyland (even before the movie,) and they took that, plus the awesome Yo-Ho! song to lengths that couldn't be achieved in lesser hands. Again, avoid the sequels and buy this fantastic adventure. It seriously can be stand-alone, and should've. * * * Final thoughts: Of all of our memories together, Justin, this always stands out. Despite not being one of the biggest events in our time together, the time we went to this small, 2-screen, island duplex, will forever be etched into my memory. Thank you for opening my mind to this film and experience.
5.0~Great poster, lousy movie preppy-3 Sign in Permalink To tell you the truth I can't remember much about the plot--and I just saw it last night! Something about a cursed pirate ship and its crew and how they all turn to skeletons when moonlight hits them and how they need some coins or something to release the curse...I was so bored during this film my mind kept wandering. Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that. This film has some major problems--it's way too long (half an hour could have been cut out easily); the story is (needlessly) convoluted and very badly done (I'm blaming the screenwriters and director, NOT the actors); despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull; there's loads of casual violence; leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me. There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back again--but it's too little too late. The direction is WAY off too--he seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing. I can't fault the actors--Orlando Bloom (very handsome with beautiful black eyes) is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worse--she's just "the girl" in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief. Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie. His performance is so off-beat and funny he keeps the film afloat. Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines. So...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction, ridiculous length and many many boring stretches. Unless you're a huge fan of pirate movies you can skip this one.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean is amazing! pennywisegirl Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is an amazing movie. Johnny Depp does an excellent job playing Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp is hilarious! The movie kept my attention the entire time and that is very hard to do. This is a movie that everyone can enjoy. It was very well done. I give it an A+
10.0~Another movie that 10 out of 10 doesn't begin to do justice!! Sean68 Sign in Permalink What a fantastic film. truly a stroke of genius for Disney. i must have seen this over 100 times, most of my friends and myself are constantly quoting it. Johnny Depp totally steals the film as Captain Jack Sparrow and this role has truly cemented him as one of my 4 favourite living actors. (the other 3 being Keannu Reeves, Nicolas Cage and Clint Eastwood). There isn't a weak character or a poorly played part in the film. The bit where Jack Sparrow is running and being shot at and is trying to bat the bullets out the way with the palm of his hand makes me cry with laughter every time i watch it. Geoffrey Rush is deeply inspired as Barbossa and Kiera Knightley is one of the brightest English roses around. A must see for any movie fan who wants a good story, good acting and a few good laughs along the way!
7.0~It's a fascinating and amusing pirates film with a lot of fun ma-cortes Sign in Permalink The movie deals with a curse on pirates , then they abduct the starring named Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) with the aim she free them of a damned spell. But she's helped by a likable pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a rush blacksmith (Orlando Bloom). They will have to confront a nasty villain (Geoffrey Rush) and his henchmen. The motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , humor , love and results to be enough bemusing. The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining. The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , also to Ray Harryhausen and his picture ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ regarding the living skeletons . First-rate interpretation by Johnny Depp ,he plays like a ¨drag queen¨ and Robert Newton in the film titled 'Blackbeard'. Having decided that pirates were the eighteenth century equivalent of rock stars, Johnny Depp's characterization of Sparrow was inspired by close observation of his friend Keith Richards from Rolling Stones , though he emphasized in interviews that it was not an impersonation. Kiera Knightley is beautiful but lacks her experience who proved in his following hits , becoming a first star . Kiera was only eighteen years old when this movie came out. Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine) is excellent but overacting , at times . Colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer . Klaus Badlet's music as well as direction by Gore Verbinsky is riveting . It's followed by two sequels : ¨Dead man's chest¨ and ¨At world's end¨ with similar actors and technicians .The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is the tenth highest grossing franchise ever. Rating: 6,5/10 . Good.
10.0~I luved it! Chocaholic913 Sign in Permalink Hehe! PIRATES ROCK!! I luved it. Who knew Disney could do such a great job on a movie based on a ride?? Johnny Depp and Orli were awesome, and i am sooooo jealous of Kiera. Hehe. ANYHOO... This was an awesome movie! YAH!!
9.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl shows that protecting those you love gives you the courage to overcome the things that can cause one to be frightened woods-99320 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the story of how Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) work together to rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the undead pirates that sail on the Black Pearl. Elizabeth is taken from her home when a group of pirates invades the town. She is taken to Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) after she invokes the right of parley. She wears a pirate's medallion that is linked to the curse placed on the crew of the Black Pearl after they stole the Aztec treasure. The medallion is the final piece of treasure, and they only need her blood to break the curse. However, she has taken this medallion from Will when he was a young boy, and it is his blood that they need. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl shows that protecting those you love gives you the courage to overcome the things that can cause one to be frightened. Nothing can stop a person from trying to protect someone they love. Will Turner is in love with Elizabeth and finds a way to rescue her from the pirates that took her. He was unable to get help from the Navy and the man that wishes to marry Elizabeth, so he breaks Jack out of the cell he was held in, and they work together to find the pirates and Elizabeth. I believe the central insight of the film is doing what has to be done for those you love. This theme is shown throughout the movie as Will finds Elizabeth and tells Barbossa that he is the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner and offers to trade his life for the release of Elizabeth. She returns the love of Will and makes a plan to burn all of the rum on the island she and Jack are stranded on. Her father and Commodore Norrington see the fire and rescue them. Elizabeth convinces them to look for Will. She realizes that she is in love with Will, and her father sees this as well. Throughout the film, the motif was used that showed Will had a love interest in Elizabeth. He would always call her Ms. Swann even though every time she told him to call her Elizabeth. Jack also pointed out that Will already had a love interest, and that was why he practiced so much with the swords that he made. The lighting used when Will and Elizabeth are together is also brighter and shows more connection between the two. The love that grew between Will and Elizabeth lead to them being able to save each other from the undead pirates that were looking for the last golden medallion. They were able to overcome the difficult obstacles that the pirates put in front of them and were able to use their love and passion to get others along the way to help them.
10.0~Honestly One Of the Best Movies I've Seen In A Long Time tracyluvsya Sign in Permalink If Johnny Depp does not win an award for this movie, then hell has frozen over. The superb acting, the clever comebacks, the wittiness, and, of course, the heart throbs make this the best movie of the year. I've seen the movie over 10 times, and can't wait for my 11th. If the whole cast isn't back for Pirates 2, I will be sorely disappointed.
10.0~Best movie this summer Sisiutil Sign in Permalink WOW. It's not often I watch a whole movie with a smile on my face, but I did with this one. It was a delight from start to finish, and I can't think of anything bad to say about it aside from the fact that it bugs me that Jerry Bruckheimer actually produced something I liked. Here's the top ten things I loved about this movie: 1) Johnny Depp. A simply amazing, scene-stealing, MOVIE-stealing performance. Pure genius. 2) Restrained use of CGI. It was thrilling to see REAL PEOPLE swinging from the ropes on those ships. And the CGI is effectively employed when it is used, especially during the underwater march of the cursed pirates. 3) Johnny Depp. 4) A great cast. Orlando Bloom doing an amazing impression of a young Errol Flynn and holding his own in scenes with Depp. I look forward to watching this guy's career. Geoffrey Rush doing a great job as the villain and making him almost as fascinating as Depp's Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly as a beautiful, smart, believably spunky heroine. Can't wait to see more of her! Uh, I mean, in other movies. Acting. That's what I meant. What did you think I meant? Get your mind out of the gutter. Oh, and Johnny Depp is great, too! 5) Everything you'd expect in a pirate movie, including a talking parrot, a monkey, Spanish gold, a ship battle, a young hero of uncertain lineage, the governor's daughter, walking the plank, "Avast!", "Davey Jones' Locker", hats with big feathers in them...and yet it NEVER seems cliched. 6) Johnny Depp. 7) The exhilarating music. 8) A movie without one use of the F-word, not to mention a restrained amount of swearing since this IS a pirate movie. Oh, and no nudity or car chases or buildings exploding. It is summer, isn't it? 9) Amazing fight sequences; the early, acrobatic sword fight between Depp and Bloom, and the ship battle, were stand-outs. 10) Oh, yeah, and Johnny Depp is great! Did I mention that? I'm a big fan of the two recent Mummy films, and I think this one falls into that category of enormously fun, endlessly entertaining adventure flicks. There's nothing profound here, but hey, it's summer, and this movie is great fun. This is one of the few times in my life when I've said this, but God, I hope they do a sequel! 9/10
9.0~Yo Ho! Great! spider_webster Sign in Permalink This movie is really an action-packed one. Johnny Depp plays the infamous Jack Sparrow, a pirate-gone-mad and is about the help Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue the damsel in distress, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his group of also-cursed pirates. Jack also wants to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from Barbossa's hands. It seems simple enough, but when you put it all together, plus CGI and a group of good actors, you'll get a surprise at this! It might sound like any other boring pirate movie where they try to pillage and plunder and save the girl and stuff, but it's not. Johnny Depp really puts his heart into playing Jack Sparrow and is really good at the bad-yet-has-a-heart kinda character. His acting is what makes the audience laugh and leave the theatre content to have seen Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom's acting was a little off but he's young and is up and coming. I personally preferred him playing Legolas in LOTR. Keira Knightley is also another with off-putting acting, but at that time, she was only a rising star, so you can't blame. Geoffrey Rush was well, a cursed pirate so there's not much to say about him. Just that he's good with his roles. Overall, I think what impressed me most was the CGI and the storyline, because the acting was a little bleak. I would've given it a ten but I figured maybe it could use a bit of work. So it's a 9/10
10.0~Johnny Depp rules! thechosen1 Sign in Permalink Why on earth hasn't Johnny Depp got an Oscar yet???? Even if he doesn't do a movie in a whole year, they should just give him one for being a darn good actor. Darn great actor, infact! This movie was an adventure. One that you could go on again and again and again. Every aspect of the movie was extremely entertaining. As soon as Johnny Depp enters, you know that there's gonna be a hell of a performance. And there was. That guy can play anything and I really wouldn't mind if he played a pirate for the rest of his life! His ability to put on almost any accent for any role is absolutely amazing. He doesn't slip up even for a second. Orlando Bloom looked really good, Keira Knightley looked really pretty and this role suited her well. Geoffrey Rush was amazing, as always. The direction was excellent and the dialogues were hilarious. Very highly recommended! *****/*****
8.0~Wind in Yer Sails, Me Hearties bfreilly Sign in Permalink When I first heard about this film, I have to say I felt underwhelmed. Another movie based off of a Disney ride, oh what fun! Despite the presence of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom giving "Pirates" a little star credibility, I believed that this movie would be sunk* at the box office. However, after I saw it, I had a complete change of heart. It was as funny and as exciting as most of my friends had avowed. "Pirates" is a light-hearted action filled romp, perfect for idling away an afternoon. Certainly, some of the acting was a little over the top (i.e., Depp and Rush), but that seems fitting for this movie. I am now eagerly awaiting "Dead Man's Chest" and hoping that it will live up to the standard that its predecessor set. *I apologize sincerely for this terrible pun. I couldn't help myself.
9.0~B+/A-... Savvy? jenwrks Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, that girl, and that guy, and a monkey. Now, before beginning this review, I'd like to point out that this is a Disney movie - yes, the same people who brought us Finding Nemo and Pocahontas. Indeed. So I figured it could go either way, but would probably get bad reviews and bomb at the box office. Imagine my surprise then, when I arrived at the movie theatre and the movie was sold out for the 6:25 show. Who goes to see a movie on a Wednesday night?? So I bought my ticket for the 6:55 show and sat in the theatre for forever, waiting excitedly for the film to begin. Johnny Depp is hot. Seriously. Big hottie. Especially when you add eye makeup, cool hair, a good outfit, an excellent accent and a cool hat. Plus, he was crazy. As evident in Fear and Loathing, he plays crazy pretty well. The CGI in the film was very good as well - people turning into skeletons and all. Well done. I'm not an Orlando Bloom fan really, seeing as I didn't see either of the Lord of the Rings. So I didn't know what to expect from him, but luckily his role was monstrously overshadowed by Depp. The chick in this movie, whatever her name is, wasn't as good. Her accent needed a little work, she made horrible facial expressions, and it seems as though she got all the crappy lines. The plot was classic Disney - one twist towards the end that would shock the hell out of little kids, and they spelled out the entire plot for you as it happens. Sometimes that's good, when.. say.. you're too busy drooling over Johnny Depp to pay attention.. but still. You have to take that with a grain of salt (why isn't it pepper?) because it's Disney. Okay. So overall I'd give the movie.. well.. a B+/A-.. it wasn't amazing, but it *was* hilarious, and there were good fight scenes and good cgi and it wasn't boring, and very very good Johnny Depp. I think it's one of my favorite movies for him (of course, I haven't seen him in many movies I actually like - he favors scripts that make me drowsy just hearing the titles), so that's my final answer. B+/A-. Savvy?
1.0~The worst movie I saw in years; beats King Arthur. ka-ef-1 Sign in Permalink Simply said: no plot at all. What's happening? Depp is ridiculous in his acting. Anyone calling this humor, should think better. Full of improbabilities. The movie jumps from one topic to the next without any logical sequence. The characters are not properly developed. Keira is excellent, but cannot save this non-product. You expect a pirate movie - not necessarily full of romance, but this film lacks any trace of it. For instance: if you don't love Norrington, who then do you really love? A writer could do better than this. The movie is definitely not based on Disney's P. of the C. Anyone doubting that should go and visit the Real Pirates at Disneyland. I saw some bad movies, but this one beats a lot of them.
10.0~I love pirates moylank Sign in Permalink It's great to see a pirate movie again, especially SUCH a good one. I love the old pirate movies (Captain Blood, one about Jean Lafette(sp)). But they went out of fashion with fluff movies like Cutthroat Island. Pirates is a comedy and has ghosts but it's got something that makes all that ok. And I don't mean just cute stars either, but Orlando and johnny aren't hard on the eyes! Also, Disney seems to have done some research since making Pocahontas, the ship in that cartoon was rigged so badly that a blind folded 5 year old could have done better. Hopefully the sequel will be well-thought out and not just an attempt to make money off the name.

7.0~Excellent, if overlong, action film driven by Depp and Rush Hancock_the_Superb Sign in Permalink In Bermuda circa 1700, Port Royal comes under attack from a gang of vicious pirates led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). During the attack, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the feisty young daughter of the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), is kidnapped by the pirates. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith (and pirate's son) who is in love with Elizabeth, enlists the help of shifty pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), whose ship, "The Black Pearl", had been lost to Barbossa during a mutiny. However, Barbossa's men are no longer mere pirates - instead, they have been transformed into undead zombie pirates who need the blood of Will (or, so they think, Elizabeth) to break the curse. The main reason why "Pirates of the Caribbean" was so popular is simple. Take away Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, the action, the effects, everything - even Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush - and consider the simple fact that no one expected this film to be any good. It was based on a Disney theme park ride (a formula that had been unsuccessful before, see "The Country Bears") and had, to be frank, a ridiculous plot. This movie seemed likely to die a quick death at the box office, get torn apart by critics, and be forgotten. However, the film went on to be an astonishing box-office hit and pop culture phenomenon. In the aftermath of the mediocre sequel it's easy to forget how refreshing the movie seemed when it first came out - full of rousing action, great special effects, stirring music, a wonderfully written script, and of course brilliantly over-the-top performances by Depp and Rush. Really, this movie does not bear in-depth analysis. There aren't any themes running through it; it's just a fun, unpretentious action film. Or at least it tries to be; the movie is about twenty minutes too long, with a climax that drags on forever (and seems arbitrary in light of the sequel). But that's a fairly minor complaint, when the 120 minutes before it were so entertaining. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is a wonderfully entertaining character. In the second movie, he will have worn out his welcome (at least for this reviewer), but here he's amazing. Campy, drunken, profane, and ceaselessly witty, it's easy to see why Jack has become such a immensely popular character. While ostensibly based on Keith Richards, Jack reminds me at least of Eli Wallach's Tuco from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" - a lovable, double-crossing rogue who is turns likable and hate-able. Depp gives simply a marvelous performance, and transforms a character who, on paper, was likely not much into something wonderful. Geoffrey Rush, one of my favorite living actors, is a perfect counterpart as Barbossa. Rush, who can be a restrained and subtle performer ("Shine", "Elizabeth"), goes way over-the-top here. But in a film like this - and especially with someone like Depp's Sparrow as your rival - over-the-top is the only way to go, and Rush executes his role with relish. Barbossa is a surprisingly sympathetic character; one feels for his anguish at the curse, even though he is ostensibly a villain, and Rush should get credit for being able to convey this as well. The histrionic sparring of the two above actors does, unfortunately, overshadow most of the supporting cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just not good actors, I'm sorry to say, but they are able to handle their parts with admirable aplomb - even though they are blown off the screen by Depp and Rush. Jack Davenport, as Elizabeth's suitor Norrington, and Jonathan Pryce, as Governor Swann, give good, restrained performances that relegate them to the background. Among the rest of the supporting cast, Kevin McNalty as Gibbs, the sailor-turned-pirate and Jack's chief sidekick, is most memorable, bringing dignity and humor to his smallish role. The action sequences are well-done, and the special effects, while not realistic, are frighteningly convincing (unlike the ridiculously overdone effects in "Dead Man's Chest"). Elizabeth's discovery of just what Barbossa's pirates are is effectively done - it seems over-the-top but it works, helped immeasurably by Rush. The action scenes - particularly the climactic sword-fight between Jack and Barbossa - sometimes go on for too long, but most of them are so enthralling that you won't notice. The film doesn't lack for humor either, mostly through Sparrow's character. Though a bit too long and contrived, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a fun, fun action movie that is worth watching again and again. It's easy to see why it was such a successful film, and this one (if not the sequels) will certainly be watched for years to come. 7/10
8.0~The best pure fun movie WakenPayne Sign in Permalink and its nothing more than pure fun. The sequel was not as good but watchable the third one was utter crap (and that's me praising it if anyone could figure out what was going on in that movie they're doing better than me) but now onto this movie. This movie follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, but the fierce and clever Barbossa has been cursed. He, along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made. This movie is one of the few movies on IMDb that I agree with it's overall rating sometimes crap on there is overrated and some good movies are underrated on here
7.0~Pretty so-so. Devotchka Sign in Permalink I love pirates but I thought this was a pretty disappointing movie. Sure, Depp was great--he usually is. His lines were some of the best in the film. I did enjoy the boats and sets a lot. However, I did not like Orlando Bloom and found him dull and irritating. Keira Knightley was clearly just chosen as a pretty face, since she wasn't too exciting, either. It's a shame to see someone as talented as Depp paired up with two such inadequate actors. The film itself was long and without real substance. I did enjoy the "cameos" from specific parts of the WDW ride, though. Oh well. I'd watch it again, but probably with the sound off.
10.0~Best Movie Ever th_girlz Sign in Permalink This is the Best movie I've ever seen! It has everything anyone could ever ask for. No Blood and gore, A bit of Scaryness, Sword fights, Romance and ORLANDO BLOOM AND JOHNNY DEPP!! You couldn't have asked for a better movie in all of the world. This movie was made for the Duo, It is the perfect Movie! I love Pirates!!(in at least this movie) It had the perfect ending to, everything was finished, I can't reveal to much or you will know what happens. EVERYONE DIES!! just kidding. But it really is the best ever movie and you should really watch it. I have seen it about a million times and I am able to quote along with this movie, and still things surprise me. The smallest things are hidden in there that you never see until the fifth or sixth time watching it. You'll want to watch it again and again and again.
10.0~Awesome sportsaholickmt Sign in Permalink I love it and i own it! i watched it a thousand times all ready! Johnny Depp is a great actor. Kiera Knightly does a great job with this. I think its her best yet. If you like action movies this one is for you. I Can't to see the second and third one! Orlando Bloom also does a great job. By far the best Pirate movie i ever saw! In the movie Jack Sparrow loses his ship to Barbosa and wants to get it back. Elizabeth Swan is taken by Barbosa. Will Turner loves her and wants to saw her so he teams up with Captian Jack. Will finds out that his father was a pirate. Will's blood is needed to stop the curse that is own Barbosa and his men. I don't want to spoil it to much so you should go and watch it!!!!
8.0~Sexy Actors! senorita_belle Sign in Permalink At the first time, I wanted to see this movie because of the actors, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. But, it was a funny and very adventure movie. I like the setting, so classic. And Johnny Depp, of course, he was very funny even if he didn't look too handsome on that movie. The creature was good, spooky but made me laugh. Esp. the visual effect when they turned from human to skull. And Kiera Knightly made me jealous when she kissed Orlando Bloom. Every girl wants it, no doubt. O yeah, Johnny Depp won for best actor on Mtv Movie Award. It's proper for him. I'm very want to find out what will happen on the next sequel. I hope it will be more fantastic. Great job for all of the casts and crews,
10.0~Savvy? KatharineFanatic Sign in Permalink The cinematography on this film is what makes it outstanding. Whether it's Elizabeth Swann preparing to faint from a too-tight-corset on a parapet, or the tattered Black Pearl sailing in the moonlight, there's always something wondrous to gaze at on the screen. One fantastic underwater shot peruses a school of hammerheads as they drift endlessly through an underwater cove of sunken, ghostly ships. The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog. This scene alone makes the movie ticket price well worth it... and that's only the first four minutes. As many profession and personal critics have observed, the film belongs to Johnny Depp's memorable performance as "Captain" Jack Sparrow, the single pirate able to elude the curse thanks to his crew mutinying before the gold could be spent. But the other performers shouldn't be overlooked in his hilariously likable wake. In the role of a very strong, independent heroine, Kiera Knightley manages to be both beautiful and spirited without escaping into cliché. Orlando Bloom is more likable here than as the aloof Legolas he's become so well known for; with some excellent action scenes, he shows his unique skill with a blade as well as has the opportunity to carry off a romantic lead with a keen flair. Geoffrey Rush is at his best; being a fan of his endeavors, it was a pleasure to watch him on screen in a very different, very misunderstood role. He manages to make Barbossa both fascinating, horrible, and yet have a shred of sorrow at the end for his passing. Two extremely underrated actors, Britain's Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce, are given the respective roles of Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth's unfortunate fiancée, and her governor father. For once, scriptwriters haven't copped out and given us an easy decision. While being slightly arrogant and something of an egotist, Norrington is also extremely likable, a perfect gentleman, and one might even go so far as to say, the most noble character by the closing credits. Davenport plays him with just the right amount of lethargic enthusiasm and irritation; his scenes with Depp, always wrought with blatant humor, are some of the film's finest moments. Pryce doesn't have a lot to work with, but the audience cannot help but chuckle over some of his humorous traits, such as fighting a skeletal hand for his magnanimous wig. The music is also first-rate, very mood-setting with a certain sense of dramatic tension even in romantic scenes. The film is well worth a PG13 rating, but is never inappropriate for younger audiences. The mild innuendo will go over children's heads (and most parents as well, for that matter -- only literature history-lovers will pick up some of the sly historical jests), the violence is all quite bloodless, and there's virtually no profanity. The pirates are properly frightening and in various stages of decay, extremely cool from a CGI perspective. A movie well worth its praise, and one you simply MUST own on DVD for all its subtleties.
9.0~wild adventure nobbytatoes Sign in Permalink In the fog at sea, a small boy, Will floats on a scrap plank. Picked up by the British Navy commanded by Governor Swann and Norrington, Will is taken into care by Elizabeth, Governor Swan's daughter. Elizabeth discovers that Will is a pirate carrying a gold trinket, yet keeps this secret. Eight years later, Norrinton is soon to be announced as Commodore Norrinton and reveal his love for Elizabeth. Will is a black smiths apprentice, with a hidden love for Elizabeth. Arriving at Port Royal on a sinking ship, pirate Captain Jack Sparrow is looking to commandeer a ship to continue his travels. When a phantom ship, the Black Pearl comes into port, commanded by Captain Barbossa, Jack, Will and Elizabeth become entangled in the Black Pearls cursed crew and their goal to lift the curse. Strangely based upon a theme park ride at the Disney theme park, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an exciting adventure. For a long time, pirate movies have been a disappointing venture; its hard to say when a good pirate movie was. The genre was close to be non-existent. Director Gore Verbinski and screen writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought to pirate film into a new age and revitalised a very dwindling genre. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has all the standard elements of a pirate film; savvy characters, treasure, boat caught in thunderous storm, people walking the plank, but its the induction of the supernatural element that elevates Pirates of the Caribbean from just a standard pirate film. The cursed pirates turning into skeletons in the moonlight spins the whole notion of the genre. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought a real authentic element; the lingo and dialog, the pirate code, adds more realism and authenticity. Really making Pirates of the Caribbean all the better is the character driving force it holds. The character are detailed and fleshed out; they are all so unique. The life of the film rests upon Johnny Depp, bringing his most memorable and best performance of his career; he is the most versatile actor of this age in cinema. Johnny as the miscreant Jack Sparrow, with all his blasé idiosyncrasies, are impossible to turn away. Orlando Bloom at time over plays, with his love lorn looks, yet does a great act. As the beautiful damsel Elizabeth, Keira Knightley is wonderful. Making for an ultimate pirate, Geoffrey Rush is just flawless. He makes Barbossa so charismatic, with some tongue in cheek wit. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one swash buckling adventure and one of the best pirate films in such a very long time.
10.0~its the best film Eva blonde_auts1992 Sign in Permalink i think its the best film ever i think Johnny Depp steals it. he plays the part brilliant.(Johnny Depp is ace) all the rest of the actors are brilliant as well. i think its a great story line it also has a lot of mysteries in it like how does he get of the island at first. it has a lot of humour in it. its great how they sort of mix an adventure comedy film with a love story. the special effects are really good like when the pirates turn to skeletons. i was glad that captain barboser was killed at the end he deserved it i think the film is fab and would recommend it to everyone i cart wait for the second and third to come out
7.0~A new kind of a movie ebiros2 Sign in Permalink Jerry Bruckheimer created a completely new genre of movie with the Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not just a pirate movie, not just a ghost movie, and not just a comedy, but all combined into one strange tale of curse, legend, and adventure. Not to mention some romance along the way. The movie also created a new character, Capt. Jack Sparrow who's not even human as the hero. The story is bit convoluted and difficult to understand. Why the curse started in the first place, why Jack is cursed, where the heck Davy Jones' locker came from etc. etc. Even if you've paid attention, some of the details still remains unclear, and remains that way in the subsequent sequels. The movie is beautifully made, although bit creepy at times. Johnny Depp's acting adds to the mysterious mood of the movie. I've watched this movie several times along with its sequels, but I still haven't figured out the whole story yet.
10.0~good action movie; needed better editors! katiebug6143 Sign in Permalink I have probably seen this movie 15 times. I love movies and I am terribly critical of them. When I read the goofs page on this movie, I was shocked to see how many there were. IT is not good that the editors let so many slide. But, as a whole, this is a great mindless movie. I read a review by another user that said a good movie is one that raises important issues and questions; I agree. But, there can be other kinds of good movies. This is one! Watch it with an empty mind needing entertainment and the willingness to pass off goofs by saying "it is a movie" and you will find great satisfaction in Pirates. All in all, I would call this a new classic because it appeals to the masses who generally care nothing for "great art films".
10.0~Blows You Out of the Water! rviolin2002 Sign in Permalink Wow, it is amazing! The sword fights and cannon blasts, and amazing graphics. I love the skeletons this movie is so cool. I have seen it three times and still, I have yet to be bored. I love Johnny Depp, this movie is what made me want to see more of his movies than I had. What a wonderful story. The best movie of the summer. It leaves you in aw and amazement at how good a movie can be. The plot is just fabulous and if you haven't seen it do. This movie is the best ever! It will be remembered for centuries. See It!
10.0~Drink Up Me Harties, Yoho! mrusty5 Sign in Permalink One of the best live action Disney films of all time. Pirates of the Caribbean revived a dead movie genre with spectacular glory. Full of comedy, action, great story and character development and amazing CGI, it deserves to be in the film hall of fame, if there is one. The story revolves around the cursed treasure of Cortez, placed in a large chest on Isla De Muetre, an island that can only be found by those who know where it is. Anyway, a crew of pirates take the coins and become cursed skeletons. They need all the coins to free themselves of the curse, so they kidnap Keira Knightley from Port Royal to complete their goal. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, teams up with swank pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save her from Captain Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl. Hilarity, action and old-fashioned pirating follows with an amazing final battle. I give the film 9/10.
9.0~A Great Film Rainey-Dawn Sign in Permalink Disney has made quite a number of great films and the entire Pirates of the Caribbean is no exception. PotC: Curse of the Black Pearl is lots of fun. It has plenty of action for eye-candy and lots of comedy to keep everyone laughing. It's an adventurous tale, with a great fantasy story to follow. The entire cast seemed to really outdo themselves for this film... they appeared to give it their all for this outstanding movie, each one played their roles believably. This is a movie the entire family can enjoy. This movie would be a great double feature with movies like "The Mask of Zorro", "Hook" or even followed by the second film of the PotC series "Dead Man's Chest" 9.5/10
10.0~A rousing good time! Definitely an "E-Ticket" Movie! debabe Sign in Permalink PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is, quite simply, the best movie [so far] of the summer. Certainly the most satisfying. It has everything you could possibly want from a pirate movie...and more. The perfect blend of action, jaw-dropping visuals and tongue-in-cheek humor. As one would expect, there are numerous, yet subtle references to the Disneyland Park attraction on which the film is based and moviegoers will have fun identifying them. Even the famous song "Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life For Me!" makes sporadic appearances in the film, in fact, the movie opens with it. But it is presented in such a way that it never comes off forced or "cheesy." While Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are all excellent in their respective roles, it's Johnny's Depp's movie all the way. Depp commands your attention every time he's on the screen and clearly he's having fun with it. Very few actors could pull this feat off without going "overboard", so to speak. Only Geoffrey Rush comes dangerously close to fulfilling his destiny as a true pirate and stealing the movie away from Depp. It is an honest pleasure to watch these two professionals on screen together. Summer moviegoers, tired of film disappointments and over-hyped sequels will be delighted by this cinematic thrill-ride. Bring your sword and your eye patch, the swashbuckler adventure is back! NOTE: The PG-13 rating is for mild violence; TV show and video games contain far more graphic violence. There is also no profanity or nudity. However, I dare the viewer to miss any of these with the well-written script!
9.0~Excellent Movie! bhangalepratik Sign in Permalink Movie Review: Pirates of Caribbean (The Curse of black Pearl) An action adventure film directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer. Wonderfully drunken performance of Johnny Depp playing a roguish, mildly insane, piratical lead named Captain Jack Sparrow. The Movie also stars Orlando Bloom as blacksmith named Will Turner and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth who is a daughter of Governor of Port Royal. The movie sails along with the ship called "The Black Pearl". The pirates on the Black Pearl captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) are cursed to sail the seas in a state between living and dead. Their cursed could be lifted only after they get the last piece of Aztec gold that every cursed pirate had. Pirates kidnap Elizabeth as she had the last piece of gold. Jack Sparrow teams up with a Will who was in love with Elizabeth to rescue her and to get his ship back from Barbossa. He then steals the ship and forms the crew to hunt down Barbossa. The energetic and entertaining sequences of action produced between the fight scenes between Royal Navy and immortal pirates is another reason to watch this amusing movie. Just like the theme park ride that inspired it, the movie's greatest strengths are its atmosphere and art direction. The best thing about the direction of Gore Verbinsky is the amount of perfection he adds in every frame and in every character of his film. Supporting characters Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport had perfectly played their part. Constant pace of action, picture perfect scene, soundtrack and some excellent execution of dialogues can be seen throughout the movie. It is a film that prides itself on lively detail and top-grade craftsmanship, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Audiences aren't persuaded into feeling that they should be having fun but they simply are having fun because the movie is too.
9.0~One fun movie! Darkangel22688 Sign in Permalink I have mostly praise for Pirates. Johnny Depp absolutely carries the movie with his exceptionally brilliant, somewhat comedic, performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. He was everything you could imagine a pirate to be - a sly thief with a swagger in his step and nothing but a desire to sail his beloved ship on the high seas. Orlando Bloom (personally, my favorite actor)gave a nice performance as heroic blacksmith Will Turner and Kiera Knightly played Turner's captured love interest Elizabeth Swann. Also, great performances by Geoffrey Rush as Jack Sparrow's undead enemy Captain Barbossa and Jack Davenport(whom I love in the British sitcom, Coupling) as Commodore Norrington. Another great attribute of this film was it's soundtrack. Klaus Badlet hit the nail on the head..perfect Pirate music! I only had two problems with the film. First, there were questions pertaining to the plot that should've been answered such as, why a Turner's blood was needed to break the curse. (It is possible that that question was answered but I missed it.)Also, the fight scenes between the British and the skeleton-pirates were a bit drawn out and could've been shorter. However, overall, this movie was one of the best times I've had at the movies in a long time!
10.0~Johnny Depp is hilarious!!! As well as hott!!! kermit_co_06 Sign in Permalink This movie was so funny. Johnny and Orlando are pretty funny. I'm really into the "ship" related movies likes this one and Master and Commander. This movie was one of the best I've seen. If you haven't seen this, YOU NEED TO!!! I can't wait til the second one comes out in 2005. I have an idea that that one is going to be just as good or even better. Can't wait to see Johnny again.
10.0~great movie for everyone ginjjerz Sign in Permalink This was a great movie, a little long in length (which is not a bad thing, who wants to watch an 80 minute movie???) but wonderfully cast and crewed;great story line-all together an excellent movie which i have watched more than several times since it's release last year and i don't get tired of the story or the special effects. Definitely a must see, plus it's Disney so nothing to risque and the whole family can watch
10.0~fun fun fun! saint-cloche-21 Sign in Permalink This is a very fun and high-spirited story. It just may be better than next one, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Deadman's Chest. Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, is a pirates. He wants his ship, the Black Pearl but now he is arrested. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is a captain of the Black Pearl now. Captain Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth(Keira Knightley) because solving ancient curse needs for her. Her friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) worries and wants to help her, he goes sea and search for her with Jack. Through the adventure, we may be excited and laugh about their bravery, friendship and love.
10.0~The best film ever olesyablue Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is an adventure and a comedy film. It is about Jack Sparrow who's had a lot of adventures, a lot of friends as well as enemies. I really love this film because of the main character. Jack is funny, clever and smart. Also adventure films are interesting, sometimes romantic and scary. Finally, it's a fantastic story which we can never see in real life. That's why it is very exciting! For all these reasons it is the best film I've ever seen. Written by an ESL student, Rita (CPFR A2+)
10.0~The Best of the Best! GeminiSpaceman Sign in Permalink This is a definite Two Thumbs Up! for Disney! A great movie filled with swashbuckling adventure, beautiful scenery, and the best of the best -- Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom! The chemistry between the two of them was a beautiful thing to see! I bought it on DVD and have almost worn the disc out, enjoying every second over and over again. I am definitely looking forward to their second one and hope it will be out soon! Even the female, Kiera, was good, though we all could have done without the Will/Elizabeth romance at the end! About the only bad things in the story were the bad pirates and the lack of Will sailing away into the sunset with Sparrow on their ship! These two fine actors deserve a pat on the back and more like about a thousand stars for making their characters likable, enduring, and leaving a taste on your tongue for wanting more! I highly recommend it for all family members! Once seen, this movie will stay with a fond place in your heart forever!
10.0~all my comments are excellent and valid rachanimallover1 Sign in Permalink this movie was the best movie i personally think i have ever seen.i highly recommend you buy the DVD as the bonus features are astounding too.johny depp makes the perfect pirate and is also very funny in this movie.orlando bloom does very well too as do all the actors.just when you think its the last action scene there is so so much more to come.this movie was really just larger than life.this movie is a must see.after seeing this movie you will want to become a pirate yourself. i watched this movie 5 times in a row and did not get bored once. just trust me this is one of the best movies ever made!go rent it, buy it or do whatever just see this awesome movie. you will not be disappointed!!!
5.0~A Disney Theme Ride Come TO The Big Sreen...Oh Boy... underfire35 Sign in Permalink PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is an expensive film. It looks expensive, and was more than likely expensive to make. It is a film about cursed pirates. It has lots o' CGI effects (my favorite), but fails at using them in any new or interesting way. Geoffory Rush and Johnny Depp (as a high seas Keith Richards) seem to be having a blast, but then again they are being payed a whole lot of money (see note above on film's expense). The musical score, by Klaus Badelt, is carbon copy Media Ventures crap (and to think he replaced Alan Silvestri...), and probably cost a good penny in and of itself. Let's just say that if I didn't have a girlfriend, I would have never seen this film. Okay, the bad points: On a general level I find this film disturbing. It opens the gates of hell and, upon its success, will prompt Disney to churn out colorful products that do nothing more than promote the corporate giant's theme parks (did anyone catch the trailer for THE HAUNTED MANSION, looks good...sigh...). One can almost feel the hairy mouse-like tendrils closing on the jugular of American film. Mark my words: there will be a 'It's a Small World' movie and when that day comes may God help us all. 5/10.
10.0~Brilliant Picture mitchell-robert46 Sign in Permalink Loved the film - i would like to know when the first Johnny Depp / Orlando Bloom Pirates film was shown on small screen i.e. TV , as I have a friend who disputes my memory . I distinctly remember a Pirates film shown on TV that starred Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom , and I really enjoyed it but can not quite remember the title but thought it was part of the Pirates of the Caribbean { not just an excerpt a full length film ). Am I going off my rocker or did I actually see it , not that I want to prove anyone wrong . I love Johnny Depp as an actor and hope that he has many more films. Thanks Lets have more like this ! Regards Rob Mitchell.
10.0~One of the most entertaining movies ever.... vvinoba Sign in Permalink My only regret in seeing this movie, is that I missed out on going and seeing it in Cinema! Like many others, I thought a movie based on a theme ride in Disney could not possibly offer much. I was WRONG! Johnny Depp is brilliant, incredibly funny and mmmmmmmmm... Orlando Bloom is brilliant and Keira Knightley is not half bad. The movie was fast paced, had a good storyline and was acted out brilliantly. I loved it! My only thought now is that I was under the impression that the movie had tied up all it's loose ends at the endings. Normally you come out of a movie wondering "what ever happened to that one character". I did not get the feeling from this movie so what could be in stall for the sequel?
7.0~Enjoyed it! dale-little Sign in Permalink When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew. The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 April 2004, and I have just watched again today (10 Feb 2007) enjoying the same way as in the first time. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Piratas do Caribe – A Maldição do Pérola Negra" ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl")
8.0~Surprisingly Good Brad2002 Sign in Permalink Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it. There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie. I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good. Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10
9.0~Pure entertainment at its best! Superbly cast and acted! mslong Sign in Permalink You'll love it and leave wanting MORE! Thank goodness for sequels!!! Some elements could be frightening for the very young, but overall it is perfect for the family. Johnny Depp is at his absolute best, having taken his inspiration from Keith Richards (The Rolling Stones) and...Pepe' le Pew! Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are born to play period roles. The staging is beautiful and the special effects are AMAZING! Jerry Bruckheimer RULES. How did he do it? The references to the Disneyland ride are perfect; not overdone, but familiar enough to those who've enjoyed the ride. One of the most entertaining and imaginative movie of our time. It rocks!
3.0~Full of sound and fury, but signifying nothing kayester Sign in Permalink This is one of those movies you hate to pan, everyone on screen seems to be trying so hard to make something out of the material. Sometimes, even the best efforts can't rescue a plot thinner than the skins of the villains. And therein lies the problem. All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with. At best, this film is a good way to spend a couple of hours where the alternative is banging your head against the wall.
10.0~Pirates and me Dorka93 Sign in Permalink I was ten years old when i saw it the first time, but since then well i think i watch again about 30 times. This movie the first of my list. I know it's not the best movie in the world for the critics but for me is is one of the best movies. I love Johnny Depp every time when i see him. Hi's a great actor the Pirates of Caribbean makes him to really famous. Keira was really young in the first episode, and she grew up for the trilogy. The pictures and the view all of them are amazing, the design it's so realistic. I would like to see the Black Pearl in real life, and the Caribbean sea because i think it's amazing how it's looks like in the movie.
6.0~Entertaining but.... kaosridder Sign in Permalink I give it 6 stars. Very entertaining and quite good at some points. At other times just plain hideous. The two soldiers and two pirates you follow during the movie are absolutely misplaced. They are supposed to add humor but I found their presence really annoying. The humor in the movie is mediocre.
10.0~The BEST movie of the summer DramaQueenLizzy Sign in Permalink I love this movie. The acting was great, the casting was perfect. Johnny Depp was great as Captin Jack Sparow, he had me laghing almost the whole movie. A movie with action, adventure, comidy, romance, and great acting. What more could you ask for? I saw it 3 times in the theater, and now I own it. I highly sugest watching this movie to everyone.
10.0~One of the best pinkliz41 Sign in Permalink *****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *Tragic Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a 10/10 swashbuckling, wind whirling and sword clanging action adventure film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Johnny Depp is at a sheer peak performance as the whizzy 'Captain' Jack Sparrow and one that got him an Oscar nomination for best actor. Depp clearly steals the show and brings down the house with an all amazing performance. It's story is a blessing for this certain genre and thank god Verbinski did it right. He nails it to the point where you wouldn't presume it's a normal story but still treats it in that fashion. But it's the knife-sharp dialogue that plays the real part and Depp unsurprisingly pulls it to the top (Savvey?) Verdict: Pirates of the Carribena: the Curse of the Black Pearl is a pure adventure to watch. Depp at his all time best, unforgettable dialogue and Keira Knightley in a corset. How could you go wrong? *****Classic
10.0~This movie is remarkable magicflute92 Sign in Permalink "Me? I'm dishonest and a dishonest man you can trust to be dishonest honestly. It's the honest ones you have to watch out for...

I can let you drown but I can't sail into Tortuga all by me onesis Savvy? Now can you sail under the command of a Pirate or can you not?" These are just three of some of the most memorable quotes that Captain Jack will let you listen to if you watch this movie. Trust me you will love this movie it has been... is... and will always be loved by people of all ages and generations. You can still be cought up in it even though it takes place years from now.
10.0~A VERY GOOD FILM!!!!! crazy_caz Sign in Permalink Pirates of the caribbean is not only an action, but funny and a bit of horror too, EVERYONE who i have asked if they like it have said yes, its a film that almost everybody likes, no matter what age or genre they like. It stars Johnny Depp is the fearless pirate Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom is the young Blacksmith and Keria Knightly is the governors daughter. This is one of Johnny Depps best films, and he really makes the film what it is!! The graphics were above average and the story line is not boring what so ever, everyone is entertained. I have to say i cant wait for the next one to come out.
10.0~this film is mega-awesome!!! miss_attitude8667 Sign in Permalink I rated this film 10/10 because when i watched it i had to watch the whole film. also i fell in love with Orlando Bloom so that was probably another reason. this film was definitely top marks and i cant wait to watch the next two films of pirates of the Caribbean and i hope that they will be as good as this first one. If there is one person who has got something bad to say about this film it would most probably be a boring person who has no taste in films at all and if they think i am being mean well I'm sorry but i have got to write something because i am not allowed to publish this if it does not have 10 lines or more.i am nearly there now so sorry if i offended anyone but actually you would be crazy not to like this film!!!
10.0~Pirates: one of the best movies queengrace777 Sign in Permalink I love this movie. First of all, I love pirates, which means anything that has to do with pirates, I love. So, obviously I would like this, but, besides that, this movie has romance, action, adventure, a witty rum-obsessed captain (Jack), a brave hero (Will), and a not so distressed damsel (Elizabeth). There are also bad guys of course (Captain Barbosa), the undead skeleton pirates that Jack, Will, and Elizabeth have to defeat.Overall this film is a wonderful pirate movie that I love, but I wouldn't recommend watching the other two, although they somewhat summed up the story, they were not as good as the first one, which above all, has to be the best out of the three. So, as I said, it is a great movie that I give 10 out of 10.
6.0~Fromage, but fun fromage david-546 Sign in Permalink I had heard so much about Johnny Depp's performance in this film that I had to see it just because I am a fan of Johnny Depp. And he didn't disappoint either as Captain Jack Sparrow aka "The Swishbuckler". And others in the cast were fine as well including Geoffrey Rush even if my reaction was "what is he doing in this fromage". As the love interests Orlando Bloom was fine and Keira Knightley while no where near perfect was okay. But folks at the end of the day this was pure fromage. Fun but fromage nonetheless. From the moment Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) entered the scene and stepped off his sinking boat onto the dock all you could do is burst out laughing as you knew this was, well, pure fromage. And if course it didn't stop there to the Pirate with the glass eye, Geoffrey Rush playing the baddy to the hilt, all of the sword fights and while the Pirates changing into skeltons and back again was pure fromage it was well done at least especially the final battle scene with Depp and Rush. Topping the list of fromage was the Pirates den which looked like well something you would encounter at a cheesy theme park. Of course it was based on the Disneyworld Pirate theme park so what did you expect - realism. Okay this wasn't Academy Award material but Johhny Depp's performance might be and at least it was fun should save this piece of fromage from the Razzies. See it. But folks don't take this fromage too seriously. IMDB top 250 material this ain't despite its current score. 6/10.
10.0~An Extremely Well Crafted Film Hollywood_Yoda Sign in Permalink I wasn't quite sure how this film would fare with audiences back in 2003 since it was based on an amusement park ride, but Jerry Bruckheimer produces. With the box-office bomb of "The Country Bears (2002)", no one could have expected the great box office sales of this film. The starring roles were excellent as well, with Johnny Depp in the lead playing Jack Sperrow, Captain of the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom starring as Will Turner, a blacksmith; and Keira Knightley as the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. Johnny Depp plays a magnificent pirate, and was even nominated for Best Actor at the 2004 Academy Awards (but lost). It was an excellent film, but the producers were unsure about making a sequel until it made over $300 million in ticket sales.
9.0~Johnny Depp's Unforgettable Performance Helps Make This Swashbuckling Adventure A Modern Classic jaredpahl Sign in Permalink Today, few people can remember going into the local multiplex on a warm summer afternoon and being treated to something completely original. In the 1970s and 80s, pioneers like Spielberg and Lucas were creating modern myths, putting stories and images on screen that would be seared into the collective consciousness forever. Jaws, Star Wars, E.T, Indiana Jones, and even Jurassic Park, were more than just quality entertainment. There was a magic to those films that I thought had gone extinct by the time the 21st century rolled around. Then, in the summer of 2003, came Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. Yes, it is inspired by the theme park attraction at Disneyland, but what director Gore Verbinski and his collaborators do, is use the spirit of the ride to create something truly special. With an ensemble cast featuring big stars, veteran character actors, and young up-and-comers, lavish production design, an iconic score, and a heaping spoonful of humor, Pirates of the Caribbean represents the perfect storm of summer entertainment. The Curse of the Black Pearl does not simply coast on a recognizable name. Instead, Verbinski and company dare to create something brand new. In the end, thanks in large part to Johnny Depp's audacious lead performance, Pirates of the Caribbean brings magic back to the movies. The titular curse of the Black Pearl is the driving force behind the story of Pirates of the Caribbean. The Black Pearl's ruthless captain, Barbossa, played with scenery chewing gusto by Geoffrey Rush, and his crew are cursed by mythical Aztec Gold to live forever as the undead (In a bit of design brilliance, they're skeletal bodies can only be seen by the light of the moon). After Barbossa kidnaps the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan, played by the young beauty Keira Knightly, in order to break the curse, a young admirer of Elizabeth, a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), enlists the help of legendary pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp in one of the most iconic performances of the decade, to help free her from the clutches of the undead crew. Now is as good a time as any to mention Johnny Depp. What he does with Jack Sparrow, with the makeup, the costume, and the unsteady, drunken, charismatic persona, is a tour de force of acting. Depp creates a pirate rockstar icon where just about everybody else would have phoned in a typical smiling Errol Flynn impression. He is simply electrifying on screen. The story of Pirates of the Caribbean is appropriately old-fashioned. Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio take care to include just about every pirate trope there is into the script. Sword fights, romance, sea-faring battles, and buried treasure, every classic pirate situation is here. While it might have been clichéd in less capable hands, the story here is deliciously simple. While there is a good deal of background to what the curse is and how it can be cured, the basic structure of Curse of the Black Pearl is in the spirit of the grand pirate adventures of the Golden Age of Hollywood. It is a classic adventure yarn with good guys, bad guys, sweeping romance, and high spirited adventure. Depp gets the lion's share of the credit for the success of Pirates of the Caribbean, and he does steal the show, but Gore Verbinski's direction is nearly equal to the Johnny Depp show. The pairing of the high-energy director and the classic swashbuckling material proved to be a stroke of genius on the part of Jerry Bruckheimer. Verbinski brings enough personality and humor for a dozen movies. From a purely visual standpoint, Pirates of the Caribbean is equally unique. The exotic locations, from the Bay of Port Royal to the picturesque beauty of Rumrunner's Isle, are bright, colorful, and lush. Where the production value really excels though is in how the real-life locations sync perfectly with the sets, which tastefully evoke the Disneyland attraction. In it's production design, Curse of the Black Pearl is as satisfying a visual experience as you can have in a summer blockbuster. The locations, the sets, and the dependably boundary-pushing special effects from ILM make the most of all the natural beauty of the real life Caribbean, as well as the nostalgic Disney glow of the theme park ride. In my eyes, Gore Verbinski is currently one of the best action directors working, but back in 2003, his brand of swashbuckling adventure was eye-opening. It's not just that Verbinski is so adept at giving the stunts, the highlights of which are a massive battle on the high seas and a climatic sword fight in a treasure-filled cave, an enthusiastic electricity. It's that the humor mixed throughout the action is so darn effortless. The action scenes in Pirates of the Caribbean are so fun by themselves, it seems the actors can't help but have fun along with them. The mix of humor and action in Pirates of the Caribbean is simply unrivaled. Nobody buckles swash quite as entertainingly as Gore Verbinski, and Curse of the Black Pearl represents him at the very top of his game. This movie is fun. Not just the type of fun where you walk out of the theater feeling placated, but the type of experience that leaves you with a big dumb grin on your face the entire time. Without Gore Verbinski or Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl would probably be a solid adventure. It's with these two, plus the rest of the eclectic cast, that Pirates of the Caribbean becomes a bona-fide classic. Depp's Jack Sparrow is an unforgettable character, an instant icon that came out of nowhere. Nobody could have predicted what Depp brought to the character, and yet he fits into Verbinski's world like a glove. These elements are what make Pirates of the Caribbean special. Summer blockbusters come and go, but Bruckheimer, Verbinski, and Depp did something I thought could never be done again, they captured that old movie magic, like a ship in a bottle. 94/100
10.0~Most entertaining film ever made Minkymouse Sign in Permalink OK, so everything that I could say has all been said in the other reviews already, but I can't stress just how enjoyable this film is. It's a wild ride that keeps you laughing and thrilled from beginning to end. Johnny Depp is incredibly funny and incredibly sexy, and since potc I have become a JD addict, which is costing me a fortune on Ebay. The special effects are perfect - the pirates are very funny and not overdone at all. It is fun for all the family, and I can't think of anybody who isn't a complete kill joy, who wouldn't enjoy this film. It's always worth a watch when you need cheering up. I have seen it around 9 or 10 times and there will be more. Can't wait for the sequel, and praying that they can secure Johnny for part 3 too.
5.0~Rousing romp ofmaritime adventure has some problems with historical continuity... ccmiller1492 Sign in Permalink Although this film is a rousing romp of maritime adventure, it has some problems with historical continuity. Characters seem to randomly inhabit any century from the 16th to the 18th, roughly from the period of Edward VI to George III, willy nilly. The action and characters are everything they need to to be and a bit more ( you can just about smell Depp's Jack Starling.) This film makes me appreciate all those Flynn, Power, Derek and Payne movies which managed to capture the period and flavor of bygone Romantic eras with much greater dispatch and lower budgets. But I'm glad to see this genre again after too long an absence from our screens. Great fun, all in all.
5.0~Fun movie, but doesn't deserve such high praise Torgo_Approves Sign in Permalink Yes, Johnny Depp is one of today's greatest actors and it's amazing that he'd dedicate so much time and effort to a character in a flavour-of-the-month fad movie like this one. But really, that's all there is to this film. If another actor entirely had played Jack Sparrow, this movie would get a 5 from me, tops. It is simply an extremely forgettable film. In 20 years, who will even remember who played Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann? Knightly and Bloom are good to look at, but they'll soon be past their expiration date and, let's face it, no one watches their movies for their acting. The entire movie consists mainly of CGI skeletons, CGI ships and tired children's' humour derived from would-be funny characters (the transvestite ghosts, whatever their names were, are the most forgettable sidekicks this side of Tantor). The plot is as uninteresting as they come. The only reason to see this film is Depp, and although his performance is positively amazing, it's not enough to boost this flick to "great movie" status. His great job and the gorgeous Caribbean scenery is enough to make this movie an above average kids' flick, but no more, no less. There's not much else to say on the subject, so I'll leave you eunuchs to re-watch the film and consider that maybe everything about "Pirates" really isn't as amazing as you first thought it was.

10.0~I absolutely loved it!!! Austin_Powers_fan Sign in Permalink This was a really great movie with two excellent actors...Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. I loved every minute of it and can't wait to buy it on DVD. I'm thrilled they're making POC 2!!! If you haven't seen this one yet...don't rent it, just buy the DVD when it's out. You won't regret it.
10.0~The best movie to be created.... stinglikeabee_777 Sign in Permalink This movie tops them all with AMAZING direction, AMAZING moods, AMAZING music and mostly AMAZING OF ALL AMAZINGS... acting! I have the biggest passion for Johnny Depp and thought this was the most hilarious role to have him play. He did it flawlessly! and he's so hot! Just an added bonus. Orlando Bloom was probably at his best in this movie as well, and because i don't really like him at all, that is definitely a huge compliment to say the least. And if all i told you about this movie is that it was produced by Jerry Bruckhiemer, then you would automatically know it is something worth watching. From The Amazing Race, to CSI, Jerry Bruckhiemer produces everything worth watching. And don't get me started on the flawlessly beautifully talented Keira Knightly. She is beautiful, has the cutest accent and is extremely talented! Honestly, if you didn't like this movie you have got to have something seriously wrong with you - it's a classic to be remembered for the rest of time!
10.0~Pure excitement! Sup_Kitty Sign in Permalink This film wraps together the perfect measures of fun, action and adventure. Every part of this film is intriguing. It never grows old, but keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Johnny Depp, as always, thrills audiences with his completely believable character: the infamous Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush once again bring life to the screen, and Kiera Knightly proves herself to be the shining star she really is, and establishes her place among the other lead actors. This action packed story is a film that the whole family can enjoy.
10.0~Great Film anthonydnelson Sign in Permalink Gore Verbinski follows up The Ring with this incredible family film. Johnny Depp turns in another incredible performance that should get a laugh out of everyone. This is the type of incredible family adventure/comedy that should be a favorite of the youth in this generation as The Princess Bride was for those before it. Both movies give you that good feeling and have that quality where you never get sick of watching it and hearing the lines over and over. This is a film that everyone should see a couple of times, just to enjoy the pure fun it has to offer. The great film was a surprise to me, since I knew it was based off of a Disney ride and I thought it was going to be a film for kids, but it is definitely something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Captain Jack Sparrow is the pathetic yet savvy and smooth pirate that you can't help rooting for. Orlando Bloom is the one actor I don't particularly care for in any movie, but he doesn't bother me in this one. Geoffry Rush is cast perfectly and the special effects are nice. If you haven't seen this great film yet, go out and rent it or buy the DVD which is loaded with extras that will keep you happy.
10.0~a true, memorable summer blockbuster than MUSN'T be missed!! johnmichael-2 Sign in Permalink Yes, Johnny Depp was amazing in this movie. He totally deserved his Acadamy Award nomination. But credit must also go to the two other costars of this movie: Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom. They also delivered amazing performances, considering that Keira Knightly was only 18 when she got the role and Orlando Bloom had just started his movie career a few years previously. The three actors, as well as pretty much every single supporting actor and actress, gave totally believable performances. Also to be credited is the absolutely wonderful screenplay. It's full of foreshadowing that really binds the movie together and helps every part make perfect sense. True, there is the fact that the pirates under the curse aren't supposed to feel anything, yet they still react to hot coals being poured on their heads and stuff like that. But that can be explained away with a little imagination, and it was pretty much the only notable mistake in the movie. Otherwise, the script is very effective and full of little subplots and extra tidbits that make a movie so fun to watch a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. time. I am very sad that this movie didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations. I didn't quite expect Johnny Depp to win, because his nomination was so much of a surprise in itself. But the other nominations (sound, sound editing, visual effects), and makeup were totally deserved, and it makes me cry to realize that it didn't stand a chance when going up against LOTR. If it had been another year, it would have most certainly won at least a few of those awards. Oh well. In closing: this movie is bound to be a classic. It has romance, adventure, scary moments, sweet moments, great visual effects, great music, and great everything-else-that-makes-a-movie-fun-to-see. DON'T MISS IT!!
10.0~LOVE Depp in this movie. His weirdness is wonderful caseyeholliman Sign in Permalink I love Jonny's range of oddness in this film. It's amazing! The movie's special effects are very engaging to the eye and well crafted. The plot has got you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wanting more all the way up to the end.
10.0~Pure pirate perfection, to see this film once is worth all the gold and silver in the world! jburtroald95 Sign in Permalink The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing. The other cast members are also pitch-perfect, and some of them are even better: Rush is wonderful as the cunning and horridly cruel villain; Orlando and Keira are nothing outstanding and we feel that we have seen their characters countless times before, but neverhteless they do manage to pull off the pair of heroic lovers that they play quite nicely; Jack Davenport is superb as the dutiful Commodore who greatly despises piracy; Jonathan Pryce is decent as a cowardly governor and the protective father of Keira's character; Kevin.R.McNally is excellent in the role of an old companion of Jack's; and the dynamic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are delightful as two bumbling blundering pirate buddies under the the service of Rush's character. The music is incredible, and greatly enhances the overall uplifting and exciting feel of the film. The choreography of the action sequences are outstanding, the special effects work beautifully, the costumes are very well designed as are the sets... This is my equal-third favourite film, with the other two being 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I really sincerely do mean that, no other of my reviews says this. I just hope that i have given this film the vast quantity of praise that it deserves. It completely shatters the Walt Disney Company's reputation for being able to create only babyish kids cartoons and similar live action movies. Though it is still a bold and daring little company that thrives on risky endeavours, like the dazzling 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', such as this.
10.0~MORE SPARROW PLEASE!! bullocks_1 Sign in Permalink *minor spoilers* Pirates of the Caribbean was an absolute FANTASTIC FILM!!! I didn't expect much from a Disney film, and to be honest, I actually went to see the film because Orlando Bloom starred in it. However, Johnny Depp proved to be the best actor in the film, who played the comedic and lunatic character, Jack Sparrow, exceptionally well. Stunning performance by Orlando Bloom as the heroic blacksmith Will Turner, Geoffrey Rush as the haunting Captain Barbossa and Keira Knightly as the strong and independent Elizabeth Swann. It even created a division between 'good' pirates and 'bad' pirates. (I thought they were all ruthless?). Jack Sparrow is a well developed character who even draws sympathy from the audiences (when we're told of his crew abandoning him). He also adds in well balanced comedy, which just makes this character even more loveable. Johnny Depp definitely at his best, and he couldn't get any sexier! The sword fight with the two hottest actors was one of the best scenes! who could resist watching the young blacksmith fighting with the inticing pirate, its a shame they didnt cut more of their shirts off... The Special effects were fantastic, the story was witty and exciting, and although the ending was a little cheesy, it is definitely a fantastic MUST SEE film. Definite thumbs up! go watch it if you haven't already! A perve at Orlando and Johnny is enough to make any girl want to see it! rate 9/10
8.0~<3 Love For Pirates <3 tiskec Sign in Permalink I absolutely love this series. I think it's one of Disney's best series of films, and Johnny Depp' s best work. Also, who doesn't like Orlando Bloom? These two make this movie into a corked up bundle of fun. All the quirky sword fighting scenes and the dialog between these two in the film is something else. You gotta love it. I love the filming of Pirates of the Caribbean. The whole series makes you feel like you're inside some kind of story book, along for the adventure. The characters are easy to connect with, because they adapt to your outlook in a goofy way. It definitely gives you the proper feel of an actual pirate adventure. I liked the end the best, when Johnny Depp finds out he's got the curse as well. The Pirates are all really dead. He didn't know it, but he was cursed to live forever. Once they found all the treasure in the cave, Johnny Depp fights with the captain of the Black Pearl. His whole intention are to get a new ship this whole time. Every other character's mission is so complex, but his is the simplest, and he goes about them in the simplest ways. He is also the one that succeeds the most throughout the movie. It's too funny. I really like this movie a lot. It gives you a storybook experience mixed with actual piracy type motives, by pirates. If that makes sense? I would definitely recommend this Disney flick to anyone in the mood for a good adventure.
8.0~surprisingly good ealgerno Sign in Permalink I wasn't expecting much when I walked into the theatre to see this movie. I mean - it's a movie based on a ride for goodness sakes. But they actually manage to pull off making something that is a lot of fun to watch and manages to be a spoof of other swashbuckling movies as well. Johnny Depp is particularly good in his lunatic role of Jack Sparrow. He definitely makes the movie with his nonchalant air of cool confidence while at the same time - messing up a good percentage of the time. His make-up was a little overdone - but his character itself is so odd, that I found I forgot all about his makeup about five minutes into the movie. The sword fight between Sparrow and the young blacksmith is all one could hope for in an all-out acrobatic and elaborate duel. It's not a masterpiece by any means and the movie suffers from some predictability. The second half of the movie isn't nearly as tight as the first half before Sparrow and the blacksmith steal the boat in pursuit of the Black Pearl. Overall though, it's much better than the average modern flick out there involving swords and ships - especially considering the original premise.
10.0~Popcorn-flick at its BEST! raphaklopper Sign in Permalink In 1996, the movie "Independence Day" by Roland Emerich proved that entertainment films, which usually come out in summer (in other words, summer movies, the ones that only serve for a good popcorn) could have a high quality in various aspects from the very story, script and performances. And Gore Verbinski and the writers of "Shrek" (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) with "Pirates" proved that once again in big! "Pirates" has everything that a summer movie needs to be pure entertainment, from the romantic story of the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the beautiful daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). That begins to go awry when the weird pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) appears in Port Royal and soon after him the cursed crew of the "Black Pearl" led by the cruel Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Like I said, from romance to comedy and action, everything that a popcorn film needs. But thanks to Verbinski, everything can go much higher and better that we expected. Since the beginning, the film presents a superb script with a good, flowing and entertaining narrative (surprising for a entertainment film), that goes from memorable phrases to intelligent humor, and the plot really takes something pretty serious without exaggerating as other films have tried and failed. But it's not just comedy that elevates the film, is the "tone-change" that the film has: in scenes between Elizabeth and Will the film seems to have a dramatic tone but never gets to be boring or dry; when Barbossa and his cursed crew appear everything gets dark and kind of scary. But thanks to Jack Sparrow, at all times we have a really good and funny comic relief. The film also contains a superb direction of Verbinski in all scenes, giving the film also pretty adventurous moments when you see the great and vast Caribbean, and also epic moments of action that range from fun choreographed chase-sequences to epic battles between pirate's ships against another. Ah, speaking of pirates, Verbinski seems to have grabbed almost all the clichés of pirates and thrown in the movie: one speaker parrot on a pirate's shoulder (no, neither Sparrow or Barbossa, one seems to have something against animals and Barbossa has a annoying monkey); dirty teeth and horrible breath; the favorite drink of any pirate, rum; and the British navy with elegant gentlemen leading them against pirates, and much more! Now the performances, even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have a good romantic connection in their characters, their acting doesn't shine much in this movie (they shine much more in the unnecessary but great sequels that the movie had). Perhaps the reason for this is the superb Geoffrey Rush, that perfectly embodying the spirit of a Pirate since the evilness to the "aarrgghhh", OR the highest and memorable point of the film that is the EXCELLENT performance by Johnny Depp as the unforgettable Jack Sparrow. His performance was so weird, so fun and so good that it cost him his varied roles in films like the weird and funny guy. "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" can be one of the several examples that entertainment can simultaneously be VERY fun; well written; well-acted; well directed and contain a luxurious soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, "Pirates" is entertainment and popcorn-flick at its best and much more! 10/10
1.0~Absolutely monotonous ChasBid4 Sign in Permalink Possible spoilers. I could only endure about an hour of this movie, before I walked out of the room where I had been watching it with my family. Why? First, the movie lacked a plot. It was strictly about the everyday lives of a group of pirates, and had no extraordinary plot elements. Instead of being a movie, it should have been made a sitcom. At least sitcoms ARE generally about the everyday lives of a person or group of people. Movies should have something more. Secondly, this was one of the most monotonous movies I have ever seen. Most of the hour that I watched was the same dialogue, paraphrases over and over: "I'm a pirate." "Are you a pirate?" "Is he a pirate?" Hearing the same word in ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE grew very tiresome after an hour. Lastly, constantly hearing the word "pirate" was only half of the problem with the dialogue. Much of it was JUST PLAIN CHEESY. I could not see how any educated writers could have come up with the dialogue that was used in this movie. If you want matching corny plot and dialogue, Pirates of the Caribbean is the right movie for you.
10.0~Fantastic Voyage! allanradman Sign in Permalink A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.
9.0~Terrific! MaxBorg89 Sign in Permalink You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made. The opening concept is a clichè:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy("You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of" "But you HAVE heard of me!"). It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10. So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns. See you next summer,Captain!
8.0~Where's all the rum gone? Jasper76 Sign in Permalink Many many years ago, the stories of pirates died in Hollywood, the interest and freshness just left it, and the name of swashbuckling piracy gathered dust in a box on a shelf in the back of a closet. Then, in 2003, Jerry Bruckheimer found the old box, dusted it off and said to himself "Hey I could use this!" And use it, he did. With an all-star cast and the best crew in town, Jerry set out to do the unthinkable, resurrect the pirate name. Many people, upon seeing the footage-less teaser trailer thought the film would be so bad it would be a joke, but the director, Gore Verbinki proved them all wrong. Through jolly musical themes, a surprisingly creepy plot, a fantastic cast, and awesome bits of nothing-but-fun action, Pirates of the Caribbean successfully leaves the viewer stunned, and wanting more (which, they brought, twice). If you liked Transformers, Night at the Musiem you will probably like this movie.
8.0~terrific! ponyboys-girl Sign in Permalink This movie is sure to astonish you. It is has so well devolped charactercs, breath taking scenery, and a plot line leaving you ictching for more. The actors bring this movie to life. It is fun for the young and the old. It will lead young minds to adventure ,and dreamers to far away places filled with pirates ,and compasses that don't point north. It is so intruding you will want to watch it over and over again. It is a timeless classic for the family even if it still has those fun pirates myths. Even with those myths it still brings in new fantasist pirate styles. That are sure to kept you laughing for quite some time. This is the kind of film we need more of today.
10.0~Everything You Want atish Sign in Permalink This movies is all a person could want from a film: action, adventure, comedy, horror, romance.... A crowd pleaser for any crowd, savvy? Depp, in an award-worthy performance shines like never before. A must-see.
3.0~awfully boring!!!!!!!!!! halo01 Sign in Permalink This movie was one of the most boring movies that I have seen this year. It was slow paced the whole movie with little to no action at all. The movie was about a half hour too long and none of the characters were likeable other than Orlando Bloom's character. Two disappointing thumbs down!!!!!!!!!!!
10.0~A Thrill Ride!! weenedee Sign in Permalink This movie was fun and exciting! The script was great and the casting perfect! I was never a Johnny Depp fan till POTC, but now I'm a fan who has sought out most of his movies, and thought he was the absolute, perfect Capt. Jack Sparrow! I have seen it so many times, and still have heard lines I hadn't caught before! The movie was made for Depp!! I can't wait to see POTC #2! A Def. must see! 10! Peace Out!
10.0~Worth seeing over and over! ladywriter56 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that has something for everyone - adventure, humor, romance, action, drama, even a bit of the supernatural. And all in just the right doses so that one doesn't overpower any of the others. The writing is wonderful - clever and articulate - and brought alive by a first rate cast. Keira Knightly was only 17 when this was filmed and her acting skills bring to mind Lauren Bacall at the same age. I must say, too, that POTC made a Johnny Depp fan out of me - it really does show what an amazing talent he possesses. Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow, having stepped right into the persona of a pirate who is more comfortable on sea than on land. Ruthless in his quest to retrieve his beloved ship and stay "afloat", as it were, he keeps us guessing as to what really lies in his heart, what makes him tick. Half the fun of the movie - most of it really - comes from watching to see what he will do and say next. Yes, it's a long movie, but I really couldn't find a boring part in the whole thing - and I saw it six times when it was in the theatres! See it - you won't be disappointed.
8.0~S10 Reviews: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) suspiria10 Sign in Permalink Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp channeling Keith Richards), a deposed and left for dead pirate joins blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on the hunt for the cursed Black Pearl, Jack's former ship until his lecherous first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wrestled it away from him and left him stranded on an island. Jack wants his ship; Will wants the jewel of his eye the lovely Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) now held captive by the scurvy Barbossa. But these mean hombres are a bit harder to crack than usually thanks to a nifty curse that turns them into the undead. Arrrr! It seems that Walt Disney Company somehow had gotten their memos crossed when they sent 'Pirates' sailing into production (the ride comes AFTER the film, not before). But no matter what is cranked out by the Bruckheimer machine is a fun romp through the spray of the Caribbean. Director Verbinski (hot off success with 'The Ring') creates an action packed walk down the plank that occasionally gets a bit long in the tooth but you know the next big sequence is right around the corner. A lot of nifty effects (the dead crew of the Black Pearl for instance) round out a nicely created production and design. On the acting front while Knightley and Bloom are fine in their roles Depp (as often is the case) steals the show as the staggering Jack whose a crafty sort but more lucky than anything. Rush chews the scenery in his own right leading up to a knock-down, drag-out with Sparrow. Good fun for the family, just keep your hands in the car.
10.0~Truly Amazing Ben_Haigh Sign in Permalink This film is amazingly stunning!!! I have been to the cinema 7 times to see it, and each time see something new, I didnt see before hand!!! The film has a fantastic story line, some amazing special effects, and some comedy to die for!!!. The acting in POTC is fantastic, and Keira Knightley is stunningly beautiful and very funny. Orlando Bloom is a little wooden, but still good, but Johnny Depp steals the show with his characterisation of Captain Jack Sparrow. He has a very strong character, with a great voice, attitude and appearance. Fantastic!!!
10.0~Best Movie Ever. So Interesting!!! georgeina Sign in Permalink I thought this movie was great. I loved all the twists and turns in the end. It was a great feel good kind of movie. It broke free of the usual Disney style. But it did have exceptionell special effects. And an extremely hot actor Johnny Depp,who plays Captain Jack Sparrow. A drunken, rum lovin, tanned, hot, intelligent pirate. Johnny Depp is definatly what made this movie so great. NO other actor casted could have played the role of Jack Sparow as good as Depp. I think his preformance was incredible. I loved him as Jack Sparow and as his role as Mort Rainey in his latest movie "Secret Window". All in all I believe that this movie deserves 10 out of 10 because of Johnny Depp the best looking actor in the entire world, oh, yes, plus the fact that the plot was intriging and so very interesting.
2.0~Waste of time imdb-319 Sign in Permalink This movie was awful. No nice, big sets Ugly costumes Bad makeup (dark eyes) No tension, no character development Forseeable story line Full of pirates cliches (parrot on shoulder) (Sorry for my bad english, I'm German)
9.0~ARRRGHHH Totally Shivered my timbers! Shailyn20 Sign in Permalink Was a wonderfull movie, Johnny Depp stole the show as Jack Sparrow, hes crazy and endearing. Orlando Bloom, was terribly good looking, and rather amusing as well, his character didnt seem to stand up with jack sparrows character, but Orlando did a fine job anway.Keira knightly was gorgeous and not annoying has the leading lady. Generally I really really enjoyed it. Geoffrey Rush was wonderfull as your undead villian. Special effects were fantstical, You didnt even really think about them being there. All around i highly enjoyed it and recommend it highly!
10.0~The second best movie ever made! The best movie ever made was its sequel, Dead Man's Chest! ajaws4ever Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, includes a definite top-notch, all-star, brilliant, and outstanding cast that includes Johnny Depp (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Secret Window), Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings trilogy), and Keira Knightley (The Jacket, Domino), and Geoffery Rush (Finding Nemo, Munich), one of the best casts I have seen, well, ever. The acting was pitch-perfect in this film. In fact, the acting was so good, it couldn't get any better! The special effects were spectacular. The make-up was awesome. The editing, the music, the story, everything was just fantastic! Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer definitely did a good job on producing this film! Not only was this movie totally filled with action, but there was a lot of humor in it, too. Johnny Depp did a great job with the acting and the funny humor and the hilarious disgusted or happy facial features. You'll have to see the film to get what I mean with the whole facial feature thing. Anyway, I recommend not letting any child under the age of 8 to see this film. There are a lot of scary images of rotting flesh and undead corpses. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl definitely deserves a 10 out of 10 starts. Even better. Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Action/Adventure Violence My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Intense Sequences of Action/Adventure Violence My Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence
5.0~dull,dull,dull....(spoilers maybe,i'm new user) graypilgrimofmiddlearth Sign in Permalink Before seeing it,I expected to relax and enjoy myself,but instead of dead i found myself almost asleep in the cinema because I couldn't stand the bordom.Why?Primarily,the script is mixture of everything;first it is a pirate movie,then it is love story,then a story about revenge and honour(revenge theme is being quite popular in hollywood this autumn,Mystic River for example).The problem is that neither of stories functions too well.Characters are not interesting and actors ,not including Depp, and Rush,failed in intepretation of characters.Orlando Bloom 'brilliantly' playing his role as if he was once again Legolas,but this time without blond wig.He even had a bit more lines to say then in the LOTR.Visually it's impressive,few jokes are funny (all of them are Depp's).In one scene when the girl realises she is on the cursed ship and sees 'pirates' working I was horrified that they are going to sing (Disney!!!).I rated the film 5/10 for only Depp's performance .
6.0~"You are the most pathetic pirate I've ever heard of." "But you heard about me!" blacktouring Sign in Permalink Yes, we not only heard about Captain Jack Sparrow, but we saw him with our own eyes in three wonderful films. And it was from the adventures of the Black Pearl that everything began: chases, betrayals, unusual surprises, adventures, curses, love, etc. - all that is inherent in the films of the genre adventure. The first part of the great saga does not shine with a huge amount of all of the above. There are generally two memorable scenes for the modern, spoiled viewer. But there are charismatic heroes in it that will be remembered by any audience forever. First of all, Jack Sparrow, who was played by Johnny Depp. I think the pirate's lineup will be like Depp's brand after a delightful trilogy. But we know that Jonia is able to play any role.
6.0~Decent! tyler-bruce23 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view. Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people. Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity. Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates. The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it. The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the British fleet. A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book.
2.0~Why is anyone seeing this movie twice???????? lucretiagooch Sign in Permalink I was so bored with the fighting at the end, it ruined the whole movie. And why does Johnny Depp sound like he's drunk, but hardly ever drinks? The special effects were nothing compared to other movies this summer. I think I'll go see "Seabiscuit" again, so I can forget about this stinker.
5.0~Good Idea gone bad! smryab@excite.com Sign in Permalink Let me start by saying that Johnny Depp was great in this movie, as expected... The movie it self was pretty average with a very lame ending! It could have also been an hour shorter... Pretty predictable and not much new really...
8.0~Probably the Best Movie Ever Based on a Theme-Park Ride RobertF87 Sign in Permalink This film, which was based on a popular theme-park ride at Disneyland, came out about four years ago now and was really not expected to do very well. However it managed to become one of the major box-office hits of 2003. Set, presumably sometime in the 18th Century, the film depicts the Caribbean port town of Port Royal attacked by pirates, who kidnap the daughter (Keira Knightley) of the town's governor. Of course, the local apprentice blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) determines to save her with the help of flamboyant pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). The film mixes action, adventure and fantasy into a very entertaining whole. The film is very well-made with some superb special effects and production design, it's also fairly well-acted especially Johnny Depp successfully blending ridiculousness and heroism as Captain Jack Sparrow. it manages to balance the humour and action pretty well, for the most part, although the film is at times overlong.
10.0~A Pirates Life For Me sexy_pisces_gal Sign in Permalink With the cross of a sword and the firing of gunpowder, you'll be hard pressed not to fall in love with this story of betrayal and adventure. Johnny Depp stars in this epic blockbuster as the infamous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, a man with charm, roguish good looks, and the determination to reclaim his ship the Black Pearl, after he was the victim of a mutiny from his ship mates. What he doesn't know that in the town of Port Royal, the governors' daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) has been kidnapped by his deadly rival Captain Barbossa, (Geoffrey Rush) the man who stole his ship. Teaming up with the Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) the pair embarks on a perilous journey to save Elizabeth and reclaim the Black Pearl. What they don't know is a deadly curse has forced Barbossa and his evil crew to live forever as the undead.
7.0~A Bombastic Start to a Franchise gavin6942 Sign in Permalink Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with eccentric pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead. Although he has been around since the early 1980s, and has made such great films as "Edward Scissorhands", this is now the role Depp is best known for. And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in "Into the Woods" has its charms). Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie. Even if the soundtrack existed and the screen was blank, the film would deserve credit just for the score. Not many films could claim this, but "Pirates" can.
10.0~Gotta love that hat!!! ButWhyIzRumGone Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is da best movie eva!!!!! "You see me, I'm dishonest and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you've got to watch out for, because you never know when they're going to do something incredibly stupid..." - CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow "So,you see, we're all men of our word really, except for Elizabeth who is in fact a woman!" - CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow " "Musta been Terrible for you Jack" WELL IT BLOODY IS NOW!!!" - CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow
10.0~Loved it. Libertybelle96 Sign in Permalink I did not originally see the movie in the theater but rented it when it came out on video and loved it. I have eventually bought it and have watched it so many times I have lost count. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was really good and you couldn't help but love him. I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one.
10.0~I be a Pirate of the Seven Seas! seanathome00 Sign in Permalink Arr! Ye should see Pirates of the Caribbean once or twice ye swobs! And git ready for the delightful sequel to the movie, which is coming out in June 2006! I can't wait for that movie! But can ye stand the long and perilous journey of awaiting the movie? I would hope so! Keep sailing ye ship mates! Keep on sailing ye ship mates! -Sean P. at St. Charles- -Summer is ALMOST here! I can't wait to enter High School!- -"You are, without a doubt, the worst pirate I have ever heard of," Commodore Norrington -"You don't know what this is, do ya?" Captain Barbossa
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean was a Fantastic film magicalpirate Sign in Permalink i do not know why all of you people are putting pirates of the Caribbean down it was a fantastic film and i can not wait for the second one Johnny, Orlando, Keira,Geoffrey and Jack Davenport were all fantastic it was shot in a fantastic place, great scripts great jokes and all together a great film. Johnny Depps wonderful drunk kind of pirate look went great with his funny walk (inspired by Keith Richards (rolling stones)) Orlando Bloom's brave yet caring character went really well he was the hero with great looks and great talent Keira Knightly is so young and so beautiful her character of the damsel in distress but also shows that she can really kick butt Geoffrey Rush's Character of the cold hearted and cold blooded Captain Barbossa suited him well with his witty lines and great monkey. Jack Davenport's character of Commodore Norrington with the brave and maybe a little romantic at heart.
10.0~Best Pirate Movie mtilds Sign in Permalink If your a fan of Geoffery Rush, Johnny Depp, or Orlando Bloom, this is not a film to pass up or miss. Best Summer Film of 2003. Best Film in Summer of 2003 to have excellent Actors, Story, Music, Comedy, Special Effects, Costume, and Makeup. Best to Buy rather than to rent. Is a CLASSIC.
9.0~Captain Jack Sparrow! RanJith_C Sign in Permalink Whenever I hear the bgm, I sing along with it. A big salute for those who made it. Johnny depp is most famous in his role in the pirates of the Caribbean movie series. He we can't predict whether he is planned or doing things with the flow. The characters all have done well. Villain and his crew, and of course the black pearl is the core of the movie. An all-time entertainer.
8.0~Argghhh dave8436 Sign in Permalink Sure, the plot was stupid and had plenty of holes, but I left the theater feeling entertained primarily because of Depp's brilliant characterization. But I was wondering near the end how Knightly got that British uniform tailored to fit so well.
7.0~Disneys classic story andro-dolic Sign in Permalink As children everyone liked Disney everybody liked Disneys stories . This one was very impressive and maybe curious . Pirates of Caribbean are bringing some new dimension and the are really entertaining . This is one good classic and I really liked it . Scenes were impressive and they are well made . Whole movie is very adventurous and it is so good . Maybe movie will look like some fairytale but it is so attractive that I wanted to watch and other movies from this serial . Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow had stunning performance . Keira Knightley was also very good but maybe sometimes too childish . Orlando Bloom didn't impress me so much because of his maybe too uninteresting performance . Other characters were looking simply good . This movie in comparison with others is maybe too simply.
7.0~A giant, thrilling roller coaster-ride, indeed Coventry Sign in Permalink To be totally honest...I didn't join the hype and the worldwide enthusiasm when this movie was first announced. I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last "rebel" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By "rebel" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making. Pirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of "250 best movies ever" here on this website...That may be a bit soon, I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not. But hey, no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself, actually. This topic seemed to be "cursed" to itself ( oh, sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it, back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold. Yes, Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role, so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time, even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general, I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were for the used language alone !! I love expressions like " Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker" and several other, typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film, I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI, I complain about this matter on most modern films, but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best, otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!
5.0~Yawnsome -should have remained as the Walt Disney World theme park ride it is inspired by Jenny Ho Sign in Permalink As a child, Elizabeth Swann spots Will Turner floating unconscious in the water when she is at sea with her father, the British Governor. After Will has been rescued, Elizabeth discovers and takes the coin hanging around his neck (a sign that Will is a pirate). As an adult, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) wears this coin round her own neck and because of this, she is kidnapped by the crew of pirate ship, the Black Pearl who are cursed to sail the seas in a ghostly zombie-like state. Only when the coin is returned to its treasure chest will this curse be lifted. It is then up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with the help of pirate Jack Sparrow to rescue the Governor's daughter. A good selling point of the film is its cast which includes pretty actors Bloom, Knightley and Depp (personally, I don't know what the fuss is about with Orlando Bloom to me he is merely a younger version of Antonio Banderas). Depp gives a likeable but over-the performance as the drunk and cockney accented Jack Sparrow and other big names include Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, the captain of the Black Pearl, and Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's Governor father. Also, look out for Gareth of The Office' fame as one of the pirates! All seem to be having fun with some acting more befitting to a pantomime than a film. The main problem I have with this film is that the pirate concept holds little interest for me (I am however, slightly amused by the obligatory Oooh Arrr's in pirate speak). The main source of excitement is the fight sequences during which we see some good special effects of the crew of the Black Pearl appearing as a combination of skeleton and rotting flesh when exposed to direct moonlight. However, the fighting soon becomes dull and repetitive. Because the villains are already dead, there does not appear to be a quick resolution and as a result, the film is painfully drawn out to well over two hours in length. Young children and those who are intrigued and excited by the prospect of pretty actors romping about and fighting on ships and the hoisting of the Jolly Roger will probably enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean'. If you arrive to the cinema in a panto frame of mind, you will have a lot of fun but unfortunately the film left this viewer cold.
8.0~This is the Kind of Movie That Improves the More You Watch It. Evil_Magus Sign in Permalink When I saw this movie, I was surprised ---no--- out right stunned as to the kind of movie that could be made based off of a Disney ride. This isn't some simple point "A" to point "B" plot, these characters aren't mechanical merry-men and the score isn't the work of some back-stage maestro on a keyboard. Everything about this movie was incredible and surprising, and the more I watched it the greater it seemed to become. The acting of this film was outstanding, with a full and able a cast as could be wanted. The greatest was, of course, Johnny Depp's performance. He always chooses very quirky, very unique and singular, characters to play, and Captain Jack Sparrow fits Depp's natural tendencies. He's a quirky and awkward character who acts as if in a perpetual drunken and ataxic stagger. Accompanied with typically slurred words and uncomfortable body language, this would, in the hands of most other actors, be an awkward and uneven performance. But Depp pulls it off flawlessly in this striking and memorable addition to his acting repertoire. Orlando Bloom, fresh off of his work as The Lord of the Ring's Legolas Greenleaf, plays the blacksmith William Turner, and easily holds his own next to Depp. While his part is not nearly so... colorful... it is, nonetheless, equally memorable. He is a believable performer who has noticeably grown from his Lord of the Rings performance. He acts as the antithesis of Depp's character; a serious and emotional individual to contrast with Depp's quirky and aloof character. This, personally, is my favorite performance of Kiera Knightley's, even overshadowing her Oscar-nominated performance in 2005's Pride & Prejudice. While this role is clearly not meant to showcase her talents, nor is it as necessarily deep or spotlighted as Elizabeth Bennet's, it is a clear and charming performance. She takes on a somewhat comedic supporting role and really shine in it. Her timing matches up well with her costars'; her comedic delivery leaves nothing to be desired. She's rather impressive in a role that could have become another "damsel in distress" awaiting rescuing in the hands of a lesser actress. The remainder supporting cast all deserve mention for their talents. Geoffrey Rush shines marvelously as the villainous Captain Barbossa, Jack Davenport gives a stiff yet convincing performance as Commodore Norington and Jonathon Pryce give a light comedic performance as Governor Swan. Even David Bailie and Lee Arenberg played pleasant comedic performances as Cotten and Pintel, despite also playing the parts of decent villains. The score was absolutely outstanding, a singular masterpiece all its own. Every song, every line, every measure, every note, is so striking that by simply listening to the score on its own you can tell exactly what part of the movie would be playing alongside it. It stands as one of my favorite movie scores, and Klaus Badelt has nestled himself along such greats as John Williams, Howard Shore, Danny Elfman and Elmer Bernstein. I personally preferred it to Return of the King's score (Which is really, really saying something, as that was a masterful composition), and the fact that this wasn't even NOMINATED for best score is a travesty to the history of the Academy Awards. Visually, it was outstanding. The special effects for the undead pirate crew were pretty impressive. But they weren't overly obtrusive; for how obvious they were, the effects were actually rather subtle still. The only part where they become a little hokey is when Kiera Knightley's launched into the air on a sort of trampoline. Other than that, the effect were flawless. Overall, this is an excellent movie; perfect for families, action fans, comedy fans and fans of any of the main actors/actresses. It is certainly deserving of all the praise it's received as well as it's position on the IMDb top 250 (currently 237). This is a surprising gem of a movie, and one that it's quite difficult to find a person who absolutely dislikes it. It's a very safe movie to recommend to everybody.
10.0~Best Movie Ever!!! georgeina Sign in Permalink This is my favorite Disney movie ever. I've watched it nearly one hundred times and haven't gotten sick of it yet. Possibly because Johnny Depp is so hot that it's impossible to get tired of watching it. Also, I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns in the plot. The plot was extremely well thought out. I am interested though to see if the second Pirates of the Caribean movie can match up to the first. I give this movie an 11 out of 10 because Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was just so beleiveable and incredible. No one,I mean no one could have played Jack Sparrow as good as Depp did.( he was made for that role) He is just such an accomplished actor that has a natural talent in acting. Johnny won the screen actors guild award for this movie and was nominated for a golden globe and an oscar. Although he lost out to Bill Murry and Sean Penn he will always be number one in my heart. Because of this movie I became an even bigger fan of Disney and gained more respect for Disney. I await the release of the sequil!!!

4.0~I'm cursed by the black sleep (dad) leplatypus Sign in Permalink In 2011, i tried opus 4 with Penelope and it was so slow, so dark that I felt asleep in my seat ! Now it's the second (!) time i try to watch this DVD because of Keira and it happens again ! even if the production is baroque and visually stunning, the pace of the movie is terribly dull and its attraction wagon moves faster and is more exciting ! Sure there is efforts to have a dense story and there are strong characters and funny back roles as well, but the way it's told and filmed isn't dynamic : so it's a pure Disney movie as every age can follow what happens on screen, old or young ! The action sequences are quite boring and repetitive, Deep gets irritating with his pantomimes, Pryce with his usual dandy manner (he is not John Cleese !) and getting aboard and out of ships isn't really exciting at the end ! With this dragging ambiance, i felt again asleep when Keira was abducted ! At least she was here because she is really the revelation of this movie as well as the fighting skeletons by moonlight ! Withtout them, i couldn't have sustain such a long movie for which i have the big feeling to have seen it already before !
4.0~Boring SilkTork Sign in Permalink A tiresome Walt Disney kiddies movie with appalling dialogue and a Bodger Award for the most dreadful performance by a leading actor in a major movie of all time. Everyone just woodenly and stiffly and badly moves through this movie repeating their dreadful lines with a lack of enthusiasm. Some embarrassment is evident. The storyline is pathetic and boring and dull. The initial action is limp and dull. In fact dull is the key word. Dull and boring and bad and wooden. And how on earth did this ever get filmed. Surely it can't be that hard to make an exciting, interesting and worthy pirate movie in such pleasant locations? The movie does pick up toward the end with some decent fight scenes, and a bit of swashbuckling, but it's too little too late.
10.0~Fun fun fun isabelbutic Sign in Permalink I saw the previews for this movie in the theatres, but thought that watching it would probably lower my IQ somehow. When I heard that it was a summer hit, I scoffed thinking "it figures." But after a friend told me it's not that stupid and Johnny Depp gives a good performance, I rented it. I'm glad I did, since it's really fun, but not mind numbingly preposterous. Depp is stunning. Captain Jack just oozes charisma, and I eagerly awaited his return when he wasn't onscreen. I had no idea what this film was about, so the little twist was a complete shocker and quiet scary! I think Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for his performance. Granted, the other guys gave powerful performances and what not. But Depp did too, and he took a lot of risks in his! None of the other nominees stole every scene of their respective movies. Also, their character portrayals were easily dictated by the script. But Depp created someone refreshing and new. The only thing I could say is that this movie is waaay too long. Three hours? And the fight scene in the cave had a few to many 'twists.' It didn't really need them. Oh well. It's still good over all. I'm glad that they are making a sequel.
10.0~Get ready for a swashbuckling adventure! tinkerbellem Sign in Permalink Before this film i had never heard of Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly or Geoffery Rush but i had heard of Orlando Bloom. I had never even seen the trailer to 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! My sister first saw the film and told me so much about it and told me that I really should go and see it with her... I kept on saying no because it just didn't appeal to me. I then spoke to other people about it who said it was great so i finally decided to go and see it. From start to finish i was taken on a swashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have... love, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after treasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp... playing the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in the film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up taking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love with the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her. However the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they must repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you can see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be trusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the pirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse? Watch this film as it is perfect for anyone! This film is one of the best epics every made! Watch it...you will not be disappointed!
10.0~Very entertaining!! Ajk2386 Sign in Permalink This movie isn't critically "a masterpiece" but it sure is fun to watch. Every time Jack Sparrow was on screen he was fantastic and the ocean scenery was beautiful. I can definitely see myself watching this movie for years to come.
5.0~The best. Forget the rest studioAT Sign in Permalink With every additional sequel the 'Pirates' saga has become bloated and weighed down by its own sense of whimsy and importance. And why do they have to be so bum-numbingly long?! However it is important to remember that this first entry was actually pretty good and contained lots of good moments. Johnny Depp is on fine form as Captain Jack and the Will/Elizabeth romance is not nearly as annoying as it would become in later instalments. It's a good stand alone film really but you can understand why Disney, faced with a surprise hit, would want to milk it for all its worth. Sadly though, the more films that are produced the more the reputation of what once was a strong franchise is weakened.
10.0~I loved it!!!!!!1 booboo-52 Sign in Permalink I thought that this movie was sooooooo good. I love Johnny and Orlando so it all worked out for me. Jack Sparrow is known for being a trouble-maker, thief, and and impersonator. When he comes to Port Royal, He comes across the Govoner's daughter, who is in the possession of a piece of Aztec Gold, he is concocting a plan of attack. With the help of Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) they set out to retrieve Elizabeth(Kiera Knightly). They go to the secret hiding place of the "cursed pirates" and watch as they sacrifice the blood of Elizabeth. In the end the "cursed pirates" are cursed no longer, thanks to the great fighting skills of Jack and Will. All Johnny and Orlando fans should see this movie and the movies to come.
8.0~Awesome The-Social-Introvert Sign in Permalink This is such a gem of a movie. It came out of nowhere and with little expectations, reigniting film fans' love of pirate adventures. The fact that it had no expectation contrasts with its sequels, which is why it was probably so successful. You've got the classic pirate villain (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush – my favourite character of the films), great CGI, and some incredibly witty scenes. Let's not forget Jonny Depp's outstanding, unforgettable and charismatic portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. It seems he was supposed to be an appealing supporting character, and yet shoved the cliché love plot out of the way and made the film his own. Very little can be said of this film in a negative light. It was clever, witty and sharp. One of the true achievements, however, was that it wasn't too witty and sharp – it knew its boundaries, unlike the sequels. The seriousness of the situations these characters were put in felt real. Therefore, we cared about what happened to them. Despite my eagerness for the upcoming film, I can't see it topping The Curse of the Black Pearl. In fact, I can't see any pirate film surpassing one of the landmark movies of the past decade, aside from Master and Commander. Great Stuff.
10.0~The night my dog was poisoned. serafinogm Sign in Permalink What an incredible, dashing, romantic and fun-filled adventure was the unexpectedly good film "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". Johnny Depp's performance is universally extolled and rightfully so however for me the tour de force performance was that of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Rush morphed into an 18th century pirate from the golden-age of piracy and for me his performance is the gold standard for portraying a pirate. Good performances abound in the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series (it should have been the first and last but greedy studio executives had to soil a good thing for a buck) it wasn't merely the Depp and Rush performances there was also the performance of lovely and delightful femme fatale Elizabeth Swann (aka. Keira Knightly), the noble and proud Norrington (Jack Davenport), the amusing but sinister Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and many other convincing performances as well. It simply is the epitome of movie entertainment, it's a movie worthy of the price of admission!
1.0~There has to be something to this movie...doesn't there? BJS Sign in Permalink I had misgivings when I learned this was a Disney production and I should have let my instincts rule. For me, five words summed it all up "A waste of my time". If I'd sat through the whole movie, then I'd have written "A colossal waste of time". Perhaps it's an age thing but for the life of me I couldn't fathom the demographics of this movie. I have to add that Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors as a rule but this role..... Bjs
9.0~A wonderful adventure film. lorenz4815 Sign in Permalink This movie was one of the best action/adventure films in the last decade. It is an adventure film, with a lot of genres involved. There is a handful of fun action, a lot of funny dialog, and some character development for the drama. It is an all ages movie. I think this is Johnny Depp's best role. The supporting actors are also up there in performance. This is a first of its kind being very unique in many ways. Its all about pirates on the seas and hunting for treasure and the like, nut it puts a whole twist into it with the funny side remarks and the family adventure style. If you enjoy watching fun effects and beautiful scenery and like a good old fashioned adventure film, this is definitely for you!
5.0~High production values do not cancel out the mostly hollow affair oneloveall Sign in Permalink This big budget swashbuckler reinstated Hollywood's interest in pirates, reaffirmed Johhny Depp as a bankable mainstream leading man, and refocused the industry with it's surprisingly high box office performance, followed by an even more surprising (though widely regarded as inferior) net gain from it's sequel. So why did I not have half the fun as I was anticipating with The Curse of the Black Pearl? Despite having all the key ingredients at making this rousing adventure come to life, Pirates still flounders with a repetitious script, an overkill of production, and of course the general disengaged, auto-piloted mentality that one immediately associates with any massive studio release. Yes, Depp's inspired take as the woozy captain Jack Sparrow does breathe some fresh air into the stale script, though his acting, more often then not, devolves into processed caricature rather then the engaged perceptiveness we are used to seeing from an accomplished actor such as Depp. Also, the casting of uber-talented Geoffry Rush did help break up much of the monotony the time-killing script wished to parlay. Ultimately though, these elevated Hollywood performances are buried under ten tons of sheen, smoke, and explosions that could only be appropriately titled "The Bruckheimer effect" which finds the mega- producer, as usual, filling in any actual emotional content with a barrage of over-excessive special effects and action sequencing. Shame too, because with Depp at the helm, and the few scenes that show off the inherent humor, personality and flavor this franchise could have offered, it became obvious that this could have been so much more memorable then the hollow ride it turns out to be. As far as popcorn family entertainment goes, I can justify the massive amount of success the movie has reaped, although to elevate this movie past the point of good, into the realm of great, as many reviewers have done, seems well overrated, as I mostly spent my two and a half hours waiting for the resolution in this lackluster plot.
10.0~The most amazing movie s1l2r3 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was the most amazing movie I have ever seen in my entire life! It's a movie that can easily be watched over and over again without getting old or boring. The acting is amazing as well as the plot! The costumes are amazing as well! The ENTIRE movie is AMAZING! You should definitely see this movie! WARNING: Watching this movie may get you obsessed with johnny depp!
8.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl! tbills2 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a bona fide classic, one of my 50 favorite movies! Capt. Jack Sparrow is a hero for the ages! brought to life by the lovely Johnny Depp. Depp gives a swashbuckling original performance. Curse of the Black Pearl is high seas adventure to the very end, barrels and barrels of fun! It's good and fun for every last second! Captain Jack's character introduction is excellent, at the very beginning when he first steps onto the docks from his sinking sail ship, I love that! It reveals Jack's sloppy and resourceful being as a pirate. Depp acts brilliantly and totally brings out the best in Sparrow. He acts like a drunkard. I can imagine how much fun this role would have been for Depp. The nomination was good but he should have brought home the Oscar. Orlando Bloom's attractive as young Will Turner. Depp and Bloom alone are plenty amusement for the ladies. Keira Knightley looks amazing as Elizabeth Swann as she's wonderful. She's just too good of an actress, better than even Rush or Depp. Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa, a creative and fun villain. The 1st Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one worth its weight in gold. The sequels pale in comparison. Each of the Pirates of the Caribbeans are worthy for Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack character if nothing else, but the 1st Pirates is the only one that's really well-crafted. Curse of the Black Pearl has great writing, gorgeous cinematography and sharp, learned dialogue. I love the visuals of this film! Pirates is funny and is one awesome family adventure! Pirates of the Caribbean is a great tale filled with interesting characters, pretty landscapes, and extravagant sets. It's really always a good viewing, it's harmless fun, and it never grows old! It'll really lightens your spirits. Pirates of the Caribbean is stylishly artful, but also, it's really very fun!
10.0~The most entertaining movie of 2003 prawnny Sign in Permalink I didn't expect this movie to be so funny before I got into the cinema. Johnny Depp's performance was marvellous. He made me laugh all the way from the beginning till the end. The script was nicely written and there are so many memorable quotes that still make me laugh whenever I read them. People are surprised of the 2004 Oscar nomination for Depp but not me. I think he deserves it and it's been such a long wait for such a talented actor like him. Of course I hope he wins but with strong contenders like Bill Murray and co.... okay, I still hope he wins. I'm glad they're planning to make a sequel but I hope the script is equally great as the original one. Can't wait til the sequel's out!
10.0~best movie fashionheiress56 Sign in Permalink i saw it a long long time and i liked it no i loved it. it was excellent i am going to watch the new movie Johnny Depp was great. and so does Keira Knigthley i am going to watch it another time if you didn't watch it you need to watch it. you will love it it has action and adventure and zombies but who are afraid of zombies? its not suitable for kids but some kids that have 13 years old and more can watch it. great movie i can't wait to watch the 2 or even if its a long long trilogy i will watch it. 10/10 or even 1000/1000
9.0~Very entertaining! freeman91 Sign in Permalink When Pirates of the Caribbean trailers first started showing, it looked like a good, fun, pirate movie. Nothing incredibly special, but still a nice looking movie. After all, everyone loves pirates ;) But after seeing it, you realize it IS incredibly special, an unbelievably entertaining, exciting, suspenseful, action-packed, funny, movie. Johnny Depp is absolutely phenomenal as he plays the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, who is an immensely funny character. Everyone else does great as well! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom do a great job together! Pirates of the Caribbean has everything you could ask for and more, and at the end of it you feel happy and complete. Gore Verbinski did an excellent job and it moves nicely. Everything seems to be in the right place at the right time and it rolls smoothly towards the end with no real plot holes. What small errors there are you most likely won't even notice due to the fact there is always something going on, so you won't find your eyes wondering other places. I gave it a 9 of course which is pretty much the highest rating I plan on giving until the perfect movie is made, and who knows, it might just be Pirates of the Caribbean 2! Or to sum it all up, it belongs on anyone who likes movies top list! ;)
8.0~Very, very good. But not perfect. tenten76 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp is superb. He makes the movie, hands down, and I couldn't imagine it being anywhere near as good without his magnetic, amusing performance. The film/locations look stunning, and the story is good. In fact, there's very little wrong with this fun adventure - the effects are superb (especially fighting in & out of the moonlight) - but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype (everyone I know said it was fantastic, but I see a lot more films than they do). First off, the pacing drags here and there (not really during scenes, but between the set-pieces). The swordfights (and other fighting bits) are inventive, but let down by lacklustre angles and editing. And in the script, they've tried (a bit too hard) to make comedy duos out of two of the royal officers, and two of the pirates, with scenes that would fit right into a Disney cartoon but only serve to hold up the story in this live action film. And while Geoffrey Rush is always great to watch, he just isn't evil enough. In fact, I think that's the real fault of the film - it's written as if it were a cartoon. For a comparison, it's not as good as The Goonies. But go see it. Johnny Depp = most entertaining performance so far this year.
10.0~A film to salute, The Curse of the Black Pearl. Bchibell12 Sign in Permalink I'm trying to think of words to as not to give away any plots or spoilers about this fantastic movie, while at the same time wishing I could just repeat some of the memorable lines said by some of the greatest characters ever imagined to grace the cinema. Yes, the curse of the Black Pearl is what film-making to me is all about. As I stretched my eyes to see if possibly someone with my last name added to the production of The Black Pearl, I embraced all those that were responsible for it. Truly a classic film that has it all adventure, drama, a sense of dignity that caresses the audience with an appeal towards the characters and story-line, and of course love, love of life and freedom.
5.0~Depp was great. Too much cheese. ohfreak Sign in Permalink Maybe I was in a bad mood, but I just couldn't help thinking that they went a bit overboard on the CHEESE. Can I have ONE film without a lame love-interest blah blah blah blah blah. Also annoying: continually cutting to useless shots of the big, beaded black dude and the cross-dressing couple in the rowboat. Depp of course was nifty.
10.0~The gem of the franchise walsh-22 Sign in Permalink I can't believe they based the film on the Pirate ride at Disney (I have to confess, it is my favourite ride at the Magic Kingdom). I thought it was genius they could do a 143 minute film and have a plot that wasn't light and had plenty of weight to it. Out of the three movies, this is my favourite. It was the first film in a while to tackle pirates and cover all the key elements of pirate movies in the past- lovely locations, a love story that had the right amount of attention but wasn't the main focus of the plot, great action sequences. Then this film updated it in such a way that modern audiences wouldn't be put off watching this type of film which probably happened in the past as they just didn't know how to make a successful pirate film to appeal to their audience at the time. I thought it was an interesting idea to have the pirates cursed and that they couldn't be killed. The cast was brilliant, I loved the romance between Elizabeth and Will but who I enjoyed watching the most was obviously Johnny Depp. He had a really fantastic idea about making Jack Sparrow very rock n' roll and basing him on Keith Richards. He played him just right and probably made him the first anti-hero in a while that the audience was interested in watching and rooting for. The film really does have it all- stunning locations, really breathtaking. A very unique plot with many twists and turns. Unforgettible characters, incredible and scary special effects and exciting sword fights.
9.0~Funny! bluecrush92 Sign in Permalink This is a really funny movie! Johnny Depp brings so much to the character Jack Sparrow he is hysterical in this movie. Also Keira Knightley (who plays Elizabeth Swann) Is a great actress, she stole every scene! I really love this movie its an actioned packed movie but also hysterical! Great Movie! 9/10
10.0~Pirates is one of the best movies and Johnny Depp is amazing kdix-2 Sign in Permalink Having always been interested in pirates, curses, and adventures (when it comes to movie entertainment) this movie appealed to me the first time I saw a preview for it. I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??) Again, I greatly applaud Johnny Depp's performance and I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!
6.0~A Swashbuckling Bore blaster151 Sign in Permalink I thought the first forty-five minutes were very cleverly written, and Johnny Depp is inarguably a scene-stealer in this film. But the cumbersome plot turns absurd, and as soon as all the characters' energies onscreen are diverted toward the task of lifting an ancient curse (culminating in a set of dreary sea battles and chases), I lost interest. Honestly, Depp is probably what made the last half of this overly long film bearable for me. I am disappointed that Disney released such a violent movie in such kid-friendly packaging. There are a lot of callous murders of innocent townspeople here. And to put so much work into producing a film that glamorizes pirates--a word that has little meaning outside of rape, murder, robbery, and destruction--is a questionable endeavor. Think twice before you let your kids watch this one, unless they're already desensitized little bloodlusters.
7.0~Not as good as I thought it would be loco12 Sign in Permalink I have just watched the dvd of this movie and unfortunately it left me feeling it was not as good as I had hoped. The film is a bit too long and for periods nothing really seems to happen. At least 30 minutes could have been trimmed to make it a tighter, more thrilling event. Depp is the star of the show, playing Captain Sparrow with aplomb, and is well supported by Bloom, Rush and Keira Knightley, looking very dishy and a future star in the making. The effects were excellent, and the fight scene at the end where the cursed pirates pass in and out of moonlight(and passing from skeleton to full person)is extremely good. It just left me feeling it could have been done a bit better, perhaps with a stronger storyline. Still, I seem to be in the minority, as the film has made a mint and a second installment is on the way next year. 6.5/10
9.0~Most interesting Pirates movie samyaksambuddha Sign in Permalink Introduction of Jack Sparrow and his witty acting amazed us all. This was a unique concept with right blend of acting and presentation. The Captain with a ship like Jack and his amazing crew and all never forgetting. This is not only fantasy but diplomacy as well with East India Company playing its politics in the sea. What happens when the hero himself is a pirate.. Worth watching.
10.0~Very good start! love_for_nails Sign in Permalink I love this movie as much as I love the sequels as well. A very great beginning, though I must admit that regarding the special effect's and action sequences , they improve later in the following sequels. Nevertheless, the film is great. The plot is twisted and catchy, the action sequences are great also, especially the battle between the two ships later in the movie, the actors are very talented, they made each of their character unique and lovable, and last but not least the score is amazing and draws perfect with the epic scenes, Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer did a perfect job. An awesome movie, surely worth watching. Gore Verbinski did a fantastic job. Johnny Depp portraying the funny and a bit lumpy captain Jack is beyond amazing and hilarious the same time. Geoffrey Rush portraying the cursed and twisted captain Barbossa is surely the best performance I've seen. Orlando Bloom plays the perfect knight in shinny armor for our Keira Knightley's though lady character. And also, although they play "small" character's, Lee Arenberg's and Mackenzie Crook's Pintel and Raggeti are by far the most hilarious little villains in the movie. This being said, like I mentioned earlier a great beginning for what will be an awesome series from that day forward. Congratulations to everyone who contributed in making of this movie.
7.0~A Pretty Straightforward Movie pip-7 Sign in Permalink And I really mean it! I have absolutely no idea how this pirate movie manages to enter the IMDb's Top 250 Movie List, but I guess most of you viewers love The Curse of the Black Pearl for some good reasons. However, I don't find it entirely revolutionizing in any sense. First of all, the plot's simply too straightforward in my taste (the script is pretty cheesy and tiring as well) and like any typical Hollywood movies, expect lots of the same old swashbuckling stuff and highlighted special effects without being mesmerized by its overall b-movie context. Aside of these criticisms, Johnny Depp is brilliant as the goofy Jack Sparrow but the rest of the cast is just plain OK. The Curse of the Black Pearl seems to be a no-brainer and doesn't hold my interest any longer now. If you want a quality pirate (or ship) movie, I highly recommend you to watch 'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' instead. It's far better than this dire action movie, for my sake.
10.0~This movie is really good the actors were great in this movie. SoH4TEMe Sign in Permalink This movie is really, really good.I love it a lot. Not only is it adventurous but it is has a wonderful story line. I love the pirate in this movie named Jack Sparrow. At first when you see him you think he is not that good at being a pirate for going even with a blacksmith in a sword fight. But after a while you end up realizing that Johnny Depp really does save this movie, with his skills at being an actor.
10.0~This is a Johnny Depp movie szhsub Sign in Permalink This movie really belongs to Johnny Depp. I wonder what'd have this movie done without him. I began to watch "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" without any idea of who Johnny Depp was and what this movie was about. By the end of it, I was wondering, "Who is this stunning actor acting Jack Sparrow?" I have watched some movies of Johnny Depp without being impressed by him, hence, without concerning about even his name. But this movie was elevated by none other's but Johnny Depp's acting. A movie is never complete without the team-work but someone has to be outstanding. Story, as it is obvious, is entire fiction but cleverly written and well handled. Action sequences are simple (compared to lots of other action flicks), but according to the story line, hence impressive. Special effects are stunning. All actors contributed in an impressive way. No one tried to be unreasonably clever (this is a common problem that I have noticed in Hollywood movies as non-English viewer.) It is not "just-another-pirates-movie". It is a must-watch.
8.0~it's the script, stupid... lindacamidge Sign in Permalink Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have watched this film three times in the past six months. To be frank, it's taken me that many viewings to get to grips with the plot, and to appreciate that the main star is not in fact Johnny Depp - who seems, albeit understandably, to have emerged as the new Valentino - but the scriptwriter. Those wonderful understated supporting performances, notably by the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of the British navy, were enabled - as was the virtuoso and richly-imagined representation of Jack Sparrow - by their witty and precisely crafted speech. And as for Depp, are we all absolutely sure it isn't his character we've fallen in love with? After all, I don't remember anyone saying that Edward Scissorhands was the sexiest man in the world.
9.0~Johny Depp is great! fsfrick Sign in Permalink An intriguing pirate movie. Johnny Depp's character (Cap. Jack Swallow) is exceptionally well fleshed-out and Johnny Depp plays it "to the hilt." The other characters in the movie are also well done and the plot line is complex enough to be interesting, but not too complicated as to be hard to follow. The special effects are also impressive--it's easy to get "lost at sea" in this movie. The movie succeeds in making pirates look clever and attractive, while the traditional British navy types leave something to be desired. All-in-all, this is an enjoyable flick, but one that I wouldn't want my young grandsons to watch, as I don't think they would be able to follow the plot!
8.0~very entertaining Tim_Lamballais Sign in Permalink Although Pirates Of The Caribbean contains some HUGE flaws and features an extremely cheesy ending, it's a great movie. I've seen it 3 times and I can honestly say that this is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Depp makes this movie, his character is the best thing about the whole movie. All in all this is something you don't want to miss 8/10
10.0~Best Pirat movie of our time saliaj-enea Sign in Permalink This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take- charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)
9.0~Best pirate film in the world - ever! guylikeu Sign in Permalink I love this film so much! Everything is perfect - Johnny is wonderful as Jack Sparrow, Orlando is gorgeus as the hero and alongside Keira makes the best looking and talented young couple in modern cinema. Gore Vebinski's direction is flawless; the music is fitting for every scene - a highlight is the soaring anthem for the final battle scene. And I've not even got onto the delightful support actors and the jaw-dropping special effects! Above all though, there is a strong story and script, with a perfect balance of humour, action and romance. And the DVD is great too - very highly recommended - 10/10.
9.0~A Fun Savvy Movie CrowBat2005 Sign in Permalink What can be better than seeing a movie with Johnny Depp wearing makeup? NOTHING! Seriously, what a story. The first time seeing this movie, I felt it was too good to only receive the maximum of 3 out of 4 stars, and I still don't see why. First of all, the acting leaves you wishing you were in the shoes of a pirate yourself, whether you are on the good side or the bad. Personally, this was the performance of Johnny Depp's career, though he's had many, none were as recognizable or as fun to imitate as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast is superb, the action is endless, and the comedy is more than funny. I feel this movie deserved to at least win ONE Academy Award. As for my nine out of ten rating, I've learned to accept the fact that 4 stars is the most and I've made a balance. "Pirates of the Caribbean" leaves you dying to see the second.
10.0~Best match up in Disney years. vdiane1580 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best Disney live movies I have seen in years. Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are a match made in heaven. The two them are perfectly matched, Orlando portraying a dorkish character with pirate in his blood, carried off this in a magnificent manner. Kiera's portrayal of a well-bred governor's daughter surely carried off being a pirate as well. They seemed to have known each other in a previous life able to perform perfectly and on time. They each held their own beside the veterans such as Johnny Depp and the rest of the star clad cast. Bravo to each of the new actors, Kiera and Orlando.
10.0~Best Movie of the year!! redsam_2 Sign in Permalink I aboslutely LOVED this movie! It is a movie that covers all the bases and does it well. It has nonstop humor along with nonstop action. It also has hot guys and smart witty women. The priate thing makes it unique and makes the movie one of a kind. This movie deserves best movie of the year, and I hope it gets it. If you haven't seen it, buy it and watch it, it's definelty worth the money!!
10.0~Very funny and very cleverly done Stevezilla Sign in Permalink Every now and then a movie comes along that is nothing short of sheer FUN This is one of those movies Johnny Depp adds to his already impressive list of performances the "swishbuckling" Captain Jack Sparrow Other people have said so many wonderful things so I won't need to add to them JUST SEE IT and prove me right
9.0~The definition of entertainment damonazgul Sign in Permalink I came out of this film grinning to the point of tears. I wish more movies of this type were as fun. Thats a word I love using about films, fun; I can't remember the last time I had so much fun in the theater!! And all of you who loved this film out there: BUY THE SOUNDTRACK NOW!! It,s absolutely fantastic.
7.0~X marks the spot for fun Fluke_Skywalker Sign in Permalink Plot; A pirate teams with a blacksmith in an attempt to rescue a young woman from the cursed crew of his former ship. Having not watched this since it originally hit DVD four... teen years ago (gulp), I was surprised by a number of things. For one, why did I wait so long to revisit it? I remember thinking it was fun (and at the time, refreshingly different), and the former certainly still holds true. Perhaps more surprising is Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. Over the years I've watched the various sequels (save for the latest one), and there was--if memory serves--a severe level of diminishing returns. But even more, I remember Depp's Sparrow being a total buffoon. Seeing him here I realize that what happened was that Sparrow became a caricature of the character Depp created in the original. To be sure Jack Sparrow's got some quirk to him, but he's not the ever-slurring gag-a-second clown I'd pegged him to be. He's got an edge here. A swagger. And he wears it well. Though it's a tad too long for its own good, it still moves by a brisk pace and has a tight focus. Its enormous success spawned a "Bigger is better" philosophy for at least the next two sequels, and that's a shame. I'll eventually get around to revisiting the rest of the series and seeing this Summer's sequel, but my memory says that fun walks the plank at the sword tip of spectacle.
10.0~SUPER FUNNY!! Appelviken Sign in Permalink This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, Johnny Depp is totally awesome and so funny. Orlando Bloom isn't that bad either, with other words he is wonderful. I've only seen it two times but when it comes out on DVD I'm the first person in Sweden to buy it. Johnny Depp in his best movie yet. // Madde
8.0~Bril movie! cybermansec Sign in Permalink I enjoyed this movie. Johnny was really good as a pirate and he just looks the part for a pirate (Especially when he isn't in the movies). It was very funny and very good and brings pirates back into fashion. Keeps you busy and excited throughout the whole thing. It isn't right though that they'll make two other ones or sequels to it. I'll see them don't get me wrong but this end is just wow though. I enjoyed watching it. *Spoiler part* (Look away if you don't want me to ruin it) It is about a pirate who is not afraid of meeting people who disagree with him. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith to save his girlfriend from another evil pirate who previously stole Johnny's ship. They set out to find her causing havoc everywhere. And in the end Johnny dies well not dead turns into a skeleton when fighting Barbossa and kills him. That's it really but if I didn't make it sound that good go see it anyway. End of review. But I'm giving it 8/10 because it's to good. S E E Y A!
10.0~Love this movie nehapatel-98000 Sign in Permalink Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, is a unique character. He's a funny pirate who wears weird clothing and does and says weird but sometimes inspiring things. The suspense in this movie is good and the whole thing is exciting. Not to mention Jack is quite attractive! ;)
9.0~One of the very best for 03. shellco Sign in Permalink The movie turned out much better than I had expected. There was something for everyone, (action, comedy, romance, special effects). It keeps your attention throughout. The special effects did not take over the movie, as some do and the fights did not drag out. Johnny Depp did a great job of playing himself dressed in pirates clothing.
10.0~Reminded me of Saturday AM matinees. Rocking DH Sign in Permalink I did not rush out and see this film. I mean, it is based on a theme ride at Disneyland/World. Ah, but that was my mistake. I kept hearing good things about it and finally did see it. I immediately found the sound track and also purchased the 2-disc DVD set when it was released. Johnny Depp has produced a masterful characterization in CAPT. Jack Sparrow, borrowing perhaps a bit from the barge gypsy in "Chocolat". But Depp truly hones and defines the swash and the buckle in Jack Sparrow. I realize the film was released in Summer 2003 to probably help build concessions at the Disney Parks, and the Caribbean, islands, ships, and pirates are perhaps more conducive to summer movie audiences. But perhaps a slightly later release date might have helped the film garner more Oscar nominations. I regret that the music and the costumes have not been nominated. I am pleased that the Academy did single out Johnny Depp for a Best Actor nomination. I realize his chances of winning are as great a long shot as Seabiscuit's were in his career, but I, for one, hope Mr. Depp wins. Captain Jack has a thrilling physical introduction in the film and his energy just goes on and on. He has a single purpose and he keeps to it, manipulating the winds, waves, and folk that come his way. Beautifully written and acted. It is not often that a choice role combines with a commercially successful film to push an actor up into star range, but Captain Jack Sparrow has certainly done this for Mr. Depp. Mr.Bloom, Mr. Rush and Ms. Knightley are good support. Quite a romp with great swordsmanship. A really good crew assembled. "Yo ho!"
7.0~cool ugotakahashi Sign in Permalink Nice idea and a good start for a beautiful movie franchise.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean bex_4_johnny_orli Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean, WHAT A MOVIE!!!! Everyone should see it. The graphics are so cool. I hope the 2nd and the 3rd are way better with the same cast all the way through the trilogy. For those girls who just love Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, there's plenty of them in this movie. The director ( Gore Verbinski )most be really pleased about his great success on this movie. It's rated PG so those little children who are under 12, you have to wait till film comes out on DVD before you can see it. And Penny Rose ( costume designer )nice costumes!! A great thanks to the producer ( Jerry Bruckheimer )who helped a great deal on this movie. I wish I was in these great movies. I HOPE EVERYBODY WILL SEE IT AND ENJOY IT!!!!!!!
10.0~I hated films about pirates - until that movie appeared FrauSeipi Sign in Permalink Why hasn`t anybody chosen Johnny Depp for the role of a pirate before?? I hated pirate films until that movie came into the cinemas. Johnny plays Jack Sparrow brilliantly and I think Orlando Bloom is the best looking actor at the moment. I loved him in "Lord of the Rings" but I love him now as Will Turner. I hope there will be much more films with him in a leading role, he is an upcoming star!! I hope that there will be a second part and I don`t hate pirates anymore...
8.0~no heroes amongst thieves a captain with no ship a curse to be paid a legend to be told but a jolly pirate has issues a cunning plan he has so 2karl- Sign in Permalink this 2hours 17 minutes flies by I wasn't into pirates films and I was reluctant to watch but johnny Depp performance was stunning he should have got a Oscar for it totally mind blowing this film comes from producer Jerry bruckheimer who done pearl harbor and gore verbinski who made the chilling the ring brings us a thrilling high seas adventure the roguish yet charming jack sparrow idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis the wily captain barbossa a funny but charming Geoff rush but a magnificent character to life steals his ship the the black pearl the special effects this film are truly awesome especially when the moon comes out and later attack the town of port royal kidnapping the governors daughter played by keira knightly her character is Elizabeth in a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the black pearl Elizabeth childhood friend will turner played by the swashbuckling Orlando bloom joins forces with jack what will doesn't know is that s cursed treasure has doomed barbossa and his skeletal crew to live forever as the undead suspense filled adventure sword clashing action mystery and humour unforgettable characters and never before seen special effects this movie was made for the big screen straight from the Disneland it surprised everyone with 5 academy award nominations but I cant wait to see the next one
7.0~Swashbuckling good time grahamsj3 Sign in Permalink I half expected Errol Flynn to appear at any time. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley head a fine cast in this rollicking adventure about a cursed pirate crew and their quest to undo the curse. I don't want to give the story away too much, but suffice it to say that Bloom figures prominently if unwillingly in that quest. Plenty of action and adventure along with excellent at-sea shots make this a well executed film. All in all, a great time!
10.0~The Best Disney Film Ever!!! Workin_Man Sign in Permalink Well, all I can say is that Disney has finally redeemed themselves. This is the best movie that Disney has ever released in a decade. I am so glad that it is not for kids!!! It is very nice to see a Disney film that is for older audiences. A very refreshing change for Disney. Disney has been very successful with this movie and I think the sequels that they are making for this film will be very successful as well. Anyway, i'll talk about the movie now. This movie was a pleasure to watch. It had everything that makes a movie good. Humor, action, and violence. The action sequences in this film were very enjoyable to watch. My whole family watched this movie together and we all loved it! That's saying a lot because usually my parents hate these kinds of movies. However they had a lot of positive comments about this film. My verdict: This film is very enjoyable to watch and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. 10/10
9.0~Mythical The_Hateful_Citizen Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean", first of the name is an excellent film, it is undeniable. The actors are all very good, although Johnny Deep surpasses everyone from the beginning, the moment when he arrives on the mast of his ship which is mythical and which allows to make of Jack Sparrow the image of the film (then of the saga) and tying it to Johnny Deep who made him "his" character. Definitely one or THE best film about piracy on the part of a very good realization, excellent sets, special effects that have not aged and an Original Sound Track that remains and will remain in the annals of cinema, an excellent film that justifies largely a 9/10! Mythical.
1.0~Over rated. reddragon1110 Sign in Permalink The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it "The best". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great. Great visuals, a nice interesting story, good performances, good make up, but it is still and will be another blockbuster film. 7.56/100
8.0~A good movie lifted to greatness by Depp mnpollio Sign in Permalink It would seem a given that an action/adventure film based on a theme ride at Disneyland would be an underwhelming disaster. However, one would be refreshingly incorrect on that score - at least as far as this film goes. An incredibly imaginative and rousing swashbuckler directed with technical finesse by Gore Verbinski and sporting a solid screenplay. The film would have been good fun on its own merits, but it has been gifted with a tremendous lead performance by Johnny Depp as the riotous Captain Jack Sparrow - a lucky pirate rogue who manages to succeed in spite of himself. The visual effects are dazzling and the film has a spirited supporting cast. Geoffrey Rush is an intimidating villain as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley is enchanting as the gutsy governor's daughter and secret pirate groupie accidentally caught up in the adventure. Orlando Bloom brings much of the grave beauty of a young Douglas Fairbanks to his role as the more traditional hero and provides the film much of its heart. Yet the real reason to be amazed is Depp's incredible work. Any actor can take a great role and be good in it, but only a great actor can take an iffy role and turn it into a scene-stealing delight the way that Depp does here. This is the mark of a great actor and he should have walked off with the Oscar were Oscar voters not so overly entranced with Sean Penn's tiresome Method acting from Mystic River. If the film has any weakness, it is that it sports at least one ending too many and the pacing starts to flag slightly before the credits roll, but these seem trivial compared to the achievements.
2.0~Generational Gap B24 Sign in Permalink Without Johnny Depp, this basically animatronic mess would have been ignored by anyone with half a brain. But the general reactions to it underscore one aspect in particular: popular films, whether truly good or truly bad, have lately demonstrated that a large component of the viewing audience haven't a clue about what constitutes good cinematic art. While many of us of a certain age look at movies as an extension of dramatic art moving forward in time from Aristophanes to Arthur Miller, just as many if not more of us seem to evaluate them based primarily on the sort of criteria usually reserved for rating computer games and cartoons. Literature and history be damned; if it ain't got visual sparks, it ain't no good. I did manage to stay awake through this one, wondering from time to time what the hell I was doing it for. Depp provided the sole depth, an ironic gem in the midst of a sea of motile muck.
10.0~Not All Treasure Is Silver & Gold nessiea Sign in Permalink For all Johnny Depp lovers this film is undoubtedly for you. For all good movie lovers this film is for you too! Truly this film has something for everyone and is a classic. Keira Knightley plays the feisty & independent Elizabeth Swann, who should become a Disney Princess. Orlando Bloom serves as the teenage girl eye candy, but admittedly he is an OK character although Jack Sparrow (ahem, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) steals the show with his hilarious remarks. The film has a great cast and plenty of nods to the original ride from the Disney Parks. A favorite of mine is definitely Jack the Monkey, Barbossa's immortal pet monkey who was named 'Jack' to spite the human. Personally, my favorite scene is when Jack Sparrow gets marooned with Lizzie. "They'll be no living with her after this." In total, this film does not disappoint and is a fabulous tribute to Walt's vision. The cast makes it shine, the sets make it glow, and the breathtaking ambiance of it all makes it ideal for any movie night.
10.0~Excellect Picture Dusty754-1 Sign in Permalink Finally a true Walt Disney movie. This is something that would have come from Walt's own mind. Verbinski really put himself into this film. It proves that with an excellent director and an even more excellent cast, one can make a movie that keeps one on the edge of their seat. This film may start out unusual but once the burning ship scene appears, the movie is a non-stop roller coaster ride. It might slow down, but only to allow you to catch your breath for the next swash buckling scene. I truly hope that the sequel is as good. There is the possibility of Barbossa returning under the curse of Cortez. The end of the closing title shows the monkey pulling a medallion from the chest of Cortez and turning cursed. Drop the medallion on Barbossa and guess who is back. There is the possibility.
9.0~Everything in one package! A must see! aldeshsa Sign in Permalink Hello! I just came from a preview in Denver. This movie has it all. Action, adventure, comedy, romance, pirates, skeletons, references to the ride at Disneyland, one hot babe and oh yeah Depp and Bloom. Go see it at least twice!
9.0~9/10 [with explanation] frogger612 Sign in Permalink My rating: 9/10 Before the featured presentation of LotR: The Two Towers came on the screen, a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean aired. My first thought was 'Uggh.' I forgot about it for a few months, then read a few critics' reviews, which praised a movie so different from what the preview hinted at. I got interested, and decided to see what people were raving about. Then the next day, I went and saw it again... Fun and adventurous, 'Pirates' was not at all what I expected from a pirate movie, yet it was exactly what a pirate movie should be: swashbuckling fun and adventure, a bit of violence, treasure, etc. Twisting humor, romance, violence, adventure, and fantasy into a fast and involving plot, the film keeps the audience's interest the entire film. Johnny Depp [CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow] carries the movie, complete with brilliantly ridiculous attire and movements reminiscent of Keith Richards. Depp adds most of the humor to 'Pirates' with memorable one-liners and speeches. Keira Knightley [Elizabeth Swann] played her part quite well, too. This was the first film of hers I'd seen and judged her performance as excellent, fitting into all the facets of her character. Orlando Bloom [Will Turner] was watched even closer by me, since I had recently seen his debut in the LotR trilogy. He acted up to par and accented Depp's character. Geoffrey Rush [Captain Barbossa] played the evil and clever 'bad guy' and brought the cunning ship captain to life. One last aspect of this film captivated me-- the score. I can nearly hum the entire musical score from listening to the soundtrack too many times. The music is exciting and enthralling, pulling you into the action scenes and softening the deep tones for the romantic ones. In fact, that's one of the only times I've waited through the credits, just to here that final rendition of 'He's a Pirate'. Be sure to pay attention to the music--it will make your viewing that much more exciting. All in all, 'Pirates' is a well-wrapped package of entertainment and adventure that will keep you spell-bound 'til the end. Drink up me hearties, yo ho! --
8.0~great stuff artemon Sign in Permalink excellent script, and the pace is dizzying sometimes. performances remind Xmen 2, all in synergy for the movieand no primadonas. Depp is commendable neverthelles, quite funny but but a better qockney accent man!:) all others was so realistic. I just had to nug. Good film.
4.0~Just Plain Awful haddyrikabi Sign in Permalink First off, having a movie based on a Disney ride seemed ridiculous. Second, having Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom together in a movie seemed terrible. The outcome? A painful 2 hours I'll never get back. The movie doesn't even have a pirate theme. There's no stealing, killing, drinking, etc. Just fighting off fake CGI skeletons on a stupid ship. I don't know how this garbage made it to the top 250 list. The cheesy dialogue, dull action scenes, cardboard acting, lame use of CGI, and the ludicrous plot made this as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm also beginning to think this is a total chick-flick, since the only people who watch it are peppy girls who drool over Depp's fake look in the movie.
10.0~Without a doubt, the most fun movies ever made. Flyer78 Sign in Permalink The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy has always been my favorite trilogy because of the fact that one second the story will be serious and adrenaline-pumping, and the next, you will be laughing at the antics of Jack Sparrow, who is BRILLIANTLY played by Johnny Depp. But there are several other great actors that do not need to go without mentioning. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both excellent in their respective roles, and Geoffrey Rush plays a great villain in Barbossa. But the thing besides the comedy and acting that sets this movie apart is the action. All of them start off as ordinary old sword duels, but they eventually escalate into unique fights with creative use of props. All of the POTC movies are fairly long, but believe me, you will have so much fun, they seem like the normal old 2 hour movie.
8.0~Great adventure! Boba_Fett1138 Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" takes you on an adventure full with sword fights, explosions, bottles of rum and much humor. This certainly is the most fun movie of the year (yet). It's an awesome "feel good" movie. The movie has a very high entertainment value, not only because of the fun story itself but also and mainly because of Johnny Depp. It has been said many times before and it will be said many times again but Depp is fantastic in this movie! His character introduction is priceless! But let's also not forget the perfectly casted Geoffrey Rush who also seemed to have lot's of fun making this movie. The story is one big adventure and it has all the typical pirate adventure elements in it. Added to that there are the cursed ghost pirates and the British marine with as a result an even bigger adventure story. The movie is full with crazy and fun characters and there is some great dialog and much much comedy. In other words, how could you not like this movie? The musical score is awesome, even though you can hear it was done in an hurry. The music uses lot's of elements from previous Media Venture scores such as "Gladiator" and "Black Hawk Down" but it just suits the movie very well and gives it an extra cool feeling. Visually the movie looks simply amazing. The costumes are great and so are the sets. But even better are the special effects, the way the cursed pirates (and monkey) in the moonlight look is amazing. The fights are cool, however I feel that it could have used some more wide shots instead of quick fast cuts. The final fight is amazing mainly because of the special effects where the characters change from their cursed look into their normal human look and back again time after time every time when they step into the moonlight. No Oscar material, just great fun for everyone to watch over and over again! Also very recommendable if you like the "Monkey Island" games. 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
7.0~The most extraordinary special effects RenataRusso Sign in Permalink I was going to the movies to see it and when i got in i thought:" It will be another movie with beautiful people(except Geoffrey Rush),a terrible script and lots of money for Jerry Bruckheimer". I was wrong. Since The Lord of The Rings the movies will never be the same again.The magic,the cast, everything got right on it. We have to bless Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp, everyone that made it come true.But I came here to tell about visual effects.They made me want to get into the college to study it. I am 18 and I've never wanted to understand how Rivendell was made.But the pirates,I felt they were real that I could touch if I see them. Well,share my experience with another people because this magic will be forever.
10.0~Finally! Something Original! lemon-lime-pie-2 Sign in Permalink This film is absolutely breathtaking! Not only is it original, it combines a mixture of great comedy, thrills, and action. The sword fighting sequences were great and I loved the special effects. You can not hate this movie. There is nothing to hate. Johnny Depp was a comic genius in this, he got a bunch of good humor in there and Kiera Knightly was great! I adored the character Jack Sparrow and it also contained lots of other unforgettable characters. I found it hard to believe that beautiful Kiera Knightly was only 17 while filming the movie! It was absolutely original. I hate unoriginal movies especially clichéd ones. This is neither unoriginal or clichéd. It is perfect and I love the director and the writer of this movie. Cudos to you, the cast,the crew, the writers, the director and producer, yes you Jerry Bruckheimer! Bravo! You guys make an excellent team!
9.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Review akrake-85376 Sign in Permalink If you heard a movie was coming out based on a theme park ride that would seem like a ridiculous idea, right? Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" did just that. And made it a masterpiece. Although the plot is very good, it is the actors, action and use of effects that make it innovative in itself. Johnny Depp was brilliant. He is the perfect amount of strange to pull off the role of Jack Sparrow. Sparrow is stupid but also genius. One way Depp plays into this characteristic is by leaning his head in, maybe a little too close, getting in their space and in their heads with his character's sneaky, ridiculous truths. Jack Sparrow is not a good guy, but the way Depp flails his arms and wiggles his fingers makes his character funny and entertaining enough that you end up rooting for him. Depp takes "pirate" to the next level of entertainment. As Depp is an unforgettable goofy pirate, Geoffery Rush as Captain Barbosa is a villain that people will remember. Barbosa is a bad because of the circumstance of the curse, not just for the sake of being evil. However, Rush's acting gives him more character. He gives Barbosa a harsh voice, wide eyes, sneaking smile and a creepy laugh that shows he knows what he's doing and he's not joking around about breaking the curse. By being more than just a bad guy, he demands respect from not only his crew aboard the Black Pearl, but also the audience. Along with the characters, the action in the movie is also very entertaining. They have lots of cannon fires and explosions setting things on fire, like when the crew of the Black Pearl attacks the town looking for the gold coin. Along with explosions, when Will and Elizabeth's crew fights the Black Pearl, they are out of cannonballs so they began to launch things like silverware at the other ship. One fun scene is between Jack Sparrow and William Turner. It starts as a typical sword fight, but then they get launched onto the ceiling panels, where the fight gets more interesting. Additions like these are creative and something that helps make the movie memorable. By using all real people doing real stunts, they take advantage of practical effects. Disney uses practical effects in much more than just fighting. They also built their sets and all of the boats. Not only is it impressive that they built boats suitable for the sea, but they also create a storm. After Jack and his crew leave Tortuga in search of the island the Black Pearl is on, they encounter a huge storm. Instead of using CGI, the scene was created by building a boat in a large pool, creating waves and using rain machines for the storm. Using practical effects instead of special effects gives the movie an authentic feel that many movies lack. It was the small things in this movie that made it so extraordinary. The actors, set designers, and producers apart of this film helped make it different from the average summer blockbuster. They made it fun, exciting, and slightly strange. Not every movie has to be the same cookie cutter action/adventure movie. In a day and age with tons of movies available to us, it is important that a movie brings something new or interesting to the table to make a mark on the population.
9.0~It's a great movie ruffinelli_ro Sign in Permalink The first installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, "The Curse of the Balck Pearl" is the best movie from the original trilogy. Since the creators consider "On Stranger Tides" a reboot, I won't mention it except for this time. This film is about a blacksmith in some Caribbean island that tries to get his beloved one back from the pirates who kidnapped her. In the process he teams up with the eccentric but very likable Captain Jack Sparrow. We find out later that their stories are connected somehow to the mighty ship "The Black Pearl", that used to be led by Sparrow before Barbossa and the rest of the pirates took it over in a mutiny. One of the best aspects of this movie is the plot, is not simple as you might expect from a Disney movie about pirates, it's really original, with the correct amount of adventure, romance, action and fun. I wasn't excited about this film when it came out, but when I caught on TV years after its original release, I was blown away. At this point, I watched all the movies from this series and liked all of them, but this is far superior than the other two. It has some kind of magic, I was really excited when I was watching it for the first time, it made me feel something, and that is the reason why this one is better than the other two (They were not bad, but I think that they didn't match this one). It has many positive sides, like the outfits (I don't know if they were historically accurate, but they looked great nonetheless), the breathtaking scenarios, the dialog, and obviously, the actors. Every actor was great. Bloom was convincing as the reluctant pirate, Keira was charming as Elizabeth, and she is beautiful, and the rest of the cast was great also. An special mention goes to both Rush and Depp who were extremely good in their roles as Barbossa and Sparrow respectively. Even if Rush plays the bad guy, is likable as a character because he was both funny and evil, and had a strong presence on screen. I won't even try to spend words to say what everyone thinks about Sparrow, nobody could possibly play that role like Depp. But not everything is perfect in this movie. One of the negative aspects I found were some "funny" lines that felt out of place and little forced. On the other hand, it was a bit long for my taste. There are also some mistakes in the plot, but they weren't big thankfully. I recommend it to everyone because is really entertaining , it has great actors in great roles, and it was like a real adventure. You won't be disappointed
1.0~Extremely booooring tonybarker Sign in Permalink I found this to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Sword fights generally are entertaining because the suspense that the participants might get killed. But here, the participants are already dead, so who cares? The fights go on and on and on... I realize that action movies often require the viewer to let go of reality and just enjoy the mindless entertainment. But as hard as I tried to be entertained, I kept finding the movie as thrilling as a junior high ballet recital. The first part of the movie seemed promising, but it just went nowhere. I find it hard to believe that Disney's money and talent couldn't come up with something better than this...
10.0~The best film a saw in the last two years nagkar Sign in Permalink My friends always ask me about films. What shall they see? What's the latest film i saw and like it very much? I couldn't answer frankly. But now... This is a very good advanture movie with a great story. The character of Johnny Depp is very well created and magnificent. The play of Mr.Depp make this character unforgetablettable. The crew can find the optimal way between humour and action. The fighting scenes are spectacular with little bit funny. Very good. I can recommend it for everybody.
10.0~Definitely worth watching. mentalcase Sign in Permalink This was probably the greatest movie of 2003. And should be remembered for years to come. Everything from its casting, special effects, and story to it's original lines and witty characters is fantastic. It's a movie that you can never get tired of and once you watch it, you'll want to see it again and again. I haven't seen a movie yet that can compare to this extraodinary flick. So if I was you I'd get up from the computer and go rent it...savvy?
4.0~one more Depp movie isa-24 Sign in Permalink Depp looks good, but he always looks good. He alone makes the movie, and that's not lasting for the movie, only lasting for Depp. This is a tragic disappointment to those who love pirates. It follows the recent trends of dark ghost stories stylistic eye candy, but underneath it's empty. Someone said to me that it's going to be a classic, only because pirate stories tend to be. Some people can't see the forest for the trees.
10.0~10 out of 10 DrX88 Sign in Permalink I don't think I can get enough of this movie. Every actor and actress is absolutely brilliant, and plays their role perfectly. Every scene has its place and is part of the plot. Even the script is memorable and well done. Everyone deserves an award. When you see it for the first time, you see many twists, and they come together as the movie progresses. But when you see it for the second time, you pick up more on what the characters were really thinking. Overall, this movie is absolutely brilliant. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003). 10 out of 10.
10.0~Bla Bla florence_carter Sign in Permalink oh my god i love P.O.T.C, it is such a clever film. Johnny Depp is the perfect casting choice as Jack Sparrow. he is really funny, and plays the part really well. i know some people will hate me for this but Orlando Bloom really annoys me in this film and i know he plays the part well Bla Bla Bla, i just don't like him. it has such a good storyline and they perform it so well. i must have watched the film at least 10 times now and i am getting a bit tired of it but it is still one of the best films out there. i wasn't sure when i heard about the trilogy, but when i had seen all three of the films i was totally hooked. usually films get a bit boring if you have such high expectations but the next 2 films were just as good. Keira Knightley plays the part of Elizabeth Swan really well too. she really helps make the film as good as it is. it is a masterpiece of a film and everything about it is brilliant. it is a film for the whole family to enjoy and i know for certain all of mine enjoyed it. i would recommend it to anyone. 10/10 definitely.
8.0~Too Many Rules to Follow Hitchcoc Sign in Permalink I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end, and we're ready for more.
9.0~a great adventure, with one of the best characters from the movies. miguelneto-74936 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the best adventure films already made, the cast is great, Johnny Depp in his best character, with great acting, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and etc. the special effects are very good, have very good times, not to mention the mood of the film is great, has very funny moments, the picture is very good, the costumes are great, the soundtrack is excellent, especially the theme song from Jack Sparrow is one of the best characters already done, Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl has some problems, more is excellent movie with great moments and is great fun. Note 9.2
3.0~What a HUGE disappointment! spacemandc Sign in Permalink Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the "Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, "Curse of the Black Pearl," way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride. And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in – an inconsequential "pretty boy" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a "pretty bit of fluff" who was "force fed" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., "we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly "updated" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..." Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character – and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a "love interest" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in "Captain Blood" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in "Against All Flags" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely).... Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that "things would get better," i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride – and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel – BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the "perfect woman of his dreams" become the "the nightmare hag from hell"
1.0~A silly stupid bore of a film April221968 Sign in Permalink The fact this film is 18th in the all time list leaves me despairing for the future of mankind Maybe watching it on dvd is not the best place to grasp the cinematics?!??! but the whole film I have just sat through stunk so bad I needed a close peg just to get to the credits The female lead was so poor I laughed everytime she said a word.. Johhny Depp ..the man deserves an Oscar for keeping up....... or should I say (Hamming up) the Keith Richards impersonation for 2 hours of this nonsense or should that read NO SENSE ..the script sloshed about more than the Black Pearl in a force 10.. Okay its a lightweight romp , The Mummy on the high seas with a third rate Gladiator score and a plot with as many holes as the Black Pearls main mast . Maybe I should have just suspended my senses and put away my brain like all the teen dummys who made this ropey rubbish $650m ...no sorry I wont...1 out 10!
10.0~oooh, i love it moo-30 Sign in Permalink Have you seen it??? "Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl" What can i say? It is an amazing agglomeration of action and romance that leaves the viewer, well, speechless... until you have taken it all in that is!! I think, if i had to choose, the one thing that makes this film, is the casting. How those characters are brought to life is... wow! Take Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) for instance- how versatile can one man be!! but i have to say "horray" for Orlando Bloom providing the perfect balancing character to Jack (after all, a character is what the actor makes it). The single best film i have seen for a long time!!!! Watch it!!! Now!!! Go!!! Go!!!! Go!!!!!
7.0~Average abzahidab Sign in Permalink Han tou phr is a great place to work for and it is a great place to work for and it is a great place to work
4.0~goes down like a pint of grog reverend_bel Sign in Permalink A friend with whom I watched this film summed it up better than I ever could. "I've never seen such convincing effects look so unconvincing." as for the meat of the movie, without Johnny Depp, we would have walked out. he saves this from being a miserable adventure flick and makes it into a tolerable adventure flick. it's got lots of pretty visuals and swashbuckling action and whatnot, but it wasn't worth my $8.50. matinee... maybe.
10.0~Great entertainment paulfoulger Sign in Permalink This was the most fun movie of 2003. The story was original and above average, a pleasant surprise for a story based loosely on a theme park entertainment. The ghost ship and crew was a nice touch, but the show remained essentially an old fashioned adventure story, enhanced by a really good production to make everything seem believable. It had a good pace and special effects, but the strongest thing in its favor was the really good acting. Johnny Depp put in a great performance to make his character amusingly eccentric and likable, but there were other fine cast members, such as Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom, not to mention some really knavish pirates.
10.0~A great film with great acting ability, 10/10. cant wait for numbers 2 and 3 bangban_tribudiman Sign in Permalink When i first saw Pirates i was expecting a more master and commander themes. However once it started, the acting ability of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were shown from the start. I do believe that Geoffrey Rush has been forgotten for his perfect display, it was he and Depp who made the film what is still is. This movie brings a whole new dimension to pirate movies, there hasn't been one for a while and this really did set Johnny Depp onto a fligher. The acting of Kira knightly and Orlando bloom was ordinary, but they fitted perfectly into the script and had the odd descent one liner. Pirates 2 and 3 look hopeful yet i fear it could be ruined, as not every film made is capable of having sequels. The matrix was a good tell tale fact for that.
10.0~Wonderful. Extremely underrated as a true film. ajjpacifica Sign in Permalink Disney pulled the rug from under everyone when it produced a rated PG- 13 movie about some of the most terrifying men to ever walk the earth. The end result was the birth of an iconic character in Captain Jack Sparrow, whose fantastic lines and perfect delivery made him a global phenomenon. Fantastic supporting performances by Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom as well as the truly menacing Geoffrey Rush give this film an edge no one would have expected. Containing witty dialogue, masterful camera-work and visual effects, one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores (including the riveting theme "He's a Pirate"), and a story extremely quick-paced and exciting, all capped off by Depp's career- defining performance, this film at times gives a stronger adrenaline rush than the ride it's based on.
10.0~A great movie!!! marymmp2449 Sign in Permalink When the "Pirates of the Caribbean" was released, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. However, I finally managed to watch it many months later and I LOVED it! It's a breath-taking movie, with an interesting plot and great performances from the actors. Although the movie is a little bit long, nobody can get bored while watching it. What I liked most -and I think most people liked- is Johnny Depp's performance. He was GREAT, he perfectly played the role of Jack Sparrow and whenever he appeared, he was "breaking" the "gravity" that prevailed in the movie and turned everything more pleasant and funny, by reminding us that he's a really great actor, something he has already proved many times so far. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were also very good and proved that they are two talented actors. However, they are still quite young and I personally think that their performances seemed rather indifferent, comparing to Geoffrey Rush's and Johnny Depp's. To sum up: I found this a great movie and anyone who hasn't watched it yet, he should definitely buy the DVD! Finally: Many people say it's a good movie, while others disagree. However, there is one point that nobody can doubt: Even if you are not a fan of such movies, it's worth watching just for Johnny Depp!
5.0~Pure entertainment...but Depp's rancid Captain Jack only makes one long for the likes of Robert Newton ccmiller1492 Sign in Permalink This film was great fun and just might awaken more interest in the historical adventure film...a genre that has been sadly missed, but as in "Gladiator", when done well is big box office. However, Johnny Depp's rancid Captain Jack makes on long for the likes of Robert Newton, Anthony Quinn, and the pirate heroes of the 50's such as Flynn and Tyrone Power. The "evil dead" type special effects were an unnecessary distraction and the historical continuity was ludicrous. Some characters were circa 16th and 17th century (Orlando Bloom with his Musketeer garb at the end) while the British troops were definitely late 18th century as in the American Revolution. Although I have to laud the intention the results were not entirely satisfying, but I'd like to see more attempts at this kind of film.
10.0~Truly Worth Watching Desertman84 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an adventure fantasy film based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney theme parks.It features Johnny Depp,Geoffrey Rush,Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley together with Jack Davenport,Kevin R. McNally,Zoe Saldana and Jonathan Pryce. It was directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The story follows blacksmith Will Turner and pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as they rescue the kidnapped Elizabeth Swann from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, captained by Hector Barbossa. When Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Swann is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner, the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow. Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter. In this Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural has Johnny Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious as he gives his loosest and looniest performance yet and it is spectacular.Entertaining, exciting, and engrossing with a genuine feel of adventure along with excellent performances, this is truly worth watching.
10.0~Adventure, love, rum, and pirates. I couldn't ask for much more in a pirate film. lilithg Sign in Permalink I love this movie. I have seen it twice and would gladly see it again. Johnny Depp is fabulous in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. His mannerisms, quirks, and humour bring this character to life. Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley also perform superbly in the film. These performances, combined with a magnificent soundtrack, fun swordfighting scenes, and a good plot make a great movie. That said, there were some plot elements that I didn't quite understand, but they were few and not so confusing that I couldn't enjoy the movie. I recommend this movie to those who love pirate movies or movies that are fun, funny, and exciting with a bit of romance thrown in.
10.0~great film sweetiqra1 Sign in Permalink I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously. Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.
9.0~Swashbuckling fun. GrantReedIII Sign in Permalink This movie will likely not earn critical acclaim. It isn't the type of movie that earns Oscars, or Academy Awards for best acting, though it has some very good acting. There is not a deep plotline where everybody suffers that attempts to cater to artsy critics that have no idea what a movie is actually for. It is not even very historically accurate in details. Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is just plain fun. It is a roller-coaster ride, with attractive guides and a wicked sense of humour. It is an adventure and something of a mystery that is a coming-of-age story as well. Many people have already commented on the terrific job done by Johnny Depp, so I won't go into that performance other than to state that from his entrance to his exit he is fun to watch, and as effective as Tim Curry has been in similarly flamboyant roles. Orlando Bloom does an good job in presenting a character that takes as much from Captain Blood as it does from The Princess Bride. His character is the young sidekick that is driven and drives the story. If you are looking for the next Amistad, Amadeus, Schindlers List, or story with a deep underlying meaning, look elsewhere. If you want to recall the feelings you had when you were young and going to a movie was something you looked forward too, see this movie. This movie was written to entertain, and in that, it meets it's goal.
8.0~An entire diffrent journey brookewhistance Sign in Permalink Pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.
10.0~SO GOOD!!!SPOILER starlet_ag Sign in Permalink Movie was awesome!!Johnny Depp can play any character he's a well rounded actor, one of the best in the business (I feel). He's not to bad on the eyes either:). I'm so excited he's going to be in the 2nd movie, I feel that if they had chosen some one else to play Cpt. Jack Sparrow, Will Turner or Elizabeth Swan, it really would have not made sense. I saw the movie 6 times mainly for the actors and the plot it was very interesting and well thought out. Many people said it was too long, I believe it was perfect it kept getting interesting just as you thought Jack was going to be hung Will's to the rescue and then you think Jack and Will are caught and will go to jail Elizabeth is there. Best movie Gore is going to have trouble making the second look good as the first, hopefully it will come close. Music for the movie was great too.
4.0~seen it before Jeckes Sign in Permalink Nice effects but not enough to want to see this film again. Just another action film, the storyline has been done again and again. Formula, formula, formula. I found myself looking at my watch too often. The only saving grace...Johnny Depp. He is always interesting and if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have gone to see this thing.
2.0~This can impossibly appeal to an adult audience Flagrant-Baronessa Sign in Permalink If you voted 10 for this film, you'd better be 10 years old or else this is simply unforgivable. Pirates of the Caribbean is a truly excruciating experience. I hate this film on so many levels, covering so many aspects and ranging from crew to cast that it actually makes me physically ill to watch. So if I hate this film to the core, then what's the 2/10 for, you ask? The answer is; I think this film could be entertaining to kids and the odd pre-teen. It is, after all, a Disney production based on a popular Disney ride in a theme park and I think this explains its paper-thin plot of "saving the damsel in distress (Keira Knightley), killing the bad guy (Geoffrey Rush) and having an over-the-top comedic sidekick (Johnny Depp) whilst doing it". I don't know whose genius idea it was to cast Orlando Bloom as the romantic and heroic lead, but this choice helps him cement his position as the resident Hollywood lucky-guy, getting by without so much as a shred of talent, but inexplicably being offered big-budget project after the other. Furthermore, my theory is that Bloom's bad acting is contagious and affected the rest of the cast of Pirates of the Caribbean like a nasty case of the flu. Keira Knightley is a stunning woman but all she does here is pout with her pretty lips until she gets to deliver some cheeseball tough-chick line like "You like pain? *WHAM* Try wearing a corset." I'm no member of the Depp camp but I think he has pulled off some great performances in the past, but in Pirates, he is so over-the-top and corny that this can impossibly appeal to an adult audience. So aside from the cringe-worthy "corset" line by Keira Knightley, the dialogue-writing on the film really puzzles me. It's like it's camp but not intentionally. I believe this film truly thinks it's clever and amusing when it's only extremely embarrassing. Juvenile generic action sequences, long-drawn segments, contrived performances, dumb plot and overblown special effects make Pirates of the Caribbean an unwatchable adventure. 2/10
9.0~Pirates rock... Mandagirl Sign in Permalink I have one word: Pirates rock. I've never thought much about pirate movies, maybe because most of them are so alike. But occasionally, movies comes up that changes your mind completely, and I think that this movie is one of them. It's amazing! It's got action, humour, a brilliant cast - everything. And I actually think that the regular cliches worked! So maybe this isn't 100% original, but it's great! The twist with the curse made it so much better... Hooray for the Pirates.
2.0~Good Family Pirate Movie hiphoper33 Sign in Permalink Good Pirate Comedy Adventure Film for the whole family. The story lacks spirit and depth but still manages to keep from sinking. Very good acting. Johnny Depp portrays his character very well here also. A liitle too watered down but this is due to the Walt Disney style. Only for big fans of family style Adventure Comedy films and fans of the lead actors........
10.0~Amazing javatc Sign in Permalink I remember when this cam out when I was much younger. Before this movie, I didn't take movies all that serious. I was a toddler, stuck in my room watching Bugs Life and Toy Story. Watching this, however, changed my view on movies. The amazing story is well written and directed. The amazing soundtrack makes you want to move, and makes you feel as though you could take on an army while the theme plays in the background. The amazing humor that makes you laugh without pushing it on you or even seeming intentional at times. The amazing actions scenes that are even better coupled with the soundtrack. Everything about this movie is simple amazing. This is the only movie I've ever seen that I can say I don't have any major complaints or criticisms of. Whenever I watch this movie, I can't help but smile and laugh. I've seen it so many times I have to hold myself back from reciting the parts of the script that I've memorized by heart. I can recommend this to anyone of any age any day of the week. It's quite easily established itself as a timeless classic in my eyes.
8.0~Epic and fun pirate adventure with an iconic character swilliky Sign in Permalink The first pirate movie to be based off the Disney ride tells the tale of cursed pirates, a crafty sea captain, and a young couple. As a young girl, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) finds a young William Turner (Orlando Bloom) in the ocean with a gold coin around his neck. In the present, since Elizabeth is the daughter of the Governor of Port Royal Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) she is promised to marry Norrington (Jack Davenport) but Will Turner hopes to woo her. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives in Port Royal tries to steal a ship from the British Navy but is caught by two guards. He has to save Ms. Swann when she faints off a cliff into the ocean from the effects of a corset. Sparrow attempts to escape but in a fight with Will Turner he is caught and imprisoned. As Jack wallows in prison, the Black Pearl arrives with its deadly pirate crew captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). The pirates are in search of the gold coin Elizabeth possesses but when she claims "parlay", the pirates bring her aboard and kidnap her. Will Turner, determined to save Elizabeth, frees Jack Sparrow, and the two men steal a ship and head to Tortuga. Jack assembles a crew including Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and Anamaria (Zoe Saldana). Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com
3.0~A below-average action comedy doniphon Sign in Permalink Having fond childhood memories of old pirate movies and stories, I was really looking forward to watch this one. I certainly didn't expect some brain challenging epic, but good entertainment. I was disappointed. Many things may be said of old, classic movies, but one thing is certain, they generally had good scripts. What has happened to good Hollywood scriptwriters? Don't they exist anymore or are they all working for TV at HBO? This film has a potentially good story and a completely pathetic script that results in a plot that most of the time makes no sense whatsoever, with bad dialogue lines, and awkward twists trying to disguise as "complex turns". Simple bad writing. At least they got someone witty to write Captain Jack Sparrow's lines. Without doubt, the one outstanding thing about this movie is Johny Deep's character and his rendition of it. It is very funny and thoroughly enjoyable. Depending how you look at it, Deep's performance is either wasted in this movie, or saves it.
10.0~A film everyone likes! shemstock Sign in Permalink I love this film, the kids love this film, my parents love this film. Its funny, its action, its tongue in cheek, well acted, well written, well made. Its heaps of good fun, and solid entertainment. I think this comes under the category of a kids film with such a good story and so well told that everyone enjoys it! Its a pirate horror story over-played by the lead roles - who appear to be having loads of fun making the film, that you can't help but love this film. If they ruin this film with poor sequels (like the Matrix .. ugh) heads should roll. If they can keep the quality and story as good (like Shrek, Aliens II..) they'll make a mint - and well deserved too! A film to lift the spirits. Good solid entertainment.
8.0~This movie did everything right rainynight65 Sign in Permalink To be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie when it came out. Everyone was talking about the SFX, noone really mentioned the story, so I didn't consider it worth watching in the theatre. However, when a friend borrowed me the DVD, I changed my mind completely. Nowadays, when a movie comes out, it usually falls under at least one of these categories: a) it's made after a book (or a comic), b) it focuses on SFX rather than on storytelling, and c) it belongs to a genre which has been completely exhausted during the last couple years. Now none of these points mean that it is a bad movie, however when at least two points apply, it's mostly bound to be a flick you watch once and then forget about. It was truly refreshing to see a movie which for a change didn't apply to any of these categories. Meanwhile I bought the DVD, and I catch myself watching the movie or parts of it over and over again. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' basically does everything right. It has a gripping, immersing story, a great cast and dedicated crew, great photography and a wonderful musical score. It belongs to a genre which has been nearly extinct in the last years, it has a story which strays from the usual stereotypes, and it uses SFX to make the movie better, not just to show off with latest technology. Johnny Depp is just brilliant in the role of Jack Sparrow, he makes you laugh over and over again. As does Geoffrey Rush, who plays Captain Barbossa. Some of the cast stay a bit pale, like Orlando Bloom, who I think can do better. The SFX blend perfectly into the movie, these skeletons are great. The music is wonderful as well, worth buying the soundtrack. The score is so catchy, I find myself humming or whistling parts of it constantly. This is entertainment at its best. Not an alltime classic, it doesn't have too much of a message, but that wasn't the goal of making it anyway. Worth watching several times, since you discover new details every time. Right now it ranks pretty high in my favourite list. 8/10 stars from me for this one.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best!!! rezo889 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is my all times favorite movie. I can watch it again and again. In this movie everything is on high level, performance, action, entertainment. Maybe for others story line isn't so strong, but i think that it's very entertaining pirates story ever, the way the cast act is wonderful. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the memorable character in movie history, I can't imagine anyone better than Johnny Depp on this role, he should have won Academy award for this performance. Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Barbossa are also very memorable characters, the way Keira, Orlando and Geoffrey act is magnificent, very beautiful and deeply impressed. For me, the story line is wonderful, i have watched it very many times and I still want to see this film again,there are very many scenes, that make me laugh. Expect acting, there are many thing that makes movie wonderful, the place, where the movie was set, the visual effects and of course awesome music, that is loved by almost everyone. I think that it's not good that this movie has no Academy Awards, it deserved at least one of them in which category it was nominated. I really can't understand anyone who says that this movie is bad or something, it's the best adventure and comedy movie of 2003 and my all times favorite. So,I can talk about this movie all day long, but I'll say shortly, want to say everyone who hasn't watched it yet that they are lucky, because they can watch this great movie for the first time. In conclusion, great movie, great acting, great music, great at all 10 of 10.
9.0~Great - 9.0 StonedMagician Sign in Permalink Funny, with great acting. Also, some of the music wasn't in proportion with the action. If you must see any of this trilogy, make it this one. The other 2 drop off drastically.
3.0~A bit drawn out, repetitious, and yeah boring thdrldn Sign in Permalink Among all of my friends who saw this movie, both pirate/Depp fanatics and neutral, told me that it was such an amazing movie, and that they are excited about the sequel that's coming soon, and how I HAVE to see this movie. So, I did. I got pretty much what I expected, except less. I found the jokes unamusing, action sequence unexciting, the music just droning on-and-on-and-on... Really, I mean, what was so spectacular about this movie? I'm surprised that I managed to stay wake for the ordeal. The acting was good, I guess. I wasn't too impressed with any of the characters. Jack Sparrow was kind of amusing, but his antics got really old very fast. Orlando Bloom and Knightly's characters were plain boring. But the character I was most disappointed in was Captain Barbossa -- such an uninteresting villain, absolutely no noteworthy character. I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10, and I feel like I'm being generous. I know I'm not going to spend my hard earned dollars on the sequel.
10.0~Pirates of the Caribbean (amazing films) groovy_chick904 Sign in Permalink OH MY GOD this film is amazing i think maybe even the best film that has ever been made with a couple of other acceptions ! Orlando bloom your an amazing actor also u r so hot its unbearable ! i think u will always beat johnny when it comes 2 looks :D also Johnny's pretty fine 2 ! Keira Knightley is so beautiful and an amazing actress. keep up the good films y'all ! i have just recently seen the new pirates of the Caribbean: dead man's chest and i think it is also a top film, it is funnier i would say and I'm going to see it again ! i was so annoyed though at the cliff hanger and the end ! WILL, ELIZABETH LOVES YOU NOT JACK SPARROW ha ha. Cant wait 4 the next film i hope it is just as good, i hope that more are made after to third pirates of the Caribbean, with the same cast, Johnny, Orlando and Keira Fran xxx
10.0~Good vfangon Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp is the most versatile actor of this time.. He is good at many genres and he is very pure and also mild in his acting.. We will feel his purity when he is acting ,very interesting... Very good, I felt bad when he was not the winner of the 2003 academy awards night.... yet, of all the nominations you can see how Mr. Depp was the best... there is nothing who can out stand him.. he is the BEST actor, probably the most versatile actor of this current time.. I think he deserves to be a winner of 10+ academy awards... Best actor of 2006 POTC2... yeah I will congratulate Mr. Depp for winning it instant... You are the best Mr. Johnny Depp
9.0~'Pirates' delivers slinkster Sign in Permalink Unlike most summer blockbusters, 'Pirates' lives up to its hype and delivers what it set out to. This movie was fun, fast paced and action packed without having to rely on gimmicky plot depreciating tricks or cussing. There was actually a very detail-driven story which was followed through very well from beginning to end. The movie is serious without losing sight of the comedy in many situations. The technical aspects as well are PHENOMENAL. Johnny Depp does not disappoint in this role of unwitting hero which seems to be tailor made for him (I'm willing to bet his coolness quotient with his kids just went up tenfold.). Geoffory Rush is positively evil as the rouge ghost captain, leaving you chilled with merely a glance from his yellowed eyes. Orlando Bloom seems equally well fitted for his role as pirate hater with a past. His swashbuckling scenes are marvelous and you can see how his stint in 'Lord of the Rings' paid off. Every character from the most minor to the large roles had an important part in the furthering of the story. Overall, I'd this movie is well worth seeing, even just for the sheer amusement of picking out scenes from the Disney ride. Plus, you can take your kids because despite the PG-13 rating there was no bad language and very little blood (the ghosts may be a little scary for young children). I would definitely see this movie again and recommend it to others. Good job, Disney!
1.0~What an Awful Movie. m_jordan_jones2008 Sign in Permalink This movie was so stupid I couldn't finish it. The beginning to this movie dreadfully long. I couldn't believe I sat through half of this movie. One of the major problems with this movie was that it was so unrealistic that it ruined the whole movie. The real pirates were nothing like the pirates in this fake piece of trash. I would rather watch my finger nails grow than watch this stupid movie again. If your into the fake stupid pirate movies than I would recommend this movie, but if you like movies that are realistic than avoid at all costs. I don't know how this piece of garbage made it to theaters. Hollywood has really gone down hill their new movies. This movie was a real disappointment to say the least.
7.0~Shiver me timbers, there be a decent pirates movie! Kimberwyn Sign in Permalink I would have given this an B+ if they had cut about 30 min's from the middle of the movie. PotC has its faults, numerous ones if you care to dig deep, but it is by far one of the most entertaining movies of the summer 2003. Johnny Depp does a superb job as Jack Sparrow. The character showcases his versatility in one of the most refreshing characters I have seen in a long time. And newcomer Keira Knightly shines onscreen in her role as Elizabeth. It seems as if Orlando Bloom was may have been left in the dust in this film by his dashing costars. His acting was rather one dimensional, and suspiciously similar to his character of Legolas in "The Lord of the Rings". But who's paying attention to his acting, anyways? Overall, this pirate movie is non stop laughs, action and adventure. Savvy? Rating: B
1.0~Poor Historical Accuracy odd_bloke Sign in Permalink Personally, I found this film to be a great disappointment. I am something of a history nut and so was disappointed by the amount of inaccuracy of the movie. For example: 1) Every cannonball in the movie exploded, yet they were all fired from long guns and so would just have been lumps of metal hurtling through the air. 2) Norrington had a huge ceremonial promotion to commodore. A commodore was not a permanent rank. It was simply a way of distinguishing between a captain who had been given /temporary/ command of a squadron and one who had not. 3) There were never enough sailors on any of the ships. Most ships of that era had literally hundreds of men aboard. The Black Pearl would have had at least 100 as a skeleton crew (no pun intended) and they would not have been able to use the guns or mount any sort of assault. It would have a full complement of something like 500, if not more. 4) All the sailors were bedecked in ridiculous uniforms. All of the sailors seemed to be wearing their dress uniforms all the time, which simply would not happen on any ship. As if this wasn't bad enough, some of those who weren't marines were wearing red, which would make them an anathema to all the other men in the ship. However, action-wise, the film is very good, though Depp does begin to get on my nerves after a while.
7.0~Handsomely Produced, Exciting And Amusing Pirate Adventure ShootingShark Sign in Permalink A group of mutinous pirates, led by the villainous Barbossa, have been cursed to sail the seas as ghosts until they return every last gold coin from a stolen Aztec treasure chest. Their former leader, Captain Jack Sparrow, is seeking his revenge upon Barbossa and the return of his ship, The Black Pearl. The pirates kidnap the Governor's daughter, who possesses one of the coins, and the scene is set for a heroic rescue ... Here's a movie first I think - a film based on a theme-park ride - but Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is a tremendous action-filled pirate adventure in the classic style, with plenty of sea-dogs, cutlass waving, treasure-hunting, unrequited love and general swashbuckling. There is a lot of good-natured mugging by the likable cast, but Depp steals the show as the lovable Jack Sparrow - bold and dashing but also downtrodden and dubious, with a wonderful Cockney accent and too much mascara. Verbinski balances the film beautifully, keeping the story rolling along nicely, with action, scares, comedy and romance in equal measure. There are several terrific set-pieces; the swordfight between Depp and Bloom in a smithy, a moonlight sequence where the pirates are revealed in all their ghostly glory, a great bit where Depp and Bloom steal a ship but get caught by a faster ship and boarded and then steal that ship, and a great escape-the-hangman's-noose scene at the end. There is a wonderfully rousing score by Klaus Badelt, great visual effects by John Knoll, and Jerry Bruckheimer's production is lavish. Everybody should enjoy a good pirate movie from time to time, and this one is terrific.
1.0~Bad movie, a lost of time dasa108 Sign in Permalink What to say? Any person who likes action movies, should avoid this films as cancer or Ebola. J. Depp is overacting all the film. Also, with the exception of Jack Davenport and Geoffrie Rush, not any actor or actress should act again. Is so terrible to see all the people considering this one as a masterpiece, when they never see The Crimson Pirate, and never give time to see the great heroes acted by Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Gene Kelly. All the movies in the present are made by the same rule: put any thing you think all the mass will love. Is terrible. Some goofs: when the Black Pearl show his flag, the flag has aspect anti past (any artesan should see this fact). In some shot, the principal actress show his finger nails, and are painted with pink colour. In that time, that thing was impossible.
7.0~Good Disney! ankibodor Sign in Permalink Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10
8.0~I Liked This A Lot Theo Robertson Sign in Permalink I never believed I was going to enjoy CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL as I stuck it in the DVD player . After all it was produced by Jerry Brukheimer who's only real critically acclaimed film BLACK HAWK DOWN is down more to director Ridley Scott rather than producer Bruckheimer and let's not forget he also produced Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR two of the most obscene wastes of money Hollywood has come up with in recent years . In fact I would have paid good money NOT to have seen either of these films The production team seem to have taken a leaf out of the Peter Jackson book of film making by casting hunks as heroes with Shakespearian trained actors in the supporting roles . The cast are very good . Johhny Depp was atrocious as an English police inspector in FROM HELL but here as Jack Sparrow his camp English accent is entirely in keeping with the tone of the film . It also makes good business sense too , just think of the amount of 20 something woman who'll go to watch Depp play a swashbuckling rogue . Same with Orlando Bloom who's incredibly popular with a teenage girl audience . Keira Knightley ? Yeah she's really fit but like these other much hyped English Roses such as Julia Ormand in LEGENDS OF THE FALL and Kate Winslett in TITANIC I doubt if she'll be a household name many years from now , she is good as the ballsy heroine in this though . The always under rated Jonathon Pryce is slightly disappointing probably because like so many great stage actors he's not very good with camp humour . By an ironic contrast Geoffry Rush gives the best performance as the villain , a performance that may see him get an Oscar nod as best supporting actor There does seem to be a lot of debate as to how well this film will do at the Oscars . I very much doubt if it'll be up for best picture or director ( It is a fantasy film and this genre is always over looked by the academy ) but it does deserve a handful of technical award nominations in the fields of cinematography , editing , sound , costume design and special effects . Unfortunately it's going to be up against RETURN OF THE KING and MASTER AND COMMANDER which means a probable empty treasure chest for these pirates which is a pity ***** SPOILERS ***** No review of mine is complete without a few grumpy complaints so here they are : Once again the Brits are shown to be stupid and incompetent but that's Hollywood for you , while there's a serious plot hole at the end where it's revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ? But no matter I liked this movie and I thought I'd I never say this but I hope to see the words " Produced by Jerry Brukheimer " a lot more in the future Update - Sorrymy mistake . Jack wasn't suffering from the curse all along . Thanks to the forty or so people who wrote to me pointing this out
2.0~Meh. nilanna999 Sign in Permalink Boring. That's what it is. Just plain boring. It doesn't deserve the hype it gets. I've seen the movie twice and was bored both times... and I really wanted to like it because all of my friends did. The acting might be okay. But I felt nothing for any of the characters or the story. As someone who, again, gave even the likes of Troll 2 five stars, the fact that I was more invested in a bad movie's story than this supposed "good movie" is really saying something. It's a total snoozefest. I honestly didn't find a single scene interesting. Even the Doctor Who knockoff "The Curse of the Black Spot" was more entertaining with better characters and a good story. No thanks. So that's my synopsis, I barely remember what happens but I don't really care. I didn't like it at all.
10.0~Johnny Depp looks so sexy! leanneowen999 Sign in Permalink I think Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the best films ive ever seen. Johnny Depp is so funny and looks so sexy as Captin Jack Sparrow. Cant wait to see if there is a Pirates of the Carribean 2 because i enjoyed the first one so much. Hope Johnny Depp looks as nice in the second one!
10.0~THE GREATEST MOVIE!! Laerke-DK Sign in Permalink Hey!!!! I just want to say, that Pirates Of The Caribbean is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I love the actors, the story, I love everything!!!! I am just so crazy about Orlando, Johnny, Keira and all the other wonderful guys, who had made this movie!!!! This is my favorite movie, and guys: you should watch it, or you gonna miss something very big and great!!!! I just can't wait to see Pirates Of The Caribbean 2!!!! And the last thing: ORLANDO BLOOM IS HOT!!!! Love, Laerke.
8.0~Ages well sarastro7 Sign in Permalink I have just watched the original Pirates of the Caribbean for the third time. The first time was in the theater in '03, and the second time was when my brother bought the DVD in '04. While the first viewing was fun, I remember the second viewing as rather pedestrian. But I'm glad I watched it again now (after having seen and enjoyed the sequel), because I wasn't bored for a second of it. The dialog is sharp and funny (at times even intelligent), the story progresses very well, and the production values are top of the line (even if '03 CGI looks dated now - but by "production values" I mostly mean the beautiful sets and environments). I was struck by how much of the action of the sequel is prefigured in the original movie, and how some puzzling details that are explained in the sequel were never revealed in the first movie (such as the "compass that doesn't point north", which only in the sequel is revealed to be pointing at what the holder most desires). So while I originally rated the first (and the second) movie a 7 out of 10, I will now emend that to an 8, for both movies. They're a couple of great romps, packed with action, ideas, characterization and eye candy. The third movie, unfortunately, was a huge disappointment for me... :-(
5.0~Flailing the high seas. johnnyboyz Sign in Permalink I suppose the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl depicts a sword fight between two immortals that lasts for several minutes is really the clincher that the film does not amount to much more than a bit of throwaway nonsense. The scene, wherein it is readily identified by both parties that the futility of their actions can be equated only to their skills in sword fighting in the first place, epitomises just how much director Gore Verbinski is enjoying himself and just how much his audience aren't. For many years, the notion of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object has befuddled physicists; it may very well have to take second stage to the conundrum of what happens when two invulnerable forces do battle to the death. Do not think there is any attempt at solving such a riddle, for the director is merely pleased with the fact he's bringing all of this spectacle to life in the first place. It falls to all the usual Hollywood mistakes and annoyances: visual and oral bombardment consisting of grandeur tracking shots put to a booming score, while the completely ill-judged decision to cut back and forth from harmless comedy to scenes of a massacre represents American event-movie directing at its very worst. Like most of its ilk, it's too long and while there is some heady adventure in there at times, the film is too bad too often to actually get too excited about. There is no secret in the fact the film struggles with its narrative, seemingly desiring to balance the role of protagonist between three different people but only really ending up telling the story of a doomed crew to a series of fancy edits and prolonged sword fights. Somewhere down the line, ideas either ran out or became cross contaminated; the film is quite so evidently in love with its opening act that it hardly seems to want to launch its characters into a quest, while restless audiences will merely crave the opposite. And then there is that opening act, where, for all the errs of its ways and evident mistakes later on, the film starts surprisingly well. Beginning several years before the main body of the text, the film first depicts Elizabeth Swann on board a British galleon during the colonial era spying a young boy in the water. Once aboard, she discovers his true nature in that he's a pirate – a sworn enemy to those on board but she keeps it a secret out of feeling quite fond for him and not wanting to see him lose his life. As the years pass, Swann grows up into Keira Knightley while the boy matures into Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and they stay loosely connected; he becoming a blacksmith, she already in the rarefied circles of already being a Navy Governor's daughter. As a young adult, Swann is living a suffocating life on this Jamaica-based outpost of the Empire; suffocating in every sense of the word in as much her tight fitting corset apparel is forced upon her just as much as her father's will seemingly is. Played with an ample amount of both sneer and sympathy by Jonathan Pryce, daddy sees fit to remind her that a certain Navy Commodore with a name like Norrington would make a fine suitor. Elizabeth can only wish for something more, something in the form of Turner with whom she would never stand a chance but for her peers. Enter Johnny Depp's rambling Jack Sparrow; a smooth talking, all-action although ultimately unorthodox pirate who doesn't shoot first and ask questions later since he doesn't carry a firearm and is too busy dropping a one-liner on you as he makes his daring escape anyway. Certainly, when compared to the other pirates in the jail cells, Sparrow strikes us as somewhat different; a man who risks capture if it means saving a life but is cold enough to exploit the life if it means saving his own. The initial incident launching everyone into motion arrives when Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain of the damned attacks the British fort and takes Elizabeth, something that forces the previously at-odds Sparrow and Turner into going after her by themselves. Structurally, the film spends too long in the port city of Port Royal before finally launching itself on the gigantic quest encompassing nautical traversing; un-dead enemies and a whole host of fight scenes. Thirty minutes into the actual adventure, we want to go back to Jamaica; where ramshackle characters with problems; desires and feelings played out in an environment brought to screen intelligently and energetically with a rich amount of costume and mise-en-scene for the colonial era when Britain ruled the waves. The film is generally problematic, with Depp and Bloom's buddy partnership not hitting the mark and this ridiculous narrative falling in on itself when further complications arise to do with the banishing of a curse. Once enough is enough, the film begins to outstay its welcome; the score gets louder and things that might've resembled human beings in the early part have become action figures for a child's imagination during playtime. The film is far from terrible and it's made with a boyish enthusiasm, but with the money; design and, some might say, the cast quite evidently at hand, enthusiasm and good intentions are not enough.
1.0~old pirate movies put this one to shame zwerg105 Sign in Permalink The old pirate movies put this one to shame. The main couple is so dislikable with babbling honorably sounding dialogue but without showing one shred of goodness that you expect in a pirate movie. This is also reflected in the script, which makes them act as if with good intentions, but when you reflect, only to make them look good. Naturally the end is incredibly cheesy, events without motivation, impossible action, and quite good special effects and big breasts to keep the eye interested.
7.0~Pirates ye beware! michaelRokeefe Sign in Permalink Absolutely entertaining. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) a rogue pirate joins the efforts of a young blacksmith in saving a damsel(Keira Knightley)in distress and fighting a ghostly group of villainous pirates to recapture a ship he claims has been stolen from him. Sword clashing adventure and off beat humor coupled with some very good special effects makes for an interesting escape from the real world. Depp proves himself a master craftsman. What role can't he play? The cast also features Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jonathan Pryce and Damian O'Hare. NOTE: It has been said that Depp patterned his pirate character after spending some time with Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones.
10.0~Perfect! tomalamulangux Sign in Permalink I've seen it in the premier, and i love it! Im fascinated about pirates.. not because of these movies and when 1º Pirates of the Caribbean came out.. i was so happy.. out of control xD And then the 2º! They became my reason of living! xD Well.. i know it sounds crazy.. but its the truth :X Lol I know that some people doesn't like even a bit of both films, but what a shame.. xD I love them! :X The other day i pick up my newspaper and i've read that it is gonna be a 4º movie! :O Is it true?! It doesn't make any sense.. but one more Pirates movie is never too much! :X P.S.: Sorry my English ^^'
8.0~Pirates For The 21st Century iCrazyDavey Sign in Permalink Pirates Of The Caribbean is a great movie. It has enjoyable comedy, action, and of couse... acting!!! I have to agree with everyone that Johnny Depp is a great actor. To tell you the truth this is the first Johnny Depp movie I thought was amazing and I can't wait until it comes on DVD so I can add to my movie collection. Disney has finally made a great live action movie since Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Which was also PG-13). I can't wait until they make a sequal to this..... but it better be good not like those stupid sequals that Disney does to most it's Disney classics.
9.0~Bloody Brilliant! rising_star-42 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a well-written, well-made, and well-acted film. Do not expect a simple action film; it is humourous and creepy, fascinating and thrilling. Like most films, there are a couple of holes here and there in the fabric of the story; but this film wasn't made for the Oscars, it's meant to entertain and it succeeds in full at that. It's a jolly good time with some good actors (and great Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush) and high adventure on the high seas. Not to be missed!
10.0~A landmark film for Disney cody-phillipsphotography Sign in Permalink Arguably one of Disney's greatest films to ever be released, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl captures pure adventure, romance, and horror into one tightly knit film. With a love for this film from the first viewing, Curse of the Black Pearl was one of the first films that I grew to love, and continue to love to this day. Curse of the Black Pearl is one of Disney's most ambitious films. Seeming to go darker than they ever had before, this film pushed the boundaries of what Disney could get away with. It's really surprising to see that this is a Disney film, since it does have its moment where it gets frightening, especially for a younger audience. The scenes involving the Pearl's crew showing the effects of the curse really are frighteningly realistic, which could easily scare little kids. The violence also is surprising, since there are many deaths throughout the film. This really started to push the dark side of Disney, but still kept a spirit of adventure. While Curse of the Black Pearl has its dark moments, there are so many moments throughout the film that leave you breathless. The scene that most stands out is where the crew of the Black Pearl go for their walk underwater, it's a completely unforgettable scene in an unforgettable film. With some surprisingly beautiful cinematography, this film not only is highly entertaining, but it really is a stunning film to watch. It's an effort that really ended up paying off in the end to create a beautiful film about pirates, that happens to be a Disney film. Curse of the Black Pearl is a perfect beginning to a franchise. It's the best film of the series by far, as well as the most memorable. This film is one that really started getting me interested in watching film for fun, since it was one that was so much fun to watch. It's amazing to see Disney produce an epic film like this, which they have tried to do with films like John Carter and Prince of Persia, which sadly didn't live up to the expectations, but this film certainly exceeds expectations. Simply put, it's one of Disney's best films to date.
6.0~Fun, but not much of anything new patrick_dunne Sign in Permalink Elizabeth Swan is captured by the pirates of the Black Pearl. Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner go out to save her. As you can see, the storyline is nothing new. To add to that, Pirates of the Caribbean had no inspiration, except for a Disney ride, so you can't expect anything extraordinary. The movie, however, does offer some pirate sword-fighting, adventure, and funny lines to make up for that. However, the adventure isn't enough to hold the weights of a close-to-two-hour-experience. The movie is fun, but forgettable to some people, and drags on too much for more people. (like me) 6.5/10
10.0~this is my favorite movie ever!! theshorty59 Sign in Permalink oh man....this movie is soo good....it has just the right mix of comedy, action, and romance!! oh i loved it!!! i can't wait until pirates of the caribbean 2 comes out!!!!! only 6 months left!!!! orlando bloom is so cute!!!! johnny depp is so good in this movie!! he is so funny! he is my favorite actor! i also loved is ragetti.....(mackenzie crook) he is very good.....weird eye, but yeah. i thought they could have made barbossa better, but they did a pretty good job...yeah this is definitely my fav movie....my little sister even loved it.....and she is 9!! everyone i know loved it.....sigh....i love this movie...
8.0~Finally, a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh Igenlode Wordsmith Sign in Permalink "Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male," a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie. With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!) The moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-) The other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character... The basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: "we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'" Jack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as "the worst pirate I've ever seen", as in "the worst at it", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful). This character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another "Mask of Zorro", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick... There are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud. The film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - "it's okay", "I was rooting for you" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there. But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! ÿ
7.0~Great Entertainment erikcortina Sign in Permalink I must confess, at the beginning I was not very enthusiastic about seeing this movie. I wondered "What new thing can be told about pirates?" not to mention that pirates movies were not precisely my main choice, due to terrible flicks such as "Cutthroat Island" (yuck), but then I said, if I'm going to criticize a movie I have to see it, right? OK, so I went to the movie theater with my pals, expecting to see a big waste of money, but, you know what? You can imagine, I LOVED IT! yes, I found it really amusing, but not banal, you know, everything was perfectly synchronized to work, to make laugh, even to scare. I have to say that Mr. Johnny Depp's performance is OUT OF THIS WORLD, fantastic, I'm not saying that his previous films were not superior, actually, some of them are; but I rediscovered Mr. Depp with this film, he is really a comedic actor. I can even suggest the Academy a well deserved award for him. Or for Mr. Geoffrey Rush. AMAZING! he is another great actor who doesn't take himself so seriously, giving his character a special dose of sarcasm and fun. Then, the lead couple, Orlando Bloom & Kyra Knightley (hope I wrote it right), they just do their job, I'm not saying they're bad, but their characters are not really as appealing as Depp's and Rush's roles are. But I must say She is gorgeous. Then, the delirious crew of the Black Pearl, they are simply funny! What else, oh yeah, the art direction, the costume design, the special effects, the makeup; those characteristics that can even be more important than the story of acting (Terminator 3?), but in this movie, they just combine perfectly to deliver an excellent product.
9.0~Prepare to be blown away staisil2 Sign in Permalink Disney never ceases to amaze me. 'Pirates' is a humorous yet well-portrayed movie. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner are a kickass team in this movie of truth, honor, love, and adventure for the entire family! 8.8 out of 10.
10.0~It's a sensational swashbuckling success, savvy? Samundsasha Sign in Permalink Nowadays when I see the "Walt Disney" mark at the top of a film I think to myself, "Oh no, another rubbishy soppy story with an ending like ones on Barney the Dinosaur." You cannot deny it, Disney is letting us down. Or was letting us down UNTIL the launch of "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". You see, POTC is nothing like the usual Disney do-gooder rubbish that everybody finds incredibly tiring and sickening. It is comedy from the start. And, thankfully, the soppy lines are kept to a minimum. And you know what? They are TWENTY TIMES more effective than when they are thrown at you all the time. For instance, when Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightley) kiss at the end, its for the first time in the whole film and it makes it so sweet that everybody is wiping their eyes at the perfect love story. The casting is superb as well and I'm not just talking about the big actors (Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Kiera Knightley, Geoffrey Rush), the less well-known actors are top-notch. Who can forget the showdown between Jack Davenport's "Commodore Norrington" and Depp's "CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow"? Or strange antics of Giles New and Angus Barnett's "Murtogg" and "Mullroy". And the extras do their job perfectly. Overall, this film is well acted and extremely well directed. The Jerry Bruckheimer effects will wow you and the comedy will have you quoting the script for weeks to come. A must-see for all the family! P.S. The extras on the DVD especially the Blooper Reel and the commentaries are a great source of entertainment.
7.0~God bless Jack Sparrow julia-wicks1703 Sign in Permalink This is one of those movies I'll rate higher than I really should because it's pure nostalgia for me. I was in kindergarten when it came out, and this film was responsible for an extended pirate phase. Hell, I still want to be a pirate. The aesthetic in this movie is a powerful thing, and the character who embodies that aesthetic is, of course, Jack Sparrow. Oh, Jack Sparrow. I never had a crush on you, but you were and are #goals - a seaborne Mick Jagger swaggering down-ship with a bottle of rum, radiating a good-humored nihilism that even my child-self knew to envy. There's a surprising amount beneath the surface with Sparrow, but ultimately, he captures and complicates the conflict between fantasy and reality that defines this genre. All the other characters are pure period drama or pure fantasy. Sparrow quite literally walks the line between real and myth, and because of it he's the essence of a swashbuckler. The whole Will/Elizabeth story - okay, that's most of the story - that I could do without, and I think I speak for most people when I say Sparrow makes the movie. But boy, does he make it something.
8.0~Funny but flawed. yamspoon Sign in Permalink I went into this movie with a negative attitude. I always have my doubts about big budget action films, despite the great cast. I had also seen Verbinski's The Ring, and I was not very impressed. However, I was impressed with this film. It was full of laughs, which gave the appearance that it wasn't trying to take on the plot completely seriously. The action scenes were good, and most characters had fairly witty lines and were well acted. The only problem I have with this film was the way the characters held together. We were shown to constant double-crossing, and people that rescued each other, then betrayed them. For example, Jack Sparrow (played by Depp) seemed to have only thing in mind. But then, in the next scene, he was saving someone else (by the way, I'm being especially brief as I don't want to give away any spoilers to the people who have not yet seen this movie). Apart from this small problem, this movie was very good, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good action-packed laugh.
10.0~What a wonderful pirate movie for kids and adults josiemortean-1 Sign in Permalink What a wonderful pirate movie! I loved every bit of it. This is a real treat for Disney fans. The performances was incredible and realistic, there are some superb actors and actresses in this movie, such as Johnny Depp, who plays the mighty yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow he will certainly blow the audience away with his action, humour and look!! Also the heroic and handsome Orlando Bloom, who plays Will Turner, he proves that he can shine no matter what with his personality and talents. As for Keira Knightley (who plays the beautiful governor's daughter in this movie)proved that she can play a grown up girl who is stuck in the 18th Century very well and probably her fans think so too. And Geoffrey Rush, who plays the evil and cunning Captain Barbossa, did very well and you can feel his emotions inside you and he can have you right at the edge of your seat. I think all of the actors and actresses did brilliantly in this movie and not to mention the makers of this movie, they have done an absolutely amazing job to produce such a enjoyable gripping pirate movie. I loved the special effects in this movie - it made the movie more realistic than ever. Also I loved the idea of the plot, the mighty and charming Captain Jack Sparrow is back, this time the evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) stole Jack's ship, The Black Pearl. And later it attacks Port Royal and two pirates kidnapped the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth get kidnapped and in an attempt to rescue her he joined forces with Jack. But a cursed treasure doomed Barbossa and his band of cursed men to live as undead forever and Will dosen't know that... This is a perfect pirate movie mixed with humour, horror, mystery, adventure, love and sword fighting action.
10.0~movie mycatjello Sign in Permalink I thought that this movie was the best!!! I thought it was the best movie because it has Johnny Depp in it!!! :p Boy is he hot!!:D:D:D:P:P:P I think that anyone who sees this movie has got to agree that it is one of the best movies ever!! I hope they make another move!!! I wonder if there will be as much suspense in the next two movies as in the first movie?? I hope to watch this movie again and again because it is the best movie in the world!! I just have to watch any movie with Johnny Depp in it cause he's the best actor in the world!! Why don't you go out and get it and see for yourself that is is an awesome movie!!
8.0~Escapist Fun pdrums Sign in Permalink Every now and then, and truly fun and totally escapist movie enters my radar. I really enjoyed this movie. The thing I enjoyed about it most was watching Johnny Depp playing Keith Richards playing a pirate! Great stuff. As much action and special effects that were going on, it was still Depp who made this movie as much fun as it was.
10.0~Hurrah! BendertheRobot Sign in Permalink I was afraid of this movie at first. One of my friends held a pirate costume party the day it opened, and then we all went to see the movie. Being a Disney movie, I had low expectations. This movie was surprisingly good. Sadly, not all the acting was noteworthy. Johnny Depp carried this movie, but he had help from Geoffrey Rush. Orlando Bloom was dull and Keira Knightley was only there to look at. Graphics - I was not disappointed in any of the scenes. I was quite impressed with the cursed crew jumping in and out of darkness in the final fight scene. The movie seemed like it was only an hour and a half long when it was actually over 2 hours. This is the first Gore Verbinski movie I have seen, and I was quite impressed. This had the potential to be a terrible flop, but between Verbinski and Depp, it came out to be a superb movie for the time period.
4.0~Overrated piece of... uninnovative things thrix Sign in Permalink *Minor spoilers* Much praise has been held over 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the black pearl', and not one, but TWO sequels are in production. The movie is also rated 7.9 and #227 (today, may 08 2005). The cast is very good, but the script and plot is WAY to cheesy for me to take in. I find it ironic that a very good movie like Master and Commander, who is also a pirates-vs-soldiers movie and a hell of a good one at that, aiming for realism, gets surpassed by Potc with a plot of undead pirates walking on the bottom of oceans and turning to bones by night? There's also a lot of bridges that doesn't really add anything to the action (the movie tops 140 minutes), which only becomes an annoyance. Fun for 11-year olds mayhap, but for us a bit older... Crap. Go see Master & Commander if you want a movie with some story. 4/10
6.0~Not bad, but not really all that great twin_ears Sign in Permalink I cannot help but think that this film could have been much better in more capable hands. As others have noted, it runs way too long. Roger Ebert rather astutely observed that somewhere in this 143 minute movie could be a decent 90 minute movie; perhaps he is correct, though we might never know. Gore Verbinski should re-edit this movie for a director's cut and leave out about forty-five minutes; perhaps that would help resolve at least some of its shortcomings. The acting is nothing special, which is to be expected given the way the film plays like a combination of a slapstick comedy and a children's movie. Johnny Depp is a very good, serious actor, as evidenced in "Blow," "Ed Wood," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," "Finding Neverland," etc., though I didn't really like his performance in this film. He does much as much can be expected to develop his character, though I cannot help but wonder if he (along with the rest of the cast) considered this from the onset as simply a paycheck because it appears many of the actors didn't take it seriously and merely phoned in their performances. It doesn't help that they didn't have much with which to work, either. I'm not certain why the principle leads would sign on for two more entries to this series, though money would again be the prime suspect. Action-adventure movies can be fun and entertaining without being shallow and resorting to clichéd tactics as this movie does; the recent Harry Potter and Spider-man movies are good examples of movies that successfully combine entertainment and action with competent, intelligent scripting. Furthermore, it seems to me the makers of this movie could not decide what the target audience for this movie would be, and the result is that it appears to be intended for children, yet is entirely too long to retain their attention and contains entirely too much violence and too many gruesome effects for children. This seems to be a problematic trademark for Verbinski, whose "Mousehunt" (1997) seemed to be clearly intended for children, yet contained some decidedly adult humor. I cannot really recommend a movie that has me wishing it would end halfway through it, which this one did. That is not to say it is bad or that it is dull because it is undoubtedly ambitious and there are moments throughout the film, until the last frames, which show undeniable sparks of energy. Some of the scenes work well and the action is more than adequate. Also, we don't see very many pirate movies any more, so it does have that going for it, you know, which is nice. Ultimately, however, the film meanders about, loses focus and is simply not good enough to warrant a viewing. With two more movies on the way, perhaps there was enough material among this trilogy that would have warranted making 1.5 or even 2 movies from the first the one. I received the DVD as a present, watched it once and must say I am not in a hurry to sit through it again. (However, I might skip to the scenes with Keira Knightley, whose radiance is enough to lift any film)
8.0~A very good film. Mightyzebra Sign in Permalink This is a fun, swashbuckling, exciting, well-acted, well-plotted, obsessive and dramatic film, good for grown-ups and teens. Before you start watching this, remember that this is not for the faint-hearted. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) are the stars of this pirate film, all with very different personalities and good acting. Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film, has been a pirate for some time - and is very good at it. He leads the film on with his daring deeds, plunders and sword-play. Will Turner's character has the most surprises. He is thought to be a humble blacksmith, but instead he turns out to be a good swordsman and later, a good pirate. Elizabeth Swan is the governor's daughter, but soon it turns out that she is captured by pirates. She is very firm, brave and is not the kind of person to give up. Though she has grown up good and posh, it seems she has a bit of pirate in her too... I'll save most of the plot as a surprise for you, but be prepared for a little bit of gore (but not a great amount) and some rather scary skeletons (depending on how you see them). I like this film because of the actors, the adventures, the lines from the characters, the plot and the way this was made. There are some very good graphics here which work incredibly well (sometimes a little too well). I recommend this film to people who are not too scared by action and just that little bit of horror and who like funny bits in action films as well. Enjoy "Pirates of the Caribbean"! :-)
8.0~Highly Recommended EthanBJones_03 Sign in Permalink PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL - 2003 Directed by Gore Verbinski Starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley Plot Overview: Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates. The movie equivalent of the phrase 'Lightning in a Bottle'. Such a fun, inventive, creative and enjoyable movie that was seriously sensational considering it was based on a ride. It is a swashbuckling adventure and a heck of a ride from beginning to end. It is just so much fun. The plot for the movie is overly complicated for a movie of this calibre. But if you peel back the overly complicated layers, it is a very fun and entertaining adventure at heart. I also really like the ending. It is such a perfect way to end the movie. Inventive, entertaining and fun. That is the heart and soul of the film translated into 5 minutes. Johnny Depp was great in this film, back when he acted not 'stumbled onto set for all that $$$'. CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is a great, fun, likable character. Again, back in the golden age of 'effort'. I am really not a fan of Orlando Bloom and I do not see the appeal of him as an actor. He wasn't that great in this movie and neither was the character. Turner wasn't likable, funny or entertaining. He didn't fit with the movie tonally and was just a bore to watch. Keira Knightley was good as Elizabeth Swan. I bought her performance for the most part. As far as her character goes, Swan was just a generic love interest for the first half but as she slowly becomes an empowered and strong female character, I really liked her. One thing I could really have done without was the love story between Bloom and Knightley. It wasn't even that well done and love is the LAST thing on my mind when I think about Pirates. Geoffrey Rush is incredible as Captain Hector Barbossa. You can tell he was having so much fun and relished every moment in the film. As an antagonist, Barbossa was both threatening and funny, which blends the world of pirating and this film's tone perfectly. Other supporting roles, such as Mr Gibbs(Kevin McNally) and James Norrington(Jack Davenport) were all pretty good and they were at least interesting. The effects are pretty impressive and look decent. Not realistic but they have a fun, goofy nature to them which I think fits in tone with the overall film. The cinematography in the movie was very good and it looks very nice. The editing can sometimes get a little dodgy, especially during some fight scenes. Thankfully, it isn't that frequent and the action was still thoroughly enjoyable. Both the costume and set design were excellent. And the score for this movie is one of the most memorable scores since the year 2000. The humour for this movie works very well for the most part, with Depp and Rush being clear standouts for it. The action is, when you can see it, very fun and inventive and enjoyable to watch. Clearly a lot of effort was put into it and I applaud the actors because I think they did their own sword fighting and whatnot. The Curse of the Black Pearl is a very fun ride from beginning to end and I can highly recommend it. It is definitely worth a watch. I'll rate this film 8 'Savvys' out of 10.
10.0~Captain Jack Sparrow is great, suvvy?! Shine_star0246-1 Sign in Permalink The most beautiful movie i ever seen for long time .i liked it soooo much Johnny Depp deserve the oscar for this great performace but he isn't lucky the movie contains all people needs fun, action, adventure,and i can't say any thing more exept that jack sparrow is a charming pirate he is smart, funny, and attractive this movie is wonderful.I can't wait to see the next part jack sparrow captured my heart he stole it from me he is incredable pirate. what i can say i didn't see pirates movie like this in my whole life it is differes than all johnny depp's old movies my favorite movie was edward scissorhands but now it is pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl . two thumbs up for all pirates.
8.0~Fun and Original friedem0n2004 Sign in Permalink For some time now I have been putting this movie down because it didn't seem to appealing to me when I first heard about it. Now, I know, I was so wrong to say I didn't want to see it. One reason was because I knew the sequel was on the horizon and that I felt I should see the first in order to get a sense of what Pirates was all about. I loved just about every aspect of this film. The acting was great and the story had so much to tell that I never felt like the film was long just for the sake of being long. Johnny Depp played a great pirate and so did Orlando Bloom, only in the latter part did he really shine though. The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. The effects were not over the top and they were done to a point where I thought I wouldn't care if I could tell the difference between live action and CG. The only thing I felt to be off balance was some of the Disney dumbness, that plagues most Disney movies and was probably put in at the request of Disney to make it more audience friendly. Overall I felt that I saw a movie and not some action flick with no backbone....ie(STORY). When I was finished, the movie gave me a sense of pride I have not had in a long time when I watch film. I have seen something I will never forget.
8.0~One pirates life for me... sinncross Sign in Permalink A movie based upon a Disney theme-park ride? The day I see that would be well, now; Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, takes the world of swashbuckling pirates, from a theme park ride as I have stated, wraps in some humour, and produces one of the best films to grace the silver screen. Pirates of the Caribbean is about the rescue of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa, the captain of The Black Pearl. To her rescue is Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who recruits the help of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together they set after Barbosa and his crew only to discover that they are undergoing a curse, which keeps them alive forever. From beginning to end, Pirates of the Caribbean is a roller-coaster ride of laughter. There is never a joke misplaced, and it sure makes one's views of the world of pirates, far more entertaining. Fighting sequences never detract from the comedy, as there are a couple instances of humour within battle. This humour is brought to the table, most of the time, by Depp's awesome portrayal of the ingenious, yet bizarre Jack Sparrow. All other actors bring immense life to their characters, and what you get is a film where acting is at its best. However, all is not well: the length of the film is questionable, as it appears to drag on for far too long then it ought to. This is sadly due to some bad editing. There are one or two scenes which weren't required in the final cut, and almost every other scene is exposed for being a few seconds too long. While some perfect editing wouldn't cut the length of the film where one would notice, it would make for some faster pacing. Perhaps the editing division was given a little more freedom then expected, and is something which should be tightened up upon in the future. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is successful on many levels that other films are not. It's not going to be the best film of our time, but will surely go down as one of the most entertaining. Comedy is carefully placed amongst times of story development and times of battle. Many will easily be reciting their favourite parts over and over again. However, due to some lazy editing, the film seems too long, but it's not a problem to get yourself tied into a knot over.
2.0~The big conglomerates have pretty much driven the little guys out of business, you know?...Oh, the movie, right. galensaysyes Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp must work a potent magic on his admirers: by its power he's able to communicate to them, and to them alone, the character he has it in his head that he's portraying. The rest of us have to do a good deal of guessing, since the actor goes only a little way in manifesting his purpose by means of the normal external signs, e.g. facial expressions, body language, tones of voice. Lacking these to go by, I hazard that in this movie he thinks he's impersonating a would-be buccaneer who's generally too drunk, lazy, incompetent, or good-natured to carry off his boasted predations: a role for a W. C. Fields or Wallace Beery, not a performer with the look and the aura of a spoiled altar-boy twenty years past his prime. The star's deficiency might have been compensated for in some measure by intelligent casting of the leading lady; but the one we have here is Keira Knightley, doing her usual, i.e. wanly striking poses for an imaginary photo shoot. The villain, Geoffrey Rush, supplies the color and panache the other two lack; but there's not enough of him to go around. The movie is rather at pains to present itself as a piece of good fun; but for me it was a piece of hard work, all on account of the director (the same one who bumbled up the American "Ring"). He appears to have one virtue: shooting all the script he has, so that all the pieces are there, as they often are not in films these days. But the pieces are nearly all wrong: in the staging, the perspectives and proportions are so far off what one might imagine in reading the script (or any of its published story-izings) that one almost has to revisualize the movie as it goes to get what it's about. And the script, which is a mishmash at best, is confusing in places. The first scene ends with the pirate ship bearing down on its apparent target...and then what? Pondering this enigma distracted me from subsequent developments for a good hour or so; not that they compelled much interest in themselves. I feel a gallon of ill will toward this movie: as a product for sale, which is all it is (it's a lot farther from being a work of art than the amusement ride that inspired), it's a piece of inferior merchandise, with its seams still unfinished. Yet buyers seemed not to see that. Depp's magic at work again?
10.0~Pirates is the best movie dancr4life3392 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best movies of all time correction this is the best movie of all time.Johnny Depp is genius in this film one of his best roles.With One of the best casts with Johnny ,Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly and Geoffery Rush this film plunges the deep Caribbean with action drama romance and even comedy. That is probably what makes this film so good there isn't just one genre there's several. Also this isn't the classic and very overused Good vs. Evil we have The Black Pearl crew the bad guys then we have Commodore Norringtons navy which is the good guys but kinda are the bad guys also when they are keeping Elizabeth from rescuing will and then we have the crazy crew of captain jack sparrow which are pirates and bad guys to the Royal navy but good guys to the pirates of the black pearl and then we have just Captain Jack Sparrow who we never really know what side hes on. Another thing that makes this movie so incredibly awesome is the hilarious quotes. Jack sparrow is one incredible character hes always funny but serious its to hard to describe he has the most hilarious facial expressions all the time and is never scared but always 3 steps in front of everyone else.I have a friend who had never seen it because she said the previews scared her but i begged her into watching it and now thats all she talks about she bought the cereal she has a countdown for the second and shes just about as obsessed as i am my dance troupe has made our production dance pirates thats how incredibly awesome everything in this movie is!!!!! If you haven't seen this movie you are missing something incredible ! Don't delay go out now and rent it the second one will be out soon July 7th 2006.

10.0~fantastical escape eddie-kent Sign in Permalink Don't know about all you guys, but when I go to the movies I don't want real life, I get enough of that in........real life! This was the best film i've seen in years, I didn't know how long it was and couldn't believe how much time had passed while watching the movie. The 2 hours and 20 odd minutes sailed by ( sorry, bad pun! ) Johnny Depp was superb, the accent was so-so but as a brit i'll forgive him! He stole every scene he was in, he camped it up throughout, I laughed out loud and so did my kids aged 16 & 10. The dvd is already on my wish list and hopefully a sequel will follow. Storyline? wasn't really one but who cares? As I said the movies for me are about parking my brain at the door and being entertained, and this movie delivered that in spades. So take a chill pill guys and stop taking life so seriously!!
9.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest glive405 Sign in Permalink One of the best Pirates of the Caribbean movies I have seen. It really kept me on my feet and focused the hole time I enjoyed how they made it seem very thrilling, the excitement was outstanding. Orlando did a great job acting. He played his parts wonderfully, along with Kara Knightly (excuse my spelling mistakes if i made any.) but i recommend any of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies to any age groups. They are very exhilarating and entertaining for the hole family they have their humor when needed to be, and some scares also. Some swear words may be said nothing serious but just to warn some people who may have young children but other then that nothing bad. Enjoy :)
5.0~6/10 and even that is mostly due to Depp VitalyBe Sign in Permalink It is rather sad since this movie showed a LOT of potential in its beginning, yet soon enough it became yet another kitschy Disney movie. First the good: The performance of Depp was wonderful, even if a tiny bit too ecstatic. The visuals and the sounds were, as you can expect from Disney, amazing as well and reminded me of LOTR visuals somewhat. Also, surprisingly, the movie has also quite a sophisticated story. { MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS BELOW } Very quickly, though, the movie dropped very low. The scenes became repetitive and dull. I grew tired of all these sword slashings, first with men, then with shields. In fact, there is just TOO MUCH fighting in this movie. It isn't the stunning fighting of Matrix/LOTR though where you grew more excited every minute, it is more like the regular Disney fighting of, "Aww he dropped the barrel and it dropped on the skeleton, ain't it funny folks?". All the fighting scenes are FULL with Disney cliches like this one. { REAL SPOILERS NOW } In fact, ALL the movie grows to be more and more one big cliche as it spins towards its grand finale cliche end. Starting from the silly sentences (BadGuy: "Say good-bye!", barrel falls on him, GoodGuy: "Good-bye!"), continuing with even sillier sentences that I could guess ten seconds before the actors said them and ending with the super sticky, happy "and they lived happily ever after" end. I hoped they will broke SOME of the sweetness by letting SOMEONE die but apparently they decided to be the STEREOTYPE of cliche Disney movies. Oh well, another 2 hours bit the dust.
10.0~Great!! alexosborne80 Sign in Permalink What can i say this film came from no where and impressed. I have been to Florida quite a few times so was familiar with Pirates of the Caribbean the ride. When i saw this film was coming out, i thought oh dear!! but went along anyway. I had ZERO expectations. THIS FILM IS BRILLIANT..... It has action, adventure, Humour, Romance and even a touch of horror. The characters are all great and you can empathise with all of them. The action sequences were all great, with good sword fights, Daring escapes and even ship to ship battles. The Humour is probably the best thing about this film, its just fun and light hearted you can't help but like it. This film also has some great one liners. The acting in the film is also very good, Depp being the best. He has created a great classic, anti-hero lovable rouge who is up there with the likes of Indiana Jones and Han solo, he's just campy(but trust me that works). The rest of the cast is also good. The set pieces and special effects are also great. a good mix of real effects combined with CGI have combined to make a great looking picture. If you want a good swash buckling adventure action flick with a big dash of Humour and a pinch of romance mixed in for good measure. Then this film is for you.
1.0~I've seen all of this before... Hack_Scudder Sign in Permalink There were only little things to like about this film, like the humor. And even the humor was to be found in the sections 'All Been Done Before' and 'Unoriginal?? What're You Talking About??!' (Cough)*Sarcasm*(Cough) The film was annoying, also because there were a lot of people who died, but only extra's, no one really important. Maybe kids like it and love it, but this is not a pirate-movie. At least Jack Sparrow is not a pirate; Johnny Depp is a great actor, but the story makes him completely unbelievable, if he'd be a real pirate, he'd be much more of a bad-ass. There should be no argue about tastes, but I hate to see this movie to be so high rated!
3.0~Well Overrated!!! roisin2reilly Sign in Permalink Thank god there are other people in the world whom don't 'love' this film. Pirates of the Caribbean is so overrated, if it wasn't for johnny depp, then it would be a washout completely, which says a great deal about it. If I am honest I fell asleep about three quarters of the way through the film, out of sheer boredom, i think Knightley's famous line 'try wearing a corset' set me down for the night. I saw this film last year, and had expected a masterpiece since many people had such high praises for it. The storyline is mediocre, the acting of two of the key actors, Knightly and Bloom (sorry I don't know their characters names, there is a simple reason for this!) is very average. I can remember very little from the film, as it has mere substance. Unfortunately, I have to now deal with people having panic attacks over the release of the sequel..oh well.
8.0~What an Enjoyable Ride! snakejenkins Sign in Permalink Ok, I'm not much for the Disney engine but I do have to admit that I really enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean if for no other reason than Johnny Depp's wonderful performance. The film itself is the usual action fair with aggravating editing and impossibilities galore. The effects were very well done and were the first in a while to really make me think "how'd they do that?". A film like this, though, doesn't rely on plot or depth or anything like that. It relies on a feeling of adventure and fun. And darn it all, I had fun. I had more of a good time at this film than any film I can recall in recent memory and think that Depp's performance of Jack Sparrow deserves every bit of acclaim it's received and more. I'm not too keen on a Pirates 2, but if Jack Sparrow is back, I'll be there Maties!!! ***.5 / ****
10.0~mY aLl TiMe FaVoRiTe MoViE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! punkgurl743 Sign in Permalink This was the best movie I have ever seen. The way they take the shots were wonderful. The way the actors just played each roll was like they were meant for the roll when the script was made. The first encounter of Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Johnny Depp (Captin Jack Sparrow) was brilliant how they had a conversation while one was fighting for his life against a pirate and the other was fighting to get out of the blacksmith shop and also to save his own life. I highly recommend this for anyone. I don't usually like action movies. After I watched this I fell in love with Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp so of course I had to watch Troy and Secret Window which I also enjoyed. I LOVE ORLANDO AND JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8.0~Worth every penny spent, Excelent Movie CBlodg Sign in Permalink If this isn't the best movie of the summer then I don't know what is. Johnny Depp gives one of his best preformences as Cpt. Jack Sparrow. The movie had a fine mix of humor and serious. The special effects(primerily visual) were excelent. The film makers even stuck in some well liked and known scenes from the ride. I will be suggesting this to all of my friends, family, co-workers, etc.
10.0~This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat! ILuvPrincessDiaries2 Sign in Permalink I loved this movie. it was surprisingly clean of bad language and full of excitement and adventure. The plot was good and had you going the whole way. No way could you not like this movie. But don't let your children under 10 or 11 see it because the skeletons and sword fights will scare them and they won't get the funny lines or the story plot. This show is a must see.This shows keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time! Johnny Depp plays a perfect part as a good and bad pirate. I loved Keira Knightly in this movie and even Orlando bloom. They all seemed to fit together. I bet all us POTC lovers will be wanting to see if the next two are as good!
8.0~Don't Like Johnny Depp,But This movie is good icet2004 Sign in Permalink This swash-buckling tale follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, but the fierce and clever Barbossa has been cursed. He, along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made. Full of edge-of-the-seat action and swashbuckling adventures, this is a movie you won't want to miss! this is movie good i guess.not my favorite but some scenes are really funny and skeletons are made terribly good.i recommend it.
10.0~For those hard to hear lines.... Rocking DH Sign in Permalink Re: The comment from the individual that could not understand the British accents and/or some lines with overlying sound effects. I recently explored the DVD at great length, and was fascinated with the English captioned lines for the hearing impaired. While not perfectly transcribed, they do help one understand lines that were yelled or screamed over cannon fire, wave sounds, etc. For example, I heard Geoffrey Rush say, "They're clubhauling". Had not heard this term in the movie theater. The captioned edition really did fill in some details in the script.
10.0~Excellent canuckbabe1970 Sign in Permalink I really enjoyed this film. The action combined with the comedy was done really well. I liked the way the transition was between full bodied and skeleton for the pirates when they stepped into the moonlight. Excellent movie, I give it a 10 on the IMDB scale and 2 thumbs up on the 'thumb' scale.
10.0~POTC 1 is the best taypyle Sign in Permalink it's the best movie ever because i just love it. i don't need a particular reason. i think Orlando bloom is hot and i think johnny is an excellent actor. Keria is great too. I love the plot of the movie like Elizabeth was taken by the gents of Captain Barbossa and the handsome Will tries to get her back. i love every scene in that movie. do you agree??? some don't but just matters of an opinion but other than that i think it's just an great movie. other movies you can see like Pirde and Prejudice and Tiantic. those are also my favorite movies cause of romance. yeah i love romantic movies and POTC 1 had some of that and that's why it's such a great movie.
10.0~This is a one-of-a-kind film that will stand the test of time. ember_firedrake Sign in Permalink I'm pleased with myself that I'm finally getting around to writing a comment. I'll start off with this. This movie is more than you would expect. I went into the theater hoping for plenty of Orlando Bloom screen time, thinking "It's a pirate movie, it might be interesting". One of the biggest understatements of my life. I left the theater with a newfound appreciation for Johnny Depp as an actor. His role and acting were superb in the film. Definitely the best performance of the year. Orlando Bloom, while his performance was not as good as Depp's, was still a great supporting actor, and has the potential to become a bigger star with his upcoming films. Kiera Knightly puts forth a strong supporting role, and does perfectly in the sole female role (not counting Anamaria's). And Geoffrey Rush is one of the best villains I have seen on screen in a long time (with the exception of Gollum). He's the character you love to hate, but feel pity for him at the same time. This is a movie I'd recommend to anybody, and all that I have encouraged to see it thought it better than they had hoped.
10.0~One of my favorite action movies Queph Sign in Permalink This movie is a great mixture of comedy and action. The combination of plot, actors, script, and directing make this one of the best shows out there. Another thing that improves the quality of this film is the fact that it has practically no cussing (which I find needless in a movie). There are several well know actor, including: Jonny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, and Geofery Rush. All of whom did a superb acting job. The special effect were very well done and very convincing. Not only can this show make you laugh but it has amazing scenes of fighting, sailing, etc. This show is definitely a must see. If you haven't seen it yet then I highly recommend renting or buying.
10.0~Brilliant! aura772 Sign in Permalink I've seen this movie three or four times by now. I have enjoyed it every single time like it was the first. I watched it again today and it still amazes me. The cast is incredible, Depp, Bloom and Knightley make a really entertaining team. Watching this film again, it made me realize that Orlando Bloom does have acting skills and he probably has a great career ahead of him. Keira Knightley was beautiful and delivers a good performance in The Curse of the Black Pearl. She was made to act and to shine, I cannot believe she was only seventeen in this movie, the age I am now. I believe she is a really good role model as well. Johnny Depp... His name says everything. He's an amazing actor, always part of the best movies of the genre and one of the best entertainers of this millennium, probably. It's not his looks or his muscular body, or his youth (I was making a joke) that impresses us - it's the facial expressions and the body language. Jack Sparrow is a really good character and young kids, specially boys, everywhere will want Jack Sparrow backpacks and Jack Sparrow lunch boxes. But not only kids enjoy this movie, adults do too, Sparrow is also a complex character. But those tree are not the only ones that impress, the rest of them are good also. Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Weatherby Swann are a good contrast to Will and Jack. Both amusing and amazing. Barbossa makes a nice villain in this film and Geoffrey Rush acted pretty good alongside Depp and the main cast. The special effects are good, modern, it almost makes you forget you're just watching a movie. The story is relatively simple, the humor is really good, sometimes I wonder if this is a pirates parody movie, but then I realize that they're trying to create that perfect feeling that comes into your mind when you are thinking about pirates and adventure. I don't know what more I can say since I'm not an expert. If you haven't seen this movie then what are you waiting for? Everybody has seen it!
8.0~Simply Johnny Depp's Best Movie!!!! yashrajs536 Sign in Permalink I had watched pirates 1 on my phone two days ago and it just felt awesome the visual effects are outstanding . The story was bit different and the concept was totally different. The acting was great and the comedy done by all actors was good and entertaining to watch. The direction was very good. "Johnny Depp" is perfect for a arole of "Captain Jack Sparrow" and the comedy done by him was outstanding. Other supporting cast were also good at their places. The movie was very much fast pace and I like that. Overall the movie was awesome and worth watchable and bit Unforgettable.
5.0~Deeply Deppy Red-Barracuda Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is a film based on a Disney theme-park ride. This over-long bore-fest is full to the gunnels with swashbuckling and other pirate-based antics. We have Johnny Depp putting in a very Deppy performance indeed, which is no doubt terrific for those who like that kind of thing. In this one he played a pirate in the style of Keith Richards. I personally would have much preferred it if he had did it in the vein of Bill Wyman instead. Wyman's famously slightly tedious personality would have fit this movie quite a bit better and would have been at least a little more amusing, with Captain Jack Sparrow spending a good portion of the film waxing lyrically about subjects as disinteresting as the differences between different types of wood or the differences between different types of flags. It would have been tiresome to watch I suppose but much less intolerable than Depp's irritating Rolling Stones pirate. Generally speaking, the story-line to this one was so tedious that I can't remember it very well at all and am not motivated enough to read the synopsis to remind myself. It seemed to incorporate zombies though, which on the face of it was an okay idea but there also seemed to be a lot of other bits involving people swing on ropes and running around, which I found increasingly more unacceptable as the film progressed. This wasn't for me I suppose, I preferred Captain Pugwash a lot more.
8.0~You'll have a good time. louwburger-42312 Sign in Permalink May leave you exhausted like the theme park ride that inspired it; however, you'll have a good time.
10.0~amazing movie!!!!!!!!!! Butterscotchbaby Sign in Permalink From its very first opening scene, to the last.....Pirates of the Carribean gives a swashbuckling sensation of greatness to the movies of today. It matches the Lord of the Rings trilogy in greatness, and makes you laugh every few seconds. Johnny Depp sashays into the scenes with a convincingly piraty manner, a rum soaked pirate with no home to go to. His witty lines, funny nature and great acting abilitys are amazing, he is convincingly the one and only "Captain Jack Sparrow." He leaves most of the handsome heroics, dueling and all of the loving to Orlando Bloom, a major hottie, who seems to be made for acting out extremly handsome young men with a slightly Pirate nature about them in love with gorgeous woman such as Kiera Knightly, who plays Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful young governers daughter, is a great actress, and manages to look amazing in every picture ever taken of her. Geoffery Rush draws back his eyeballs and speaks in a convincingly evil tone, and when you see his equally evil crew you think "how much makeup did these guys need to make them looking that....ugly?" It was..in fact, two hours work every day....at least, for Jack Danport who plays a great role as Pinnel the bloodthirsty pirate. Ok, lets review.....we have Johnny-the great and unique actor with a great sense of humor, Orlando-the handsome great guy who loves to act, Kiera-a new girl in the world of film who manages to stand out from everyone else, Geoffery-a well known and great actor....plus so many many many many many many many many more!!!!!!! Including lots of people from St. Vincent, the harbor in the Carribean where most of the movie was filmed, and the Lady Washington who plays the "Interceptor." all in all...this is the best movie I have ever seen.
8.0~Incredibly fun and entertaining swashbuckler masonmorgan-92917 Sign in Permalink Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has become one of Disney's staples in modern cinema. It completely smashed the box office for it's year and has since held up incredibly well. This Pirates of the Caribbean entry has set the standard for swashbuckler and just adventure films in general, as well as create on the most recognizable and influential movie characters of all time, Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's eccentric performance aside, Pirates is still an immensely entertaining adventure film with likable characters, great action and an unwavering sense of confidence. This entry to the Pirates series has an energy and personality that all the other entries lack. The story moves at such a pace where we never have time to become disinterested as we advance through the adventure at a break-neck speed. We also have a cast of very likable characters that show great on screen chemistry as well as providing the majority of the films energy and personality. All this, along with the excellently choreographed action sequences, makes Curse of the Black Pearl an infinitely re-watchable and endlessly enjoyable adventure. Black Pearl features a very talented cast that each excellently fit their roles. They share great on- screen chemistry and the well written dialogue they deliver make their characters even more likable. While the acting overall was pretty great and fun to watch, there is no doubt that Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow carried the movie entirely as his performance alone gave the film the majority of it's character. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of cinema's most recognizable and widely liked characters as Depp's phenomenal delivery and unique mannerism makes him perfect for the eccentric pirate. It really is hard to think of anyone else more suitable for the role. There is a broad spectrum of different characters here, but any viewer is guaranteed to find at least one to like and cheer on throughout. The story, while admittedly quite silly, has a surprising amount of layers and themes varying from friendship to loyalty and honesty. This being a Disney film, it of course is going to have themes like this, but the way these messages are delivered feel natural, not just pandering to the child audience. One of the things that did kind of bother me was the execution of the subject matter. Disney's try at a pirate themed franchise seems strange as pirates usually indulged in violence, booze and women, making it a difficult subject for Disney to tackle without greatly cutting down on some aspects. There is an easily noticeable sense of goofiness and censorship throughout the film's action scenes. It doesn't necessarily ruin these scenes, but it does lack a sense of tension and intensity after Disney's tweaking. It doesn't quite satisfy the want for a "real" pirate film with gritty and realistic action sequences, but Black Pearl is still a fun venture for anyone to enjoy. Another complaint is the run-time of the film. It clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours, which wouldn't be a problem if the film has enough substance to carry itself through the longer-than-average run-time, but Curse of the Black Pearl noticeably slows after 2 hours. Despite the fast-paced action of these 2 hours, the last 30 minutes makes the entire film feel overlong as it struggles to hold my attention in this time, especially during the literally pointless fight scenes involving Captain Jack Sparrow, who literally cannot die. Despite the overlong run-time and somewhat censored pirate themes, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is still a fantastically fun adventure filled with likable characters and great action choreography. Bursting with energy and wit, this entry to the Pirates series kick-started a following of copycats and wannabes, but none will ever come close to touching the personality and character Black Pearl so effortlessly pulls off.
7.0~Calm down, people! Borut_Z Sign in Permalink I saw the movie for the second time and decided to write this review. I don't think it's a good idea to write one just after you saw the movie for the first time, because you can be too impressed by the movie and therefore not thinking clearly. The movie is nice, very nice, and I'm sure I will see it multiple times more, but to say »it's the best movie ever« is as ridiculous as the fact that all three movies of the »Lord Of The Rings« trilogy are in the top ten of all times on this site. A great movie, in my opinion, is the one that raises important issues and forces you to think about them and generates strong emotions together with superb acting. So, by definition, I tend to like dramas a lot. I know I can't expect this kind of things in an adventure movie. So, I saw POTC just to have fun and I had a great time. It's a movie which was designed to make a lot of money and entertain the whole family (like Disney's parks), and it did its job perfectly. I can imagine it must be so magical for the kids. Jack Sparrow, brought brilliantly to life by Johnny Depp is so charming and witty. I bet there are children out there arguing at play because everyone wants to be the Captain. Bloom did all right but that's it. I'm kinda romantic guy, so I did like scenes between Orlando and Keira, but I can understand they were very pathetic for some people. She did much better in them, he was basically just staring at her. The story is interesting enough, it has golden treasure, curse and pretty good twists, effects are impressive, movie is also very funny. So, if you are looking for some fun, this is the right choice.
10.0~Johnny Depp is truly amazing! rosie_bubba37 Sign in Permalink This was a very good movie. Johnny Depp is indescribable as Captain Jack Sparrow. He brings humor and charm to what could have been a two-dimensional stock character. Orlando Bloom proves that he can do more than just stand around looking pretty and shooting arrows. His Will Turner is dashing and will set many ladies' hearts aflutter. I, for one, look forward to seeing his future work. Geoffrey Rush seems to be having a wonderful time as the dastardly and evil Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley makes a spirited Elizabeth Swann. She is not just a damsel in distress; she gets to take part in the action quite a bit. Jack Davenport was good as the honorable Commodore Norrington. He seemed to really care for Elizabeth, and want her to be happy. In another film, he probably would have been the hero, but Elizabeth had to end up with SPOILER SPOILER Will Turner. The supporting characters are hysterical. The two bumbling British soldiers and their pirate counterparts made me laugh every time they were on screen. I only had two issues with this movie. It got a little too long towards the end; how many battle do you really need? (although I'll admit I still enjoyed it immensely!) Also, Jonathan Pryce was sorely underused. There were many times when his role as Governor Swann could have developed into so much more, but they were never utilized. Overall, this movie was very exciting and fun. A definite for multiple viewings!
10.0~The best film of 2003..... em_1986 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean was easily one of the best films of 2003. The story was brilliant, the acting was amazing and the characters were some of the most interesting and creative to have graced the silver screen. It was about time a pirate movie was made that didnt disappoint. there was action, comedy, romance...there was something for everyone....even my step-dad liked it. Personally, i dont think that the casting could have been much better. Geoffrey Rush and Johnny depp, two of Hollywood's most talented actors....how could they go wrong? Johnny Depp more than deserved an Oscar nomination, although the other nominees were equally deserving, and i think that its a shame he missed out. he has played so many interesting and challenging roles so well that i think he truely deserves one. Overall this is an amazing film that will hopefully stand the test of time, and in ten years time i will be able to sit down with my children and they will enjoy it as much as i have. However, the only think that worries me about it standing the test of time is the graphics. the speed at which technology is improving that will look awful in a matter of years. Other than that, i give this movie an impressive 10/10
10.0~A movie to be enjoyed for all ages and years to come xer0derm Sign in Permalink The film was filled with extreme comedy and great action scenes. Much of Depp's acting was reminiscent of his work in Fear and Loathing, but it was hillarious and well worth the nine dollars. The action scenes were packed with entertainment, and were very frequent. All ages can enjoy this movie, and most likely will. If you have the ability to get to a theatre, go to one, and see this movie.
9.0~great movie Karvid Sign in Permalink When I first saw this movie I thought that it would be a normal "adventure movie" I didn't think that this is a comedy. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those movies that isn't entirely funny but there is a character in it that makes you laugh every time you watch it, and that of course is Captain Jack Sparrow, in this movie. He makes the movie even better than it would have been without him: it had a good plot and good supporting actors playing the other characters in the movie. There isn't that much to say about this movie, just go see it, enjoy it and be ready for a good action/comedy. 9 out of 10
1.0~Yeeek! central_p Sign in Permalink Now, here is my short opinion. This movie is so bad and so forgettable that at the time I'm writing this I've already forgotten what it was all about and all I remember is the bad taste it left in my mouth! Wow, how is it possible that such a pile of crap, can have so many fans?!? It's just another mass product from the Hollywood conveyor belt. It has no story, no character, nothing at all but hi-tech, expensive visuals! I haven't seen a good US movie made in the last 5-6 years! Dammit! Ye eek!Ye eek!Ye eek! Have a nice day!
10.0~I defintely suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly great movie. FizzyApple Sign in Permalink This is the best movie I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot! Absolutely brilliant screenplay and acting, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Johnny Depp creates an original personality for his character, Jack Sparrow, a pirate looking for revenge after the mutiny 10 years ago from his first mate, Captain Barbossa. Geoffrey Rush gives Barbossa an amazing character, full of wickedness but also just that touch of pity and laughter. When the pirates of the Black Pearl, Jack's old ship, attack Port Royal, they take the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), with them onto the ship. Keira has definitely launched her career with this role as she displayed some wonderful acting. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is determined to rescue her and teams up with Jack. Orlando has done it again - made a great movie even better. But only Jack knows that a curse has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever. I just absolutely adore this movie; it has everything - adventure, comedy, romance, action, you name it. Not to mention impeccable casting, wonderful costume and makeup, astonishing props and scenes, and amazing music. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly great movie. 11/10!!!
10.0~The film that has everything packed into it! Prettytomboy Sign in Permalink This is one of my all-time favorite films! What can I say? They did a wonderful job with this film, throwing in an awesome mix to make a story that would appeal to nearly anyone who enjoys a good movie. The casting was fantastic and spot on. Johnny Depp was Exceptional- no body could have played the role of Jack Sparrow better. I just smiled throughout the whole thing, because his performance was so fantastic. His wit was great and the one-liners were completely memorable. Orlando Bloom made excellent eye-candy, and Keira Knightley was as gorgeous as ever and played an excellent role. Geoffry Rush played his role with as much ease as Depp and really did the whole bad-guy thing well! The action was fantastic- the fantasy side was enjoyable. The jokes were great, and the special effects were also A+. I could watch this over and over again, and still get the same great feeling from it. There aren't a lot of pirate films out there, but this is by far the best there is. Certainly deserving of many sequels and I would definitely recommend it to buy and keep on DVD.
8.0~In a time of massive summer blockbusters, this high-sailing ship is definitely a crowd-pleaser. khanbaliq2 Sign in Permalink An eccentric pirate (Johnny Depp) rushes to the rescue when the British governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) is kidnapped by his former shipmates. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Depp. Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is an enjoyable action adventure, based on a Disney theme-park ride, that barely has a coherent plot but still hits the spot - especially as Depp's Jack Sparrow, in this first film of the franchise, has the advantage of surprise. His mascara-lidded, swaggering, cockney pirate, a rock star by any other name, is a truly original creation.
10.0~i love this movie!! twirlgirl2001 Sign in Permalink I love this movie!.. its the BEST movie i've seen in a LONG LONG time!.. this is my favorite movie ever!.. Johnny Depp is awesome in this movie.. The movie is good for the girls because Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are in it..so even if you're not enjoying the movie, atleast you will have something good to look at.. and its good for the guys because there is a lot of action in this movie.. there's a lot of sword fights and some ships blow up! If you haven't already seen this movie, I suggest that you go and rent it right now!.. I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!!!
9.0~Good always defeats evil! flaviacartman Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp,Orlando Bloom,Keira Knightley...a good cast for a good movie!And it has all that is required for a block-buster:funny scenes,adventure...dead people... Moreover,Johnny Depp's performance was flawless like always.But we should ask this question:why doesn't he enjoy playing in block-busters? Seeing this movie is a great opportunity to learn more about pirates...and their code for example.In addition to this,it is perfect for a family reunion in front of the TV,with a bowl of popcorn,of course! In my opinion,this is one of the fewest movies which really deserves a sequel and of course all my comments above will be applied to it. Enjoy!
9.0~The best time I've ever had in theaters jonothanwarriorpoet Sign in Permalink This movie quite simply forced me to enjoy myself in a theater more than I have in years. Between Johnny Depp playing quite possibly the coolest pirate in the world, an excellent story, amazing visuals, astounding sword fighting, and roll in the aisles comedy - it is what a faithful movie going audience deserves. I will see it again and again and I suggest you do the same.
10.0~Review narine_tevosyan Sign in Permalink "Pirates of the Caribbean" is one of my favorite pirate movies. I like all the series of this movie. I think one of the benefits of this movie is that all age categories can watch it. Of course, there are some parts, which can be frightening for children, however, I remember that when I was a child, approximately at 9 age, I watched this movie great enthusiasm and nothing stopped me from watching it. There is nothing that can be sad bad about this movie. All actors play perfectly in this movie, and everyone is remembered differently. Of course, my favorite character is Captain Jack, and my love for Johnny Depp started from this movie. Depp and this character are one and plays so good that you can't imagine him without this character. I think that no one could play this character better than Depp and it was horrible for me when I read an article, where the producer of this movie tells that Depp will no longer be a part of the upcoming project. Another character that I love in this movie is Elisabeth, which is played by Kira Knightley. I like how Knightley plays her role; she makes so that we believe her. At first, we see a fragile and curious girl, which by chance falls into another world: a world full of pirates and secrets. However, then we see her growth and the way she struggles for her love. Also in other parts, we see it even more obvious. In particular, she leaves Captain Jack at the mercy of a large octopus or the part where she becomes the head of all pirates. All these changes show her strong character and also indicate how a person gradually reveals his real abilities based on the circumstances. Overall, in my opinion, it is a worthy movie with great graphics and talented actors. I advise everyone to watch this movie and don't pay attention to the duration of the film. It is so addictive that you won't be bored.
10.0~The Curse Is Upon Us annomy Sign in Permalink What can anyone say about Pirates of the Caribbean except that it's BRILLIANT!! From the beginning of the movie, you set sail on a journey through the Caribbean. You can almost smell the air and feel totally absorbed into the movie. The plot is good for a pirates' story with so many twists and shifts and gets you into the story step by step. The set design is very good. So realistic and so rich you see that nothing is out of place, everything is where it's supposed to be. The direction is excellent. The fight sequences were done in a humorous mode but with good skills. The graphics is OUTSTANDING. You can look with the examining eye, you can not find a single moment of inconsistency in the graphics. It took my breath away. The leads (Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport) were brilliant. They contributed positively to their roles, especially Johnny Depp. He was so funny and so in character that you couldn't imagine anyone else doing that role but him (savvy?). In Total...I think that this movie gave Disney a peak that is HARD to surpass. I really doubt if anyone could do any better.
7.0~Better than first baller9393 Sign in Permalink The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films. The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film. Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes. The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting. Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad. On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10.
8.0~Depp is fantastic but the movie..... james_earp Sign in Permalink I have to say that Johnny Deep is one of the best actors Hollywood have seen in the last decade and he is very good in Pirates. He is the one that makes this movie to something different than an ordinary J.Bruckheimer production. When I say ordinary Bruckheimer production I mean a action movie with great specialeffects and no story (The Rock is an exeption). Pirates is a typical Bruckheimer production with allot of action and specialeffects but the story is not so good. But Pirates is a perfect adventure/action movie alá Indian Jones (but not so good though) and a perfect movie for a movie night with your friends. But they should have skipped the two stupid Pirates. The were more anoying than funny. It gets a 7/10
10.0~Johnny Depp has it all in Pirates of the Caribbean! moforubberducky Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is an ultimate movie! Johnny Depp's sexiest performance ever. Seen it four times and am absolutely dying, YES DYING!, to see number two and three. If you've heard of the film and thought it looked like too much of a kiddy's film, honestly, think again. The pirates aren't stereotypical eye-patch and wooden sword characters, their originality is what makes the film. Jack Sparrow is a loyal yet unpredictable part played by Johnny Depp, and made me laugh throughout with his hilarious random jokes. Best pirate film of all time in my opinion. Captain Jack Sarrow, Wil Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) all search for what they're looking for in the Caribbean until death gets in the way!
5.0~Highly overrated blindg Sign in Permalink This is one of the most overrated movies of the last decade, just unbelievable that it reached the top 250.. Johnny Depp is good to watch (as always) but the rest of acting was terrible, especially Orlando Bloom. Many people talks about fun, but what is fun? In this movie I found so much hackneyed entertainment just disguised in a new form: take away the skeleton pirates, put in it criminals, terrorists, cops or whatever and you get the same result. With a less banal script and a bit of drama, ah and yes with a *bit* of characters development this could have been better, but hey, it's Disney.... This is just the usual "turn-off-brain" movie, nothing less, nothing more.
10.0~Fantastic film, a certain must see. alisonjsaunders Sign in Permalink I just didn't want it to end. From the very beginning I was experiencing that nice light hearted happy feeling of total enjoyment. A great mix of action and humour and it was lovely to see a film not reliant on violence and swearing just for the sake of it. Johnny Depp was outstanding as was the guy who was Gareth in "The Office". Having just watched Terminator 3 and feeling quite despondent about the decidedly dodgy offerings at the cinema, this film has certainly restored my faith. Can't wait to see it again.
8.0~Very good action epic from the Caribbean. bigjohn_81 Sign in Permalink Very good action epic from the Caribbean. After seeing the preview I was expecting a "lets make a movie for the sake of it" mentality with lots of special effects. I was somewhat surprised when I actually found it to be quite an entertaining and easy to watch film. I was also very impressed with the effects, but especially the skeletal effects (believable without being gory). Johnny Depp's grasp of "Jack Sparrow" is to be commended however I feel he was let down by the lacking and somewhat forced performances of two other characters. It is for this reason alone I give this movie an 8 instead of the elusive 10. Interesting story with interesting characters, whats not to like?
7.0~Entertaining. Akira-36 Sign in Permalink Yep, that's pretty much sum it up. This is an entertaining summer movie. A thumb up for Verbinski and/or the film editor that decided to keep the running time more than 2 hours. It allowed for character development and interaction. Quite engaging at times and the cgi usage was effective and precise. Plus you have gorgeous casts and big budget. Everyone had fun.
10.0~Go and see it!!Now!!! tereza19 Sign in Permalink OK, maybe it was too long, maybe I was bored once or twice...but...despite it, it was sooo funny in common that I can forgive them (creators) weaker moments. The whole time - drunk Jack Sparrow, performed by my all time favorite, Johny Depp...yeah, that was brilliant. Even a very beautiful Kiera Knightly somehow disappeared when Johny occurred:)) And after all, why is the rum gone?:))) I have seen the film 5 times which is, in my small world...tooo much. And I still love it. And the music fits, too. And the stunt-men are formidable...the pirates, yeah, they even look bad:) well, most of them :) Maybe the script is not perfectly logical, especially the last scene with Barbossa...but OK, it's only a story, based on Disney World attraction. I think, the crew made the best of it. And though I don't like Nr. 2 and 3 normally, this time I'm looking fwd it:) See the movie, it's better than most of the 250 best movies in this database:)
10.0~Better than I heard i_want_a_kitten Sign in Permalink I heard it was pretty good... I thought it was awesome, and it is still may favorite movie of all time. I am a couch potato, (NOT FAT!)I always watch movies or TV. DON'T forget! The 2nd one comes out July 7th!!! I can't wait! my 13 year old body is going to explode!!!!! YAAAAYYY!!! Orlando Bloom was awesome, As was Kiera Knightly and Jhonny Depp. I'm sure that the second one will show much promise. I especially loved the part where Jack got stabbed and fell into the moonlight in the cave, only to be discovered that he had stolen a coin, acquiring the curse... And then, fighting with superior skill, throwing it to Will, who dropped it in the chest and broke the curse. Absolutely. I loved it... I cheered Jack on...he he... I WAS 10!!! anyway, enjoy!!!
8.0~Definitely the best done of the series. Pretty entertaining if you don't see it too often. CinematicInceptions Sign in Permalink Although this series has spiraled downward in quality, this first installment was a good place to start. It introduces all of the themes that drive the sequels, even though there is a relatively small connection between this and Dead Man's Chest. The most prominent theme is whether all laws can be considered just which we see with both Norrington's use and abuse of his military position to hunt pirates, and the ambiguity of the pirate code. Less prominent is the theme of selfishness. Jack is easily the most selfish character, but seems to do this for show as a deception. As we learn later, Jack's compass is actually run by people's desires. Even here, the plot is driven by each character's desires and how they cause conflict. And these conflicts are only resolved by selflessness as with Will sacrificing his life for Elizabeth, Elizabeth allowing Norrington to marry her to save Will, the crew abandoning the code to save Jack, and Norrington's actions at the very end. Those aren't great examples, but much more concrete resolutions through selflessness come later in the series. The characters are very well done, both major and minor. All are given attention, personality, and motives in the case of the main characters. The fact that a character with as little screen time as Governor Swann has motives and contributes to others' motives says something. Each character's exposition is pretty much spot-on and fits the situation naturally without involving any dull or implausible "information dumps" about the current situation. Any information dumps come well after we have met and have a sense of each character. It helps that the characters are very likable from Jack Sparrow's witticisms and quirks, Will's blunders and passions, Barbossa's dramatic tones, Elizabeth's ability to excercise whatever power she has over her enemies, and the various eccentricities of each crew. In addition to that, there is no true protagonist, but everyone plays the villain at some point with the exception of Will and Elizabeth. But despite that, there is a degree of sympathy that you can have for each character including Barbossa and Norrington. The plot gets a bit complicated, and it's definitely worth it to stop midway through and run through the story so far with the help of a friend or some other spoiler-free source of information. The most confusing thing about my first viewing was how the curse worked, but once I made sense of it I appreciated the movie more. Even when there aren't action scenes, the story moves along at a decent pace and remains entertaining and interesting. Of course, some of this loses it's effect if you know the story too well, so I recommend that you wait a couple years before re-watching it. In light of modern spfx, some of the visuals are a little laughable, but are still pretty good for the time. The acting was pretty good for an action movie, with Johnny Depp stealing the show as Jack. There is a lot of action with the fast-paced sword duels, sea battles, and the sacking of Port Royal. The choreography is pretty good, and all of the action is exciting and fun rather than brutal. The script was really well done, easily the best of the series, both in it's dialogue and scene structure. Gore Verbinski did a pretty good job directing too. As it's a Disney movie it's geared a little bit for kids, but not too strongly. I certainly enjoyed it more when I was about 12 or 13, but it's still pretty fun to watch now. The PG-13 rating is warranted but it's well on the mild side. I would recommend buying it at some point if you enjoy it and haven't already, especially since you can probably get it used for less than $5. There's potential for it to be annoying, especially if you're looking for flaws and can understand the story. But on the whole there aren't any glaring mistakes. So definitely rent it if you enjoy fun, exciting, and thematic movies. Overall Rating: 8.5/10.
7.0~It's not great but it's a pretty fun movie Argemaluco Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean:the curse of the black pearl is not a great movie,but it kept me fun.The production behind this movie is great.But the best thing I found on this movie is the script.I know it's not innovative,but it's well written with the unexpected twists and the surprises the movie has.The great Johnny Depp has an extraordinary performance as Jack Sparrow and putting him on that character was a great decision.He had a very deserved Academy Award nomination.Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport bring excellent performances,too.Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are very shallow on their characters.The battle sequences are spectacular but some of them are very long and some of them could have been edited off the movie.Another frailty is that,near the ending,there are some boring and redundant scenes which could have been taken out.Pirates of the Caribbean is not a great movie but it kept me fun.
7.0~Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl VidSteh Sign in Permalink It makes me wonder why there was no "pirate movie" until the Pirates of the Caribbean came out in 2003. I really missed that kind of movies with ruthless and bearded pirates, mystical adventures out on the sea, fighting for money, power and treasure... I really missed that all these years. Now, The Pirates of the Caribbean were made by the Disneyland attraction by the same name, so I didn't expect a lot from the movie. First of all, it came from Disney studios, so I didn't expected to see angry and ruthless pirates and really scary adventures. So when the movie came out, I decide to gave it a shot. Overall, the movie is not so bad. Johnny Depp is now probably one of them most talented actors and his acting as goofy pirate Jack Sparrow is really great. The environment of beautiful Caribbean islands is also great. Special effects are solid and some of the scenes from the movie are really scary (of course, from the Disney point of view). The problem of the movie is in the story. The story of the movie is really predictable, even for the Disney movies. One poor guy is in love with the rich girl. The girl is taken away by the "evil" pirates. The poor guy decided to bring the girl back. Of course... the girl is a governor daughter and he's a nobody, but then he finds out that he's a son of a pirate. Predictable. Even worse.. the poor guy is played by two worst actors on the planet: Orlando Bloom and the rich girl is played by Keira Knightley. You know the rest. The second problem are the "bad" guys in the movie. They're really not "bad", they just look like a bunch of dorks, being at the wrong place in the wrong time. There is no "evil" in this movie. The pirates are shown as a rum - drinking fat morons with bad sense of humor. They're not evil and not even convincing. The only good character is Jack Sparrow and even him became annoying with his bad humor after a hour and a half. Pirates of the Caribbean are good adventure movie, but nothing more than that. The characters are annoying (Knightley with her really annoying British accent), there's a lack of real "evil" in the movie and the story is a complete breakdown. Despite good acting from Depp, this movie is not a real "pirate movie". This is not Treasure Island, it's a mix of Disneys fairy - tales and pirate movies.
8.0~A modern-day high-seas blockbuster born from unlikely Disney roots Mr-Fusion Sign in Permalink Disregarding the bloated the carcass that has become the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series helps restore the lustre to "Curse of the Black Pearl". At least, it did for me. It's a rousing pirate adventure, cleverly mixing battle scenes, humor and memorable characters. But it's really built around Captain Jack Sparrow, which is a problem I had with the later entries when the cast really got crowded and he was (somewhat) sidelined. But he is the real magic here, and Depp plays the character with mincing bug-eyed flair. He's a treat. Then again, so's the whole movie, especially bearing in mind that it's a big effects movie spawned from a theme park ride. Let that sink in for a moment, and this really has no business being so good. Like some sort of mad science experiment in Anaheim that was never supposed to work. Yet it totally does. 8/10
10.0~just a few words... xxxalexxx Sign in Permalink well, first of all, I really didn't want to go see this movie, I wanted to go to another, but now I'm happy I did. I don't say its without mistakes; it's a bit too long and some characters are flat and blank and as usual in Hollywood, Will and Elizabeth must be paired in the end... but no matter, it's still the best movie I've seen for years, especially thanks to the great performance of Johnny Depp, but also Geoffrey Rush helped it a lot. One thing I really don't understand is: what they want to make Pirates 2 about?! And that's about it...
5.0~Overrated, overlong, but mercifully it is over peter394 Sign in Permalink The movie really dragged on. The core of the movie plot was somewhat intriguing but the execution was did not work. The movie was not funny enough to be a comedy; not realistic enough to be gripping; not exciting enough to stop you from squirming in your seat. The comedy was too extensive to be comic relief and their was not enough drama to need to be relieved. Johnny Depp, a fine actor, was annoying as the almost drunk sounding lead. More swishy than swash buckling.
9.0~Watch this film! godblessamerica_89 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean (The Curse of the Black Pearl) is about a governor's family who find o boy in the water when they are out whit their boat. The daughter of the governor is finding that the boy wear a pirate-necklace and she take it. When the daughter (Elizabeth) is older, she gets taken by some evil pirates. She tells them her name is Elizabeth Turner. But it isn't. Turner is the name of the boy her family find in the water, some years ago. The boy, Will, doesn't know he is a pirate and now he is a friend of Elizabeth and her family. The evil pirates, think Elizabet is a pirate, because she is named Turner. They are taking her to a cave, together with the necklace and there they are going to take some of her blood and they are going to cancel a curse that rest over the evil pirates. But it doesn't work. So now they know that Elizabeth is not the right human to take blood from, she is not the daughter of the Turner (the father of Will Turner). Now they start searching after the pirate who can cancel the curse. Will Turner, who's working as a smith in the town where Elizabeth lives, meet Jack Sparrow one day. Jack is a pirate too, and they take a ship and go away to look after Elizabeth. On the ship Jack tells Will that he is a pirate too, but Will isn't believe him at first. But afterward he recognize that its true. Jack and Will goes out on a big adventure, and Will is prepared to die to find Elizabeth, and save her.. I think the film is a good film. You can see it in nearly every ages and its both funny and exciting. The actors is very good in acting, and of course it makes the film been better. This movie is definitely worth to see!
10.0~An epic adventure; my favourite film of 2003. colonel_green Sign in Permalink The first time I saw "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" in theatres, in the summer of 2003, I knew that it was the first of many viewings. I ended up seeing it four times in theatres, and I then acquired the DVD. PotC is a truly great action-adventure film, perhaps the best pirate movie ever made (although that genre hasn't faired well of late). Johnny Depp does an iconic turn as Jack Sparrow, the bizarre anti-hero that captured the audience's imagination, and earned Depp an Oscar nomination (he should have won, if you asked me). Sparrow is a truly unique creation, and he overshadows everything else in the film. Doing his best to match Depp in scenery chewing is Geoffrey Rush, playing another of his memorable villains, Captain Barbossa. Somewhat more subdued are Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and the stunningly beautiful Keira Knightley (in the role that put her on the map). Knightley is just about the only woman in the production, but she is a great screen presence; hopefully she will have a long career ahead of her. My favourite scene is the dinner scene onboard the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth sits down with Barbossa and he gives her food to eat; unable to enjoy the food himself, Barbossa draws an absurd amount of enjoyment from watching her eat and drink; he then follows it up with an excellent monologue, one of the most memorable film speeches I've ever seen. I give "Pirates of the Caribbean" a 10/10.
7.0~Certainly a fun movie to watch Agent10 Sign in Permalink Johnny Depp saved this movie. There, that's all you need to know. POC was a pretty good film overall, with excellent production design worthy of any spectacular epic film. But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised.
8.0~Disney Drops Anchor, But Not The Ball! cchase Sign in Permalink Though we were too late to get tickets for it, my partner and I had the good fortune (and timing) to be in Anaheim when the world premiere for PIRATES was taking place. It was his umpteenth time at Disneyland, my very first, (at age 43, yet!!!) For him, it was a revelation about seeing the Magic Kingdom through adult eyes vs. the awestruck vision of a young teenager. Even more so for me, since coming to the Magic Kingdom had been virtually all I dreamed about after seeing it so many times on "The Wonderful World of Disney." Needless to say, though I pretty much enjoyed myself there, a lot of the more kid-friendly attractions simply left me cold, or at the very most, lukewarm. At the top of the list of things that left me less-than-impressed? Pirates-of-the-Caribbean: The Ride. The goofy joy tempered with thrills and chills that I remember, seeing the ride on a show about Disneyland itself (which has been thoughtfully included on the POTC DVD extras) was totally dissipated by a sense of ghastly horror...horror at the fact that the ride hadn't changed in nearly twenty years!!! You could even see the places on some of the animatronic figures where they had simply been patched up with spit, chewing gum and chicken wire! Even after seeing the previews, which were exciting in that bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer-way, I remember thinking as I got off the ride, "Ohmigod. Disney is gonna lose their shirts on this one." A big budget feature based on a dilapidated theme park attraction, set in a genre that had been considered dead since that disaster known as CUTTHROAT ISLAND? What chance could Disney have of possibly turning this sow's ear into a silk purse loaded with gold doubloons? Not a single one. But miracle of miracles, they pulled it off!!! Every so often, Hollywood puts together a project guaranteed to be an absolute disaster. The director is anything but a veteran, the leading man is way too quirky, unpredictable or just plain difficult, the script comes from writers who are hit-and-miss at best, and the producers are known for their plot-free, bloated behemoths of sunscreen-weather blockbusters. The end result? Like a Rube Goldberg contraption, the damn thing may actually work, but that doesn't mean it will do anything or go anywhere. Yet, with Gore Verbinski (THE RING, MOUSE HUNT) at the helm, Jerry Bruckheimer (BAD BOYS 2, ENEMY OF THE STATE) producing, a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (GODZILLA) and the inscrutable Johnny Depp in the lead, PIRATES takes the disgraced and abandoned niche of pirate movies and brings it back to life with a bang and a "yo ho ho!" in a way not seen since the days of the original TREASURE ISLAND or CAPTAIN BLOOD. Not only that, but the film still manages to give plenty of 'nudge-wink' references to the ride upon which it is based, while still entertaining you in a wildly reckless and gleeful way that all but obliterates the memory of the original experience from your senses. Should they ever redesign and revamp the ride, they now have the blueprint for it. And speaking of blueprints, I'm astonished at myself for actually looking forward to the sequel, (and that's even without the famously rumored appearance of the Stones' Keith Richard as Jack Sparrow's miserable excuse for a father.) Bringing back the fresh, naive heroism of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who could use a solid hit right about now), the feisty sexiness of Elizabeth Turner (Keira Knightley, who has become famous for that very quality in her heroines) and the murderously jovial sensibility of Geoffrey Rush's scenery-chewing Captain Barbossa is the smartest move the filmmakers could've made. Let's just hope that for this series, PIRATES 2 is more like THE GODFATHER 2, and not SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL.
1.0~Disappointing film:( Movie Nuttball Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in My opinion is not one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't. The following is in My opinion. 1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him. 2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one. 3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why? 4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed. 5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke? You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!
10.0~Those Old Sea Pirates in All of Us CrowTurtle Sign in Permalink This movie is a very funny romanticization of those Pirates of the Caribbean during the early 1700s, yet touches a deep & wonderful sense of adventure in us even now. The sea "pirate" that is Captain Jack Sparrow is that childlike spirit that lives in all of us - "despite all the evidence to the contrary" - and has its source beyond and without any definition of worldly authorization. J.R.R.Tolkien had a saying - "not all who wander are lost". And another truly great thing about this movie - it is not in the least pretentious or heavy handed nor does it wallow in personal issues like so many self-important films today. 'Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl' is just one very cool, well made and fun movie!! p.s. if you liked this Pirate flick - another kind of 'pirate' in our more contemporary times (1992) that you might enjoy and might want to check out is 'Captain Ron' (as in the movie with Kurt Russell). Two very different movies but the spirit of Captain Jack Sparrow could be a match with 'Captain Ron' in another time and place .
9.0~Striking visuals, adventurous story, amazing execution. Elswet Sign in Permalink After years of enjoyable viewing of 21 Jump Street, some of us did not need this movie to appreciate Johnny Depp's talents and abilities as an actor. But for the rest of the world, this was the springboard for Depp's movie career. The movie begins with a hauntingly beautiful child singing of pirates on the misty bow of a ship. She is cautioned not to bring pirates down on them, by singing of them. Just after, a small boy is found floating on a piece of wreckage, and the young girl child immediately identifies him as a pirate, and hides his true nature/identity from her father the Governor and the captain of the ship upon which they sail. You then fade to the same little girl as a grown woman (Keira Knightly), dreaming of the day when she first found her William (Orlando Bloom) adrift in the sea. She's hidden his treasure in a secret compartment beneath one of the drawers in her bedside cabinet, and obviously treasures it, as she does him. The remainder of the movie, she attempts to find herself, discover whom she really is, and please her father at the same time. No easy task of ANY daughter. William has since become an apprentice to the blacksmith of the small seaside village in which they reside. He has learned his lessons so well, in fact, that his master sleeps in a peaceful but drunken slumber all the day while Will masters the work sent to their forge. These two are obviously in love, but Will knows his place, and refuses to be familiar with her in any way, in the presence of her father the Governor. Not quite the way to woo the lady's heart, there, Will. Enters now, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), in a sinking water-filled schooner. He himself bears no small resemblance to a bilge-rat, as he rides the main mast of the sinking ship right up to the harbor of the same village in which Elizabeth and William reside; Port Royal. His shenanigans will not be tolerated, as he soon learns, and he quickly finds himself in irons. We discover that Captain Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl; the most feared pirate's ship to sail the Caribbean Sea. This ship is rumored to have black sails, be crewed by the damned, and captained by an evil darker than any other. There has been some criticism of the vocabulary used by the pirates, but in reality, they did have quite the vocabulary. They had to trade in many different ports, using many different languages fluently in order to prevent themselves from being taken advantage of. These men were mostly self-educated, learning the hard way. And while most could not read and write, true enough, they could and would bargain with anyone which could uplift their situation. They sought fame and riches. Having been heard of was akin to the gunslingers of the US Western days having wanted posters of themselves jealously secreted away within their own saddlebags. They lived by a strict code of ethics, and experienced a very unstable lifestyle; feasting one day, while enduring famine the next. Also, the "mascara" some critics have criticized, was usually Kohl, used commonly by sea-farers of the time to block the sun out of their eyes, much like football players use black stick, today. It does create a rather dramatic look, but was a common technique used in the days of such men as these. This story, while not wholly original, borrowed from every pirate movie I've ever seen, but uplifted and upgraded those old tales. It was extremely well told, convincingly executed, and brilliantly portrayed by Depp and Bloom. I've acquired a new respect for both of their work, of late, actually. And while this does not possess the epic qualities of some other recent productions, Bloom's talents were just as well exercised here as they were in his most recent success. As for the wardrobe of the pirates, they were in the Caribbean; an exotic place, populated by people of colorful cultures. Their dress, while basically British, was properly colored by the islands in which they prowled. Reportedly, having modeled his Jack Sparrow character closely after Keith Richards, Depp's flawless Cockney accent was quite believable and near perfect. He worked very hard on that portion of his character, as was obvious by his beautiful and colorfully wide use of the Cockney hyperbole. "All by me onsie," meaning all by myself, and so on. There was one element with which I had some qualms, however. That of the undead army. Having recently seen LotR: RotK, I could not help but compare the undead armies to one another, and found that this one was a tiny bit lacking. Their movements were sometimes choppy, hesitant, clumsy and not surreal as was Jackson's. These lacked the graceful, floating ghostly quality that was exhibited in Jackson's masterpiece. They ~looked~ real enough, but their movements were awkward and clumsy. Other than that, I was completely delighted with this endeavor, and cannot wait to see the next installment of this franchise. I hope it is a long-running one. It rates an 8.8/10 from... the Fiend :.
10.0~Simply amazing...one of the best films of the year...savvy? Alien_Angie Sign in Permalink OK. I went to see this film full of doubts. My friend is a few years younger than me and loves Orlando Bloom since his appearance as Legolas and she liked Johnny Depp to so not surprising she saw it on opening night. After dealing with her gushing over the male leads and for a few days and constant bugging by my brother to see the film I eventually went with no expectations. I wasnt a great fan of 'Legolas' and Id only seen Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow which was (IMHO) rather an odd film. From the second Depp appeared on screen I was hooked. Orlandos first appearance in the governors house had left me swooning but it was Johnny Depp that left me glued to the screen. Jack Sparrows introduction was amazing and had me in stitches (my condition for most of the film) The performances by each of the main characters was absolutely flawless, the chemistry that played between Will, Elizabeth and Jack was sparkling. The special effects were brilliant and the story was enthralling. I have to say that I left the film deeply on love with both Orlando and Johnny...but more so Jack Sparrow! Johnny Depp stole this film. His performance was faultless and as unlikely as it is he deserves an oscar for this performance - he was flawless! I left the cinema with the film still fresh in my head, and went to see it the next day...and 3 times the week after. I have also already managed to obtain the film on DVD and its already been watched at home 4 times and is in danger of melting! Im even starting to pick up some of Jacks words...savvy? :-) Now thats not a good sign...LOL IMHO I give this film top marks...10/10 fantastic performances from the 4 leads: Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in particular but Geoffrey Rush and Kieira Knightley were on top form too. A must see.
10.0~That has got to be the best pirate film I've ever seen zachgrant Sign in Permalink This is without a doubt my second favorite film ever made. Johnny Depp as Jack is great. Rush as Barbosa is great. The 2 main characters, Elizabeth and Will, are great. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The story is expertly told. What else can I say, IT'S PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. The villains are both sympathetic and cruel, and Barbosa's death is so well handled. He got exactly what he wanted throughout the film, and that's what got him. And Jack's face during that scene perfectly shows the years of torment he had to go through to get what was his back. All in all, go watch this film. It is by far one of the best action film ever made. Yo Ho, a pirate's life for me.
7.0~ahh, not another pirate film? deepion Sign in Permalink When i was at the cinema waiting to see The Matrix Reloaded, a trailer appeared before me for a certain pirate movie. The first thing which went through my head was, oh God, please not another pirate movie, especially one made for the kids during the summer holidays. My fears were confirmed when the Disney logo appeared at the end of the trailer. There was no way in hell I was going to see this movie. Then, people started telling me about a certain guy called Johnny Depp. Now, I have never seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it, so I wasn`t really moved when people told me that he was the best thing in this movie. Anyway, lately a friend and I decided to rent the movie just to see what it was like. I watched it and I must say, it IS a Disney pirate movie made for the kids for summer. However, it is also a very entertaining movie, in parts. I can see why it has done very well at the box offices around the world and why people keep going back to see it. If you haven`t seen this movie, the fact that it is a Disney movie should not discourage you, and the fact that it has pirates in it, well, in all fairness it is one of the best pirate movies I have seen, well worth a try, you won`t be disappointed.
10.0~Pirates rules!!!!! OrlandoBloomrulz Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean is in my opinion the best film in the world apart from Lord of the Rings!!!, Will Turner has got to be the best character in that, but jack is also good,i would give this movie 10 out of 10
8.0~The worst pirate movie ever. =G= Sign in Permalink Just kidding. "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" is an extravagant and sumptuous feast albeit an awful lot of talking...and we all know pirates were long on plunder and short on words. It's politically correct Disney all the way with this watered down and convoluted family fun fare which has delighted the critics and public alike. However, there was no black eye patch, no peg leg, no hanging from a yard arm, no pieces of eight or dubloons, and its common knowledge that planks were always walked blindfolded which was a big part of pirate fun. Also, what's up with sword fighting someone you can't kill? Good stuff even if it was an encyclopedia version pirating as opposed to the more real good ol' Hollywood version of the buccaneer. (B+)
7.0~"Yo Ho Ho" ween-3 Sign in Permalink A movie based on a Disney ride? You gotta be kiddin' me!! But somehow, they did it...a thoroughly entertaining film with a surprisingly funny script and great over-the-top performances by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush swashin' and bucklin' their way through this send-up of the Errol Flynn genre...Maybe a little CGI-heavy, but Walt would have loved it...And as for 17-year old Keira Knightley, her pirate ship has most assuredly come in...Some fun DVD extras (short history of piracy---the original Disney ride history)...Extravagant costumes, sets and make-up but the performances don't get buried, and that's as much as you can ask for in this type of film...My only fear is that if this catches on ("Haunted Mansion", etc.), they'll be making a movie about the concession stands at the park before too long... "AAAAARGGGHHHHH MATEY!!!!", indeed!!
8.0~Sail the Black Pearl. anaconda-40658 Sign in Permalink Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush, Zoe Saldana: A celebration of pirate movies symbolizing trouble when placing trust in the world. Jack Sparrow placed emphases on his ship, the Black Pearl until his partner's betrayal. He is sentenced to death until a pirate raid results in the kidnapping of the Governor's daughter. They seek a medallion that can lift a curse. Directed by Gore Verbinski who previously made The Ring and The Mexican. He brings a sense of youthful enthusiasm that works. Johnny Depp delivers a hilarious scene stealing performance as Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush is fierce as his ex partner. He is the evil pirate leader seeking the medallion. Its power is never properly explained but they are seen as skeletons under the moonlight. Orlando Bloom plays a weapons manufacturer. Keira Knightley goes beyond damsel in distress as the Governor's daughter. She is involved in a mesmerizing sequence where she is hurled aimlessly from skeleton to skeleton when she realizes the horror that is upon her. It is obvious that she and Bloom will unite. Zoe Saldana plays a female pirate who joins Bloom and sets out to confront Sparrow for stealing her ship. Special effects are best when the moonlight turns normality into a skeletal frame of relentless horror. Score: 8 / 10
10.0~an all around great movie flo116 Sign in Permalink Every time I watch this movie I enjoy it more. I see new things every time. POTC is funny and heart warming. The hero's are flawed but lovable. It has a lot of different stories going on and they are all presented in an understandable way. It is just a fun enjoyable movie and I think will be a classic Disney movie. I went to see it the first time because the Lady Washington played the Interceptor and she was built on the harbor where I live. I just was enamored with Johnny Depp whom I had only vaguely heard of before. I am so glad I went to see it I would have missed so much if I hadn't. I only saw it once on the big screen and wish I had seen it more and I will get the chance with the new ones coming out.
10.0~Perfection! This film is FAR from cursed! ahdvd Sign in Permalink This is a fantastic film, with an all round perfect balance of action, drama, comedy and horror, supported by increadible special effects (the walking crew of the damned in their moonlight guises are really quite impressive) aswell as a rather good story and VERY good acting (in particular on Johnny Depp's part as Captain Jack Sparrow, he is the source of much hilarity while also being the most complex of all the characters on screen). Good direction and music adds to this movie that will be liked by adults and kids alike. 10 out of 10!
10.0~I think it was great anamarie_dot_com Sign in Permalink I really don't care what the other comments say, I loved this movie, and not only because of Johnny Depp, but also for the story, and the really nice make-up and costumes and hair styles. All of these combined made Pirates of the Caribbean a great movie. Of course it's not one of the best ones, but i think it deserves it's rating. And I really don't understand how come all the other comments have something negative to say about this movie. After i saw i the first time, i watched it another 5 times in the following days. I really recommend this movie to all people, because it keeps you in suspense and it doesn't have any sex scenes or dirty talk. It's perfect to watch it with your family or with your friends.
10.0~Depp-tastic! lossiebeth Sign in Permalink I must confess that until I saw this film, I was never a fan of Johnny Depp-don't know why, but there you are. A friend lent me this on DVD and I was absolutely gobsmacked. What a SUPER film, and Depp is perfect as Jack Sparrow. Everyone is wonderful, but the film belongs (as I wish the Best Actor Oscar would, but I don't trust Hollywood) to Johnny Depp. The combination of humour, action, romance, and ghostly pirates is quite a mix, and the plot moves along at a fine speed. I really can't fault this film; it is SO good!
10.0~This movie has it all, there is something for everyone!! bjmnajah Sign in Permalink Take an exciting trip back to the days of pirates, gold, and adventure on the high seas. The days of Flynn are gone, here comes Depp! Oh and what a movie this is. There is something for everyone in the family with this movie, romance, action, drama, horror, adventure and fantasy. A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. I can't wait to see the next Pirates of the Carebean, should be great.
10.0~The Kind of Movie that Leaves a Good Taste in Your Mouth tarity Sign in Permalink This is my #4 greatest movie ever made. Great laughs all the way through, PERFECT acting. Excellent action scenes, a real smile-as-you-watch movie. Perfect directing by Verbinski. Can't wait for the sequel!Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
10.0~This is one of the greatest pirate movie I've ever seen hyperchick91307 Sign in Permalink This has to be one of the best movies Johhny Depp has been in, showing a new side of himself as a drunken, self centered, and very determined pirate. He, Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom travel all over the Caribbean. Though Orlando Bloom never shows any emotions (as usual), this is still an incredible movies that you'll want to watch again and again. The action and suspense never stops, with Keira Knightly's screaming. This Disney movie is the first to be rated PG-13, so it's got to good, and there's no singing in weird dances involved in this Disney classic. Just drinking, guns firing, swearing, and my personal favorite, suffication by corset
10.0~great work of art, scriptwriting, and acting eta1-1 Sign in Permalink This film is seriously entertaining. The actors were really good even the bit parts. This film has a good combination of wit, humor and bravado as well as little tidbits of life's wisdom. The sparring scenes are definitely a plus. I hadn't watched a movie in several years and I'm glad this was my intro back. The good guys are really good and the bad guys really bad but Johnny Depp manages to be both really good and really bad. His character is what every gal dreams of; a bad boy with a good heart. I found myself wanting to use some of the lines in it in everyday life especially the daring do's. Over all the films ability to draw you in is amazing. Every time I think of it I smile.
8.0~you forgot one very important thing, mate LostInFilmUK Sign in Permalink Story/Plot - Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is the daughter of the Governor and she holds the last piece of Aztec gold, wanted and hunted by pirates. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a pirate and captain of the Black Pearl. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is a blacksmith with quick feet and quick thinking. Elizabeth is kidnapped by a group of pirates under the command of Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken to the Black Pearl. On board this ship Elizabeth soon realizes that the pirates are more than rum drinking swashbucklers, they are in fact undead. Will and Jack join forces on the hunt to save the love of Will's life, Elizabeth. With a ship and a crew they set sale to reclaim what is theirs and take down Barbosa. A battle commences and a fight to the death has arisen. Will Jack reclaim the Pearl and Will reunite with Elizabeth? My verdict - An amazing story of grit and determination surrounded by love and action.
10.0~Pirates A Terrific Adventure Film tburke85 Sign in Permalink Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl is a terrific adventure film with action, drama, suspense, some romance, and humor. Johnny Depp is amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow and he's clearly having a lot of fun with this character. The rest of the supporting cast are great in their roles including Geoffrey Rush as the villain Captain Barbossa, Orland Bloom as Will Turner a blacksmith, and Kiera Knightely as Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinksi does a fantastic job of bringing this movie to the big screen. From the action, to the drama, to the humor and adventure this film has something in it for everyone who's looking for an entertaining movie to watch. It really is that good and The Curse Of The Black Pearl is now one of the my favorite movies. With two possible sequels on the way lets just hope they can be just as good or even better than this one. Go see it you won't be disappointed even with a running time of 2 hours and 23 minutes the movie is fast paced and action packed. With plenty of humor thrown in that balances well between the drama, suspense, and action.
10.0~One of the Most Delightful Pirates Adventure Ever claudio_carvalho Sign in Permalink When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew. The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 April 2004, and I have just watched again today (10 Feb 2007) enjoying the same way as in the first time. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): "Piratas do Caribe  A Maldição do Pérola Negra" ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl")
10.0~Do we have a heading? Yes for greatness! AmyJenson1995 Sign in Permalink There are movies which are giving our faith back into the movie industry. Movies which are refreshing an entire genre in a very good way and will become a new model for films to come. Since it has been released in 2003, I have been a huge fan of the Pirates of The Caribbeans saga. It's epic, funny, well directed and played, the CGIs are awesomely shot, the soundtrack is epic as well. There's nothing to throw away. But the real magnet to this movie is Johnny Depp aka Jack Sparrow. He is cheating, awkward, a real loon but god he's so awesome! Johnny is displaying all his talent and class throughout the movie and is really the one we will always come to mind first when we talk about Pirates of the Caribbean. Although it would be terribly unfair to not praise the performance of the rest of the cast as they are as awesome as Mr Depp. Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally play their part perfectly and all are bringing their part to the plot. Talking about that, the story is as epic as it could be. A mix between paranormal, adventure, comedy and action, it's keeping us entertained from start to finish and never letting us get bored. Some of the scenes are really scary like the one when Elizabeth discovers the terrible curse the Black Pearl crew is suffering and try to stop. Romance has not been forgotten as well. The love triangle between Will, Elizabeth and Commodore Norrington is an entire part of the story as it's the main motive running through the movie. When Elizabeth is kidnapped by Barbossa, Will is going to her rescue ready to ally with someone he despise so much at the beginning to succeed in his task. Both of them are so cute and sympathetic. Another great asset is the music. It's at the image of the movie: epic and adventurous. It's a perfect match to the tempo of the movie and the genre theme. Hans Zimmer did a perfect job once again. To me it deserves a 10.
7.0~The Pirate Blockbluster freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink Unlike a lot of people, I thought the Pirates of the Caribbean series was okay, entertaining in place, but not great. Pirate films have a history of being flops, from Roman Polanski's Pirates to the biggest Blockbuster failure Cutthroat Island. Pirates of the Caribbean also has a filmy source material, a ride at Disneyworld (and the Florida version isn't that good). So the signs weren't good. However, the film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who has made a large number of blockbusters, had writers who were involved in successful films like Aladdin, the Mask of Zorro, Antz, Shrek and Colleratal, and staring Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. POTC is set in the 17th Century, set in the Caribbean (surprise surprise). Sailing from England to Port Royal, Jamaica, the young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her father, the Governor of the island (Jonathan Pryce) find a young boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) floating in the ocean. The film fast-forwards to when Elizabeth and Will are young adults, Elizabeth still the daughter of the governor and Will is a blacksmith. Will is in love with Elizabeth but doesn't do anything about it. However their world is rocked when Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) shows up. He saves Elizabeth from drowning before getting arrested by the British authorities. That night Port Royal is attacked by pirates from the Black Pearl, with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) leading them. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Jack and Will have to chase to save her. Now the film is hokum, but that's acceptable. It is meant for a family entertainment. It also adds supernatural elements and it felt similar to the Mummy, even have similar action scenes. This film in the series has the simplest plot and has many humorous elements. The action is top-draw, mixing live-action and CGI, the whole series is known for it special effects and had an excellent score. The acting is hit and miss. Johnny Depp is entertaining as the drunken, distruthful Jack Sparrow. This is Johnny Depp's first blockbuster, in the past often rejecting big budget movies to work on smaller projects. Depp is a brilliant actor. Geoffrey Rush is an actor who added gravitas to project and makes an excellent villain; the films allows him to have some fun. Johnathan Pryce was underused in the film, but still made his character a good but indifferent being. Keira Knightley was okay, I don't mind her, she is very easy on the eye. Orlando Bloom is a bit wet and he has been type-casted since Lord of the Rings (he has been in Troy and Kingdom of Heaven). The film is too long and the story is not the best. It is filled with pirate clichés. Gore Verbinski is more comfortable with the action scenes then character development. Most of the humours comes from Jack Sparrow and often slapstick. Basically the film is entertaining enough, 3 out of 5.
6.0~Romantic comedy meets campy horror film. duffster Sign in Permalink After watching Pirates of the Caribbean last night, I was very surprised to see that it had an IMDB rating of 8.0! Could THIS MOVIE really be one of the best 250 movies ever made?!? Then I looked at the voter breakdown, noticed that females gave it an average rating of 8.7, and the 1,041 females under 18 gave it a 9.5! Suddenly things started to make sense. A little sense. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW* Basically what we've got here is a pretty typical story. The rich governor's daughter loves the poor blacksmith boy, and he with her, but she's supposed to marry the military man. The blacksmith boy is amazingly handsome, makes the most beautiful swords that you've ever seen, and is an amazing sword fighter, since he practices in his free time-- apparently against no one. The military man takes a role that's been popular in romantic comedies lately. He's not a horrible, slimy jerk. He's just not the type of guy that women want to marry. He's stuffy, always follows the rules, and there's nothing the least bit entertaining about him. Of course she ends up with the blacksmith. Yawn. The story was incredibly predictable. The evil, vile pirates don't seem that evil and vile, perhaps because they were given too many comedic gags. Additionally, their fighting scenes looked like some sort of a cheesy video game. They never really seemed as real or threatening as they should have. Bloom and the girl turn in average performances, as does Geoffrey Rush. I was really disappointed with that, as I expected him to really blow me away. Unfortunately, he either wasn't feeling it, or he didn't get adequate screentime. Johnny Depp was quite good. He really brought some fun to an otherwise drab movie. Had it not been for Depp's performance, I don't think that this movie would have made half of the money that it did. If you DO watch Pirates of the Caribbean, watch it for Depp. 6.5 of 10, rounded down to hopefully drag this thing out of the top 250. :)
6.0~If you like Johnny Depp, you'll love Johnny Depp in this flick. siberryfan Sign in Permalink Well, I finally got around to seeing this because I continue to hear such rave reviews and decided they can't be all wrong. Turns out, I was wrong: this movie bored me bored me bored me. By the time the movie was half-over, I began waiting impatiently for the smallest sighting of Johnny Depp - any scene he was in was incredible: his acting was genius, his costume was perfect, and his Captain Jack Sparrow consumed him. During his appearances, the scenes were understandable, sensible (for a quirky Pirate movie), and extremely entertaining; I laughed aloud almost every time he was on screen. Unfortunately, if he was not involved in a scene, it was guaranteed to be confusing and boring. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were the only actors whose lines could be understood the first time listening, I felt. I saw this on DVD with the convenience of the life-saving remote control to rewind when I couldn't get it. How did theater-goers manage?? Everyone else spoke too fast! I found myself rewinding many of Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom's lines, along with a few of the pirates. What's up with that? Why the frenetic spewing of lines? Depp's and Rush's words flowed from them as though part of their being, their essence. Masters, they are. The story unnecessarily twisted back and forth - trust or don't trust, honesty or dishonesty, honor or betrayal - it went from one extreme to the other like the audience was in a secret attempt by the writers to break the Guinness Record for yo-yoing. Too much work for the audience, for too little payoff, I say; it was exhausting. I am guessing that the ride in the park is similar: back and forth and back and forth, just to the point of breaking "the fine line," you know, when you are just about to throw up? Now that I think of it, the actors' quality of performances yo-yoed from scene to scene as well. Up with Depp, down with Bloom. Up and down, up and down. It could have ended far sooner than it had. And the special effects, while impressive programming for video games and home entertainment centers, also did nothing for me when substituting skeletons for fleshy humans in this movie. I found the graphics an answer to the laziness in not using real humans in makeup and costume. They looked incredibly costumed and made up as human pirates, why not try the same technique for the immortal pirates? I thought it was kitschy and a cop-out. Johnny Depp outperformed everyone in this movie, including the writers and director. Other than Rush, the only others who performed on nearly the same level were the two goofballs trying to prevent him from docking, and later holding the flag during the execution scene. 6/10
9.0~A Surprising Gem KnightsSayNI Sign in Permalink When I was first planning to view this film I must admit my expectations where not that high. After all, the title did give a cheesy feel to the whole thing. However, I must say that within 10 minutes of the film I was completely spellbound by the film, characters, and plot. The fight scenes where well done and not over dramatized, the animation of the skeletons was smoothly done, and the acting was incredible. The most surprising factor was how Johnny Depp played his character Jack Sparrow. Normally I am not a Depp fan per say, I enjoy his work but I don't exactly find myself fascinated by it. This role, however, gave me a whole different view of how truly talented Depp is as an actor. Depp took on a whole different role that even varied in the way his character Sparrow carried himself and mastered it like it was nothing. Bloom was also a pleasant surprise. A few minutes into the film in you completely forgot about the elf and focused on the character in front of us. After seeing Bloom in this film I can honestly say that he is not a typecast and will well be on his way to the top. Rush was excellent as usual and portrayed his role as `a captain so evil Hell spat him out' with such humanity you actually felt a bit sorry for the cursed pirate. All in all, this film is a rare gem to come from behind the Disney vaults. Along with the superb acting the writing, camera movement, plot, and timing was perfect. Not once did you feel the length of the movie setting in like `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' or like watching `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' a third time. Humor, drama, action, and adventure where perfectly balanced out to make this film the movie of the summer.
10.0~My very favorite movie!!!!!!!! clandestine_kiddo Sign in Permalink I am absolutely in love with this movie!!! I love everything about it!!! Before I first watched it, I was skeptical. I thought, 'What kind of a movie is this?' I originally thought it was going to be the kind of movie that Disney intended it to be. You know with all the swashbuckling pirates and nonsense like that. But oh boy was I wrong. When I first watched it, I immediately fell in love with it! I loved Johnny Depp as *Captain* Jack Sparrow even thought at that time, I was in love with Orlando Bloom! I instantly became obsessed with that movie and everything about it! And now, a few years later, I am still completely obsessed with it, but I have also picked up an obsession with the ever-so-amazing, Johnny Depp. Now that the second movie has come out, I am going to see it as many times as possible. I am absolutely amazed by all of the sword fights in those movies and also how amazingly believable Johnny Depp is as Captain Jack. I found it remarkable that he pretty much created that character! This movie is so amazing!! So amazing, that, in fact, I watch it every single day! I am now in love with Pirates II! And i'm pretty sure that when the 3rd movie comes out in summer '07, that I will be completely obsessed with it too!!!
10.0~Amazing! Jessejessejesse Sign in Permalink This movie is absolutely excellent! Johnny Depp gives one of my favorite acting performances of all time as the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is fantastic! Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is great. Kiera Knightly is my only problem with the movie...I find her extremely unlikeable (she is better in this one than the second and third one). The movie is a ton of fun and it's still the best in the franchise so far. I really like all four movies though...but I love the first the most! The movie is so great. Overall, I give the movie a 10/10. It's extremely fun, well acted, great special effects, and amazing action!
3.0~Another Jerry Bruckheimer Piece of Trash mOVIemAN56 Sign in Permalink The first thing I realized when I saw this film was that Disney is running out of ideas for good films. I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks. It's a pirate film with some good acting but Orlando Bloom proves yet again that he can't act. After the daughter of the governor of an island in the Caribbean is captured by mysterious pirates, only two people are able to save the beloved Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). These two men are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Some how they are able to comender a British super vessel able to navigate it across the ocean. The movie just went way to long, topping two hours and twenty minutes, way to long for a Disney film. Jerry Bruckheimer adds tons of corny lines and supposed battle scenes between undead pirates and British Soldiers . Johnny Deep and Geoffery Rush do what they can with the roles they're given. Their are some beautiful filmed scenes of the ocean but their really isn't a story. I guess you could call this entertaining for a nine year old but for anyone else it's just a yawn fest. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Starring: Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, Keira Knightley, and Jack Davenport. 2 out of 5 Stars.
1.0~McDisney dreadful. 2 violent for kids, 2 dumb for adults. videoclerk Sign in Permalink How sad. I was so looking forward to this movie. I love Pirate Lore. From the director of that smash hit The Mexican, this movie sucked. It should have gotten more Disney treatment, or none at all. The story was so shallow, the characters were so shallow, that it would have maybe been a terribly entertaining film for the kids, but the movie was too dark and violent for the little ones. I thought Depp would work wonders with this, but the script was so inane. There wasn't enough meat for the adults. I didn't care at all about any of the characters. I kept wating to hear "Ding, please turn the page." Some nice moments, but just a few. Over all, a let down. Rent the Musketeer for swordplay, or rent Mutiny for munity. As for pirates, even the Pirate Movie starring Kristie McNichol was more engaging than this. And it was a musical.
7.0~Best Disney movie Id say deatman9 Sign in Permalink I actually liked this movie quite a bit when it first came out and its still good to this day. Usually Disney goes for really childish movies but this one has more of a grown up feel and with a fun interesting story line and a great performance from Johnny Depp this movie becomes very enjoyable. This movie is about a blacksmith who teams up with pirate Jack Sparrow in order to save the love of his life who was kidnapped by Sparrows ex gang of pirates who are now undead monsters. I know the plot sounds kind of silly and strange but this movie is really enjoyable. Besides the countless historical errors if you blot those from your mind and just sit back and enjoy the ride it is very fun once all said and done with.
8.0~Johnny Depp steals the show louisiana Sign in Permalink Just got to see this film, somewhat belatedly. Had heard/read a lot about it, and I wasn't disappointed - it's very funny and Johnny Depp walks away with it as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast includes a lot of very fine actors - Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Mackenzie Crook as well as Orlando Bloom (Legolas-on-a-boat) and the easy-on-the-eye Keira Knightley. It's all done with great gusto and gives the impression the whole cast were having a ball. Definitely worth seeing more than once.
2.0~Mushy and slow raphal Sign in Permalink What a terrible movie!! I give it a two, because Johnny Depp is incredible and makes it ALMOST worth it (not quite, really), but there's only that much good he can do to a movie with a botched plotline, and ferociously dim-witted, unfunny dialogs. It hardly made me laugh: one can't squeeze all that much fun out of uninspired actors left on their own, discarded plot elements, random fights, and a slippery glass eye. It seemed it would go on forever: I enjoyed about 5 minutes of it, and hated the rest. A hopeless waste!
6.0~Guess I didn't get it... redbudnate Sign in Permalink With all of the buzz about this movie, it is possible I expected too much. With that said, I don't get the big deal about this movie. Johnny Depp is great. He does his best to hold the movie together, but even his performance couldn't save it in my eyes. First off the special effects weren't all that spectacular. It was cool to see the people turn into skeletons when they passed in and out of the moon light, but when you had a chance to really look at them it was sort of cheesy. The biggest problem with this movie is that Disney couldn't decide whether this advertisement for one of their rides (marketing brilliance by the way, no matter how disgusting it is) should be for kids or adults. In the end, it didn't fit for anyone. It was too violent for little kids with scenes of people getting killed with swords and their throats slit by daggers. It was WAY too hokey for adults. Maybe it works for 13-year-olds that haven't seen the special effects in the Matrix or Lord of the Rings. My advice, don't get your hopes up based on what the majority is saying about this one.
8.0~Fun and dumb. invisibleunicornninja Sign in Permalink This movie is entertaining with great cinematography and performances. This movie is both funny and dramatic. I'd highly recommend watching this movie. The action and comedy is perfectly balanced to create the most enjoyable and least stupid movie of this series.
8.0~A Great Swashbuckling Action Adventure! moviewizguy Sign in Permalink This swash-buckling tale follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, Barbossa along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made. This is a very entertaining action adventure and probably is one of the best films ever made! I'm not exaggerating. It has an interesting storyline for people to watch, great characters for people to love, great action scenes for people to get them to the edge-of-their-seats, and some clever dialog for people to laugh at! I even have to disagree that the film is too long. Well, I didn't mind it at all because I didn't find a single moment in the movie ever being boring. The special effects of the film was good, as well as its costume design, and production design. As you can tell, Johnny Depp plays another, but this time, a really weird character. His acting is funny and the other two roles by Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley were all good. The score is also memorable, still being played today. If you want a great, big summer movie (well, that was 4 years ago) then go on and watch the film for you folks who still have yet to watch it! It's funny, thrilling, romantic, and so on!
