10.0~Greatest comedy show johnpraseedom Sign in Permalink Watching the same episodes again will only increase the laughter. Such is the class of this show.
10.0~Timeless meganoreilly4 Sign in Permalink A timeless wonderful comedy that I never get tired of
7.0~A good show with a great flaw. sephiroth516 Sign in Permalink Friends is a funny and witty sitcom with some intelligent humour and a couple well written plot sequences. Unfortunately the show is bogged down by one of the most irritating characters in any show in recent memory. Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston is constantly whining and complaining about the smallest of things. I'm aware her character is meant to be spoiled but there is a point where it ceases to be funny and is purely frustrating. But other characters are flawed as well. Phoebe is forgettable, and Ross's illogical eagerness to simply put up with all of Rachel's whininess is foolish. Chandler is easily the most deep and funny character although his depth is still nothing significant compared to other more modern sitcoms like How I Met Your Mother. In the end, Friends is a very funny show that stays consistently amusing throughout it's 236 episodes but falls short of greatness.
10.0~one of the best shows! jenniinajjanette Sign in Permalink This show is legit the funniest show i've ever watched. i got no negative comments when it comes to Friends! love it so much <3
10.0~Amazing mmalahmad Sign in Permalink I loved the story more than their jokes and how the relations get deeper and not everything have a happy ending
9.0~The best TV sitcom ever made!! In-a-Haze Sign in Permalink There are few shows that come as close to perfect as FRIENDS does; with its nonchalant charm, its beloved characters and its hilarious plot lines, FRIENDS is a enjoyable sitcom that really makes you feel like you know its characters, for in a way you do. Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry head-up this popular TV show that has been a great addition to everyone's weekly sit-down-to-watch-TV periods. Each character is special and unique, and all equally funny. Ross has the greatest faces, and can make me laugh until I cry. Rachel is hilarious with her witty comebacks, Monica just has this way about her that gets me every time. Chandler, of course, has this sarcastic humor that constantly cracks me up, and Phoebe has a wild and wacky way about her that really gets to you. And then there's Joey. Joey is the stupid one, who also happens to be in my opinion the funniest. Joey is a really great comedian and can make anyone fall on the floor laughing! The whole show of FRIENDS is definitely the best ensemble cast ever, and in all the best TV sitcom ever made.
10.0~Is there any chance that it can be back?! ashraf_zaky11 Sign in Permalink This is the best series I,ve ever watched, you watch it again and again and you know what the next sentence Ross will say and you can't move from your chair, I can't imagine how the 6 are combined as perfect as this, you can never imagine anyone out or replaced by any other actor, it is just...PERFECT, they are so real, so good, so funny, they make you laugh from the inside, all what you see are facts from life, you can't think that they are acting, as if you see real people, and as I believe always, Inspite of good actors/acting, good script, good story, good music, good directing, there is always a "SPIRIT" for every show, if this spirit is good, people will love the show, and Friends have this spirit, I just wish if it can return back, can it..???
9.0~Very Good jkd15-1 Sign in Permalink In my opinion Friends is at the bottom of what I call the great four. Seinfeld ELR and KOQs then Friends. Don't get me wrong, this show is at the top of the list in sitcoms. It just doesn't make it to the apex. I watched this show for many years and loved it. But its replay isn't that good. I can watch ELR many times over. Friend just doesn't have the staying power for me as the other three. Boy it seems like I am putting this show down. I loved this show when it was new. And I watched a lot of replays until I had seen all of the episodes. Maybe I am just burned out with it.
9.0~Still Relatable MBeck10 Sign in Permalink Friends is a show full of whitty humor, fun characters, heartbreaking moments, and awkward situations. From the airing of its first episode in 1994, up to last episode in 2004, writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman found ways to keep audiences captivated, Humor, brilliant set designs and the wildly ordinary lives of Joey, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Phobie, and Rachel are what kept us all watching. Thanks to the creative writing style of Marta Kauffman and David Crane, Friends quickly became a fan favorite. Many of the iconic phrases they used throughout the show fall may somewhere in your vocabulary today. Phrases like, "we were on a break," "how you doin?" and worst of all, anything that comes out of Janice's mouth. We can all her her voice now, "CHANDLER BING," and "Oh. My. Gawwwwwwwd." Kauffman and Crane were brilliant writers, their ability to adapt and come up with new fresh ideas is what kept Friends alive. The two writers spent a lot of their time during shooting tweaking their writing to the crowds reaction. If they didn't get the reaction they were expecting, Kauffman and Crane would turn to the audience and ask for input. They turned to the cast members, particularly Matthew Perry aka Chandler, for suggestions as well. Many times the those suggestions made it to the final cut of the episode. This was their way of ensuring that everyone was enjoying the show. Kauffman and Crane's writing was fantastic. Their writing however, was not the soul reason Friends was as successful as it was, people like the writers who helped Kauffman and Crane, editing teams, cameramen, light guys, boom operators, and the set teams. These amazing groups of people mad it all happen and brought writing on a paper to a ten season tv show. Just as iconic as the character of Friends are, some of their set pieces are equally as iconic. When thinking of Friends, there are a couple pieces in each set that one might recognize, the orange couch from the coffee house Central Perk, the foosball table in Chandler and Joey's apartment, the picture frame around the the peephole in Rachel and Monica's apartment, and even the bizarre 3D framed picture named Edna that floats around from time to time. These things, along with others you may be thinking of, enhance the aesthetics of the show and draw your attention to the sets and what is happening around the characters. When you see these pieces, you know exactly where the characters are. This, along with good camera work are another reason why Friends, more than ten years later, is still loved by many. But arguably, the best part of the show are the characters. Ross, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Pheoby, and Rachel are 6 iconic names that made Friends into the show it is today. Writers Kauffman and Crane made these characters relatable, friendly, and funny in order to gain fandom amongst all crowds. From the controlling behavior of Monica, to the corky dad like humor of Chandler, everyone has someone they feel they closely relate to. The choice of actors for Friends could not have been any better. With Jennifer Aniston aka Rachel, being the most popular of the bunch, all have been able to go onto different acting jobs and perform very well in various roles. Friends has been off the air for over ten years now, but the humor is not lost on us. We use their language, we recognize their names, and we see their talent. For its time, and even for today's standards, Friends has earned its spot in history with all the other great movies and TV shows Roger Ebert said were, "two thumbs up."
10.0~ONE OF THE BEST EVER! tony mcarea Sign in Permalink Even though it went somewhat downhill this past season, Friends still is one of the best, funniest and most reliable shows on TV. All of this thanks to its ensemble (the best comedic ensemble by far on TV) and by its top notch writers who always manage to come up with good storylines every season. True be told, this past season the show declined somewhat in quality, but seasons 1-6 are easily brilliant, hilarious, with terrific storylines and smart writing. One of the best sitcoms ever.
10.0~All seasons are fantastic .a masterpiece cenkbug Sign in Permalink With the original dallas...this show stands as the best show of tv history..according to me..with one difference dallas lost its fire after season 9(dream season) but friends is always funny till to the end. I have watched it 2x so far and will start watching again with dallas the original.....so just watch the 1st episode..then the force will be with you :)))
10.0~WHY did the show have to end? ninnia Sign in Permalink I didn't get in touch with the excellent show until it had ended, but I could on the other hand buy the whole box at once! I have watched it over and over again and I miss them soooooo much every time I've seen the last episode! They are the only friends that never disappoint me!!! Most of all I like Rachel. Please please please dear authors and actors do a few more episodes or, what the heck, continue until you're all too old to work anymooore!!! :-D I have never understand why Seinfeld got so liked. I think it is nice to see but I don't have to see it. Friends makes me lose track of life totally! When I'm in my watching-marathons I don't do anything else. Who needs food when there are FRIENDS????????
9.0~A Classic Malcom-Funk Sign in Permalink I admit it. I haven't watched a single episode of Friends until two weeks ago. After watching some random episode I thought 'Hey! This ain't so bad', so I decided to give it a try. Now, two weeks later I'm halfway through season 9... I really got drawn into this show. You start to care for those six people like they were family. Each character has his own perks and flaws and that's why you start identifying with them. And with 3 guys and 3 girls there's really enough material to appeal to both men and women. Even though I love the characters and the comedy, I can't give this show the full 10/10 because, after 7 seasons, plots are starting to repeat themselves, I especially got tired of the whole Ross & Rachel situation after a while. Also this show often contradicts itself. While in the beginning Ross has "only slept with one women" (His ex-wife Carol) somewhere in season 6 or 7 Chandler reveals that he slept with some cleaning lady in college which simply is not possible. Stuff like that happens quite a few times and I sometimes get the feeling that the writers forget to watch their own show. Those flaws really do bum me out and keep me from really 100% getting into this show. Still great, 9/10.
10.0~Funny yet heartfelt Plotman Sign in Permalink Friends is one of my top 5 comedies of all time. It has a really nice balance of being flat out funny and having characters that you can really relate to. Each character is different, which offers comedy for different senses of humor. It doesn't feel like the comedy is forced as with other shows. It really feels like a group of friends with very different personalities all hanging out. Unlike other comedies, it also really develops the characters and makes you somewhat invested in their lives, which allows them to have some more serious moments. Like all the good comedies, it's one you can watch over and over through the years.
1.0~Boring pathetic arnavvv Sign in Permalink Boring, forced laughter makes no sense. Stinky old show.
10.0~unique dragokin Sign in Permalink You'll seldom find shows like Friends, that were long lasting without considerable drops in quality. During it's ten seasons, we've witnessed the life of six main characters and a myriad of recurring characters and guest stars. Probably the strongest message is that all of the six characters are good, no matter what situations they're going through and misunderstandings they might be causing. At the same time, the strongest quality of Friends is that the show never became sleazy. Since i've invested a couple of months in watching the show in its entirety minus the bloopers and the interviews, i think i've had a good overview. Seasons 1 to 6 were the "organic growth" in terms of plot and character development. Seasons 7 and 8 were the most mature and 9 and 10 were the logical "phase-out". Actually, there was not much left to be said in the given environment...
6.0~Just What I Thinks About "Friends" whitehorse767 Sign in Permalink Yeah... Friends was an good comedy plus a little romantic TV series. Specially Joey, Phoebe, Ross and Chandler were the best characters in the show but Monica, Rachel wasn't that good as rest of them in character wise, They over act, make stupid faces, every time screwed something, I don't know but I just don't like them (Monica, Rachel) no offense though, I guess that's what their character was. I feel a big disappointment and sad and a bit anger whenever I looked at them in the show. But on the other hand I loved Joey, the way he talks were have the most funniest thing ever on this show, and the Ross's expressions. They're the true artist and have done something so great that no one couldn't ever think of forget them. And yeah.. the weirdness overload of Phoebe. Love it.. It could become a Great show without those Monica, Rachel's expressions.
10.0~The BEST!! big-talking_man Sign in Permalink I don't normally comment on movies or anything, but I just had a FRIENDS night, where I just watched pretty much the whole 4th season and had to watch the last episode of season 10 in which Ross and Rach finally get back together. I mean, forget Romeo and Juliet, Tarzan and Jane, Rambo and his gun. This is the real thing. There's never ever been a couple more made for each other (on TV) than those two. I started watching FRIENDSin 1994, and was a fan right from the beginning. I was 7 by then, so I can say I grew up with the guys and it really kind of tore my heart out when it ended 4 years ago. I watched it with my girlfriend who is not really that into the series and could thus not really understand the fuss I was making about the final (well, she tried, though). Anyway, I couldn't believe that it had to end. I had so much fun with all of them. I mean, laughing about Chandler's genius comments and jokes, about Joeys stupidity, Phobee's naivety, Ross's way of being (and the dinosaurs!!), Monica's mania for cleanliness and Rachel's beauty and...way of being, too. They're unique, witty, and hilarious, the chemistry is perfect between all of them. It's just incomparable. It's just been the most amazing show there ever was. There's never gonna be anything like this. And I am really sorry for that. Well, I'd like to thank Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Courtney Cox-Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer for just being the best FRIENDS, Thanks. You rock!! Well, thanks!
10.0~Best show EVER ojineeadib Sign in Permalink I recommend anyone to see this sitcom, it's the best of all. Even after 14 years you will defiantly enjoy it and love it.
10.0~Sweet and funny!! biuxbb Sign in Permalink This thing is one of the most amazing TV shows of all times! I watched this show 3 times! It's worth it! It might look old or something like that, but it does not matter it is amazing! You will love the 6 crazy friends who are adorable and very very funny. It has super strong friendships and some drama/romance. I do have to warn you, you will get attached to these beautiful characters, you will cry when it ends, but don't let that stop you! Please, watch it, you will not regret it! I am only saying this because I really want you to see it because I'm 100% sure that you will enjoy it! And if you haven't watched it yet, you're missing big time!
10.0~Absolutely fabulous! Addictive! CarlaLavy Sign in Permalink Friends is a fantastic way to 'get away from it all' for a bit. There are times when you don't like one character for something he/she has done or the way the writers chose to go with the ongoing story, but the Friends cast of characters are always close to your heart. There hasn't been a cast so large that compliments each other so well in the history of TV serials. If by some strange act of God you haven't viewed a few Friends shows, do so. You'll want to see them all. The show is addictive. You see the characters go thru many things in theirs lives that can be sad, but you also see that they do survive it with the help of their friends.
5.0~The idea was good, but... julian_abadia Sign in Permalink To these days I can't figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people. The best conclusion I could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that American people where suffering in those days. Perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as: divorce, infidelity, sexual inclinations, obsession etc, with a smile on their faces, real people in a way, could deal with that issues in that way. However, "Friends" was a fictional show, much of what it happened, albeit taken from reality, was dealt in a light-hearted way. To sum up, although the premise was interesting (six friends living together in New York), the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic.
10.0~Friends say I'm like phoebe :) swetasspal Sign in Permalink This is one of the best series I've ever seen. I still remember the characters with their Friend's character names. We are also 6 friends, 3 boys and 3 girls and have named ourselves from the characters of Friends and I'm referred as Phoebe as People come to me with their problems :) I always wish that I stay with my friends forever as we see in the series. Its so much fun you hangout and have fun all the time. Yes, there are difficult times too but above all you guys are together always. Friends is not just a comedy series but you get to learn a lot. The sacrifice of Monica for Ross i love it. Overall its all time no:1 entertainer.
10.0~Friends is the best show ever bone_thugs_2003 Sign in Permalink This show is the best show ever. You could never get a better show. Every single episode you will get a very good laugh. You will never get annoyed with this show no matter how many times you watch it. It is the best show ever. Rachael (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled one who runs out on her wedding day in the first episode, Monica (Courteney Cox)is the chef who doesn't like her mum very much because she is always criticizing everything Monica does, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) is the one that has come off the streets and is a masseuse, Ross (David Schwimmer) is Monica's brother and he is the favorite that his parents like his parents say he was a "medical marvel" and he is a paleontologist, Chandler (Matthew Perry) is the sarcastic one who makes a lot of jokes, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) is the one who is an actor and who is the one who gets all of the girls. Friends is the best show ever and you could not find a better show
10.0~I still can't believe it's over srkmish Sign in Permalink Granted its over and many have forgotten but in the hearts of millions of fans the show still lives on.I can't believe when i am feeling down if i remember any event of friends,it cracks me up.As entertaining as it was,furthermore it has left a deep psychological effect on me.I still sometimes wonder what would have happened had the show went on.The pairing of the six people was beautiful and in due course they really became best friends.The parting was just too painful and we all wished that the show never ended It instilled in everyone of us a desire to be friends like them.It was not just about the comedy it was also about the emotional bonding.It was a beautiful mix of eccentric characters who passed their lives leaning on the trusty shoulders of their friends
9.0~A pure definition of must-see TV! Catherine_Grace_Zeh Sign in Permalink "FRIENDS," in my opinion, is a pure definition of must-see TV! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny whenever a mishap occurred. I always laugh at them. As a matter of fact, I think just about every single episode I've seen was funny. The only character that annoyed me to death was Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). It's hard to explain why. If you ask me, she's the kind of character you want to slap silly. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.
10.0~You Have 6 Friends: Chandler, Joey, Monica, Rachel, Ross & Phoeby fdexsingle Sign in Permalink This show is really a masterpiece. One of the best sitcom's comedy in the world. This 6 friends, is my friends, and yours friends and yours and yours and yours, this 6 Friends is everybody's friends. After the first season, you'll be excited that you pick this sitcom to watch. Comments about actors? Ooh, there is... Joey: Italian actor, very very funny, has his own style and one of my favorites! Monica: Very ingenious actress, some hilarious ways too see things, she is a pleasant surprise. Ross: Monica's brother, he's a lover. Loved Rachel, since the first episode, to the very last. Funny too! Rachel: Ooh, Rachel! She is beautiful, has a style of a elegant girl. This show, is not the same show, without her! Phoeby: Yes, Phoeby. Phoeby is some of a very talented actress. In the show, she really fits in well. Chandler: I have to say: Chandler is the BEST in this show. Really the best. Very, very, very funny, he has the style, to make the show, ONE OF THE BEST SITCOME'S EVER! I really enjoyed all of the 10's seasons, and get my advice: WATCH THIS SHOW!
10.0~If you got some free time,then watch this incredible series 'cause its worth it.And sure you'll laugh like hell. shakilabuzafor0 Sign in Permalink After watching GOT's 5 seasons in for 3 months,i was looking to watch some comedy TV-series.I heard about this TV-series 'FRIENDS' from my friends a lot and saw some good reviews and ratings in many websites.And I'm a fan of both Jennifer Aniston from Just Go With It and Matthew Perry from The Odd Couple,so finally i decided to watch this popular series and i gotta tell you it is as great as everyone says it is. My first reaction was 'Wow,Jennifer Aniston looks so cute here' i was blown,man.Every dialogue was brilliant and funny as hell and the character,Chandler can make jokes in any situation and his acting was marvelous.He is my favorite and i'd say he is the backbone of this show.I think the story is mostly about this character Ross who is a passionate paleontologist and bit confused about his feelings toward Rachel who was his high school crush and mainly the story starts by entering of Rachel in these guys life.This series is full of comedy and also shows how complicated relationships can be and in the end how it is worth all the troubles people go through.Joey portrays an ideal best buddy,womanizer and how dumb a man can be,he also shows us how competitive it is to work in acting industry.If you're a comedy enthusiast then u have to watch this series.It literally filled the whole in my heart that 'How i met your mother' left.They beautifully illustrated the love story of Chandler and Monica,it is really awesome when friends become lovers,well in some cases its a disaster.Monica's habit of organizing and cleaning everything made this show more funnier.This series isn't just about clever jokes and love stories,this story also demonstrates about how to build-up career from small to large.You'll see Rachel go from working as a waitress in a coffee house to working in a big fashion company like Ralph Lauren and Ross halfway to winning a noble prize.And no matter how late it is u gotta follow Ur passion,Chandler is a great example for that.You'll also learn how important friends and families are in anyone's life.All i gotta say is this show delivers reality of life through comedy and silly events,and i think that's what makes this show GREAT.
10.0~That show you'll always come back to victoria-tewari Sign in Permalink Friends is one of the most amazing tv shows ever made, even nowadays. No tv comedy has been able to be equal in terms of quality, fun and drama, so I gues it's best sitcom out there. Watch it! You won't regret it.
8.0~Hard to define, generation-defining that endured napierslogs Sign in Permalink "Friends" is one of those television shows that you just can't define and not because it's so great and original that words don't exist to capture it, but rather because it's so ordinary and it succeeded. 6 twenty-something friends trying to navigate life, jobs, and romance sure doesn't sound original and it's not. It's not ground-breaking in any way except for the fact that it basically united and defined a generation for almost no explicable reason. Almost every single person who grew up with the friends, can now relate every daily occurrence in their lives to an episode of the show. The show wasn't even that realistic, but all of the actors added a warmth and accessibility to each of their characters, that we hung on to every word, found comfort in their flaws, and craved that they found what they wanted. The characters weren't even that well written. In every episode you can find a contradiction to something they said or did in an earlier episode, and sure that will bother you for awhile but then the next week the friends made you fall in love with them again because the actors had that gift of connecting you to them. There's a good chance that a new show like "Friends" will not be able to find the same success. So I say to the new twenty year-olds out there to start watching "Friends" because it just may capture your generation the way it did mine.
10.0~funny and addictive valentinamaerkl Sign in Permalink I only started to watch friends because everyone said it would be cool. first I didn't understand the jokes but later on I started to understand them . The stories are very good and it's very addictive! Its also very funny once you are in the Friendsfever!! Love it!!
10.0~Masterpiece Nadiajudaii Sign in Permalink It is the best show ever .. when you start watching the show you will know and meet new true friends that will stick in your head for decades with all their wonderful personalities .. I just can't believe there are people still dose not watch it !!!
10.0~They couldn't be more fun smeagol_s Sign in Permalink When you watch one episode you may find them weird. At the second one you'll be sure to laugh more than once. Then you start to like them. You get to like their jokes better and better. Than you watch a couple more episodes and you can't tell when you started to love them. All six characters are very characteristic and just as imperfect. But guess what - they don't care about their faults, which they can't change. They stay themselves and love one another the way they are. That's the reason why they always lift up your spirit when you watch them. You can identify yourself with some of their features and learn to accept and like yourself. And above all, the humor is so brilliant, well timed, just the greatest portion of laughter you can serve yourself for 22 minutes. In fact the greatest anomaly of 'Friends' is that they repeatedly make jokes on some topic, (like Ross's hair or Monica's obsession about order) and each time you'll find these jokes more fun. If you don't know 'Friends' yet, surely you don't know what you're missing, and if you do know them it's worth to remember them better by watching all seasons again!
4.0~Probably The Most Overrated Sitcom In History, Ever wchngliu Sign in Permalink I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least. What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever.
10.0~My Best Friends perfectionist102 Sign in Permalink Wow!!! This has got to be the best show ever. I began watching it when I was nine, in the eighth season. The only reason I didn't watch it earlier was because I thought that since adults watched it, it had to be boring. But was I wrong. Now, I am the biggest Friends Fan. When it canceled, I started dreaming about the show. Do you know a bigger fan? But in Friends, you go through so many problems, and so many laughs. It truly makes your life better, if your sad, lonely, bored, or even happy. THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN IS FRIENDS!!!!!! I had "The Rachel" cut. I have Smelly Cat as my ring-tone. I want my life to be like the one Monica and Chandler have together. But doesn't everybody? I understand some people don't like Friends. But I feel that it is a show that is meant for life. If you watch (multiple episodes) you will understand.
10.0~The Best TV Show Ever! nejcnemcek-01404 Sign in Permalink I first heard of Friends about three years ago from my parents and then when I subscribed to Netflix I got an opportunity to watch the show and it blew me away! I have watched them over and over, episode after episode, season after season for over three times now and I plan on watching it the forth time. I guarantee that you will enjoy this as much as I did and I highly recommend it. Have fun!
10.0~Best show ever. JosephWaeltermann Sign in Permalink A timeless classic. Friends will forever be the GOAT
10.0~If you haven't seen FRIENDS, yer missing out on the most clever show ever written sampsonart Sign in Permalink Friends has got to be the most cleverly written show to ever be on. No wonder it lasted 10 seasons. It's funny, very clever and each episode is original. This show is one of the best comedies I've ever seen and I'm usually not a fan of comedies
10.0~Liked It Before Season 6 shinedowness Sign in Permalink Ross was a huge tool to Rachel more than 3 times, which is why I never got the reason why the writers decided to make those 2 characters end up with each other. Their chemistry seemed forced to me. When a show "forces" a couple together from an audience annoying the writers enough about it, that is when the show weakly sucks up to people's expectations about what it is supposed to represent to me. Which is why I stopped liking Friends before season 6. Monica and Chandler had a natural chemistry to me while Ross and Rachel did not. Also, I wished the writers would have left both Phoebe and Joey to be unwed throughout the seasons. That would have made both of their characters more interesting to me. All in all, this show was great before season 6 happened for my experience.
10.0~👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 laceemilija Sign in Permalink The show is great 👍🏻. I just wanted to say that Ross is the worst character of all time👋🏻🙏🏻👋🏻👁
10.0~BEST. SHOW. EVER almadyreborgandersen Sign in Permalink I LOVE FRIENDS. PLEASE WATCH IT. That's it, that's the review
10.0~Still great even after 25 years luisflfc Sign in Permalink Friends is a TV series that shows the reality of six very close friends, they are Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, Rachel e Phoebe, over 10 years it shows the daily life and what is happening with each of them in different areas, The show caught me from the very first episode, for example, right at the beginning, there are crisis in the lives of the characters, with a more critical situation in Ross and Rachel's life, both of them had just break up their corresponding relationship, they search for their friends' help, who were in the cafeteria where they hang out and share their crises and everyday experiences. Another interesting aspect in the series, in my opinion, is the love relationships between the friends, because it shows that the basis of all good relationships starts from friendship and trust in one another, the series also tells the story of overcoming the 3 characters because it shows different personalities, conditions and problems, but with positive results, starting with Phoebe who grew up on the streets without a good family structure, but struggled and overcame her obstacles and had success, Monica who in adolescence suffered from obesity but with her competitiveness managed to control herself, lose weight and get a healthier life, the story of Rachel is the opposite of Phoebe, for she grew up in a house, together with her family and with a great financial condition, but she discovered that she had grown up and yet totally depended on her parents for her livelihood, but with the help of her friends and willpower, she overcame all her pride and grew in the area professional, family, and moral. Friends is a combo of reality, comedy, drama, and many life lessons, which make every second worth watching.
1.0~worst show kcapar Sign in Permalink This is the worst show. Buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing. Even Sesame Street has better humor and more adult than friends "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on television and I've been sitting in front of the tube observing Friends" simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of "Frasier". The characters in "Friends" seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl. The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of "Friends".)
10.0~The best show that is on TV! candieturner Sign in Permalink This is the best show. My whole family sits around the television and watches it. Also we love watching the re-runs they are as great as the new episodes. You just get hooked and you are thinking, "Oh, what is going to happen?" I love this show and all of the cast. It is a very great show for the whole family to watch. I recommend this show to anyone who wants a lot of laughs and enjoyment in a show.
10.0~It's really funny until now every single day I watched. hassanxx-58631 Sign in Permalink I love so much friends.I hope this lovely show back:(.2019...
10.0~Best comedy priyansh-20570 Sign in Permalink This series is the best entertainment and comedy and all the characters containing in series all have given the best role they can perform.
10.0~One of the better American sit-coms TheLittleSongbird Sign in Permalink I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond. First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant. I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be "The One With the Scene in the Diner". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile. The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking. I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection. Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect. There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox
2.0~HIGHLY OVERRATED anamaysingh Sign in Permalink I can't understand why kids from this generation are pretending to be a great fan of this show just because it's a very famous show. I rarely find it funny.
4.0~Overrated, still not the worst android2002us Sign in Permalink It's not the worst thing on TV, but nowhere near the best. For everyone who says it's horrible, lighten up. If you watched it more frequently you'd find something you like, and besides there's been much, much worse. As for being the "best sitcom on TV," I'd have to disagree. There's only one really great sitcom- Seinfeld- and everyone who's seen an episode knows it. I'd rather watch a rerun of Seinfeld than a new episode of Friends any day (if they were still making new episodes, of course). However, I'd also rather watch a rerun of Friends over any episode of According to Jim or Yes, Dear. And for everyone who says Jerry was bad in Seinfeld because he almost cracked up in many episodes, that's because the episode was so funny nobody on the set could keep a straight face. Actually, when I see him almost laugh it makes me crack up because I know the joke really IS that funny. Back to the subject at hand, if you want mediocre, go with Friends. It's not that horrible.
10.0~One Of My All-Time Favorites AutzenMaven Sign in Permalink Caveat: The Oxford American Dictionary defines "comedy," as "1. a light, amusing play, film, television production, etc. 2. the branch of drama that consists of such plays." Please note the absence of any reference to reality, realism, plausibility, etc. It has been awhile since I took a course on film criticism, but I distinctly remember something about the requirement of "suspension of disbelief." Does anyone else remember that too? For all of you who worship at the altar of Seinfeld, Frazier, Newhart, and Cheers (shows I also relish), I believe that the same criticisms you are making of Kauffman, Bright, and Crane can also be leveled at the good folks who created those shows. What can I say? I am not even in the target demographic for this show. I am a 57 year old, male, professional...and I have seen every TV show from "Your Show of Shows" on to the present. This show ranks with the very best. The show did struggle a bit to get to Year 10, but still it was always funny...and the ensemble acting was as good as anything I have ever seen. Aniston/Cox/Kudrow/LeBlanc/Perry/Schwimmer; all winners. OK, snobbish purists...denigrate the show all you want. Aniston is this generations Lucy or Coca...and I could make similar comparisons for all of the other regulars. I realize that it is just "too hip" to trash the show when, of course, you realize you are just "so far above that sort of thing," but you miss the point. It is funny. It ain't cerebral...it is just funny. Yeah, it has "Ca-Ca, pooh-pooh," and sexual innuendo, double entendre, and cheap gags,but it also has some great stuff. Who does a double take better(and more affectedly) than LeBlanc? Who is more ditsy (for a Vassar girl) than Kudrow. Who is more witty than Perry. Who has done her best and never gotten any credit than Cox? Who tops Schwimmer for Yiddisher humor? If you are searching for a documentary about the so-called "yuppy lifestyle," please turn on PBS. Please do give us a break. We are all quite impressed by your effete sophistication and pedantry, but please, do drop your pretense and quit being so pompous! Just enjoy and have fun. Many of you film snobs think you are the very incarnation of Roger Ebert. Well, sorry...the job is taken. It may shock some of you to realize that some of us watch TV shows because we want to be entertained, not edified, and we just want to feel good and laugh at Theater of the Absurd. We are all really, really impressed with you cynics out there; with your trashing of this show. Can we BE more superior? I wonder how many of you have actually acted, or taken courses in television production? Probably not many. This show can be fun, even to people with a +3 Sigma IQ. If you can laugh at Oscar Wilde, or Monty Python, or Fawlty Towers...why not just open your mind and enjoy? For those of you who "hate" the show, please note that every single TV remote ever manufactured comes equipped with a rather large button (usually red) that makes mention of the term "POWER" or "OFF." Just my two cents.
10.0~Friends Forever subhraroy119 Sign in Permalink Probably the best sitcom I have watched so far . Each and every character has a special role to play in the story line. The chemistry between the cast is great . Most importantly I still find it funny 25 years after it has aired.
10.0~Best Sitcom of all time! bilalhussain-46904 Sign in Permalink The exclamation mark in the titles explains itself. 10 Years they appeared on the TV Screens as our favorite SIX FRIENDS. To this no sitcom, comes even close to this, in terms of making people laugh. It is really about how much can make people laugh at your jokes. It's Writing was the best thing I've scene in Comedy sitcoms over the years. How people in general think SEINFELD, Arrested Development, HIMYM, The Office etc are better than this, in terms of logic maybe but in terms of Comedy NO FREAKING WAY! All Characters were equal. Chandler had the best one-liners in any show ever. I finished watching the whole series in less than 2 weeks. IMO, this is the list of characters from best to well, Excellent, Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, Monica, Rachel. The creativity in Writing was the main thing, to perform in front of live audience was also a challenge but most important was the fact it ran for 10 straight years and never got boring or Lame at any point. If I had a chance to fulfill any of my dreams I would want to watch it live!
6.0~Friends, aka "how endless hype can turn mud into gold" Kalle_it Sign in Permalink To this day, the worldwide success of Friends is still a bit of a mystery to me. Sure, the show has its moments, but nothing that groundbreaking or laughing-out-loud funny that would have justified all the accolades. Friends was a very ambivalent show: it had the pretense of being believable, while still relying, and heavily so, on the same old Sticom 101 material. The characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new, but in the end they all fell into a stereotype, as the show was devolving into a comedy-soap. Whatever development the characters had, it was either short-lived, flimsy or a "Flanderization" (ie. comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasn't so dominant earlier on). The core of the show, the infamous Ross+Rachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous "we were on a break!" debacle. Both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat, which seriously harmed the empathy. Long, drawn-out relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down. Both Ross and Rachel instead acted like 8th graders all along, being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason. It almost felt like them getting back together was the writers' Haily Mary pass... "We're out of ideas... Let's get Ross and Rachel share a kiss, or have a baby!" The "happy ending" feels more like a token send-off to tie some loose ends, but it's really just another knee-jerk reaction of two adults who clearly can't put their act together. The same lack of development hits Joey as well. Despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot, if you're willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating, he goes from being a suave ladies' man to a childlike moron who's more or less his married friends baby. His aborted love story with Rachel could have been a much better finale, given he was indeed showing a softer side. But, alas, it had to be Ross+Rachel. Monica and Chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred, so them finding each other made sense and, with all the exaggerated personality quirks (Monica is a control freak, Chandler is socially inept) they're the most believable characters in the end. Phoebe can be fun on small doses, but she's clearly having mental issues, so shoehorning her into married life, albeit while still retaining her out-there personality, felt forced. That's the most annoying side of the show: for all the hype and all the great reviews, Friends was just another sit-com, with plenty of forced drama. The innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature, but I maintain it wasn't that great. Oh well, at least the show has aged horribly, so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller. Nostalgia will still keep it going strong, but to those who loved it so much back then I ask... watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise.
1.0~Sucks herbertvangaal Sign in Permalink This show isnt even worth 1 star. Bad actors bad Story line etc etc
10.0~"The most genuinely hilarious show to ever exist." shorty-sx Sign in Permalink "Friends" revolves around the lives of six distinctive, yet unique individuals. Although their lives seem to be typically American, if anyone, anywhere, had the chance to live half as happily as any one of the characters of the show, he could without a doubt consider himself the luckiest person on earth. "'Friends' gives us hope, hope of a better life". Although the plot caries the characters throughout numerous troubles and quarrels, the love that the six share allows them to overcome any obstacle and even turn the darkest moments into humor. "Laughter is the best medicine"  quite true. The only shame is that the person to make up that saying never had a chance to see an episode of 'Friends'. Truly incredible, there is not a single episode out of the 240, which would cause you to fall off your couch, or choke on spaghetti out of laughter. Any person to watch only a few consecutive episodes would inevitably fall in love with all six characters, who play the roles of what have become to be their own personalities. The only and greatest negative remark regarding 'Friends', is that they should have kept the show going. The writers, Marta Kaufman and David Crane, proved they can keep the excitement of the show going for ten years, which means they could have continued it indefinitely, and they should have. The greatest show to ever exist can be hardly considered a compliment.
9.0~Friends Forever! robert_deniro_tale Sign in Permalink I did not just watch a TV series for fun although it was really fun, I also lived with "friends" and I did learn so much. I'm not the same person before "friends". You can barely find something that makes you laugh in the meantime teaches you. Watching friend you get everything you want, laughing, crying, learning, annoying, sadness, happiness I'm young and I still haven't had sex, but I think now after finishing friends I know a lot about it and I think it will help me handle my sexual life. It helped me overcome my little sexual obsessions. I'm not going to adore "friends" unwisely with all infatuations; it has its own flaws, but it does have some hidden layers while you watch it. The things between friends and how they deal with their issues, that's really instructive and sometimes inspirational. I learned how to get along with people I love and how unselfish we should be at some critical points. I learned how sometimes we should be submissive and ignore ourselves; how to be compassionate about our important individuals. How to speak without talking (actually I don't know how I learned that from the series, but I did.) Chandler always gets right to the point without wasting your time, directly to the ultimate point. He is the very moment joker, who never gets clichéd and is always fresh. Phoebe is extremely creative and comes up with ideas that amaze the audience with its novelty, not clichéd at all. Rachel has the greatest heart which you can hear her heartbeats. After all if I am to choose one of friends to be with, that's for sure Ross. I used to be a little Monica, but I'm definitely Chandler+Ross. I'm not saying these because I adore these two characters, so I'm trying to say I'm like them; besides maybe no one really cares who I'm alike the most but with this arrangement of characters I think every specific audience can find his/her look-alike to some accuracies. That's the strength of "friends". Of course there are clichéd sequences at the series that sometimes are hard to avoid because, patterns can be not enough. Like when they're apparently unwilling to do something and they come to an agreement not to do that thing, but suddenly someone breaks the ice and others follow. Actually I don't consider these repetitive sequences as a serious shortcoming for two reasons; first, the series is really long and after some time one way or another repetition comes to the way and second, we cannot say we don't have those repetitions in our routine lives, so it's going to be OK because the series is a model of real life. At some moments they really annoy you; like there have been some times that I was just like "God, I hate phoebe stop that" but compared to the scenes you are thankful of the series cast, those annoying moments are unbelievably nothing. Chandler running into Janice is really really really annoying. Theseries is not ideal, but compared to other motion pictures it sure is a masterpiece. I won't regret watching this show!
10.0~Timeless Classic lindsey-dingwall1 Sign in Permalink Never gets old, fantastic writing ! Nothing like it on tv ! Sitcoms are all American cheesey crap - this was relatable
5.0~Funny enough but shallow - oh, so shallow dirtphelia Sign in Permalink I never really followed this show but I've watched episodes off and on, and though it's pretty funny in the first few seasons, it just gets stupid and extremely shallow as it goes on. The fat jokes are unbearable as are the jokes about not fitting in and not being popular. Monica is annoying and extremely high maintenance, which is fun in a quirky way and up to a point, but suddenly the show becomes all about her and it makes no sense. Rachel is the only female character that's relatable and likable most of the time, so why all the focus on the most annoying character in the whole show? Fun enough, sure, but shallow and somewhat empty in a weird way.
10.0~The Best Sitcom EVER gokulganesh Sign in Permalink I really dont wanted the show to end.Its a real stress reliever
10.0~Literally the BEST sophiac-07672 Sign in Permalink I wasn't even alive when this aired but I must have rewatched all 10 series about 20 times now!!! It's just so good!!!
10.0~Never Gets Old. rajashakaziz Sign in Permalink Along with the Fresh Prince and Only Fools and Horses, this is one on the greatest comedies of all time. The chemistry between the 6 leads is fantastic. A few similarities with Fresh Prince, but a great show in all. For me Joey (Matt Le Blanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) were a brilliant duo and how their characters matured in there roles. The rest Rachel, Monica, Phobe and Ross just as funny and weird as Joey and Chandler. Just watched it again on netflix, where i appreciated it even more, without the TV edits.
10.0~F.R.I.E.N.D.S everyday.... ryanhadi Sign in Permalink I came to know of this show just when I was about to finish 6th Grade in NYC, and though I was a kid back then it really make me realize that in every group of close friends out there, we can always find the things we see in this show. The way Joey and Chandler meet and later on become best friends for life, the way Ross and Rachel keep misunderstanding their true love for each other but finally get together, the way Phoebe reflects on the small things in life that matter a lot, and how Monica is so passionate and caring about everyone...I think that does happen with most of us....and even those people who don't like the show, if they for once watch a few episodes then they'll know that it's right. And everything shown in this series is very realistic, like how a group of friends are always there for each other in every step, and how each one cares for the other equally...well almost :) It's just that personally I love this show, it helps me realize a lot of things that happen in our lives but we miss out, and I think, what's life without friends after all? I'm 28 now, and I still watch the show on DVD every single day without a miss....big thanks to the creators and the perfect cast!
10.0~My favorite show!! icefire-588-128148 Sign in Permalink I absolutely love this show. I own all 10 seasons and have watched all of the episodes several times, and they never get old. But instead of rambling on about how awesome this show is, I will disprove some of the things people in negative reviews have said: 1. They could never afford those apartments. I guess that would be true, especially for Monica and Rachel in the earlier seasons while Rachel was a waitress and Monica was unemployed, but those people have obviously never seen many of the episodes. Monica's grandmother owned the apartment before her, so it costs her nearly nothing to live there. Ross is a professor, so he makes plenty of money to afford his apartment. Chandler also makes good money, and he has a roommate to split the cost. Phoebe also has a roommate, though we never met her. 2. The couches are always available in the coffeehouse. In some of the episodes people are getting up from the couches just as they are coming in, and in "The One with the Bullies" there IS someone sitting in their spot, and Ross and Chandler have to fight for their right to sit there. There were also some occasions where they weren't sitting at the couch when only one or two of the group were at the coffee house. And it's a TV show. It doesn't have to be completely accurate. 3. Ross and Rachel would never be together (aka, Rachel is so much hotter than Ross). Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. If you say that, you would also say that Chandler and Monica would never be together since Monica is much prettier than Rachel and Ross is more attractive than Chandler. The girls fell in love with them more for their personalities than their dashing good looks. 4. The title "Friends" is incredibly unimaginative. OK, so a show about friends is called "Friends". So what? A show about the Simpson family is called "The Simpsons", show about about an office is called "The Office", and shows about guys named House and Seinfeld are called "House" and "Seinfeld". No one is saying those shows have stupid names! 5. A show just about the everyday lives of 6 friends is boring and stupid. Hello! What do you think "Seinfeld" is about??? I love that show too, but it's stupid that people write that a show about friends is stupid and how much they love Seinfeld in the same review. 6. Their characters never mature through the 10 years the show takes place. Yes they have! They get better, more stable jobs. They get married. Have kids. Move out of the city. Etc. All of the things that normally happen between the ages of 25 and 35. Joey does remain immature, but that's part of his character. 7. The actors are terrible. Ummm, obviously not true since they've all won numerous awards for their performance in the series. The only bad actor is Joey (NOT saying Matt Leblanc's a bad actor), but again that's just part of his character. I love this show and it will probably always be on of my favorites. Some of the episodes are better than others (two of my favorites are "The one with the unagi" and "the one where no one's ready"), but that's true for all series.
10.0~Could this show BE any better!? mai_the_cutey Sign in Permalink I love friends! Its pretty much the only sitcom I can watch over and over and over again without getting sick of it. The casting of the characters is perfect, even though most of them were not the director's first choice. I have easily memorised every episode, and many of my friends have to. And whether it is watched avidly, or as background noise, every episode is every bit as funny as the first time you watch it. Some people don't get Friends, and I can see why. The comedy is very American, with references a lot of Europeans miss, however after watching a few episodes, you get used to it. I am so sad that they wont be making any more episodes. (except for talks about one more, come back special) but I'm glad it went out on a high and tied up most of the loose ends that needed to be tied. There are many continuity errors in the show, but that is normal for such a long running sitcom, and plus its actually fun trying to spot them. Friends is amazing!
10.0~goof on friends sophieburns1991 Sign in Permalink i love friends but i just thought that i would add another goof that i have noticed when watching friends. on the episode 'the one with the mugging' when joey has an audition with a famous actor and after realising that when joey needed the toilet helped him with impressing Leonard (famous actor/director), joey visits Monica and Chandler's apartment for more drinks. after going to the fridge joey returns with bottles of water and juices, but when the camera moves away and returns to him again joey has different drinks such as cans of coke and other fizzy drinks. i have noticed all the other goofs that there are also but i just thought that i would point out this one thanks.
10.0~Best show ever michaelgirardi Sign in Permalink I was very hesitant to watch this at first because I know my mom watched it and I thought it was a girly soap Oprah that I wouldn't like or relate to but boy was I wrong. I've seen Seinfeld, The Office, Breaking Bad, Friday Night Lights and many other shows which are all rated high and none of them compare to Friends. This show will make you want to stop everything and constantly watch it. I finished it in a little less than 2 months which is pretty damn fast considering there is 238 episodes. I recommend this show to everyone, it is a MUST watch show that is life changing. You will feel like you're one of the gang by season 2.
10.0~Simply flabergasting vaidyaakash Sign in Permalink Friends, Ohh what could I say, simply amazing. The best sitcom ever
10.0~Simply Awesome yogakani Sign in Permalink I started to watch this series after 10 years which had been last air casted. My friends suggested me to watch this. I thought first it was creepy .But after a while i got entertained. There was so much fun in watching this series. There was nothing to say bad... It is totally good. There is so much with Joey... I laughed maniacally because of him and Chandler...Which i like him the most...In the last one i was very emotional...Overall the series was really good... It lasts for 10 years..I am a fan of Joey..... and i used to like Chandler and Rachel too...But i hated Pheobe for her creepy behavior.. I want this to continue air cast new episodes.....
10.0~A true work of art, metaphorically speaking. danielglass-36027 Sign in Permalink This was an amazing journey that i went through with the characters and the laughing audience. I feel like I was laughing right there with the audience. My favourite character is Ross because he has the same name as me. P.S. my teacher is pretending he is Darth Vader. LOL 🍑🍑🍑
10.0~Friends - WOW adsgroupoffice Sign in Permalink One of the best series on TV! Amazing show!!!! I think, Rachel and Chandler its great actors. Monica and Chandler are beautiful couple. This show is forever! I Hope, they are return for one final movie chapter! I watch them again - 100% I love this people! this 100000 of 10!!!
10.0~friends is endless laughter ruma_uk85 Sign in Permalink i have been watching friends since i was 12 years old and now i'm 21 and still watch its repeated series... every single episode for me is a blessing .... :-) whenever I'm feeling down .... friends make me laugh !!!! i remember i used to have a massive crush on both joey and chandler and up to this day i love them both for their personalty and comic acting i love all of the characters in friends. Rachel - being the rich pretty girl next door. Monica - (She reminds me of mom so much) a obsessive cleaning freak!!!! Joey - who has no clue to anything except girls and food!!!! Chandler - who trys to act smart and also succeeds in it sometimes. Ross - the innocent and childlike man !!!! i love friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10.0~Awesome kovvboyzfanjr Sign in Permalink This is the best show/sitcom ever!!! Always a great show to watch!!
9.0~all in all excellent except monica selena-r Sign in Permalink it's basically understandable and welcomed even in china mainland, by those who are not good in English and live in a totally different background, mainly wade through the lines and dialogues by Chinese captions (unfortunately, most likely it's translated by some idiots from hong kong, full of stupid mistakes, like translate "massage" as "message", or "straight" (sex) as "something not bent", probably make Chinese who totally depend on the caption be confused with American humor). what i want to emphasize is, even if with so many obstacles, it makes Chinese laugh! my favorite is chandler, i wonder how can he figure out those witty jokes always immediately, you know, those are not meaningless trashes but always to the point and avoid awkward or stressful atmospheres. CHANDLER IS THE KEY OF THIS COMEDY. other four people except monica perform very well too. my only disappointment is monica, she's old and appearencely not suitable for playing ross's once fat younger sister and chandler's wife (the two actors are respectively two and three of her junior). more importantly, i don't think her performance is funny at all, especially when she was teased in restaurant kitchen by hostile kitchen staff, and she toasted at her parents' anniversary, i felt sorry for her but not funny. her action is formulaized: yell at people while twist her body and arms, staring with blank eyes, that can fit any lines, or maybe none. like joey's Australian girlfriend in one episode said: she's loud for such a small person, and i think she's annoying too.
1.0~the worst show i have ever seen concrete_door Sign in Permalink okay i do not know were to start on this ever so dreadfully painful experience that is called friends. this is one reason we need ugly people on TV cause all you horny freaks cant get enough of Jenifer. the humor is so bad you cant help but change the station and that god awful theme song at the beginning for me thats were the show ends. all the characters do is sit around on a couch or diner and yap saying things that are not funny nor entertaining at all why is this show loved so goddamn much i don't know watch a good humorous show like Dave chapel he will make you laugh not this garbage want a real sitcom there family guy and family ties not this trash!
8.0~A fairy tale sitcom Emraan07 Sign in Permalink This is a show which is created to attract teenage group especially girls. A show which revolves around six people who lives in New York. They come from different settings but somehow they connect with each other and lives a happy life.. the end. Sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it? Well, the show has good moments, witty jokes and sometimes does deliver wonderful situations of mishap created by guest actors. This show which was created in the 90's have certainly gained a lot of popularity even in the 2010's modern era, all thanks to the blissful internet and it's piracy and free streaming services provided by lots of websites. More than fifty percent adolescent people has spent their time watching this show and they wants to relate to it. I won't deny the fact that I've some best times watching this show in my time and I did wanted to relate to even though it's not relatable most of the time. If you want to have an amazing time depending on who you are and what period of life you're living, this show might be the next thing you want to watch.
10.0~Definitely one of the best shows on television! Becki8 Sign in Permalink 'Friends' is unmistakably one of the best shows on television. Set in the Village area of New York, it is about 6 30-something Friends, their problems and how they deal with them. It has some of the best writers available and it has been one of the funniest shows in the last ten years! I started watching this show since about 1998-99, and have been a vivid fan ever since! I don't fail to watch the new episodes every week and rarely miss the repeats in between! But, like all good things, the show is ending, with this next series being it's last. My rating: 10/10.
9.0~Amazing TV show. Continuous with laughter. PadraigWalshFilm Sign in Permalink Friends was a massive TV show back in the late 90's and early 00's and is still regarded to this date as being one of the best TV shows ever created. It follows 6 friends and their lives living in Manhattan. I'm young. And so, this show isn't so big anymore. But I still managed to watch every episode of every season and I must admit - I love it. The characters are great and are well acted by each. The story lines are very good and the jokes are hilarious. I think the mid-seasons are the best, as they give Ross more funny episodes and the laugh track is used less. If I have one complaint it's this - The laugh track is used a bit too often. - A lot of the jokes are funny but not every little thing they say. However, they stopped using it so much as the seasons went on. Each episode is interesting and they created characters we all love and are somewhat different. It is continuous with the laughter and I haven't seen a bad episode.
10.0~As a 2019 viewer! u-24093 Sign in Permalink I unsurprisingly admit that this is yet the greatest show ever and the greatest 6 cast member of all time and not to forget Gunther :). The 6-stars has it all. I still wish that there will be a movie as a sequel for the show !. Heartbroken 💔
10.0~Amazing!! squirtsquirt7 Sign in Permalink I am 17 years old. I started watching this with my mom when I was six, before I even understood it. I just watched it to spend time with her. As the years went on i understood it more and loved it more. I watched the last three seasons on prime-time and was so sad when it ended. Around 2002, I got my best friend into the show and we watched them in order on DVD from season one, all the way to season 10. Let me just say, this show never got old, the story's were great, the show was hilarious, the cast worked so great off each other, the acting was outstanding, and the ending was perfect!!!!! The was amazing from beginning to end and I still own all 10 seasons and watch them all the time. I was sad for Matt Leblanc to see "Joey" not work out but it never could have been as great as Friends was!!!!
10.0~A Masterpiece cuttingedge-90596 Sign in Permalink That's the best show ever. The comedy, drama, plot, characters and setting all of them were the form of that masterpiece. I'm in love with it, and I don't think that I'm gonna watch any other serie. Love you guys.
10.0~Its actually the best comedy show ever created project_greenmoney Sign in Permalink I have seen many many 20 + great comedy shows but this show is the best..no comedy show is greater than this..if u r missing it then u r missing out on a real deal This show will make u laugh on every sec of it.. Chandler is just just too much for a any 1..just listen close to his comments and u will witness the greatest sarcastic comedian Joe will be the second best in the show but all 6 of them will make it awesome.. I just wish this show never ended.. I have seen many comedy shows..two n a half men, how i met Ur mother, big bag theory, and the list goes on and on..but friends is the best every created..its a 10 out of 10 Really
10.0~A series No one will EVER forget patricia_abiog Sign in Permalink If you want a show that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you, because it IS filled with romance,drama and comedy that is why wherever I go I will NEVER forget that show,those characters and those series. I am unlikely to give good reviews but F.R.I.E.N.D.S really captured my heart! This show is the BEST show that I EVER watched because: 1.It makes me laugh. 2.Whenever I am lonely I watch the show so that I will be happy again. 3.The actors and actresses portray their characters very well. 4.The stories are unique. 5.The script IS Amazing! So now that I gave you the reasons why I love it... I now recommend you to watch It!
10.0~Best television comedy series to date televisionseriesreviews Sign in Permalink This is one of those very few television series where 99% of it's audience could watch it over and over again and still laugh. Why? because it's brilliant. Everyone seems to find "FRIENDS" very entertaining, and I believe it really boils down to the excellent writing. Yes the cast is brilliant and you do grow to love them all, but the writers deserve most of the credit when it comes to this show's immense success worldwide. The interesting diversity of characters, (Rachel played by Jennifer Aniston, Monica played by Courteney Cox, Phoebe played by Lisa Kudrow, Joey played by Matt LeBlanc, Chandler played by Matthew Perry and Ross played by David Schwimmer) in this show also makes it possible for an audience to identify with, and rather difficult to have a favorite. I love this show and it's no surprise that it aired for 10 consecutive years, won a Golden Globe, 62 other awards and had 174 nominations. Well done to David Crane and Marta Kauffman.
9.0~Addictively funny comedy that lives on PeterMitchell-506-564364 Sign in Permalink I thought Seinfeld was the funniest show I'd ever seen. I'd become a Friend's fan in 2011, and I didn't care if they repeated the show 90 minutes later on another channel. I'd watch it again, and crack up, at almost the level as to the first watch. They had a Friendathon on, one night, and I promised myself one more show, and I'd retire, but I'd say that after the next, then the next... The scripting is great as are the marvelous actors, some of whom' didn't really go onto do much, but a couple of movies. What, are the casting people over in L.A? Morons. I'd love for any of these actors to be in films I director. My favorite two, are of course Chandler and Joey. I can't understand how Matt Le Blanc, the best performer, hasn't done that much. I saw him in one lousy film, he was also very good in, Reform School Girls with Aimee Graham, where he played alongside her more famous sis, Heather, in Lost In Space. Kudrow is also great as the eccentric Phoebe, bringing a real human and wonderful character to the role. There's a great consistency comedy like in Two And A Half Men. You'd really wanna be around these six people, share their heartbreaks, disappointments, achievements, shocks, but sadly they're not part of our reality.
1.0~Friends Is Like a Fresh Breath of Carbon Monoxide jerrywarriner Sign in Permalink After force-feeding myself a half-dozen episodes of "Friends," I was reminded of H.L. Mencken's observation that "No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public." This is one of the most contrived shows ever produced. I have to assume that the people who find this series so riveting only do so to live vicariously through the lives of the characters. Either that or they are immature yuppie wannabees whose sensibilities have been compromised by gamma rays. The effusiveness of most of the positive reviews made me want to throw up. Friends" reeks of nauseating sexual innuendos that are spat out like projectiles from a tennis ball machine. When it comes to dealing with sex, "Cheers", Frasier" and "Seinfeld" were far more clever, witty and intelligent. "Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David wanted his show's humor to be based largely on real experiences. The show broke one barrier after another and either originated or popularized numerous expressions. "Seinfeld's" sexual humor was clever and original; on "Friends" it was on the same level as smut. On "Cheers," Ted Danson as babe hound Sam Malone was far more endearing than any of the male characters on "Friends." The show never ran out of hilarious one-liners, which was quite a feat considering that the show didn't often venture outside the confines of a bar. "Frasier" was both cerebral and jocular (how many TV shows make references to the Algonquin Round Table?) Kelsey Grammar's Frasier Crane was sidesplitting as he pursued one failed relationship after another, but he never descended to the low-level sexual innuendos that were characteristic of "Friends." Unlike evergreens such as the "Dick Van Dyke Show," 20 years from now "Friends" will have been consigned to the dustbin of forgotten TV shows alongside "Meet Millie" and "Hey, Jeannie." We'll see.
10.0~"F.R.I.E.N.D.S." Best Show I ever watched ashwin-jiwane Sign in Permalink Let me tell you my experience about the show. I come from a small town in India.I never knew about "F.R.I.E.N.D.S.".I joined my college in 2005 and my friends recommended me to watch "F.R.I.E.N.D.S." in DEC 2006, from that time I am just watching it, watching it and just watching it.... From December 2006, I have watched all the entire 10 episodes 5 times and my 6th run is on 2nd season.I got everything about friends.Their 10 seasons, all their interviews,fonts,pics,gag reels,phoebe's songs,title videos etc.. I watched That 70s show, sex and city, how i met your mother, coupling, Seinfeld etc.. all sitcoms, but nothing was so compared to F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Each episode of friends makes you feel like a heaven.And want you to feel .."ohh!! thats true.. , we should enjoy our life in that way, dealing with all our complications in life."Thats how friends live, thats how friends are.. As the F.R.I.E.N.D.S. season goes on .. its get better and better.The chemistry between those six people is so perfect that the same "Joey's funny stupidity ,Monica's self obsessiveness,Ross facial expressions,Chandler's sarcasm,Phoebe's craziness,Rachels's sweetness " makes you laugh in each and every episode. Surely its the best ever made TV series.
1.0~One of the worst shows I've ever seen Hackazit-1 Sign in Permalink What to say about this show. Must be made for the brain dead out there. 5th grade humor at best. You can watch tune Disney or Nick for equal humor, but that is geared towards kids so understandable. Surly anyone with any brains can't find this show enjoyable. At work people watch it in the lunch room. I can guess the punch line while the sentence is still being uttered, and know it is going to be stupid. I have had to either 1) not go in the lunch room or 2) Get the remote and refuse to tune in "friends". It has created enemies but I don't care, at least I still have my sanity. The laugh track is even turned way up in volume.
9.0~Friends Television Show vacationer071982 Sign in Permalink I've seen this TV series and it is by far one of the best shows I've seen In my life. In my perspective Lisa Kudrow playing Pheobe Buffay did a great job I think she played her character great and funny. Then Jenifer Aniston is most known for her character Rachel Green on this series. Courteney Cox playing Monica Geller a funny, previously fat, and obsessive cleaning woman where everything has to be in place making it hilarious. Now the men, first David Shwimmer playing the brother of Monica as Ross. His character was a type of dinosaur "geek" and not to good with most of the ladies. Matt LeBlanc playing Joey Tribbiani an actor on a soap opera but not too bright. And last Matthew Perry, playing Chandler Bing he played a funny kind of man with a cross dressing father so he had quite a feminine side to his character, but was a bit too over dramatic when it came to acting. None the less this was a great romantic comedy television show.
4.0~i like watching it but its overrated boybrat29 Sign in Permalink being born in 1992,i remembered watching friends with my aunt,sister and mother when i was young I'm in my twenties now, i saw the show was on comedy central and added it to my recordings and within a few weeks i have a collection hundreds of episodes to watch. i watch a couple of episodes everyday and average of one/two laughs every episode (provided by Chandler/Ross/Phoebe) (joey really made me laugh at the "thursday third day" line). i won't bad mouth this show because it is a decent show to watch but as a comedy, the hype and excitement around it is exaggerated. maybe as a guy it doesn't really excite me that much (so much to say the best show ever) most of the story lines are about relationships and happy endings.. its like an escapism. i like the cast, i like the show but it just doesn't have that gutso i would rate it 7 out of 10 but simply because of its over hyped I'm going to give it a 4.
10.0~awesome mind blowing fantastic outstanding superb excellent...what more i can say gopalchatterjee7 Sign in Permalink i am speechless about this show its just an example of perfection by Kaufman and the splendid comic timing,flow of emotion,anger,laugh was simply outstanding .I have an ultimate collection of this grand show with all the ten seasons plus 3000wallpapers and clips.I give this show simply 10/10 cause there is no limit behind that.The comic timing of all the characters was superb Rachel,Ross, their chemistry was amazing and Monica and Chandler their comic synchronization was fluent and orgasmic and phoebe was the best in her confused and mixed expression role and last but not the least Joey the perfect manipulator of most inconvenient circumstances.Over all everything was so perfect that there is no chance of imperfection. I give it a perfect 10/10 from my side.
2.0~Remove the Blinkers. chumpsteak Sign in Permalink We were force fed 238 episodes. Like Foie Gras Ducks, people scurried up to their TV sets for years to get tube-fed this insipid mush. I appealed to their better nature but was shouted down & will probably get many 'unhelpful comment' clicks here on IMDb. Please try to clear your minds of all the hype & the awards this won & watch an episode from a fresh point of view. It's not funny apart from 1 maybe 2 laughs per episode, provided by Matt Perry. It has dated very badly too. All this mid 90s PC nannying makes me sick. Anyone who happens to drink alcohol is portrayed as an alcoholic. Anyone who smokes has to quit etc. "I'll be there for you", let's all be supportive, let's talk over our insignificant, Middle Class issues in a Coffee Shop. NO! Go down the pub & have a laugh. If I want a comforting, self-help video I'll go & buy one. Wake up everybody. 'Friends' isn't funny, never was. It's like a cheap, fatty Burger. It seems good but deep down you know it's got no substance & is actually killing you from the inside.
10.0~Best ever sofiuddin Sign in Permalink Friends is life. Life without friends means nothing. 236 episode. It seems huge time loss, but when you started watching you will not regret your decision.... The TV series ever made in HISTORY... Miss you 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'.
10.0~Friends Forever 1fabflikfan Sign in Permalink Hey all you flik fans, Friends, already in their 8th season, has been a great success, and i agree it will stay that way for a long time. Chandler, the funny but very romantic guy, Ross, the shy dork science guy, Joey, the just plain stupid but super funny and excellent (who can't love Joey) guy, Monica, the neat-freak down-to-earth-y girl, Rachel, the hot and crazy, but also smart girl, and (last but definitely not least) Pheobe, the clueless, ditzy, (smelly cat... lol)guitar playing dumb blonde. And, All together, these 6 "friends" make up the funniest TV series ever! I just hope they stay together..... :-( We love you guys! Keep on Rockin!
10.0~the greatest sitcom ever made Jamie_Seaton Sign in Permalink i love this show with all my heart. i think i first started watching this show when season three was first showing on TV. that would of made me about ten years old, i was hooked. fifteen years later and the show has been finished for a while now and i'm still hooked. its literally a laugh a minute show that never got boring even for ten years. my favourite seasons has to be the mid seasons (four, five, six and seven) thats when the show was really at its peak i love every character in this show. the guys are funnier than the girls but they all do a fantastic job. Ross is so funny as the nerd who has been divorced so many times that hes finding it hard to get new relationships. his nerdy acting in this really makes me laugh. Chandler is the joke master but has so many insecurities, hes a gem. Joey is the dumbest character in any programme but is a girl magnet and is probably the funniest in the show. Monica is Ross's sister who has too many problems such as her cleaning habits. Rachel is also a brilliant character and always adds something brilliant to each episode. last but not least there's Pheobe who is a weird street smart psycho in my eyes. her stories of her past makes me laugh so much. what makes this show so amazing it the situations these characters get in to through the ten years the programme went on for this is a show i watch all the time.... i also love Simpson's the same as this but this show will never die in my eyes. once i get through all ten seasons like I've done so many times i just watch it all over again ha ha ha, its true. i think everyone must of seen this show. its on TV all the time but if you are living under a rock and haven't then i advise you to watch this classic. its probably the best comedy on television........... 10/10.........j.d Seaton
10.0~Best thing on television EVER abhishekaw Sign in Permalink Why can't I give ratings more than 10. Why God why? Could this show be any better? No matter how many times you watch this show it is hilarious every single time. Bestest show ever. No show can ever substitute Friends. This show will remain one of the greatest creations of mankind.
10.0~It's the best show I have ever seen! farismahmood-16130 Sign in Permalink Friends is such a good show that I have watched the show a thousand times. Too the acting, plot, jokes, etc it was really good. The characters were amazing and well written, all the characters had different humorous traits are were amazing, all the actors did an amazing job. How can a show be so addicting? Right now after writing this review of Friends, I want to watch the show and guess what I will watch it.
10.0~I'll be there for you...in the true sense srishti-sinha Sign in Permalink I am quoting some body but I totally agree with this - "If I get a wish from a genie someday, I would ask him to erase my memory, so that I can watch Friends again afresh and relish those priceless moments...." To say that F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a good situation comedy would be a gross understatement of monumental proportions. When you watch friends, you just don't watch it, you live it. It is not about how perfect you have to make your life.. it is about how every moment , good or bad , together makes life perfect. No matter what kind of person you are, you can always relate to its story line. Unlike most of the contemporary serials, this one does not have a narrow perspective. There are no fart jokes, no clichés, no stereotypical bullshit - just original day-to-day incidents and the fun and laughter and quarrels associated with it. There are no jokes for joking sake. And it would blow your mind to think how anyone can create six characters like Chandler Bing, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Phoebe Buffay, Rachel Green and Ross Geller. Hands down - "best thing ever and not just on TV"
10.0~Friendship reinvented, personified, illuminated and showcased with such beauty. patelbinny-62778 Sign in Permalink Personally i don't think 6 characters in any other show could connect to the mainstream audience as well as friends has done. Sadly i wasn't a fan when the show was actually aired prime time, but once i got the hang of it, how well has it served me with immense emotion, humor and the moral sense of living on your own terms , independent on anyone or anything. It's influence on the India urban youth is downright grand, as everyone slips in Chandler's one liners or Joeys' 'How ya doin?' or Monica's unnecessary extravagant attraction to hygiene. It has so many run of emotions and having said that, it can still be watched exclusively for its humor. I can easily entitle this as one of the funniest shows on planet earth. I remember watching it in my college days on the bed since my parent slept in the hall and even if I watched it with my headphones my laughter would screw up my parents sleep. There are so many layers to every character. There's Rachel who is a poster child glamour doll who wants to make a mark on her own and be self-sustained so starts working as a waitress. There's Monica who is a cleanliness fanatic and also a Chef by profession. There is the latter's older brother Ross who has Phd and is a paleontologist having his own dinosaur fantasies. There's Joey who is the cool and funny guy of the lot who is really popular among the girls and also a professional actor who isn't really doing well. There's sweet and very unorthodox Phoebe who likes to sing pretty offbeat songs with her guitar and is a masseuse by profession. And finally my personal favorite Chandler who throws in cringy remarks in conversations that have so much subtle sarcasm and wit and his partnership with Joey brings up some of the best bachelor Comedy there is to offer on the silver screen. On a serious note the important content displayed is that the lives of these individuals are far from perfect. In fact there are run of events that are outright sad and depressing, but eventually someone is always there for someone else and they hold on to each other in tough times.It's one show that will resonate through your life in various forms and the echoes will last your lifetime.
10.0~This is my best Friends Rybergare Sign in Permalink I will start to say that this is my favorite show ever, ever, ever and ever. Its not just the funniest comedy-show, its the best of all TV programs thats on TV. Its hilarious but so much more than that to. The humor is just incredible and i love almost every joke thats ever been told in the series. All of the characters and I really mean ALL of them are funny, everyone in there own wonderful way. Of course I have some that I like more but even that is really hard to choose. Because if you have gotten to a point where you think: "Well he is really my favorite", and then if you think of some other character again, you will have to change your mind. Because it doesn't matter how you think, every character will still be as funny as the others. And as I said before, Friends is not just about comedy, its so much more. The way the characters say there lines, their style, the atmosphere and joy makes this show to more than just an ordinary sitcom. I don't even think about it as a show, because the characters are so alive, you are watching a bunch of wonderful people live through 10 years of their lives. You really care about them and feel sorry if something bad happens or really feel the great, funny atmosphere around them when their having fun. The actors are just great to. The producers could not have picked better actors. I must say that this show is just perfect, for you who have not watched, do that. Because if you are a sitcom fan, or a drama fan or just likes a little comedy ones in a while(who does not) you are going to love this. I give Friends 10/10. If you wanna find any better show, start to search now because its going to take you forever.
10.0~Hilarious - one of the greatest comedy series of all time grantss Sign in Permalink Hilarious - one of the greatest comedy series of all time. The lives of six twenty- (later, thirty-) something friends living in Manhattan. Their relationships, work, troubles and triumphs, all told with biting wit. Very funny and, as someone who was in my twenties when the show started, incredibly relatable. Sure, it does present a stylized and almost idealistic picture of being a young, single adult, but that's part of its charm. Casting is largely spot-on and launched the careers of all six of its stars. Some of the guest stars were pretty incredible too...
10.0~masterpiece sitcom chaitankrish Sign in Permalink I'm reviewing so late because the friends is still popular even after 20 years I think it's an truly masterpiece show like no other and even my future kids will love this show if I show them because FRIENDS is as it's a reflection of our lives- a story of 6 20-somethings trying to find their way in the world, just like we are, and of finally making it. Their happy ending is the best happy ending anyone could ever ask for. The show may have ended, but the legacy will always remain. And that makes every FRIENDS fan ecstatic.
10.0~Best TV show ever anirudhkoppula Sign in Permalink I always thought TV Soaps or Shows are jus mere crappy and filled with all unnecessary drama only to blow your mind off(i mean giv u migranes). FRIENDS is one show wit awesome written characters(Writers/Producers take a bow) and absolute comic in every situation, let it be Embarrassing situations, Funny situations, Emotional sequences...i mean you just work hard all day get bugged of all nonsense stuff going on around us n come back home to switch on the TV u just need something exactly like FRIENDS just to take you to some new world where its just Fun, Laughter and Fun again with everything they do. Its a CULT show that can never be remade into anything(Movie, Book or Cartoon). I just admire one character little above all "Chandler Bing"!!!
10.0~The Best wbstsw Sign in Permalink Friends is my favourite sitcom, and being a Brit I do actually prefer American comedy to British. I'll be sad to see it go, its been a great 10 years, maybe a once a generation adventure perhaps, but I'll always watch the DVD's, and pass them along to family and friends for them to enjoy as I am currently doing. Long live friends and good luck for the future.
1.0~The last couple seasons are horrible dlh-48964 Sign in Permalink Season 8-10 are horrible!!!!! Monica & chanler are always talking about "making a baby" that becomes the only topic they talk about forever & rachel & ross are now consumed with their baby. It feels like joey & Phoebe are the only interesting characters that have a storyline that's different every episode. Monica also becomes really rude & controlling towards the way she treats her husband basically making chanler feel a toy. I loved her character up until this point because now she treats her husband in such a disgusting way. Its really insulting
10.0~There's not an episode you won't love! patrickmcculloch_rhcp Sign in Permalink Friends has been my favourite show for years. I grew up watching this show, and now grown up, I still watch and laugh the same way as I did back then. I've come to really love the writers and especially the cast. Rachel, the glamorous, stubborn, hilarious one. Phoebe, the silly, corky, hilarious one. Monica, the perfectionist, loving, hilarious one. Ross, the smart, geeky, hilarious one. Chandler, the joking, self-cautious, hilarious one. And Joey, the Italian, lady's man, hilarious one. As you can obviously tell, I've said that everyone is hilarious, which is true. These six characters are what make this show so funny, and make me laugh every time I watch it. Especially Phoebe. I feel like every comedy should have a Phoebe. I've gone through many memories with this show. I take this show everywhere I go whenever I travel. I even keep it playing on my TV while I sleep. It's just a very comfortable, familiar show which I enjoy watching a lot. I mean, I watch this show A LOT. I've watched it so much, that I know what every episode is about. Whenever it's on TV, I know which episode it is, and I say what the title is and what season it's from. It's a great show to pass the time, and you'll never get bored of it. It brings laughs, tears, and sometimes both at the same time. I'm definitely never going to stop watching this show, no matter how many times I've watched all 10 seasons. I advise this to everyone out there. This is a must see show! If God had created a show for everyone to enjoy and love, it would be something similar to Friends.
10.0~My best comedy series abothamer Sign in Permalink I love it . All the guys and girls are very funny and awesome . My favorite character is Joey . In fact, I wish I didn't finish watching the series. I hope there are more episodes of the series. With my regards: Nawaf Alotibi
10.0~Once in a lifetime phenomenon sridhar-e Sign in Permalink FRIENDS is an out and out awesome sitcom. You just cannot stop laughing..It has got everything.the sweet romantic moments, the adorable tiffs, the inarticulate desperation and of course the mind blowing and hilariously funny jokes. Chandler is the guy whom i love the most in the show. He is simply outstanding in his one liners and the sarcasm..Joey just cracks me up. He's like the cool guy with whom everybody loves to hang out with. Even though you know that Rachel is supposed to be with Ross but when Joey falls in love with Rachel, you just cannot stop rooting for joey to be with her. That was really a heartbreaking episode. The episode where chandler proposes, the one where Rachel and Ross get together for the first time, the one where U2 song was played, were all extremely special episodes. It just broke my heart when the show ended and i cant describe how much i wish that the show would start again. Its my stress buster..everyday after a long,hard and tiring day at work i come back home and watch an episode of FRIENDS and it all goes away. I just love FRIENDS and its cast..Each and every episode is a magnum opus. I wish that they could come together one more time and even if they not they have managed to create something out of the ordinary which will remain etched in the viewers hearts for generations to come.
10.0~Good series mirbtch Sign in Permalink Binged watched this, I think almost every episode made me laugh, got the series
10.0~very good giannis_pasoles Sign in Permalink Should be more episodes,not enough! I think they should go on like joey did so after a year of being at deferent places they would understand that they should be together and keep going with more adventures and wild situations. I know is hard to do this after 10 years, but if you consider that there are people like me that are watching the show for the third or fourth time you can be sure of the success. Ask for ideas from the fans of the series by mail, and make a summary in order to help you up with the creation of the story,that would help a bit although i am sure that you don't need it as you have done an excellent job,but i am sure it could be a motivation to be occupied with for the fans of FRIENDS. john
10.0~A show way ahead of its time. jcwwe-83548 Sign in Permalink Hooked to it now. Such a great show. The characters are so relatable.
10.0~Mesmerizing hamzakhan-63447 Sign in Permalink You just can't get enough of this show once you have watched the complete series. You will just keep on going back to it.
10.0~i will always be there for my F*R*I*E*N*D*S!! Chandlergellar Sign in Permalink Friends is hands down the best sitcom of all time, the main reasons are the chemistry on screen and that they are best friends off screen, which is rare because in most sitcoms, the actors hate each other because one gets overshadowed and has less publicity! even tho friends is like that because of Jennifer Aniston overshadowing Courtney and Lisa, they still stick by each other! lets explore the main characters: Rachel Green: played by Jennifer Aniston, when we first saw her back in 1994 she was spoilt and was daddy's little girl, but as time went she became independent and into her own after the "We were on a break" and when she married Ross and Vegas, we saw that she was over Ross and stood up and said "we can't stay Married", she is telling him that its over, this is the main highlight, Rachel standing up for herself. season.since she had her baby thats when we see the true Rachel Green for the first time. Plus shes HOOOTTT!!!!! rating 8/10 Monica Gellar: played by Courtney Cox- Monica is the bitchiest out of all three girls because she gets very competitive and never lets anyone win, especially chandler since they got married, she isn't my favourite character but she does have her moments i.e as fat Monica. rating 7/10 Phoebe Buffay- Played by Lisa Kudrow, Phoebe is the funniest female character hands down, her songs, her wit and her blondness makes her such a brilliant creation to watch, i couldn't imagine anyone playing her, also her twin sister is funny because you can see that they don't get along and after the "Buffay the Vampire layer" porn movie incident where Ursula used Phoebes name, you can see why Phoebe hates her.also Lisa portrays Phoebes troubled life with a smile and i think that is what makes Lisa such a great actress. rating 10/10. Joey Tribbiani: played by Matt Leblanc. Joey is a great character but he is not my favourite because after a while, Joey became a tiresome character and all the other Friends all got married had kids etc but he didn't seem to fit in anymore, i mostly admired the Joey and Chandler relationship, which got built up over the years which is great, they have more chemistry on screen than Chandler has with Monica, because i think that they were closer than he was with Monica. i don't think that his Sitcom will ever be as successful because they main characters bore me, and there is no chemistry on screen.8/10 Chandler Bing: played by Matthew Perry, Chandler the best he really is, my favourite Character because he is always making fun of how slow and dumb Joey is, i grew bored of him when he married Monica because he lost his Witt, Monica kept on being serious all the time and thats when Chandler became serious and thats why i grew bored! but he is still the best! he still does have is moments but Monica took that away and made him more mature which was a big mistake for Chandler Fans.rating 10/10 Ross Gellar: played by David Schimmer. Ross, when Friends started he wasn't the best Character because he was quite boring, but as seasons went on Davids acting and comic timing improved and thats when he became really funny! i liked it when he screamed "WE WERE ON A BREAK" after this he became funny, and as his relationship with Rachel ended, thats when he challenged Matthew Perry as the funniest Friend. I'm glad that He and Rachel got back together and i would have liked this as a sitcom than 'JOEY'. 10/10 Friends will always be the best and even tho some episodes are bad and some are excellent, you cant take the chemistry and great acting away from this great sitcom, the best seasons are 3,4,5,6,7 and 10! also I'm looking forward to the movie that has just been announced! Friends R.I.P 1994-2004
10.0~Best show ever imran-haddad Sign in Permalink If i could put stars more than 10 i will put as much i can. Friends show is best thing on TV.
10.0~One of the best TV series of all time krissi_bart Sign in Permalink Friends is a American television series that started way back in the early 90's and is about six friends named Rachel Green , Monica Geller , Phoebe Buffay , Joey Tribbiani , Chandler Bing and last but not least Ross Geller,they live in new york. Ross Geller and Rachel Green are the main Characters sort of. Rachel Green- the Sweet, hot female of the Group female(second least favorite) Monica Geller- "Mom" of the group(my least favorite) Phoebe Buffay- the unpredictable weird hippie type(fourth best Character) Joey Tribbaini- unbelievable Stupid, the Homer of friends (second best Character) Chandler Bing - the sarcastic loser who always making jokes(my Favorite just little little better then Joey) Ross Geller- a nerd who seems always getting him into some kind of mess(my third Favorite) Friends ran for 10 years and ended in 2004 sadly, but many people still watch it including me, I personally have watched friends nearly six times and have recommend it to many of people I know all of them have watched to the end and loved it. I Only discover friends 3 years ago(2009), i was not born in 1994,1995 but Friends still Managed to get my attention 15 years after is premiere I recommend Friends to everybody, i gets a 10/10!
10.0~Review on Friends mitchharwood Sign in Permalink Friends, in my opinion is the best television show ever and i was devastated when it ended after the tenth series. All of the actors portray unique and incredibly funny characters, and manage to keep the atmosphere and character relation throughout the whole ten years. A review that i just read on the main page of Friends claims that their favorite are in this order: Chandler(Perry), Ross(schwimmer), Phoebe(Kudrow), Monica(Cox-Arquette), Rachel(Aniston) and lastly Joey(LeBlanc). This could not be more off. My favorite characters in order from worst to best: Ross: The only character that i HATE. He has very little funny lines and does not bring the atmosphere to the show that the other characters/actors do. He is geeky and annoying and takes ten minutes to get out one sentence. Also, the fact that the character(nothing to do with the actor at all) always tries to get Rachel, and cheats on her, and wants her again, and then marries another woman, and then wants her again etc. I find Ross to be a pointless and pathetic character, probably only added into the show to have an even mix of Male/Female characters. Phoebe: Even though Phoebe is my fifth favorite, she is a very good character. Phoebe is the ditzy one that believes in Fate and spirits. Phoebe is very strange, and while seemingly innocent, can be very dirty at times. She delivers many funny moments and adds to the show. Joey: Joey is an Italian from Queens who is an actor, though usually out of work or in dead end plays. Joey's incredible stupidity also adds to the show. He is also the ladies man and tough guy of the show, his lack of intimate feelings being the focus of many of the plot points about Joey. Chandler: Chandler is also a great character. All of his one liners make up the best part of the show, but he just gets a tiny bit annoying. Chandler's parents divorced before he was 12, which gave him some psychological problems. Luckily for viewers, these problems bring humour. Chandler is a great character who is acted well by MAtthew Perry. Monica: Monica is the skinny, competitive, prissy and perfect one. Monica is a chef and she strives for excellence in everything and will never give up a fight. Even though she wins at virtually everything, her parents have always favoured Ross over her, which also adds humour. Rachel: Rachel is my favorite character in the show, simply because she is the uptown spoiled one. When Rachel first moves to Manhattan after running out on her wedding, she still uses her parents credit cards and has never had a job. She is witty and funny and brings A lot to the show. The only drawback of RAchel is that she falls in love with disgusting Ross, which is a real shame. With the exception of Ross, Friends is easily the BEST, FUNNIEST television show ever, and i give it 10/10.
10.0~Best show I 've ever watched garouft Sign in Permalink I discovered Friends while I was studying in UK. And I fell in love with the show. All the episodes were excellent. Hilarious, smart, the script was very well balanced. The characters were well defined and there is a central idea in the show: the life of 20something in the 90s. Their struggle to find jobs, their personal lives and their constant fun. I can not choose my favorite character. It was one of the shows I loved them all. I suppose it had to do with the fact that they were having a good time behind the scenes as well. I think one of the reasons it was such a success, it was that it reminded us the importance of friendship, of being with people you love and they ll accept you for what you are. I miss them a lot.
10.0~Very High on my all time favotire shows list nickyankees Sign in Permalink There is nothing more that needs to be said this show has EVERYTHING!!! I can watch this show and I have watched this show 5 times through and through from the first episode to the very last one. Humor romance drama real life moments the cast works so well together and I love this show everything about it!!!
10.0~Friends are just Fantastic chris26r Sign in Permalink This show of 6 friends is one way to represent the greatness in friendship and love. Definitely one of the best sitcoms there will be in TV, and not because of the laughs but because of the connection of actors. The way the actors connect in a scene is so positive and cool that makes the scene go smooth. This is definitely one show you could watch with anyone: your family, your gf/bf, and definitely with your friends. Every single detail in the show is so interesting like for example the development of characters. The characters Rachel Green / Jennifer Aniston Ross Gellar / David Schwimmer Chandler Bing / Matthew Perry Phoebe Buffay / Lisa Kudrow Monica Gellar / Courteney Cox Joey Tribbiani / Matt LeBlanc THese 6 actors are one of the most hilarious group of actors I've seen in TV and they can prove it by showing u one of their Friends Episodes. Not only funny but attractive actors. This kind of thing doesn't happen everyday, and thats why i think friends is a great show to watch
10.0~The lives, loves, and laughs of six young friends living in Manhattan. k-dhesi Sign in Permalink Will there ever be a show so funny? A show that everyone talks about, a show that makes your day a whole lot better, a show that everyone can laugh out loud no matter how many times they watch it, a show that everyone still watches even today, over and over and over again. And a show, a show that has rules comedy for over 16 years! I'll answer that. No way in hell. Okay I'm sure you heard of Friends, everyone has. If you watch it then you'll know what i'm talking about. Its absolutely hilarious, you could watch many shows but nothing would make you laugh harder. The only flaw of this series is that it finished in 2004! Ross, Rachael, Joey, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe. The gang. As the series developed you begin to fall in love with the characters, there just so amazingly likable. Although it's just a series, i think what people like the most about friends is the realism of it, 6 "average-classed" friends living in Manhattan, yet you'll get sucked into there lives, i seriously doubt there's even one episode that wouldn't make you smile, cry or roll-on-floor-laughing! It would be impossible for me to pick a favourite episode, there just all so good. If you are the strange one who hasn't seen friends and like comedy, then you haven't seen nothing yet! I cannot recommend this enough, oh how it kept me laughing through my teen years, all i know is that i would never stop watching it. You have to experience the laughs, love and chandlers sarcasm! Everyone see's friends as the show that never gets old, that's so true, you could watch the same episode a million times and still laugh like you watched it the first time. Among everything else friends is actually educational, believe me? It teaches so many life lessons but in a unique, stupid and absolutely hilarious way. I hope my kids when they reach there teenage years can experience something so funny as friends. Oh how we just all love the gang. All i can say is. If you haven't watched friends, your missing out on a whole lot of fun. If you used to watch friends, then you know how i feel about the show and if you still do watch friends, you, are the man! Or women! Best comedy show ever made hands down. "Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault!"- Phoebe Buffay "How you doin'"- Joey Tribbiani "Stop staring at my wife's legs...no, no, stop staring at your sisters legs!"- Chandler Bing "What is wrong with these pants!" - Ross Geller "I don't care if the entire cast Eight is Enough comes out of there"- Monica Geller "Oh my God. I've become my father. I've been trying so hard not to become my mother, I didn't see this coming."- Rachel Green
9.0~I'll be there for you! Jerique Sign in Permalink It's a timeless television series that will be memorable for a long time. It's not just the catchphrases, it's not just the well-known actors/actresses that lead this fun sitcom but there's characters to relate to, there's jokes to be heard and ultimately there is friendship which we all crave and need. The show revolves about Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) trying to be with the woman he's loved since the ninth grade -- Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston). Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) are great for their one-liners and providing the 'friends' vibe throughout the entire run. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) will provide you with some random comedy, throwing you off track almost every time she utters something. Monica (Courteney Cox), Ross' sister, is an obsessive controlling neat freak who glues all six of them together. As time grows on, the friendships between the six strengthen and the comedy increases. For a total of ten years, you'll learn and become friends with fictional people and hope that someday, somewhere, these people exist. Fans of Friends, like me, will most likely talk on the message boards, know the detailed trivia of each of the characters and sometimes live in their own world with their "Friends". It's not a show for children, as some of the jokes in the later seasons because sexual and/or adult themed. However, I grew up watching Friends, from the age of barely six till sixteen. I wasn't a normal kid. When my friends were watching Barney, I was watching Seinfeld or Friends. I love Friends and I think it's one of the best sitcoms of all-time. It incorporates so many elements that we all possess in some way. Each character has something and is missing something that the other characters help with. Ross is quirky, but he's shy, but Rachel helps with that. Joey is a womanizer, but lacks intelligence but is helped thanks to Ross. Every person who has watched Friends can walk away telling their own friends which character they are most similar to. It's filled with episodes that will make you laugh, warm your heart and some that will make you cry -- happy and sad -- tears. There's nothing to hate about Friends. A great treat for viewers is the long list of elegant A-list cameos/guest stars over the ten years that the series ran for. I thank Marta Kaufman and David Crane for their efforts and creative vision to create such a wonderful show.
10.0~One of those shows that you can watch twenty times and still laugh. reeb-myoo Sign in Permalink I've seen each of the episodes of Friends roughly ten times, more or less. And, no matter how many times I see it, I laugh like the first time I saw it. The characters are likable (sometimes with the exception of Monica, but I think that was partly deliberate), their relationships are sweet and realistic (barring some unlikely pairings) and the plots are funny and adorable. If I had one complaint about Friends, it would be that the last two seasons were a little old and the plots seems slightly aged, but even then, they make you laugh out loud non-stop. Their are criticisms of the show, a common one being that it would be impossible for the friends to live in amazing penthouse apartments such as numbers 19 and 20. But, if they actually watched what they were complaining about, they will know that Mon's apartment was actually her Grandma's and that, as Chandler said "it was a frigging steal!" So I would recommend actually watching the material before they complained so much. Chandler Muriel Bing. He stole the show for me. Every line was delivered with wit and precision (the timing of the delivery of his lines was what I would call perfection). Everything that Perry said was witty, funny and charming. Every single character was portrayed as a real person (possibly with the exception of Phoebe, who was seen as a little outer-worldly!), with a big heart, and an even bigger personality. It's impossible not to love them. Whoever describes Friends as base humour, or 'yuppie' comedy, they need to take it less seriously. Friends was never created to be the thinking man's comedy. It's a lighthearted, fun show for all ages. It does exactly what it says on the can. It gives you six friends, who you grow to live, laugh and love with.
10.0~probably the best thing that has ever happened to me stkabirdin-67153 Sign in Permalink The characters grow on you,and you would feel they are your personal and close friends too as they go through their daily lives as friends together. I would say one of the best creations by men, and I don't feel exaggerating as this is what everyone who have watched Friends would say. Matt Le Blanc did his best acting till date . David Schwimmer's expressions were good . Matthew Perry's sarcastic comments . Jennifer Aniston's expressions and of course her looks!! Lisa Kudrow's expression were the best and she was somewhat funny !! Courtney cox was great and how the writers started Matthew Perry's and Courtney cox's love story was very interesting !! and of course Matt Le Blanc's expressions and his way of flirting !!
2.0~Went on for too long Gemmm-1 Sign in Permalink I used to love this show when I was a kid, and I would watch every episode religiously and discuss it the next day with me mates in school, I even asked for a box set for Christmas so I could watch my fave episodes more. Then I never really botherd after the Ross and Emily wedding. After that it just got boring and seemed to drag on and on. For about a year after that wedding all it seemed to be was Monica and Chandler trying to hide that they were together, and after that Rachel and Ross deciding if they loved each other. Even now it has ended, it's still shown all the time on e4 and my mum puts it on, so I've seen every episode hundreds of times. I really think that this show was dragged on for far too long. It should've ended a couple of series before it did.
10.0~The best show ever made paulo_vic13 Sign in Permalink I've watched the whole 10 seasons for like 10/11 times! It's a show about Friends, it's a show about life and it's a show about love! And it's pure comedy, seeing that even when you watch episodes over and over you still laugh like it's the first time seeing it! Friends is a show that changed my life, and i think everyone that watched it just hopes: "I want to have Friends like that, Friends for life that i can count on everything" I remember being 15 and planning with my friends on moving to USA, probably New York and live like them, because that's the best thing we could (and can) think of! It's a perfect life, without being TOO perfect (well, they have their problems :P)! Of course, me and most of those Friends grew apart, and that's why i still watch Friends as it is the only real thing i have to rely on REAL friendship! It's a show that inpires me and a show that everyone should watch! Excellent, very well made and GENIUS!
10.0~My Best Friends on TV snehalmasne Sign in Permalink Friends has to be one of the best sitcoms ever made, i just love it! I own them all in a box set and i just have to put one on and im instantly uplifted. Its so funny, the script is just amazing and all the actors play their characters so well, you really believe that it is true life and you really feel for the characters and the situations they all go through. From watching the show from the start to the end i really feel like i have grown up with them and gone through their journeys with them. Its just the best show and i love Chandler so much, he is just so funny and witty, they are all amazing in their own light. Well done for making one of the best things on t.v, i don't know what i would have done without growing up watching it. 10 out of 10.
10.0~Sweet Comedy. cottandy Sign in Permalink If you like comedy, you will like "Friends". As simple as that. Some peaple say it's overrated, but you shouldn't say about anything until you watch it by yourself.
10.0~The BEST comedy serie ever pejman_nazarbakhtiari Sign in Permalink I've been watching Friends for 2 years now and i rewatched it about 30 times. It doesn't get old.
10.0~T.H.A.N.K.S faisalmadrid-18543 Sign in Permalink No words can describe how thankful I'm , Friends really helped me to get over a lot of tough time. Could it BE any more beautiful?
10.0~Maybe the funniest show ever... kwa1063 Sign in Permalink First of all, to all the people who say it isn't realistic, IT'S A TV SHOW! Did you think "Seinfeld" (which I also loved) was in any way realistic? Please. By the way, Monica inherited the apt. from her grandmother, that's how they can afford it. You'd know that if you watched it regularly. She told Joey that on the flashback episode when they first met and he took his clothes off while Monica was making lemonade. I don't understand how anyone could not think this is funny. The British person who said the London episode wasn't funny--are you daft? That was the funniest one ever! It is the most consistently enjoyable show I have ever seen, and believe me, I've watched a lot of tv. All the actors are excellent and it is a true ensemble show--they're all equally important to the show. Even Ross and Monica, who both get on my nerves at times. It is a crime that no one has yet been recognized at Emmy time except Lisa Kudrow. She is wonderful but the others richly deserve some recognition also. I for one will be very distressed when "Friends" goes off the air.
10.0~Friends forever.. gabeartwork Sign in Permalink Life is not beautiful. Life is not perfect. But whenever I was watching friends, life felt good. The characters were so believable and lovable that you can't help but live the moments the actors were portraying for us. A feel good show which had its ups and down but everything was worth watching. All the lead characters have performed so well that it is not surprising at all that many fans still refer to all of them as Ross, Chandler , Monica, Joey, Phoebe and Rachel.. Among the talented lot.. 'Dr.' Ross Geller played by David Schwimmer is my favorite.. He is hilarious with the act of nerd who ends up in embarrassing situations many a time.. Chandler played by Matthew Perry is my close second favorite with his witty sarcastic jokes. Joey is also excellent with his dumb yet charming character. Phoebe with her eccentricity is hilarious. Monica is a control freak who hates to lose. And last but not least is Rachel is by far the most famous among the cast adds glamour to the friends cast. To the team of friends..thanks for all the wonderful memories.. Friends forever.
10.0~Finished a while ago... yet still so popular!! BritishRainDrop Sign in Permalink I don't think Friends will ever fizz out. It is great!!! Each episode guarantees you laughs and enjoyment and each episode is also very well written out and acted. Even the arguments can be hilarious!! Each character has their own individual history, and gradually, the viewer finds out about these, which I think is great. The see-saw with Ross and Rachel was great, especially when they got back together in the end. If it did go on for another series or two, I would have liked to see Joey and Phoebe together! They suit each other, after all, he did propose to her! The last series was cleverly ended too. It is a show that I think will stay in everyones DVD collection for years to come.
10.0~I'll be there for you cause you'll there for me too j-41284 Sign in Permalink OH MY GOD in Jennis tone, I can't believe the show ended a decade ago but still a masterpiece! I feel growing and living with them while watching this show. I hope the series just on their break.
10.0~Phenomenal thenerdofsuperstuff Sign in Permalink It is hands down the best sitcom ever made. It shows that the 90s-00s era will be the best era for comedies. There are a few great comedies nowadays but nothing will compare to this one. The characters had great chemistry together. I probably watch at least one episode a day. The reason a reunion wouldn't work is because of how great the show was and it would be ruined.
10.0~the most lovable show ever.. rhea-02042 Sign in Permalink FRIENDS is the best sitcom ever made. It is one of the things which made my growing up years special. This is the first TV show I watched and absolutely loved. It taught us friendship, love and loyalty. It has the most adorable characters and one can never get tired of watching reruns. FRIENDS is just pure joy which leaves inside you a warm fuzzy feeling, lifting your spirits and instantly brightening your mood. It is the only show which can make you laugh, cry, fall in love even after all these years. It inspires. The dialogues make me laugh and cry even though I have already watched and heard them countless times. It is timeless. It still feels so difficult to watch the last episode because you do not want it to end. I love this show and I am so sure I will love it even 30years from now. The most beautiful, funny and inspiring show ever. I just wish there were more seasons, though they ended the show as beautifully as possible, I loved the show too much to see it ending. FRIENDS always. :)
10.0~My favorite TV show hiphopseoul Sign in Permalink It's incredible how "Friends" got better and better for 10 straight years. I admit I was sad when it finally came to an end, but it was a very well and respected end. The actors/actresses were able to bring their characters to life so well, I was able to feel their emotions, hilarious situations, and most importantly, their friendship. It's no wonder why this is my personal favorite show. I've had people ask "Who's your favorite character?" I was never able to answer that question and I probably never will be able to. Each character had their own unique personality that you can't help but love. Joey's "How you doin'?" Chandler's "Oh my God!" Monica's "OCD like" behavior, Ross and his divorces, Phoebe's naive nature, and Rachel's impeccable sense of fashion. It doesn't get better than this. I hope you all enjoy "Friends" as much as I did.
10.0~Friends saved my life!!! numberfranfan Sign in Permalink I love Friends!When I was younger,I would have never watched it.I saw Courteney Cox on Scream and wanted to see her in something else,so my friend Courtney said she was in Friends,and so my obssesion with Friends begins.I think Friends was well written and brilliantly casted.Could you see anyone else playing our beloved Friends?Well,I love it and if you need a good laugh,try you'll love it.You should also watch it if you want to see you favorite actor or actress.They have everyone from Julia Roberts to George Clooney to David Arquette.Well,I hope you take my advice and try the show.If you don't like nonstop laughter it's not for you.Well,that's all I can say.BYE!!
10.0~F. R. I. E. N. D. S - best show made on ' friends' meghagargmg-02284 Sign in Permalink This show is amazing, no other sitcom is even comparable to this one. All characters - joey, phoebe, rachel, chandler, monica and ross are seriously my best friends thanks to this amazing show. All comic timings and scenes are superb, acting is awsome and emotional scenes are so good that i always get tears in my eyes. This is an amazing experience, more than just a show and people who don't like this seriously have no sense of humor.
10.0~FRIENDS Changed My Life.Legend And The Best Forever. cemakca Sign in Permalink First of all,FRIENDS changed my life for real.I remember when I first watched Friends I was a little kid.And for more than half of my life , I am watching Friends.Why is Friends the best? FRIENDS is the best because it is not just about 6 character's story and life.Its about life and you feel as though you have 6 close friends.When I watch FRIENDS,I feel like I have 6 best friends and I am the one sitting in Central Perk,in apartment and everywhere.I feel like I have 6 friends,it is not just a show.With the brilliant comedy,incredible storyline,awesome jokes and with the lovely characters this is a legend.From Joey's dumbness to Ross's dinosaur obsession,to Rachel's loves and adopting the new life,Monica's cleaning obsession,Phoebe's weirdness,and Chandler's stupid and timeless jokes, this is the best.With all the special characteristic that each character has,and with the great storyline and jokes,this is just untrue... I used to watch Friends when I got sad,bored or anytime that I needed to be happy and smile.I will never get bored of it and the more I watch the more I love and laugh.I will never forget how happy Friends made me when I needed to be happy or how it stopped me from feeling so lonely. When I finished the show,I felt so dull and alone ,like my friends left me.But and then I watch another 10 seasons from the beginning and I am still watching over and over again... If you want to have the 6 greatest best friends in the world,If you want to watch the funniest and the best comedy show of all times,If you want to laugh so hard and get emotional sometimes,If you want to witness the greatest thing ever made on American TV; FRIENDS IS YOUR FRIEND. LEGEND AND THE BEST FOREVER!
9.0~The more I watched, the more I had to watch. saimsadeek Sign in Permalink Quite simply one of the best shows ever made. It starts just like any other show and with time, it drives you in, and before you know it it's a major part of your life. Every scene, every punchline, every little expression makes you fall in love with it. I think the level it has achieved over the years and how successful it has been, still don't do the show justice. It's an amazing ride which epitomizes the highs and lows of life. Every human feeling is beautifully portrayed in the show. I was particularly impressed by the story as a whole. Like there are shows which hit their highs and then can't figure out where to go with it, believe me there's nothing like that in here. All in all a very well thought out, hilarious sitcom.
10.0~This is the best sitcom ever and we all know it ! Green_Lump Sign in Permalink now, this just goes to the benefit of my fellows, the ones that i probably share more memories with than any other F.R.I.E.N.D in my life. i know that i can watch them day and night and never get full. starting with Ross, my favorite; I don't understand why he is so underrated ? it just pisses me off? we get it, chandler's the funny head, and Joey's the stupid one, but don't you think Ross delivers much better as he is the science head of the show and scientists aren't funny which gives him the hardest part ? I absolutely love Ross;3 ,, then to Chandler; man, this guy, sometimes he's even #1 for me, especially at the "being the best that Monica's ever had" he nailed it 100% XD , his sarcasm isn't boring, i would love to have a person like that in my life ;D Phoebe; we all know that the men are funnier than the women on this show, but Phoebe is a great comedian which puts her right next to the men at this, and she sometimes beats the hell out of them, her screams, her innocence, she is with no doubt the funniest out of the three girls. Joey; you're never gonna have enough of Tribbiani ;D , he absolutely has the best facial expressions EVER! and he eats a lot which kinda relates him to me :3 , Rachel & Monica: can't decide which one's my least favorite, these two being at the bottom doesn't underestimate them, I mean the show is absolutely something with them! but they're funny at the lines they're given and they add just a little to the show on their own, Monica's obsession is awesome, and Aniston's an excellent actress, I really don't know why does she stick for cheap roles nowadays, she certainly can do much better.
1.0~Not impressed killalextone Sign in Permalink Basic jokes/plot. Not a fan. I dont get the whole sitting around the coffee shop talking about absolutely nothing. Disgusted
10.0~A really great TV series. mado_kong Sign in Permalink I have seen this TV series for several times. It is a really good sitcom. It brings me a lot of happiness. The series is just normal people's life, but it shows us the happy part of life. It affected me and even changed some of my view on life. Anyway, it is good and give me a lot of happiness. Thanks for the team of Friends. I like Chandler for the most. He always has jokes. And the next one is Monica, she is manipulating, but it make the comedy be more like our normal life. And Rachel, she is beautiful. I like also her movies although they are not that as good as Friends. And Joey, he seems to be not smart, and that brings a lot jokes. Ross is fine, his English is good and his love for Rachel gives us the feeling life is good although the end of the series makes us sad to some extent. I don't like Phoebe for I think she is not that friendly to China. China is not as what she thought. She shall come to China, know China and then give her comments.
10.0~The best sit-com ever casealessandro Sign in Permalink When i discovered "Friends" I didn't realize that I had just discovered one of the best sit-com series ever produced. The cast is incredible: Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Shwimmer made me spend memorable moments. Their bond on the set was amazing, so much that you can often become part of their family. It's incredible how starting from the simple idea of friendship the authors and the cast have created a cultural phenomenon, a new style of comedy. I have a lot of fantastic things to say about Friends but I think that are all well-known. So if you haven't seen Friends yet, get you're remote and find a channel that broadcasts the show. You won't regret it!
10.0~For every occasion emafrajlic Sign in Permalink This fun humoristic show I can watch when i'm happy or sad, when I wanna cry or laugh. Highly recommend watching this show.
10.0~The best TV show ever! Foobarman Sign in Permalink 10/10 - perfect rating. Friends is not only my favorite Sitcom, but my favorite television show ever. Not only is it funny, it is very interesting to watch. From season one to season ten the jokes and funny moments just keep coming. Other great sitcoms like Two and a Half Men and Will and Grace still aren't as good as Friends. One of my favorite parts is where Rachel brings Gladys (a scary painting) into Joey's room and scares the hell out of him. Then after calling him a baby she walks out of the room and sees Glennis (another scary painting) held up by Monica and screams. Another great part is where Ross and Ben prank Rachel by throwing a dummy that looks just like Ross down the stairs and gives Rachel a heart attack (not literally). The funny moments like these just keep coming throughout the series and keeps you laughing like hell. I recommend this show to anyone who loves a great laugh.
10.0~Greatest sitcom ever ramialzanati Sign in Permalink Never gets old never boring, it is simply the best comedy show in the history . Perfection like Chandler like chandler Said. I recommend it to every one . Note: if you don't watch it you're missing a lot.
10.0~Best show ever. slipknot_maggot41 Sign in Permalink It's full of comedy, drama, and everything else you can ask for in a sitcom. By far one of my most favorite shows. I can watch it over and over again. I don't think it can ever be replaced.
10.0~The best tv show ever. aliahmd-84926 Sign in Permalink I don't really get enough of these episodes no matter how much i watch them. It is really the best show I've ever seen. And still, I'm watching friends whenever i have the chance.
10.0~One of the best series sanahinen Sign in Permalink It is well known that this series can make anyone laugh at any given moment in a person's life at any episode. I admit, before watching friends I thought it was over rated, but the minute I started watching I got attached to the characters and to their lives. It doesn't only change your mood and make you laugh, but also engage in their lives from their most embarrassing moments and funniest to the most heart breaking one which some of us can relate to, you almost feel like you're friends with them. This series will surely increase your dopamine level.
1.0~It's always sunny, for people who can't face the real world vanienfowler Sign in Permalink Grow up . Adults ain't this nice or friendly to each other ever .
7.0~Average but occasionally charming. Pierre_D Sign in Permalink Friends was never anything extraordinary. Seinfeld did friendships better and The Jeffersons, Good Times and Newhart did 'residence comedy' better. Despite that, it did have its charms. Lisa Kudrow added some heart to the show and the on and off relationships were realistic, if not endearing at times. Where the series kinda falls apart for me is the guys generally seem like lunkheads most of the time while the girls come out shining like daisies. While this also reflects some life situations, balance is good too. Friends was good, it was trendy but ultimately it lacked the character and depth to keep me hooked.
10.0~Ross and Rachel's Love story of how they loved each other and fought.That "we were on break" dialog and Joey's "How you doin?" is something everyone should watch. amannigoti Sign in Permalink Epic TV series...Can Watch it uncountable times and still Laugh like it was 1st time.One of the best sitcom of all time. Acting of Joey,Phoebe and Chandler is Something that can make many fans as one watch it.Every Episode of this series is perfect.Worth giving 20 min for this comedy. #hugefanoffreinds
9.0~This is not just a show kunalrohit-23360 Sign in Permalink After watching every episode of this much-appreciated-and-loved-by-all sitcom, I'd have to say that this is not just a show. All six characters brings the humor, love, drama which makes viewers to like them even more. Here's my view on each of the six characters- Chandler Bing: Star player of the show. If nothing/no one can make you laugh, he will. His sarcastic dialogues make you love him more. Ross Geller: A geek, who easily gets dates more often Joey Tribbiani: He's character is dumb but still makes you giggle. He's the adorably stupid on the show. Phobe Buffay: A weirdo, but cares a lot her friends, give them best possible advice and laugh at them on every occassion. Monica Geller: I don't get her character so won't say anything. Rachel Green: Worst character on the show.
10.0~Gorgeous malakeissa-20834 Sign in Permalink It's really one of the kind! Everytime I feel sad or depressed I just watch it and I got that great high mood again I like it too much .
9.0~Timeless and a true classic rohinigottipati Sign in Permalink I can never get enough of it. It's so hilarious even if you're watching it for the 1st time or re-watching the 25th time or on repeat mode, the hundredth time. The spontaneity is gold. The characters are so nuanced. Mylove for every other TV show faded away and this one is an exception.
7.0~10/10 lukerose02 Sign in Permalink Friends is the best sitcom of all time and maybe one of the best shows of all time, the writing and jokes are timeless and just phenomenal. All the characters have unique personalities and their own catchphrases, my favourite ones are Ross's like "WE WERE ON A BREAK" or "MY SANDWICH". Chandler and Ross are my favourite characters and my least favourite character is Phoebe, mainly because she has way too many relationships that don't end very well and after a while you just stop caring. Another negative thing I have to say is that by season 6 or 7 you can definitely tell that they're running out of ideas and that the show is getting a little stale. A few examples are the many flashback episodes that occur in the later seasons and dozens and dozens of pointless relationships the characters have which barely last 2 episodes. But the quality does get higher again for the last few seasons. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the series and it's hilarious characters.
10.0~This Is It MovieRaterX Sign in Permalink For many years I have watched shows where producers try to make a show last a long time, and give people what they are looking for. Many fail and very few succeed such as Scrubs and Two and a Half Men. This shows are all good. But there is no show ever created that can sum up to what 'Friends' was. It was the best series I ever watched in my life. Luckily I have the whole set so I can watch over. I have seen every single episode about 10 times....(True Fact) and yet I can watch them again. I Guess the show appeals to the emotions and maybe something that you have experienced with your life that attracts you to the storyline. I still don't know 1 person who dose not like these series. Now there is some hype going around as to a movie being made. Im not too sure whats going on, but if a movie was made, I'd be the first one to see it. All episodes are unique in their own way, and all have a well executed beginning, middle, end, complication and resolution. I felt that I had to write this comment as a tribute to these actors, writers and the series they have managed to make. It truly was an excellent experience, and made a big impact on the way I think about some stuff. I know that may sound extreme but I loved that show, and others who do, would also feel the same way. All I can say is thanks, and a job very well done. Just perfect. A masterpiece show, which will never die in my memories.
10.0~I love it! ellenrhannibal Sign in Permalink I love it and I have sene it 3 times! This is the Best show and I have watched a lot. 12 out of 10 love it! And it is fun and nice.

10.0~Best Series chinki-86743 Sign in Permalink I didn't watch Friends until two years ago (thanks to MY friends). Its damn funny and no one can deny it.Ross and Rachel are made for each other that was a true love now they are getting old, How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. One of the best t.v. shows ever! Everybody is so Good and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally. However, I do have my favorite characters, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.
10.0~American Dream alirezahgs Sign in Permalink this show makes me laugh, cry and feel love. this show is about my dream, our dream. and i want to spent my whole damn life to watch this show over and over again. watch this show to it became a part of you're life. it will became a part of you're family. friends is not about friends, its about everything and when you done this series yo feel a hole in you're life.
10.0~my first English TV show,LOVE forever Qian1010 Sign in Permalink These 6 fellows accompanied my 20s. This serie not only helped me study English also made me understand the culture differences,and fell deeply in love with it. I watched 10 times of this tv show, and preparing to learn another language still with this show😄. Whenever you feel stressed, watch Friends, your friends always there...even imaginary friends
10.0~The very best. keepstreetlynne Sign in Permalink I don't like situation comedies, but I adore Friends. When forced to watch situation comedies, I never laugh... When watching friends, I'm Laughing constantly. I just love Friends. Lynne
1.0~Yawn tkownacki Sign in Permalink By far one of the most overrated sitcoms in the history of television! I've even tried watching it now that I'm older Beyond my 30 something's and it is still boring boring boring!
5.0~Friends is mediocre - Coupling is far better DavidYZ Sign in Permalink I don't know why millions of people say that this is the best sitcom ever. I've repeatedly tried to get into it, but just can't. I only laugh slightly a couple of times per episode. The main six characters are a bunch of ordinary narcissists (with the possible exception of Phoebe). How is the audience supposed to like them or care about them? It's ridiculously unbelievable that Ross (a funny-looking, old- acting geek with an annoying voice) gets several hot girls. Many fans have said of Friends that all young adults are similar to one of the main characters. I've never been similar to any of them - nor are any of the people whom I personally know. I don't understand Rachel having been revered and admired as a sex symbol. She isn't glamorous, doesn't have a seductive voice or sexy personality and isn't particularly good-looking. I've seen many sitcoms which are much better than Friends, including Coupling (the original UK series, not the dreadful US remake). Coupling is a much funnier, sexier and more intelligent version of Friends. Coupling is better-written, better-acted and has much stronger and diverse characters. Friends is a mediocre sitcom full of ordinary people who are rarely entertaining. I guess that all of the people who dislike my review haven't seen any episodes of Coupling.
10.0~I definitely love the TV series. what about you? t-75109 Sign in Permalink This is I watch one of best sitcoms since I've seen ever. It made me burst out laughing when I watched. So my mom burst into door when I laughed,and said " calm down! calm down! okay. taking your neighobor into account." funny,I would alway miss an unreasonable old man in the show. In the cafe, in the kitchen,in the livingroom... ... this is life, definitely. Us lives sometimes are difficult or complicated, but everything will be ok, you will make a lot of money finally, you will have a girl you love her and she want you finally, you will have some so good brothers finally. l meet my life in the sitcom and it make me feeled life, make me loved life again.
6.0~The good, the bad and the always beautiful kclambeth Sign in Permalink I started watching friends as a teenager and i thoroughly enjoyed it. However, my opinion changed as i grew older. Friends is entertaining when you're bored and need a quick fix of comedy, one liner after one liner and the funny Chandler Bing (by far the best character) but the adolescent ways of the show made it hard to bare as i got older. Suddenly 20 and 30 something's were still acting like teenagers (when we'd all grown up)and everything was so superficial, always about dating, hair and this 'perfect' group friendship that rarely exists in real life. The character Phoebe is unfunny and it's annoying that we have to suffer such dumb characters over and over again. Ross was a well drawn character, Joey wasn't and Monica and Rachel were OK but shout and squeal just a little too much. After about series five or six, i stopped watching as plots involving Monica baking cakes got tedious and the on/off relationship between Ross and Rachel grew extremely boring. Watch this if you like a quick laugh but go for the early 'good' series, when the characters had not all slept with each other yet.

10.0~Friends is probably the best sitcom ever made! valentino-rossi_1987 Sign in Permalink Some consider that Seinfeld or Married with Children are the best sitcoms ever, but I think Friends is much better. It has something the other two don't have: romance. The jokes Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler and Joey make are very funny and just can't have enough of them. I started watching Friends since the middle of the 6th season, but I was too young and I couldn't understand every aspect of the show, also having missed the first half. But then I got the first seasons and I watched all the episodes and then it all started to make sense to me. Ross and Rachel's relationship is the main idea of the show, but along the way they started to pair them up: Monica and Chandler, Rachel and Joey for a short period of time and of course Phoebe and Mike. The show presents the life of six young friends that live in New York, their relationships with each-other and with others, their jobs, etc. Ross is a paleontologist, divorced from a lesbian that carried his child, the romantic of the group. He had a crush on Rachel since high-school and they started going out in the second season. Rachel is a spoiled, cute girl that moved to NY to start a new life and meet her soul-mate, which turns out to be Ross. Monica is a chef at a local restaurant, Ross' sister and Chandler's wife in the last seasons. She is obsessed by having things clean and she likes to boss people around. Phoebe is a weird, but cool girl that used to be Monica's room-mate before Rachel moved to NY. Chandler uses humor as a way to push people away, like a defense mechanism. He and Ross used to be room-mates in college. Joey, Chandler's room-mate, is a funny Italian actor that came from a big family. He is the macho of the group with a lot of success at women, but also a very caring person. When I think of Friends I think of: "Heey, how you doin'?", "WE WERE ON A BREAK!", Ross always getting divorced, Phoebe's triplets, Chandler's jokes and Joey who is a littler slower than the rest of them. I remember a joke with Ross and Joey that I really like. Joey goes like this: "Hey Ross, I've got a science question! If the homo-sapience were in fact HOMO-sapience... is that why they're extinct?" Ross says: "Joey, homo-sapience are people." and then Joey says this killer line: "Hey, I'm not judging!". Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Courtney Cox are perfect for their parts, it's like the director chose the actors first and then made-up the characters that suited them better. I've seen all the episodes and I just can't have enough of them; Friends is a great show and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh!
10.0~Friends what else can i say ! Salimov27 Sign in Permalink I know that i have waited so many years after i decide finally to watch it .. guys really for all who see this review .. this show with every single episode touch my soul ... i felt with every moment of it ...

10.0~Masterpiece laura160200 Sign in Permalink I didn't watch Friends when I was growing up but due to its huge popularity I obviously had to check it out. I do not regret this one single bit. The show had me drawn in since its first scene and that feeling didn't leave until the very last. With a great sense of humor and a great overall atmosphere you can't help but fall in love with the show. The best thing though in my opinion is the characters. Those 6 friends will make you fall in love with their really great and individual personalities. Whenever I'm bored or sick I watch this show, it's one of the only ones I can watch countless times without getting sick of it. The show is a masterpiece deserving of its popularity.
10.0~Simply perfect...! nithinmmukundan Sign in Permalink I have given perfect ratings for some movies and shows but nothing is as perfect as this show. I don't think there will ever be another show that could make you laugh so much. The amazing thing is that it doesn't switch off its funny touch in any episode. Yes, all the 236 episodes are simply breathtaking that I have made it a routine to watch it every day and you know what, it still makes me feel happy. The acting is amazing, the characters are so lovable and the plot is perfect. The character development is subtle and slick that you never feel the change in the tone of the series as the characters and plot age and evolve. One of he biggest achievement of the series is being hilarious with minimal (if at all any) profanity. A perfect series that everyone should watch in their lifetime. Each episode will make you laugh and feel good.
1.0~Brings crap to a whole new level. flackjacket Sign in Permalink This show lasted 10 years? I didn't actually watch it until it was in reruns. And even then, it took me a few times to get past the opening theme song without vomiting, which is a flat out rip off of Black Sabbath's "After Forever". Surprised there wasn't a law suit over it. First I'll start with the one positive and the only positive I can find, is that Jennifer Aniston is good looking and has nice hair. Other than that, there's nothing else positive I can say about this show. The three main male characters are carbon copies of each other. It's often difficult to distinguish them from each other except for how they comb their hair. There's the guy who combs his hair forward, the guy who's exactly the same but combs his hair side ways and the other guy who combs his hair sideways with oil and spikes it a little. This show is not only painfully boring, it's completely annoying. From the opening theme to the duplicate male characters and the poorly written scripts, it's a steaming pile of garbage. The fact it lasted for 10 years is a testament to the American public's poor taste and stupidity.
1.0~Just unbelievably unfunny crap. This awful show is a slap in the face for everyone who likes good comedy ,a show for idiots ONLY Zaphod2000 Sign in Permalink Well...I don't get it. How could this TV show become such an overrated hype?...it's because people are just as stupid as this show is. The whole thing about the show is just ridiculous and it simply fails in every simple category -the writing is pretty bad (kind of dumb punchlines along with some unfunny sarcasm for every joke...) ,terrible characters recycling every other sitcom's characters and bad plots (uninspired and unoriginal in everything...) ,not mentioning the terrible direction and awful cast which is unconvincing and unfunny at all. And besides -it's not even funny at all ,it's even impossible to crack a smile out of it...it's pure garbage ,a comedy without a comedy and a comedy without any humor at all... In conclusion- lame excuse for a sitcom: uninspired bad plots with unfunny terrible writing...pure garbage.
10.0~Astonishing ninjaduck72 Sign in Permalink An amazing sitcom people are saying that Seinfeld is better but in my opinion, Seinfeld has nothing on Friends. Friends is hilarious, Joey the Dumb and Gullible one. Chandler: The sarcastic one. Monica: The control freak. Rachel: The dramatic one Ross: The clever one. Phoebe: Bubbly and Tough. The biggest dramatic relationship is between Ross & Rachel. They have had many of fights, a point where you have to pick which team you're on team Ross or team Rachel. Makes you have to think about what you want to do about it, you feel connected to the characters and the show ran for a good ten years. I felt as if a piece of me died inside when I saw the last ever episode for the first time. It was heartbreaking that's how much you connect with the characters. All in all filled the whole circle.

10.0~from Greece with love kpant2002 Sign in Permalink Me , like many other people from all around the world , have watched every episode of friends again and again. This TV show has made me laugh over and over again, it has made me love all the 6 characters and their lives and has put me into their reality. I am a little bit more sensitive about Ross's and Rachel's love affair and the episodes where the two of them where ''not in a break'' were my sweetest. I am really sad it ended ,although I watch the repeats every week on TV and I would love to see the 6 of them again to an episode which would show them meet again just for one time.. maybe the producers should think about it!! So, from Greek fellows all my love to everyone Kelly
1.0~What is wrong with you people? breenj2 Sign in Permalink This show is awful. I don't understand what is wrong with everybody. The only reasonable conclusion that I can come to is that there was some sort of mass hypnosis, whereby everyone was convinced this show was funny. Friends never took any risks, tried anything new, or even attempted to expand the norm. Every week it was the same plot, with some wacky jokes by Phoebe, some moronic jokes by Joey, some boring jokes by Ross and Rachel, some anal retentive jokes by Monica, and some mildly charming jokes by Chandler. I realize, that this inherently is not a bad thing. Not every show is meant to push the boundaries of television. However, if you're going to rest on your laurels, and bring nothing new to the table, you should at least do a damn good job of it. Rarely was any joke a surprise, or was there ever a truly laugh out loud moment. It was not funny. This show does not deserve an 8.8 average rating.
9.0~Still one of the icons maaiah Sign in Permalink Most Comedy Series I criticized. an excellent TV show. All of the actors are excellent,so many and so failed romantic scenes. love, love,separation, tears of Rachel and Ross, the return of Rachel and Ross,tears of Rachel and Ross, the return of Rachel and Ross. it is clear that most of us get bored from love of Rachel and Ross. * Pheobe Buffey how can a reasonable person to become so crazy? Impossible, Joey foolish, stupid, we find like him but Phoebe she is not stupid, but her scenes very crazy. * Monica Gellar best female character in this series - she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong. * Rachel was not convinced by me, but she has one thing in her..we need for someone like Joey to know what it is . *Chandler in the first 4 seasons, almost before his love to Monica was the best, his passion to her dropped him down in my opinion then joy appears . * Ross - fixed level from start to finish, he is talented . Friends failure to be a Comedy - Romance Series. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgment
10.0~Something in the story is so beautiful. It's way more than funny and entertaining. damajiausa Sign in Permalink I firstly watched this show in almost 10 ago before just the year when it ends. I found it quite entertaining but a little bit dated. You know, especially the oldest seasons. However, in the following years, when I was bored, I picked some episodes time by time. Gradually, I found it's more than funny stuff for me. It may sound weird and too serious, but I really found it's kind of touching and moving. Something in the stories is so beautiful.Don't wanna to, but I have to admit that there were tears sometime. I just love all the characters, all the kindness and positiveness in those stories. It's been 10 years, no matter how familiar with the story, I still enjoy every episode in this show. Sounds a little bit pathetic maybe, but I think I just do and will love this show. Best TV show ever!
2.0~i like, soooooooooo didn't see that joke coming mark_richardson1 Sign in Permalink This show has its moments when it would genuinely be funny; however 99% of the time I just wanted to hack my own arm off just so I can chuck it at them. The jokes are predictable and watching Chandler be sarcastic every 2 seconds gets boring after the 100th time. The situations they get themselves in is completely unrealistic, which is fine so long as the situation is funny; however the situations they get themselves into just makes them all look like a bunch of idiots in a nut house. The characters are even worse than the poor script they work from. It is very clear that David Schwimmer is the only one who has any talent, as the rest of the characters can't act and just look a bit weird, not their appearance, as it's clear that the only reason why the women got the parts is because of their appearance. Also that audience drives me insane, as every time something significant happens they all scream endlessly. FOR GOD'S SAKE, IT'S ONLY A TV SHOW.

10.0~friends...... what more can i say!?! blowzy321 Sign in Permalink Over 230 episodes, of which none were a disappointment, 6 friends, intertwine into one elaborate life, consisting of humour passion and sadness. For the ten year friends aired every episode was as impressive as the next. From 1994 to 2004, the show followed the happenings and changes of contemporary society which allowed the audience to relate to the characters for the full 10 years, which helped expand the shows huge success. Friends is loved by the majority of all the media's target audiences and even now the show is over it is still as popular as ever. The rumours of reunion shows have been said to have only been rumours, but i say bring friends back!!!!
10.0~When Friends Left So Did NBC! ShelbyTMItchell Sign in Permalink When Friends left the 2004 NBC line up it showed that the NBC network really went down hard. Along with Fraiser that left the same year as well. It is about six well friends, as they are living in an apartment complex in NYC. Trying to talk about life, love, and just everyday mundane but it was the chemistry of the six actors that made it all together a huge hit. We would love to have friends like these. And would love to see them on a daily basis. They were single to begin with but then Chandler and Monica got married and had kids in the finale. While Ross and Rachel had their on again, off again growing pains. And the comedic touches of both Joey and Phoebe as wished that they would had gotten together. Show was a golden and staple run for the Peacock Network!
10.0~Again and again reneeboegheim Sign in Permalink I binge-watched this serie recently and I was so sad when it was over, that I started it all over again. I absolutely LOVE this serie. It's easy to watch and you can just sit back and relax.
10.0~the meaning of friendship ca_jcrrpm Sign in Permalink If anyone were to ask me what are the hallmarks of a good friend, I would have only the following answer. He or she must be as cute as Rachel, as homely as Monica, as quirky as Phoebe, as geeky as Ross, as wisecracking as Chandler and as crazy and lovable as Joey. Friends changed my life forever. The title track, "I'll be there for you" says it all, the essence of a true friendship, being there when you're needed the most, caring, when you didn't really have to, being loved and cared for and having someone, who'll give you a true perspective on life, who'll side by you, no matter what. Friends brought light in my life, it taught me truly, how life should be lived. Long live the good old friends!
10.0~The Best TV Show Ever behindhazeleyes Sign in Permalink "Friends" is definitely THE best television show to have ever aired. The twists and turns of these six friends, filled with laughter and romance is incomparable to any other sitcom of its time. Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Phoebe and Chandler - six names that no one will be able to think of the same again since this show. Ross, the dorky guy next door, who you can't just help but want to love. Rachel, the beautiful high school cheerleader with a gorgeous smile and looks to die for. Monica, the uptight beauty that many teenage girls can relate to. Joey, your typical slow, yet gorgeous male friend. Phoebe, the out there friend that you could talk to forever. And Chandler, the funny man who has the the sweetest personality and smile. If you have not seen "Friends," then turn on the television and watch the reruns. One episode will make you fall in love forever. Your life will be changed after watching this show. Your life is incomplete without it.
9.0~One of the finest TV shows from the 90s meganweaver-72582 Sign in Permalink Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends.
10.0~By far the best comedy programme of all time!!! chirag_88 Sign in Permalink Friends is just simply the most hilarious programme ever made. About 6 friends who live in Manhattan. Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Monica and Chandler. My favourite has to be Ross, his facial expressions are immensely funny and his dialogue will have you laughing out of your chair. Joey's funny stupidity makes him one of the most popular characters and Monica's self obsessive and petulant behaviour is realistic and funny. Although it has finished, Friends will be remembered for years and years to come and will be remembered as the most genuine comedic programme!! It is truly a comedic genius of a programme!
10.0~Friends mehrshadghanbari Sign in Permalink Even after 19 years i'm still watchin it and i'll never get bored. When i become angry i'll go and watch some episode, When i'm sad i watch some episode, When i'm happy the same.
8.0~Good Show mattyhavok Sign in Permalink I didnt watch an episode of this until 2012. I've watched the series multiple times since. The cast had great chemistry. Because of that, they really stood out and that took a pretty basic concept for a show and made it shine. I'll admit theres a lot that I disliked about story, but that has more to do with my personal opinion and not something the show did wrong. Was not a fan of the Ross/Rachel relationship. The show suffered throughout. The series finale couldnt have been more obvious, because they had no other choice but to end it the way they did. Despite my opinion on the toxic relationship that was Ross/Rachel, it is a good show.
10.0~Fantastic and funny show to brighten sad days JaneLovesMovies Sign in Permalink This show is the funniest and best sitcom that I have ever seen. The jokes and plots are written perfectly and even in 2015 it doesn't get old and still is as funny as it has always been. The actors were perfectly picked and you get one of each: Ross, the well educated professor and divorce "addict", Rachel, daddy's girl that is not used to work hard for her money, Monica, the super-organized cleaning freak, Chandler, the shy guy that makes jokes when he is uncomfortable, Joey, the handsome actor that already has slept with every hot girl in NY at least once and Phoebe, the weirdo who surprises us with another crazy story from her past in almost every episode. I have to admit that I do not like the show in German, as the synchronization is just the worst and the jokes are not at all funny and are translated totally different than the originals. I have already watched the show in English at young age, so I got used to it quickly.
9.0~One fine show that hasn't aged one bit andrearhodes-13133 Sign in Permalink Who hasn't seen Friends? The show is immensely popular all over the world. Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world.

10.0~a successful mixture of comedy, character, & romance aminifatimaaa Sign in Permalink Friends is not a TV show. It is a phenomenon because it happens once in a lifetime. One of the most endearing, genuine, and funniest sitcoms to ever exist. Never have I had an attachment to a cast of characters before Friends, the characters are addictive and inspiring. Their problems and everyday life are a world away, yet still so universal that their lives succeed in connecting with the utmost sincerity. Friends is a timeless masterpiece.
10.0~The funniest tv show ever moorel-65717 Sign in Permalink This show never gets boring and never lets me down with any of the episodes.
10.0~Friendship, Life, Happiness, Reality, Love and Dream mayaduenas Sign in Permalink This is a show that I will treasure and will certainly pass on to my future children and grandchildren. I laughed, cried, hoped, dreamed and was inspired. Never a dull moment. The script and actors are genius. It's a family. The series is a mixture of sugar and spices of our life. It will make us laugh but then again will not forget to hark you back to reality. Lines were humorously delivered by each actor in their own way and character. Laugh out loud by Joey and Pheobe's out of the blue comments, Monica's obsessive-compulsive/meticulous reactions, Ross' fossil (serious) jokes, Rachel's "combo" lines (who would have thought that she can combine class and comedy) and of course Chandler being "CHANDLER". But in between these moments, the story will make you cry. It has shown how differences between personalities can make a gap between friendships, heartbreaking moments in a relationship and unfulfilled dreams and as well as how to build a bridge between relationship gap, rekindling love and striving harder for your aspirations. It's about friendship thru tough and happy times. It's about giving and receiving hope and sharing dreams.
10.0~best soap opera ever lyquochungthinh Sign in Permalink Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippie chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show.Friends is a fantastic sitcom, probably the best of the 1990's. It is smart, snappy, colorfully and brimming with funny lines and excellent plots. Friends really shines with it's amazing cast. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are the friends you wish were your own. You can empathic with all of them in some way, and still laugh with them every week. It really is fantastic
10.0~The funniest year of my life with F.R.I.E.N.D.S. nikeillusion Sign in Permalink I didn't knew anything about friends,just heard that it's the very funny a lot of times from different peoples so last year i bought the DVD of season one and watched it.I have to say that i liked it than i got other seasons and was hooked to it there were times when i had tears in my eyes and stomach aches because of excessive laughter. I became more curious after every season,i said that if this season was this good than how will the other one be so i bought all the dvds of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. when i was watching season 8 i felt very hard to watch the next episode because of the fear that it will end soon,i didn't wanted it to end ever but i couldn't resist not watching it for too long so after a month i played season 9 and followed by the last season.even though in the end it's not that funny like the earlier seasons but i enjoyed it the same.Today when i was playing the last episode "THE LAST ONE" i nearly had tears in my eyes because it was about to end and i never thought that a funny sitcom would make me cry it is very hard to tell what i feel,i hope that someday they would make season 11 even if they are 60 years old i will love it. i don't know the reason why they stopped at season 10 when they got everything from it (money,fame,fans,success,etc) please make another part of it a movie or anything because i can't get enough of it ever.i have been watching every movie that the 6 Friends (joey,phoebe,rachel,chandler,ross,monica) have acted in but i miss F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Thank you :-the cast and crew of F.R.I.E.N.D.S for giving me the happiest year of my life. THERE IS NOTHING BETTER F.R.I.E.N.D.S. AND AS THEY SAY You can never have enough Friends!
9.0~When you have friends like these ... kosmasp Sign in Permalink ... you don't need any ... other comedy TV Show! ;o) I really enjoyed the show as long as it lasted. Although it all began very badly ... My cousins in Greece asked a few years ago if I watch this show called "Friends". I didn't know it then, so they told me to look out for it. When I got back to Germany, I watched a few episodes on TV. Now the thing in Germany is, they do dub the movies/shows that they show on TV and on most of the cinema screens. And although they do a pretty good job mostly, they totally screwed up Friends. I watched it with the German voices and was appalled. I might have chuckled a few times, but I was mostly irritated. Especially Phoebe (one of the characters in Friends) ... I hated her! Her voice was annoying as hell. I later watched the show in English and was amazed by it's charm, wit and humor. All the characters are well written and they have their flaws and weaknesses. Some people might argue that you can't have this idealistic friendship in New York, some others have said, that there aren't enough black people for New York. But those are minor details that don't detract from the overall good impression the show leaves. The last season isn't as good as the other ones, but then again, ten years is a long running time. If you're interested in a good comedy show, about friendship, respect, loyalty and love, then this is the one to watch!
10.0~Our best Friends . delhidevil-1 Sign in Permalink Brilliant. Taken sitcoms to an all new level. Since it is a Character based programme, a lot depends on the actors themselves and I must say that each actor has done his bit and conducted himself perfectly. They actually make you believe that the characters are real and are your best friends too. They make you feel as if you yourself are a part of the GROUP. I must give it to the screenplay artists and writers too. Though it is a comedy series, it has a bit of everything including emotion, romance, etc. Season 1 was basically about when the audience gets to know as to what and who these friends really are. Rachel is a spoilt girl who belongs to a rich family, trying to make her way into the city. Monica is chef who's trying to make it big time in the city. Phoebe is a mystic, funny girl with not a very pleasant past, finally getting to live a decent life in the heart of new york with a legitimate job. Chandler is a witty and funny person, with a successful job in the city, one he's not very pleased with but one which pays well. Joey on the other hand is struggling actor who is doing what he loves but something with small paychecks. Ross is the most romantic and sensitive out of the guys, but the also the most unsuccessful with his love life, as he just got divorced since his wife turned out to be a lesbian. Though a successful paleontologist, but one who is not entirely happy with his life. The way the writers have carried on these characters into new but still the same type of people is just beautiful. Each season is unique in it's own way, but each season has one thing in Common, that is in each you feel a part of the gang and each season will have you laughing till you drop. Way to Go. TRUE FRIENDS of mine.
10.0~One of the best show ever to hit TV capiyushmahajan Sign in Permalink I don't know which stupid guys are giving this guys 1 star. They obviously either don't have friends or they can't understand what it feels about. This show is all about emotions, humour, romance, drama. There's no other show I love more than FRIENDS. Some people have watched it completely, know about each and every character, knows what they do and then giving it one star. If you don't like the series, don't watch after 2-3 episodes.
10.0~Why friends is loved so much. skystruck Sign in Permalink Why has friends effected so many lives and changed so many people over the course of ten years it ran? Why is it that Everybody no matter race, religion, way of life, however different we may be from each other friends seems to be the thing we can all agree on. Friends is the life that we all want, it is the job that we live, it is the friends that we want and the problems that happen so often, and it is the way friends should be. The show is so catchy and it has so many things in it that we take into our own lives. I mean how many guys after watching friends started to name there furniture, wanted a foosball table as there kitchen table, started to have a bedtime penguin pal, going through phases after breaking up with girlfriends? And Ladies, how many people after watching this started being clean freaks around the house, started to act as weird as phoebe, took shopping to a whole other level? We start looking at chandlers life and realize our parents aren't that bad, we look at Monica and realize well, at least my mother loves me! This show is personal to the creators and to the cast. Props, people names, problems, the casts backgrounds in the show, everything about the show has had a lot of thought thought and life experiences in it and they keep the same show from beginning to end. You can see episode 2 and then episode 9 and it will be as if the same. Technology, events, politics etc... it's all kept even throughout all ten seasons. With over 55 awards and 150 nominations, the cast stuck together from the beginning to the end of the series all starting with $22,000 per episode and all ending earning over a million dollars per episode these 6 cast members and special guests and creators, producers and everybody who made it happen stuck together and made the show a part of there lives, and that is why this show is so great. If you have not had the chance to see it i strongly recommend you do.
10.0~best... show... ever RavagerDX Sign in Permalink This is the best show ever. It's funny, etc. First, I didn't like it, because I never really watched it. But then I watched a few reruns in the evening, and I began to like it. When the show was started from the beginning again, I started following it and since then... I'm addicted to it. Of course I think that some characters from Friends are less funny, or something, but they all make Friends. I hope they will make another 'Friends' with the same cast, and absolutely NOT with other actors in it. Perfect show! You should watch it!
9.0~Enemies jshapppo Sign in Permalink BRAVO!! My whole lifetime I've been searching for a comedy about linguini. And Friends is perfect their pasta making skills are brilliant, however Joey eats all the pasta! And Ross is a deluctant character always showing a brilliant performance equal to his in Band of Brothers. But there is one major plot hole and that is Janet, she is irrefutably the most hated character. However she is the enemies only true friend. Thank you for your celery questions?
10.0~Now We Really Know Who Our Friends Are! arturo_smallcharm Sign in Permalink With an excellent cast of new actors at the beginning as Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, Friends became in a great show from the WB which all revolves around the big troubles of these friends who live in New York. Ross and Monica are brothers, she's a chef and he's a teacher, Joey is an actor or at least he's pretending to be, Phoebe is a masseuse and vegetarian, Rachel worked as a waitress, but now she works at store fashion and Chandler is a manager. This super show was the most important ever, just because it's about the fatherhood, lesbianism, the death, homosexuality such a funny thing. Unfortunately our best show was ended, but now Joey will work in a spin off, good luck!
10.0~The best tv show eveerrr ahmadaltoom-61797 Sign in Permalink Enjoy because it will never happen again , what a actors what a beautiful moments i never had
10.0~Tops the list in my favourite sitcoms kmdfaizal Sign in Permalink We can relate our life to the show in various occasions.Ross and Monica gives us some serious sibling goals..and chandler and joey are friendship goals...if everyone saw life in the way Phoebe saw, it would be a hell lot easier....mondler&roschel😍 😍simply love this show ..
1.0~They're not still making this crap, surely? Gubby-Allen Sign in Permalink It's an abysmal show. I've never ever got the popularity of this, especially outside of America. In each of the last 3 houses I've lived in over the last 10 years at least one person in each house has been an avid 'Friends' fan, so I am fully exposed to it, and have seen many episodes. It's also on tele every day. Where do I start? The title is as good a place as any. I can imagine the producers discussing that: "Right, we've got a comedy about a group of friends, we need a name? How about Friends" If that's the imagination it doesn't leave much hope for the story lines. I know it's a lighthearted sit com but come on? How old are they supposed to be? They were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series 1, here we are ten years later & nothings changed. They're all approaching the big 40! yet they're still living the lives of 18 year olds. And how the hell do they afford those penthouses? They change their jobs like I change my underpants, Monica worked in a kitchen, Joey can't get any acting work. The rent would be thousands. Friends is nothing more than the equally benal & tedious 'Saved by the Bell' but for grown-ups. It's the old flogged-to-death "Three guys, three girls, all stunningly gorgeous, occasionally fancy or sleep with each other & with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group." The only thing funny about about Friends is unintentionally funny. Those parties they occasionally have in their flat (penthouse). The so called guests they invite, who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in & pass themselves off as close companions of the characters, when it's clear to the entire watching world that they've met for the first time at the start of the shot. It's a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem. It's the most unrealistic portrayal of New York in history. No black people, Chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter, even with minor parts. It's New York! One of the most multi cultural cities on the planet. Admittedly there is one funny aspect I have omitted. Chandler. The guy is enormously talented, makes the entire show, and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is. Rachel & Monica are likable characters & not annoying, but nor are they funny. But the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man. Come on? Please. Don't treat the viewer as a two year old. Joey is likable but is given no script to work with. Too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing. Wrong. Trigger is Only Fools & Horses was thick but funny with it, because of the timing. He's comments were made at exactly the right time. Joey's are not, & unfortunately for a good actor & potentially very good character, he comes over more as irritating than anything else. But the real problem with Friends are in Ross & Phoebe. The only applicable description of Ross is that he needs a good kick up the back-side, to put some oomf (?) into the bloke. He's a drip. He just drones on & on in that slow dull manner, series after series. In any real life situation a Ross & a Rachel would just not be a couple. A Rachel & a Brad Pitt would be a couple, somewhat appropriately. But even he can't beat Phoebe for irritation. It's not the actress at all that's the problem, it's 100% the character. I just don't get her. The Floor Manager must hold up the "Laugh Now" board for the audience after every line she says. For the life of me, I just don't know what she says that is funny. And in the equally irritating coffee lounge. (Why are the sofas always empty? Never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move), those scenes where she plays her guitar. I've been to funerals funnier than them. All she does is sing in coherent songs that don't rhyme, or make any sense whatsoever. Anyone could write a sketch like that. I also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door. No-one I know would put up with that, even from their Grandparents. Nor people who say "Hey" instead of Hello, but thats getting as tedious as the show now.
10.0~An evergreen must watch balikartikey Sign in Permalink One of the greatest shows ever made. This show teaches you the true meaning of friendship with never ending laughter and hilarious gags.
10.0~More Than a Sitcom jd_movie_luver Sign in Permalink After watching and re watching this show endlessly, I think I have finally figured out why this show is as amazing that it is: 1. Excellent writing- Unlike most sitcoms, friends combines nearly all types of comedy while still managing to pull at your heartstrings in many ways forcing you to care about the characters. The combination of these things makes this show appealing to virtually anyone, so that 3 people with 3 different types of humor will all be able to find something that makes them crack up. 2. Acting- Each of the six lead actors play their character superbly and really embody their characters. For example, Jennifer Aniston is a very famous actress now, but still when I watch friends, I refer to her as Rachel, not Jennifer. With these 6 actors comes 6 different types of comedy. Joey(Matt LeBlanc) has the dumb person comedy going, Rachel(Jennifer Aniston) works the spoiled girl next door comedy, Chandler(Matthew Perry) has the punchline and sarcastic comedy, Phoebe(Lisa Kudrow) does the honest hippie goofy comedy, Ross(David Schwimmer) does the physical/dramatic comedy, & Monica(Courtney Cox) has the up-tight obsessive competitive comedy. and each of these actors has perfected their portrayal of said types of comedy 3. Chemistry- possibly the deciding factor of if a show will work or not, does the cast have great chemistry on and off screen? And it is blatantly obvious that the 6 'friends' were/are real friends because it shines through the chemistry they share on screen with one another. This is also the reason the jokes work. It wouldn't be believable and probably not funny without this. With the backbone of incredible writing, actors who are masters of their character, and the chemistry that binds it all together, there is no doubt the show will be amazing. In conclusion, friends is not your typical sitcom because it combines all styles of comedy, allowing all viewers to find a laugh but it also has characters and story lines that are not just surface level. if you have not seen friends I suggest you watch it if for no other reason than to be a part of the world of inside jokes that are nearly common knowledge to the world today.
10.0~Greatest Show dryice12345 Sign in Permalink Friends is by far the best show ever. Sure you have Seinfeld and others but Friends is the greatest. In every episode you are guaranteed a laugh. All six friends become part of your life and you feel for them. Great actors put this show together and it is truly amazing. The chemistry is great on stage. Each character has a different personality. I love all of these friends and the creators did a remarkable script. Love or hate it but at least give it a try once or twice. You can see the same episode five times and still laugh. When you not feeling well and you could use a laugh, watch Friends. I promise you will love it.
8.0~Pretty Darn FUNNY padawanmovies Sign in Permalink Being knowledgeable of pop culture I've known about this show for years before I actually binged it on NETFLIX so I had already known about the major plot point of Ross & Rachel. I had recently finished watching the King of Queens series, that did not end well IMO (then when I re-watched many episodes I realized the show wasn't very funny, damn sure not funny enough to survive 200+ episodes). P.s. I noticed Carrie Heffernan, Doug's alcoholic boss, Kelli Palmer, and Mr. Prizan in later seasons (all characters from that show were all in earlier Friends episodes). However unlike that show I found my self laughing mighty hard at many episodes of Friends. I thought as far as representing many 20-30 year olds this show did a pretty good/funny job of depicting that time period in many peoples lives. It wasn't perfect (especially regarding relationships) because I thought in later parts of seasons 4 & 5, many things happened too quickly: Ross & Emily, Gary the cop and Phoebe (he asked her to move in with him after only 5 episodes?). Season 5, Rachel and the Tate Donovan (yeti) character, why was she soo obsessed with him, he truly had no attractive qualities. My other problem was why did Chandler and Monica keep their relationship a secret, your friends are supposed to be the 1st people you come to with relationship news. In season 6, ep. 2, Monica says she didn't want to rush into moving in together, however, they say they only do it because marriage is too extreme. Shouldn't you live with someone because you want to cohabit-ate with them? Which brings me to my least favorite characters: the Gellers. I wasn't a fan of either character, don't understand why anyone would want to be in a relationship with either of them. Monica's incredibly anal and selfish while Ross is a whiny baby of a man who is also incredibly selfish (I don't know what the hell Rachel saw in him, I get that relationship played well for audiences but is it the most believable? I don't think so). Every time something good happened to Rachel, Ross's 1st thought was WHAT ABOUT ME, HOW DO I FIT INTO THIS? Don't even get me started with the "we were on a break" scenario or when she gets her 1st fashion job and how he flipped out about her not being able to eat dinner with him one night. BUT the humorous parts outweigh my disdain for the Gellers and the whiplash pace of relationships. My fave characters are Phoebe and Joey they cracked me up SOOOO MUCH. Some of my series fave scenes were Phoebe singing the song about underwear in the episode where she dates 2 dudes, those 80s flashback scenes, the Smelly Cat video, and so many more. Ultimately 4 of my favorite scenes from the entire show involve guess who... The Gellers, When the 2 of them dance on New Years Rockin Eve, when Monica dances during the closing credits in season 6, ep. 15, when she dances in that 80s flashback at her first college party in season 10, and of course, Ross's bagpipes. I almost cried during all those scenes!! It is definitely a show I can and will re-watch multiple times.
10.0~The best TV show. franciscasilva-16742 Sign in Permalink I never do reviews. Never. But I feel like I should review this awesome show! I started watching it for the first time not a while ago, as I'm 14 I haven't watched it before. I must say it impressed me as I was expecting something different: even though it first aired over 20 years ago, it is still a really modern show. If you love comedies this is for you! This is the best series I've ever seen in my life: great story, great actors, great romances, extremely funny & more!
10.0~The eternal comedy must-see! hampus-widlund Sign in Permalink Ladies and gentlemen, there's a reason this show stayed 10 years on prime time, continued going strong til this day and will keep on doing so into eternity! I was barely born when it started back in 1994 but once I learned to read the high-speed subtitle I was stuck. It only got better and better and the bond between me and my FRIENDS grew stronger and stronger. When given the opportunity I'm still eager to sit down 6pm, turn on Swedish kanal 5, and watch an episode. The six genius characters pose the perfect humouristic combination of people. Rachel, the attractive fashionista, Monica, the pedantic chef, Pheobe, the slightly freaky girl you can't dislike, Ross, the classy nerd in love, Joey, the acting stud and Chandler, the funny guy whose occupation no one knows. You know them so well and in the apartments and the Central Perk they go through love, hate, relationships, break-ups, highs and lows. Thanks to the bang-on dialogue and world class acting all you do is laugh, sometimes so hard you just wan't to cry and pee your pants! And as if that's not enough there are moments so beautifully emotional you tear up and wipe your cheeks. I demand you to enjoy! Love
10.0~Bring it back !! JiraiyaPervySage Sign in Permalink FRIENDS is probably the best comedy TV show ever made. Besides from being hilarious and staying that way throughout the 10 seasons (most shows "die" after the first few), it's by no means restricted to humor and, therefore, superficial. The characters are very strongly built, each and every one of them is lovable in a unique way. I've heard many people say they didn't like one or more of the characters, usually Rachel, for being shallow, or Joey, for being... well... stupid. But for me, they were all great, each of them was the irreplaceable part of a whole. I laughed with them, I cried with them, I eagerly awaited the next episode. If I had to name the most important traits of the show, from my perspective, they would be: - the characters (my personal favorites being Chandler and Phoebe) the jokes (oh my God, the jokes!) Chandler (yes, he deserves his own place in this list, the fans know why) the witty insertion of guest stars (there's no one you'd like to see in the show who doesn't, eventually, drop by) the true, honest, unbreakable FRIENDSHIP! In conclusion, FRIENDS is one of my favorite shows in history. I've seen it three times and I'd see it again and again. I highly recommend it.
1.0~complete sh*t that I've have ever seen!!! cmanak Sign in Permalink Do not watch this T.V series guys.....its a complete waste of time.Starting from the first to the last episode I couldn't laugh for the jokes.They were repeating the same over and again.You wouldn't believe I had to pretend laughing near my friends who liked the series and recommended me to watch it:p.Some jokes r senseless and from the background u would hear the fake laughs which I have to accept made me laugh.Instead watch "Modern Family" the fake laughs make u laugh to tears than that of "Friends"."Friends" a gr8!! job,they mesmerized Millions of people in 10 years.I have 10 years of junk folders named "Friends" in my hard disk(shift + deleted).I hope u would take this as a advice and not offensive.'Guys have real FRIENDS'.....u wouldn't find a single friend of your's acting like that of the actors in the series.Please watch it if u have loads of time its good time pass cos u can practice fake laughing and that's yoga too:)
10.0~Super! akimych23 Sign in Permalink The best ever! Ross and Rachel forever!!!! Aniston plays very well and Schwimmer is so cool actor that i even can't describe! So fantastic to see my two favorite actors together! I'm lucky to see them! Thanks God that i see this wonderful film! Thanks! Thanks to IMDb.com for providing such a good and spotless information! I'm from Russia, and i'm rather glad to see information about our films and our actors! Thanks to all for such a brilliant site, and the best film in the world Friends!!!!I also want to say that Matt Le Blanc was opened as a great artist in this film... i don't know him well, but after "Friends" i know that he's so fantastic, charming, he can do everything, he's funny, serious, insane and handsome lover... Wonderful character!

10.0~An Episode a day ,keeps my work pressure away!!!!!! raghulfire-400-274241 Sign in Permalink I haven't been a die hard for any films and series apart from FRIENDS. It's like,those five characters had became a part of my life.Instead of watching it, m living with this series.Holding fans for ten long years,that too without any repetition of any comedy scenes is really a hard work.More than entertaining,Friends had taught how to face serious problems faced in normal human life in an joyful and comic way.Enjoyable characters,Stunning performance by lead characters,Awesome guest appearances,Non stop comedy,unending romance,true friendship,excellent choice of title song,Video used for title song sequence all together made FRIENDS a Life time experience!!!!!!!!Rather than watching it,LIVE it!!!! Rachel,Ross,Joey,Phoebe and chandler...!!!!The characters i wanna live with in my next life!!!!!!
10.0~Lord of the Comedies: Friends maduranga Sign in Permalink I registered in IMDb just to write a comment on Friends. Because I have to. That is the least I can do for this great show. There is not a single episode in their 10 seasons that's not funny. It's so amazing how the creators and writers made each friend with a distinct character. And how they evolve through those characteristics through 10 long seasons. I have watched most of highly rated comedy shows, but I have never laughed as hard as watching Friends. And I know I never will. Maybe because Friends set the bar too high. Friends was a show out of this world. I cant believe how so many lame shows go on for so many seasons, and they had to stop this show, Friends: Lord of the Comedies. I have watched through most seasons for many times and I will continue it for a long long time. Because I never can get tired of their jokes.
3.0~Average At Best grivand Sign in Permalink IMDb TV ratings are insanely suspect, but downright laughable when it comes to this particular TV series. This is a mildly amusing rip-off of the famous show about nothing otherwise known as Seinfeld. Stealing a premise would not have been a big deal, after all there are only so many premises for TV shows, but the amount of stolen story and plot lines, sometimes down to the same camera shots is incredible. The ultimate downfall for this show however is the completely untalented principal cast. These have to be the worst actors ever assembled to star in a sitcom. Awful delivery of most the lines, where most of the dialogue, is set-up - punchline, which is where this significantly departs from Seinfeld and reality. The popularity of the show is understandable, after all, it's a pretty girl/pretty boy soap fest of a show but the critical acclaim is baffling indeed.
10.0~A Introduction to the show. paulorg Sign in Permalink "I'll be there for you" started the song for introducing the six people who sat on an orange couch talking about their lives and wondering about their future, cracking jokes and above all as the song suggests being there for one another during tough times. The greatness that the show achieved would have been talked by many bloggers, critics and fans. So what's new about the show which is on the way to reach its 23rd birthday? It is the first show I watched and at that time I was clueless about my future (still am) just like Rachel when she walked into the coffee shop in the episode 'It all began'. As the episodes progressed and the seasons progressed they taught me how to be a good companion, a better person and a best friend. Each one of their character had their unique style of acting with their own punch lines, story arcs, flashbacks (Monica's fat suit, Rachel's nose etc.) and individual's success like Ross's tenure or Joey's acting career. These six people showed the true meaning to the word 'Friends'. paul96.org/F.R.I.E.N.D.S-The Trendsetter paul96.org/CHANDLER BING-The King Of Sarcasm paul96.org/MONICA GELLER/BING-The Compulsive Cook paul96.org/ROSS GELLER-A Prowess Palaeontologist paul96.org/RACHEL GREEN-A Fanatic Fashioner paul96.org/JOEY TRIBBIANI-The Sensational Stud paul96.org/PHOEBE BUFFAY-An Idiosyncratic Lassie paul96.org/F.R.I.E.N.D.S-The Best Episodes
10.0~Probably the best sitcom ever SafReviews Sign in Permalink Even Though i didn't live and wasn't born in the 90s, I still find this one of the best sitcoms ever. The characters are just great and the chemistry between them is just amazing; its so hard choosing who my favourite character is because they are all amazing!!! What i also like about this sitcom that it isn't always sexualized, most of the episodes are pretty much PG which makes it watchable for younger audiences or people who are not comfortable with watching sexual activities or references on a sitcom.
10.0~The Ultimate, "Feel Good" TV Show. renofhate Sign in Permalink I remember years ago, as far back as say, maybe the year 2002, I was just starting to get into or, enjoy, rather, this TV series. And at that point, the show had been running for almost eight seasons. It was crazy. I didn't even get proper into the show until after it had finished (I think maybe late 2005, early 2006). But I became a big fan in a short amount of time. Skip forward, we're in September 2016. I have seen every season at least ten times each - the season I've watched least, is the first, and even at that I've seen the first season a solid nine or ten times. And I've watched the tenth season say, double that. And to no surprises, this show is indeed wonderful and it's definitely one of the greatest of all time. I know there are loads of people out there who will strongly disagree and would be adamant to change, but it's fine. Personally, the show just does it for me in terms of sitcom. It's a situated comedy with loads happening throughout. It has a good balance of six main characters and whatever co, and the episodes, while not always hilarious per say, are enjoyable, feel-good, or just real good to watch in general. There are, as previously mentioned, and most people already know, six main characters. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross. While I'm at it I might as well mention that I do like all six main characters in the show - however, at times I find Phoebe to be rather irritating. I never get bored of the likes of Chandler or Ross, they're brilliantly funny, and Chandler is a genius-written character in my opinion. From favorite to least favorite, for me would be: Chandler, Ross, Joey, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe. But as I said, I like all of them. The episodes are good from the start but they're definitely better, or get better, along the way. I mean, the first two seasons are great; but I would say 3-6 are the significant seasons. I also think the ninth season's a really good one. They are all watchable though, so that's good. And each episode's finale is good, particularly the last episodes for seasons, 4, 5, 6 and 8. The season finale for season 10, thus ending the entire series, is a good one, but not my particular favorite episode ever. I think for the most part, seasons 4 and 5 are the best. Each episode gives something to the viewer (in my opinion). Either the episode will be seriously funny, casual but funny, plain old enjoyable, or situated with loads of things happening with some laughs along the way. Like I said it is sitcom, as you know, but yeah. And of course millions of people out there love this show, it's (well, was) very successful and spanned its own spin-off series, Joey. Joey not being so successful but some of the episodes were fine. It was a fine show. Nowhere near as strong or good or even enjoyable and entertaining as this show. Friends is the significant sitcom. I mean I haven't actually seen Seinfeld but match Friends with any other comedy or sitcom series, and it wins. It's just, the "go-to" comedy show. I like it a lot and although typically some episodes are less enjoyable and not merely as good as others, they're all okay, good, or great in their own ways.
10.0~One of the best comedies ever origyc Sign in Permalink This is probably the most evergreen comedy of all time. I love the fact that human mind forgets stuff. Thus I can watch it again and again.
10.0~My favorite show. hailz1234 Sign in Permalink I love this show. Its so amazing. I watch it everyday. It makes me happy. Chandler is my favorite. My favorite show. I've seen every episode. I know every line. Wish they had a reunion. So ya basically I absolutely love the show. I cannot wait to meet one of them. Well, I might one day. I hope I get to meet one of them. Ross is very funny. I love Rachel. Monica makes me laugh. Joey, oh Joey. And, Phoebe she's the funniest girl in the show! But, Chandler is my absolute favorite character. I have never missed an episode. I have probably over thirty episodes taped on my recording place. One of my favorite episodes is the one with Monica's Boots! I laughed so incredibly hard. Anyway, this is my favorite show and that will never change!
10.0~Nice show shubhamsinghucr Sign in Permalink Perfect combination of jokes inside jokes and what we do in usually with friends
1.0~Most overrated show ever made ronbell-23984 Sign in Permalink Cannot believe this scores so highly on ImDb. The attempts at humour aren't even funny. Very bland show.
10.0~My Best Friends agspiojoso Sign in Permalink This show is amazing, I can't believe it's ending, although it's for a good reason. I'm gonna miss this Friends so much, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to turn on the TV and to know there's not gonna be any Friend waiting for me. The best writing, the best actors, THE best show. And I don't care how will it finish, and I don't care IT finish, 'cause I'll just know, I can tell, they'll be there for me.
10.0~Why i wasn't born in the late 80's god ?! yozanirwan Sign in Permalink Friends hands down is the best sitcom that i ever watched. With complicated yet lovely characters this show took my heart out of my chest. Build by great comedy and incredible story, Friends definitly will make who ever watched it could not get over it. All of the cast was amazing. Matthew Perry as Chandler was one of my favourite. With all of his sarcastic jokes, he always make me laugh out loud. FYI i watched Friends in 2018 so, to be honest i only got 85% of their jokes. However i still enjoy the hell out of it. If i were 40 years old, maybe i could enjoy it even more.
10.0~Friends is family allen-basom Sign in Permalink These guys love and laugh and care about each other like family! I mean who can forget Joeys stupid but sophisticated attitude or Chandlers sarcasm or Ross's awkwardness and so on...The only show better than Friends is Big Bang Theory. Actually I take that back...theyre both 10 out of 10
10.0~Thank God I have Friends Like Them, Too! Queer_As_Brian_Kinney Sign in Permalink I've watched this show for I don't even know how long, and I have NEVER seen a show that I love this much. I'm serious. The characters are funny; they're witty and fast and fun. Especially Chandler; like most, he's my favorite, mainly for his jokes (and the fact that Matthew Perry is so cute!) I have to say, I have friends like them. I'm a Monica; I'm obsessive and I love not only food but I love to cook (not enough to pursue a career in it, but still). That being said, I think that "Friends" brightens up my day. If it's one of those days when I have bad hair and am stuck out in the rain without an umbrella, this show is like chocolate for me; it's a luxury, but it's a reachable luxury. And I think that if you've never watched this show, you should give it a try. You never know what you might find interesting about it. For me, like I said, it's the jokes and the easiness and light-hearted situations and comedy. It's the relationships of Monica/Chandler (Mondler) and Ross/Rachel and even sometime Phoebe/Mike. For me, everything about this show is nice. so take my advice and give it a try. You may find a friend where you never knew you had one :)
10.0~My Morning Ritual. flyingtoaster56 Sign in Permalink Friends has always been one of the most beloved programs of all time and their's no trouble seeing why, every episode is filled with laughs; situations we can relate to , happiness and sadness. I love waking up in dusk with the amazing rising sun. The characters are amazing and these six friends resemble my life with my friends and each of us have almost the exact same personalities. i'm sure you are all familiar with the characters as the shows soo famous nowadays. The first three seasons were just pure laughs and was the shows prime time and was overtaking 'Seinfield' and won! Then it picked up on more drama for the next 4 seasons and created some of the most iconic moments in TV history. My personal favorite is the last three seasons as their VERY shocking and more funny. This is show is the best ever and almost as good as Dr Who.
10.0~lovely characters, amazing plot marilia-sousa Sign in Permalink It took me so long to finally start watching Friends. Great friends of mine were always saying how great this show was, and they were all talking about those little internal jokes from the series. Well, the first three seasons were not that great for many people, but I was already addicted. From the sixth till the last one, I almost couldn't stop watching it because they are the funniest and you start to care like you know them in person. They've been through a lot during all those years, and sometimes their reaction to daily situations fits perfectly with your life. Not rarely I caught myself laughing alone from Chandler lines that were so appropriate for some situations. Anyway, I don't regret watching it, at all.
8.0~Six Friends Live in Manhattan atomius Sign in Permalink Friends features the comedic lives of six people living in New York city. Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey and Chandler all live in apartment towers and regularly have social time with one another either at their apartments or at the 'Central Perk' coffee house where Phoebe sometimes plays her guitar and Rachel is the love interest of the bartender Gunther. The comedy involves many plots, such as a new piece of furniture or a new relationship or somesuch thing, and is similar to Seinfeld in its lack of long plots and continuity. It is quite entertaining and worth watching. At present it is on Channel Ten at six rather than The Simpsons so i watch it instead and its not that bad. The humour is quite intelligent, using much wordplay and complex gags as well as simple social gags. Whenever troubles arise they always wn in the end and the show has a very upbeat feel about it.
10.0~A sitcom with fresh comedy buddhiadikari Sign in Permalink The script was impressive. Comedy was on point. Casting was done perfectly, looks like the actors are born for their roles. I always respect how they ended friends, not too many seasons or too less just the right amount of seasons. Sometimes I still watch friends and never gets bored. However, the final seasons were not that perfect like the previous seasons but it's still better than any other sitcom.
10.0~Oh My GoD !!! sasung Sign in Permalink I loved it! This series are supposed to be longer than 10 seasons. I got the complete set of DVD on 13 Dec 2010. Just few minutes back,i completed all 10 seasons. F.R.I.E.N.D.S = An actor(BRILLIANT) & Dating machine + Comedian(good friend) + Doctor(not really,but terrible keyboard player) + Perfectionist( chef + actually adviser + Molding people) + Singer & Masseuse(but terrible guitarist) + (Waitress + Fashion(adviser)) This formula really worked. Friendship between Joey and chandler is the best in this series. Past 20 days,i was laughing like something. Going to watch this series again n again:) It's never too late,if you haven't seen this series. Just go and buy a copy of DVD and enjoy! Thanks a lot to JOEY(MATT),Chandler(MATT), Ross(David),Monica(Courtney), Phoebe(Lisa), Rachel(Jenifer), Writer, Director & Producer for keeping us smile :) And Making me cry (Because of the reason - why they stopped at season 10 when they got everything from this show)
10.0~Everything you're looking for in a Sitcom BeforeDarknessFalls Sign in Permalink This was one of the best things on TV and I'm very sorry to see it end. The characters on this show were excellent and they have become a big part of my life, and of the lives of millions of other people all over. Friends has made it's mark on the world and i know for a fact that there are loads of people from all over who are going to miss watching this well made, funny show on TV. This is the kind of TV show one can watch over and over again. The plot line's rock, the script is strong and the lines are hilarious, the performer's are way talented and the characters they play are realistic. What more are you looking for?
10.0~You're a Member of the Crew theoutlawxanadu Sign in Permalink Friends' greatest strength is that it invites us into a lifestyle that we'd want to live. You've got your six friends, and they're all you need, and you're always having a good time. No, the show isn't always funny. Certainly, no, it's not always smart. But, at the end of the day, it's always a place you'd love to be a part of, and that's why it's worthy of high acclaim. The first couple of seasons of the show were comprised of mostly entirely interesting episodes. Afterwards, the episodes were mostly good - albeit with usually at least one boring, obligatory plot line - and come the final few seasons, most of the comedy got downright stupid (the episode where Phoebe tries to teach Joey French is embarrassing) and you could tell the writers were clutching at straws. Again, though, despite these flaws that need to be addressed, the show was always worthwhile. Matthew Perry, Courtney Cox and Jennifer Aniston (who, circa 1995-1996, was one of the most beautiful women to ever walk the Earth) were stand-outs, and David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow were good as well. For all the flaws one could find with the program if they tried, no one can question the chemistry between the principal actors. Combine that with the memorable settings and supporting players, and you're left with a splendid show that's more of a dumb escape from real life than anything else.
5.0~Has not aged well... chrislgorman Sign in Permalink This show was the show of the young 90s generation. (not mine, I was an adolescent during most of its run) However, as I watch now as an adult of contemporary age of most of the protagonists, I find myself saying, "Wow, these are some pretty self-absorbed and childish liberals." But then again it's New York with no consequences, "do what you feel." The more I think about, the more I don't like this show. The Rachel/ Ross will they/ will they not get together? ( Oh Btw he's married multiple times and she's just too non- committal to anything except her hair). The only semi- adult relationship is between Chandler and Monica in later seasons. Joey didn't get enough air time, but then "Joey" spin-off was pretty bad, not enough for a full show. Who can forget "Smelly cat"? Overall, a show that could have been wrapped up in 2-3 seasons that NBC milked for years as part of its Thursday "Must See TV" block. It was coincident with Seinfeld for a few years, but was then elevated to the 9pm anchor slot after Seinfeld's Finale. It never quite filled the gap.
10.0~True Legend........nothing can come close to this show.... deadman143007 Sign in Permalink I have seen Lost, Fringe, x-files and many more... but this show surpasses every single show on television..FRIENDS story line, every single joke they crack is just out of this world. The characters, the acting the timing everything is just too perfect...i recommend every single person to watch this show.. and besides the ratings it has... i give it 100/10. bcoz it deserves it and i dnt think in the next 100 years any show will be better than friends... And all those goons who didn't like FRiends i seriously say plzz have an appointment with psychiatrist.. u all seriously need. THE BEST... THE BEST... THE BEST...SHOW LUV u all-Monica, chandler,joey,ross and rachel
10.0~Could this show be anymore amazing nawazsohaib Sign in Permalink Perfect. .... these are the only words which can define this show
1.0~Highly Overrated Edkyon Sign in Permalink Never was a fan... but watched a few episodes! Now, they are repeating it on TV so i decided to watch from the beginning! Just saw 2 episodes and... is so dumb and stupid! Don´t get what people see in this to give it a score of 10!? How can IMDB score 8,9... the same score they gave to the masterpiece and for sure the best sitcom ever, Seinfeld!
10.0~The Gold Standard For American Sitcoms. jonny_mcclatch Sign in Permalink For me this is the best American sitcom hands down, from episode one you can see the camaraderie between the characters and it remains strong right until the series end and beyond. Unlike many other shows Friends manages to find the perfect ending to the series despite the writers actually intending to end the show several times prior. The show is still reaching new generations of people and will stand the test of time for the foreseeable future.
10.0~The best show ever!!! (Major spoilers) alicejohnson222 Sign in Permalink I am just totally in love with friends. I think that it can appeal to anyone who loves a good love story, a comedy, a tale of friendship and even a bit of a tear jerker. I am proud to say I have seen every episode at least 10 times and they never get boring. My boyfriend wasn't at all interested in friends before he met me but now that he has watched a few with me he can't get enough!!!! My favourite moments have got to be when Ross takes Rachel to the museum for their first date, when Joey punches Ross, when Ross gets a tan, when Monica and Chandler get married, when Ross is fine!!, when Ross and Rachel have a baby, when Monica and Chandler adopt, when Pheobie gets married and when Rachel gets off the plane!!!! I could go on but I won't.... Just stick an episode on and enjoy!

My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one. My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one. My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one. My all time best TV serial.. if this is not the "Best serial" then I would like to know which one.
10.0~Fantastic Show cagangoktas Sign in Permalink The greatest show ever! Even though the show was over in 2004, there is still the friends spirit going on in 2014. The acting was high level, I actually felt that I lost my friends when the show ended, it was one of the saddest moments, cried for days... My fav character is Phoebe, and for me the best actress. I really hope that they will get back together and film Friends2. Can't wait for that day, the second best day of my life!!! (the first was the day that I started watching the show) I will always stay the biggest fan of Friends, peace!!!!! Ps: If you haven't watched F.R.I.E.N.D.S yet, you are not living my fellow friend. Stop watching other shows, and start watching friends, I promise you it will be the turning point of your life.
10.0~I love this show erenengin-1907 Sign in Permalink love this show. Its so amazing. I watch it everyday. It makes me happy. Phoebe is my favorite. My favorite show. I've seen every episode. I know every line. Wish they had a reunion. So ya basically I absolutely love the show. I cannot wait to meet one of them. Well, I might one day. I hope I get to meet one of them. Ross is very funny. I love Rachel. Monica makes me laugh. Joey, oh Joey said 'how you doing?'. And, chandler he's the funniest man in the show! But, phoebe is my absolute favorite character. I have never missed an episode. I have probably over thirty episodes taped on my recording place. One of my favorite episodes is the one with Monica's Boots! I laughed so incredibly hard. Anyway, this is my favorite show and that will never change!
2.0~It really isn't that good. jaco_duar Sign in Permalink I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour. If you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn't) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I'll summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, "Two And A Half Men" and "The King Of Queens" as the television executives. Now then, on with the review. These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility. The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be "comedy" requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development). This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I've provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. I have watched very little of "Friends" in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned.
10.0~Funny Friends! Hayley_Lowery Sign in Permalink Well where to start... I have to say that friends is one of the greatest sit com to be on Television, if you haven't seen at least one episode you haven't lived! Every episode never fails to make me laugh, i wish they still made it now. I personally think they should bring out a film, with all the originally actors of course otherwise it just isn't friends. I say they all never fail to make me laugh but there is always one that makes me cry and that is the final episode, it was clearly so thoughtfully and cleverly thought out, i think it was just such a wonderful way to end 10 years of greatness, i do love however that even in that last couple of minutes they got one last laugh in. Overall i miss friends even though i can watch it when i want i don't think its always the say. Bring out Friends the Movie!
1.0~Really! laurapacino Sign in Permalink Why all the 10 * reviews. It has to be the unfunniest program I have ever watched. Childish annoying it's so 1 dimensional and stupid. I'm so glad to see loads of other 1* reviews which is exactly what it deserves
10.0~Friends is AWESOME!!!! eddie-meyer-735-856792 Sign in Permalink Everybody loves Friends. Anybody who doesn't like friends is part of a group of the worst people in the world which is also made up of Justin Bieber and One direction fans. Friends is hilarious unlike me. Friends is also romantic unlike me. It baffles me how I like it so much as I've got nothing in common with it. But I do. I can watch every episode over and over again without getting bored. There is nothing that compares to it. The writers are genius's but the performance of the actors makes the script and therefore the show funnier. There's no doubt that the fact that the events that occur in the show could realistically happen to you and me- ordinary people- has at least helped to make the show as successful as it is. But it's now over ten years since the show ended and people still watch it and love it and laugh at it. Friends is also known for having massive stars, for example Bruce Willis, Jeff Goldblumm and Brad Pitt in there show and it's brilliant to see them out of their comfort zone and just doing something completely different. For example it's quite funny to see Bruce Willis go from shooting down terrorists in Nakatomi tower to singing Love machine in front of a mirror. However I'm going to end my review now, having realised that everybody who has the luxury of internet will have probably watched at least one episode of Friends. But if not, WATCH IT!
10.0~The best tv show of all time undralg08 Sign in Permalink It's perfect. It contains everything that you could possibly want in a show. You will love the characters, and will give you a few "falls-from-your-chair" laughs. It's hilarious.
10.0~Best show ever ranvirkaplish Sign in Permalink It is show a great show that It Helped my friends get over depression.
9.0~Amazing series! It only gets better with time PennyCentury85 Sign in Permalink I have re-watched Friends with my partner recently and we finished all series within 2 months, we couldn't stop watching and laughing despite of pretty much having seen every episode at least twice in the past! The comedy and the characters are just fantastic and the humor doesn't get old. We've watched the series with different eyes now that we're also on our early 30s and felt we could relate even more with the characters and what they experience through their friendship years. A tv masterpiece!
10.0~Rewatching the Series on Netflix, still love it! ojendyk Sign in Permalink My husband and I are re-watching this series from the beginning on Netflix and we are loving it just as much as when we watched it as newlyweds. The characters are still as much fun as we remember and it's been great revisiting the episodes we remember and many that we don't. We are currently in the midst of the Rachel/Ross love journey and I do recall getting a little tired of that while watching the series originally. I also had forgotten how beautiful Courtney Cox was at that age.
10.0~Real friendship is a prominent theme. Absolutely love it. Travelwings Sign in Permalink Should you even be looking up a review? :D This show is my absolute favourite one which I watch every day. A story of 6 friends who in their early 20s are trying to make it on the outskirts of New York City. All of these 6 friends have different personality traits and even so they are the thickest of friends. They have different family backgrounds and with their stash of insecurities they manage to live a life around it sometimes with the help of their friends. They can be vulnerable and open with each other which makes them family!! They grow over the years with experience and the show has moments where some characters think in retrospect feeling fulfilled but at the same time new challenges erupt and they draw hope from seeing how far they have come. I have listened to some people claiming how friends is just a bunch of losers who sit over at the coffee shop and whine about life. But I disagree and say that it's much more than that. They do not always whine and complain. They support and cheer on each other. Help each other with their shortcoming and fears. They are genuinely happy when their friend is happy and sad when their friend is sad. One would be lucky to have one good friend in this age and time. All in all it's a wonderful series and all the best when you reach the last episode in the past season. It's going to break your heart as you will have loved it very much.
10.0~One of the greatest shows ever nikhilnagpal Sign in Permalink I started watching this show to improve my English, But it is really funny show And great actors really make it more special. I am really attached to the characters. I just watched the last episode of the series that made me sad. I just wanted to appreciate the show that's why I am writing my first review on IMDb.
1.0~Unbelievably bad PL1981 Sign in Permalink Throughout this show's tenure and being in the age category that this show was supposed to appeal to, I could never understand why it was so popular. Re-watching one or two episodes in syndication years later, my opinion hasn't changed Unfunny and forced humor, weak dialogue,awful acting, annoying characters, inane story lines -this show literally had it all. How did this unfunny drivel find an audience? This is probably the worst attempt at comedy I have ever seen and that's saying something Also the suspension of disbelief needed for the premise of this show to work is amazing. These people have jobs that would pay an average salary at best, yet they can afford to live in a plush Manhattan apartment. Give me a break. And notice the lack of African-Americans and other minorities on this show? In a multicultural melting point like New York? You'd think they were living in the segregated South during the 1940s rather than a modern, vibrant, culturally diverse city (To be fair, I'll give David Schwimmer credit where it's due because he seems to have been the sole cast/crew member who actually realized the stupidity of all this and to that extent he actually lobbied for the inclusion of an African-American character, leading to the casting of Aisha Tyler for at least a few episodes. But it's sad to think that he's the only one out of the whole cast and crew who didn't just blindly accept the absurd premise on which this show was based during its whole decade of existence) Ugh...to think this was on for almost a decade. Defies belief
10.0~Simply superb, no words to describe how good it was. aznfratboy1 Sign in Permalink Friends is a true testament to what true friendship really is. Although I watch episodes in the dark at 2am continuously before I go to bed on youtube, and am thankful for no adbreaks, I really do wish that I was old enough in 1994 to have seen the episodes and at the end of every episode say to myself "it's only 167 hours and 30 minutes until the next episode". What was genius about the series was that the underlying storyline (obviously Ross and Rachel romance) was introduced in the pilot and not fully resolved until 235 episodes later? I don't think many TV series that are still going in 2009 could keep viewers in suspense for over a decade. You really have to take your hats off stand up and give a long round of applause for all the directors, actors, make-up artists, editors etc who made Friends possible, it really is something that will last in the hearts and mind for a very very long time.
10.0~Friends Rules!! dmohlajee Sign in Permalink Friends is the greatest show ever I own some of the seasons and so do all of my girls!! I've loved it ever since I was little and every time I felt or feel bad I just watch it to cheer me up!! This show is great it's real life material yet it's also really great. I think that on the local broadcast listing that the station (wgn/cw) should change it from two and a half men to friends because I truly believe that Friends should be on the air during the day for the local broadcast listings. I really believe that friends rules!!! I think it's great because it's really real yet it's also really funny. It's two in one. It's a great show that should really be on air. Everyone should watch it.If I was allowed to then I would rate it over and over again as all ten's for excellent. This is a great show and everyone should watch and then rate it a ten. Go Friends!
10.0~"One of the most refreshing and original television series of all time. Charming and constantly hilarious" galileo3 Sign in Permalink Rachel, Joey, Phoebe, Chandler, Monica, Ross Ten spectacular years with 6 'eccentric' people is truly a roller-coaster ride of emotions. From obsessive hygiene freaks and chefs, to a hungry stupid guy, a paleontologist that acts like a child 70% of the time, an unsure man that has gay parents. A crazy orphan with a twin sister and just a girl that used to be ugly and have a long pointy nose. That's it. A Cafe and 3 apartments in New York City and 6 people with incredible on screen chemistry create one of the greatest television series of all time and probably the most hilarious of all. Friends is mad, funny, shocking, touching and refreshing to audiences. Ten wonderful years just don't seem to be enough. People want more. But every good thing has to end. "Along with The Simpsons, FRIENDS is one of the greatest broadcasted treasures the world has ever seen" 9.3/10
6.0~Comfort food dylanvieira-51513 Sign in Permalink I know what I am getting when I watch this show. Sometimes it can be extremely funny, sometimes it can be predictable and boring. The stories and relationships tend to become more absurd as the seasons go on. It's O.K.
10.0~Not just the best TV show on earth, but the best THING on Earth. fionaclark-61358 Sign in Permalink I cannot even BEGIN to say how much I adore this show. I never stop re-watching it because honestly, what's the point in starting a new TV show when you already know you've found the best one? So many people say that Seinfield is the best, but could that BE anymore wrong? Seinfield does not have the emotion that is in Friends. The characters are not even close to being as close as Rachel, Joey, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Ross. As a matter of fact, no one can be as close as that. I admire how the show always makes me smile the entire time. My friends all say I look like an idiot when I'm watching Friends because I'm always laughing out loud and grinning from ear to ear, and honestly, I couldn't care less. This show has changed my life. Literally. I love looking at Joey because OH... MY... GOD HE IS SO HOT. His kindness towards his friends and his sense of humor always makes me so happy. Joey is hands down my favorite. Rachel, and her growth throughout the show, is so strong and amazing. I loved how she went from the person who used her daddy's credit card to someone who works at RALPH LAUREN. Monica, and her cleanness always reminded me of some people I know, and a little bit of me too. Also, she was so gorgeous too. And Chandler, of course. His sarcasm and awkwardness made it impossible not to like him. Ross, who always manages to make me laugh because of his three failed marriages and his love for dinosaurs. He's so cute. And last but DEFINITELY not least, Phoebe, the spiritual quirky one out of them. The creator of Smelly Cat. So if you have NOT watched this show... what are you doing? Go watch it RIGHT NOW. Oh, and by the way, Ross and Rachel WERE on a break.
1.0~Friends seen from the Post-Friends era Piperson Sign in Permalink It probably isn't fair to judge this show when it has been off the air for several years but that is what the internet is for isn't it? I like certain superficial things about this show. The female characters are all physically attractive. They have very shiny hair, beautiful faces, great legs, tits, and eyes. When Rachel is bustling around in her designer clothes I just think no one on TV has ever looked so good. I love Phoebe's bohemian style and her complicated hair-dos that must have taken at least two stylists to arrange. Monica is played by one of the great beauties of this or any era. The male stars are appealing as well. Ross passes himself off as a nerd who never got girls but he is tall and handsome with movie star good looks and an unfortunate hang-dog expression. Chandler is funny and lively. Joey is a beautiful hunk and a great comic actor. I also like the sets. I feel that the girls' apartment influenced a whole era of home design. The rooms are adorned with a lot of stuff yet they don't seem crowded. If I were a young person aspiring to the lifestyle these people lead I would have studied that apartment for inspiration and I'm sure many people did either consciously or unconsciously. On the other hand there is much about this show that is hard to stomach. The romance between Ross and Rachel was what sparked much of the interest in this show, but as soon as they were happy together all the spark died out. Since the plots needed to be contrived in such a way that they would long for each other but never have satisfaction, we were subjected to some really dumb stuff. How much can you admire or care about a girl who only wants the love of her life when he is in love with someone else? She shows up at his wedding to Emily causing Ross to blow his vows and never set things right. We are expected to follow along with her when she never did the smart thing and always did the dumb thing. I give Rachel and Ross 10 out of 10 each on the annoying scale. Speaking of dumb things what about Phoebe? It is so hard to watch someone try so hard to be quirky and only succeed at being obnoxious. I realize that we are supposed to find Lisa Kudrow incredibly talented at playing someone so untalented but it just got old. Maybe if this show had only lasted 4 or 5 seasons I wouldn't be finding fault with it. But then there would be a lot fewer zillionaires in the world wouldn't there? "Just turn it off" I keep telling myself.
10.0~Never gets old! enzopert Sign in Permalink Friends is like breakfast, You have it every morning but next morning you still want to have it...No matter how many times you watch it, It is still funny even if you know all the words and punch lines! I can say it does not have the best acting or story lines but it has addiction...after watching it you end up creating a strong connection with it, it feels as thou these 6 people are your friends and you can totally connect with them. Surely it is a huge disappointment that is finished but in my mind it can never end. All in all do not watch it, coz once you do, you can never walk away!
10.0~I don't understand how people can not enjoy this! kalecrane Sign in Permalink Seriously, this is the greatest thing on TV ever! All my childhood I thought that my favourite TV program was the Simpson's, but as I got older I started to watch Friends more, and I enjoyed it! Every single episode made me laugh! I could probably watch the same episode 10 times before it got boring! My favourite male character was probably Ross as he was the one who really got me into friends. But I actually think that the best male actor was Mathew Perry, he should be in more comedy films! He also got the very last laugh in the last episode when he said the single word "Where?" My favourite female character is probably Rachel as she's quite funny. But I think that the best actress is probably Courtney Cox. Every time I watch the last episode of friends it makes me cry inside, because I know that everyone in the cast and crew were crying.
10.0~Best Sit-com Ever (beyond all doubt) Rehan7 Sign in Permalink FRIENDS, without doubt is the best sit-com ever. I watch numerous TV shows but i have never been captivated more by any show than this one. All the six main characters have done a marvelous job in depicting the day to day life in the big apple. The casting couldn't have been any better. David Schwimmer as Ross, no one could have pulled it off better. An insecure, reluctant guy who always manages to complicate things. Matthew Perry as Chandellar, o boy what a performance. The witty jokes and the sarcastic humor to go with the facial expressions and the body language, the best man for this particular character without doubt. Matt Le Blanc as Joey, the extreme dumbness yet pulled off in such a lovable manner makes joey everyone's fav character on the show. I was shocked to see Matt Le Blanc performing so brilliantly. Jennifer Anniston as Rachel, a runaway bride who is somewhat obsessed with her looks. Starts as an outlaw in the gang but smoothly becomes the integral part of the group. To this date Jennifer Anniston's best work in front of a camera. Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe, no one else on the planet could have played this role as well as Lisa. A taboo figure in the gang, very weird, mysterious and in the moment. She provides the X-Factor to the gang with her bold antics. Courteney Cox as Monica, an obsessive compulsive perfectionist. She provides the balance to the gang with her logical, reality based solutions. Courteney is another one who has performed out of her skin in this show. If you have not seen this show, trust me you have deprived yourself of something truly magnificent. For once "great show" isn't an overstatement. I have seen all 10 seasons about 10 times, even remember the dialogs in each episode :p. It is addictive, it is brilliant it simply is the best sit-com ever.
9.0~Contemporary Genius russellsrock Sign in Permalink Delightful contemporary show about youth living the dream in NYC. Great comedy to relieve one's daily stresses. Never to be duplicated.
10.0~Lmao... solstice520 Sign in Permalink This is absolutely the best show tv has ever made! I thank God for the reruns that are still on. My husband thought it was a girly show but now I catch him dying laughing and watching it with me lol...
10.0~They'll be there for you!!! yaxleycratler Sign in Permalink Friends is without a doubt the best American TV show ever to air. It has sad and hilarious storylines and makes you feel the sadness and jot out of any situation. The actors do fantastic and you really feel like you know a part of them by the end of the show. This will be a show I will never forget as I make constant references to the episodes. I wish the show could come back on air because I miss them so much, but I'm glad it got all the fame it did because it deserved it.
1.0~I wish I could get this sqeaston9 Sign in Permalink Having caught the odd episode, I've always considered this unwatchable drivel and avoided it. However a friend who's opinion I trust recently told me that the early seasons were much better, and since series 1 was available free on demand I decided to give it a go. I managed episode one and will never watch this again. There was absolutely nothing funny or even vaguely amusing, and the laughter track just added to my irritation. The characters are stupid, petty and vindictive. In one scene one of the women destroys a watch belonging to a man who persuaded her to sleep with him by telling her he hadn't been able to make love since his last relationship ended some years before. I fail to see the humour. So many people seem to love this, I just wish I could understand why. 1/10
10.0~Still the number one wemdalu Sign in Permalink After over a decade it's still the number one American TV sitcom. The Funniest, great dialogue, great Acting, perfect characters
10.0~As good as it gets, speaking of sitcoms... supercoool89 Sign in Permalink Friends is the best of all the sitcoms. Here in Sweden we're now watching season eight, and it gets better and better and better. I'm really sorry that this series aren't supposed to be longer than 10 seasons... I think the best joke in the whole series is this: Monica: "I think we should have a halloween party!" Joey: "Na, it's kinda' silly dress up and pretend you're someone else!" Chandler: "Joey... You're an actor!!!"
9.0~One of the best ensemble shows ever eliotkeith Sign in Permalink This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends.
1.0~overrated shahabiali Sign in Permalink Most overreated tv show and over over overated and it is a over rated show so yes
10.0~Watch, laugh, complete, repeat. bmos-39604 Sign in Permalink The only show that I completed it 4 times and still watch it again. The only show that everytime I watch it, I still laugh like the first time. The only show that I never wanted it to end.
10.0~Will never be forgotten ratpackaustin Sign in Permalink 14 years have gone by since this show has ended. 14 years, And yet it's still one of the most popular shows today. It is one of the most watched shows on Netflix right now, and even younger generations are throwing out quotes from this beloved series. This is what makes the show so great. Even though it's been over for 14 years, you can enjoy it in the same way today as you could then. Everything about this show was on point from the humor and laughs, to the drama and heartbreak. There has never been a show that can flawlessly dictate how the audience is going to feel like friends did. If they wanted laughs for that episode, then the jokes were going to crack everybody up. And if they wanted tears, the drama was so good that everyone felt it. Also the acting is phenomenal! You see the actors names during the "I'll be there for you" opening sequence. But you say to yourself who the hell are those people. Because you don't know who David schwimmer, Matt le blanc, Matthew perry, Courtney Cox, Lisa kudrow, and Jennifer Aniston are while watching it. You only know Ross, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, and Raechel. Im 19 and grew up watching this show. And my kids will watch this show. And so will their kids. This show will live on for many generations because it's so easy to love. It doesn't seem like it will ever die
8.0~Friends - Like These Sam_Loves_Friends Sign in Permalink Friends is a fantastic comedy in which everyone has their own story and would give anything to tell them at The Central Perk. The actors and actresses who made this possible are Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimer, Matthew perry, Matt Leblanck. It all began when Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Joey and Chandler were at their favorite coffee place and Monica's best friend from high school, Rachel, runs in. Soaking wet. In her wedding dress. Crying. The rest is history. My cousin and Friends fanatic first persuaded me to wacth Friends and it was really good. now whenever I'm upset, she uses Friends lines to make me smile again.
10.0~Best ever!!! carolrmag Sign in Permalink Okay,so it is not a genius work of art. But it is a genius entertainment loving show. It took me the first maybe 3 episodes to get to know the characters which makes every episode even funnier. It is important to get to know them (not a very hard thing to do, since they don't have many layers). It is a sweetest show, that will make you laugh and cry, and laugh laugh laugh. It is the only TV show I bought in order to be able to watch more than once. It is hilarious. Oh, and romantic, which for me is always a grabber. Don't watch it if you're too much into serious. A must watch for the rest. Hope they make a match anytime soon!!
10.0~Timeless classic comedy river_rogers Sign in Permalink A heart warming comedy that will be a classic for years to come. A must watch for for comedy fans. Each episode is funnier than the last.
9.0~Simply the best bjoernidler Sign in Permalink Friends is the best sitcom I have ever seen. I watched all ten seasons multiple times and plan on doing so again in a couple of years. Here's what's so great about it: 1. Great characters Who wouldn't like to have friends as good and diverse as this? Yes, they're all white. But remember that Friends began at a time when it wasn't considered a neccessity to at least have a black, an asian and a gay character in the same show. I can't imagine a person who can't relate to at least one of the characters. 2. The balance Friends is quite often simple fun, sometimes it's emotional, sometimes it's almost depressingly sad. But somehow the writers always managed to clear the air with a laugh at the right moment. 3. Friends takes its characters seriously. Sure, it makes fun of them as part of the comedy but every character also has its honest, heartfelt moments without seeming forced. 4. The guest stars Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, JCVD, Elle MacPherson, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Danny de Vito... The list goes on. 5. The 'quotability' Me and my friends still use many phrases, jokes and references from Friends in our every day life. Here are just three examples. 'My girlfriend's a lesbian.' 'Joey doesn't share food!!' 'We were on a break!' 6. The writing Although the show went on for 10 seasons, it didn't feel too repetetive. In my opinion they found a good time for the end of the show. Some storylines feel similar but never bore me. I don't know how they did it, but they did. I subtract 1 point for the laugh track (never understood that...) and some best-off-episodes consisting mostly of funny moments from previous episodes (no-one needs that!) Other than that, perfect entertainment!
10.0~The one that started it all ashwin-nprabhu Sign in Permalink This was the first English language programming series that I watched, most of the jokes I could never understand to or relate. Watching it again and again brings back memories. After all these years you have to appreciate the writing and the acting which makes this series the best of all time
10.0~A decade of pleasure. john-penfold Sign in Permalink How often does a TV series last 10 years, 10 seasons? How often does a TV series keep our imagination and attention held captive? Not many can fill the shoes that friends walked in. Friends was simply an amazing show. The characters just mixed perfectly together. They all seemed to aimlessly blend into each other. Without one, the other could simply not survive. I grew up watching friends, it was apart of my teenage years. I think in years to come, it will be remembered as one of the all time greats. I can still watch repeat episodes and continue to laugh at the same jokes, over and over again. It's with that, you know you have something truly special. Nothing I've ever watched came close to the brilliance that is "Friends". I don't think anything ever will. I'm just happy I was alive to see it develop and grow up and mature alongside the characters of the show. Thank you for producing friends. Thank you very much.
10.0~The One With The Comment raphael88 Sign in Permalink OH... MY...GOD !!! "Friends" is the best TV show ever ! It's the most enjoyable sitcom ! It's absolutely PERFECT !!! After the fifth time that I watch the same episode, I keep laughing at Rachel (the ex-high society kid), Monica (the fussy mother of everybody), Phoebe (the foolish girl who used to live in the street), Joey (The missed-actor very successful with girls: "How're you doin' ?"), Chandler (the sarcastic one with his engagement fear till he goes out with Monica) and Ross (The marriage & divorce specialist paleontologist) 's jokes ! I like especially Chandler for his sarcastic humor but I'm fond of every character of this wonderful show ! What is special in "Friends" is that everybody can find in each character an aspect of his own personality because, after all, the pals of the Central Perk are normal people. "Friends" is also able to speak about all themes without taboo and with subtlety: homosexuality, sex in general, marriage and divorce(s) (isn't it, Ross ?), love between friends and all that. I think it's a great idea and it's well done ! There's something else that is special in "Friends": the capacity to have moments of emotions and moments of humor without being soppy nor unsubtle. A great performance ! Thank you Marta Kauffman, David Crane and all the writers ! There's also a good amount of guest stars who are absolutely excellent ! Some of my favorites are Maggie Wheeler as the terrible Janice, James Michael Tyler as the unbeatable Gunther, Tom Selleck as Richard, Helen Baxendale as Emily, Paul Rudd as Mike, Elliot Gould as Jack, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Gary Oldman, Sasha Alexander, Elle McPherson, Bonnie Sommerville, Susan Sarandon, Reese Witherspoon, Christina Applegate, Eddie Cahill, Sean Penn,... All fantastic ! One last thing which is great: the Ross and Rachel's love story from Season 1 to 10. My Favorite Episode: "The One Where Ross Can't Flirt" My Favorite Season: Season 8 (Emmy Award 2002)
9.0~Friends hlawona Sign in Permalink Nothing like putting Friends in and laughter begins. I can watch them over and over again without being disappointed.
9.0~A must watch for sitcom lovers paulwalters-24860 Sign in Permalink I took my time watching this show over an year, then binge watched the entire series in the last month. And I am not disappointed. Everything from the actors, to the set, to the jokes are on spot. The storyline, although linear, is well written and evenly paced throughout the show. To add extra spice, the parents of each characters add an extra flavor from time to time and those are the episodes that you will rewatch again and again.
10.0~Best TV Show ever. pedrolcf Sign in Permalink Chandler, Joey, Ross and Phoebe are great, Monica is annoying as hell and Rachel is a bitch. Best TV show ever created, cannot even be compared with How I met Your Mother and other sitcoms, it's just so creative and genuine that you wish it was like that in the real life. You better watch it.
10.0~10/10 mudassarshaikh-98170 Sign in Permalink People who give less the 10 rating for friends. Don't trust them they have zero knowledge about television 😅 ... anything they say is a Moo Point🤣

2.0~Like the show, but one character ruins that lola_mary Sign in Permalink I really like the show, it's fun, the stories are great and the jokes are funny. Monica is great and she's strong. The boys are my favorite: all 3 of them and they are great friends. Unfortunately, one character ruins everything: Rachel Green. She doesn't know what she wants, she's playing Ross all over again and brakes his relationship with amazing girls. What is up with that? She ignored all the hints Ross gave her that he'd like her since forever. And then even though Ross had a new girlfriend...she seduces him. Eventually Ross breaks up his great relationship to be with Rachel, after which she doesn't want him anymore... Also, Rachel breaks up (because Ross was just the normal great boyfriend for wanting to see her once a week, on their anniversary), gets mad when he gets comfort somewhere else and calls him a cheater... I want to look to a woman and say: "I want to be like her." Rachel is everything I don't want to be. That's annoying. It's even sad because girls these days will think "not knowing what to want and playing boys is perfectly fine" .
9.0~Few ensemble sitcoms of the 1990s and early 2000s commanded as much love and devotion from its fans as the immensely popular NBC series Friends. toqtaqiya2 Sign in Permalink Friends is one of my favourite TV shows. I have to admit that I hardly watched it at all when it first aired. That maybe because I was still going to elementary school and high school then. After that I began to watch the re-runs, and found it to be very appealing. I was looking for some comedy, and got plenty of it from Friends. I guess the big reason why I didn't want to watch the show at first was because it's so popular (the leads are famous too). The series was very successful in the ratings, consistently ranking in the top ten in the final primetime ratings. The show's biggest appeal is the humor. You can always count that each episode will have at least a decent amount of humor. Most episodes are just hilarious! After I watched the entire first season I began to care about the characters. The series revolves around a group of friends in the area of Manhattan, New York City, who live together and share living expenses. I'm not going to go into which of the six leads I like the most because I like them all. They all get a chance to shine throughout the show. However, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are definite standouts. They're good in their roles, and are often very funny. Friends also has a memorable cast of supporting characters. I especially liked Monica's and Ross's parents, Rachel's father, Richard, Janice, Rachel's sister Amy, Mike Hannigan, and Phoebe's boyfriend David. The series starts off strong. In the first few seasons the main relationships form, and there's a good bit of drama too. The middle is probably my favourite part mostly because it's the funniest. And although the show does become a bit repetitive and goofy by the end, I still found it to be very entertaining. In all, there were 10 seasons with 236 episodes. The finale was watched by about 53 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in TV history. Friends has made a large cultural impact, and the Central Perk coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. Repeats of the series continue to air worldwide. Throughout its run, the series won many awards and was nominated for 63 Primetime Emmy Awards. One of the most important things that makes any story great is the characters, and Friends has six good ones. By the end, I liked the show so much that I didn't want it to end. I now have the DVDs so I can watch it anytime, and often do. Rumours have surfaced of a film. Most of the lead actors expressed interest in starring in the film, but for now the film is just a rumour because nothing's final yet. If you haven't seen Friends yet then don't hesitate to do so. The series has almost universal appeal. There are good reasons why it was so popular.
10.0~best show ever melissab-41483 Sign in Permalink Best show ever best show ever best show ever Best show ever best show ever best show ever
10.0~Awesome show/Awesome Actors ged_white72 Sign in Permalink This is one of my favourite TV comedy because it went on for around 10 years and there is not one episode i didn't like. It never took it to far it was always within the boundaries of a good comedy. I also like the fact that they sometimes put a really famous and good actor in like Brad Pitt and Danny DeVito. It is the perfect TV show to watch because there is no complications you always understand. It is so easy because there is so few places like: central perk and the apartments. But most episodes they do go to different places but those two are probably always in them apart from when they go to London but phoebe is still in the apartment but when they go to las Vegas its all there. Definitely a must watch.
10.0~Best Comedy Show Everrrr!!! samiaahmed155 Sign in Permalink I Love this show that show make laugh and in the end I feel so sad Monica Chandaler should not move in country. .. I'm really sadddddd like really sad
1.0~I will never understand the hype! kenziknightz Sign in Permalink I will never understand the hype for this show. Mundane cast and boring, overused canned comedy.
10.0~The most unforgettable US sitcom of all time lucky_star_1 Sign in Permalink Gosh, if I had friends like the six friends in this series, my life would definitely amount to something! The show has changed my whole outlook on life. You need friends, they are a necessity, yet friends like Joey, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Ross and Phoebe are hard to find. They all relied on each other for love and support, yet were unique and independent. Isn't that something that we all yearn for? And how often do you find yourself falling in love with your best friend's brother like Rachel did with Ross? Strange, but it worked. Although personally, I thought Rachel and Chandler would have potentially made an intriguing couple but hey, that's just me. Who can forget Joey going commando? Ross and Rachel 'taking a break'? Chandler's inability to 'grow up' or 'commit'? Monica's cleaning obsession? Ross' insistence that he gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist? The game that won the guys the girls' apartment? Phoebe's songs? Ross and Rachel marrying in Vegas / having a baby / finding other potential lovers / finally reuniting? And pretty much everything else that involved the friends 'being there for each other'? Well, the events, lives, loves and losses of all ten seasons will stay with me forever, right from the Pilot to the Last One. They WERE there for us and boy were we lucky. Pure entertainment and pure television genius that will go down in history.
10.0~Best TV Series ever gilmsbastos Sign in Permalink I was forced to see Friends, and since that day I can't stop watching them. They managed to stay 10 years with such a spectacular show, and from the star till the end we have hours of laughter... And if you haven't seen one episode of Friends please give it a chance... And trust me, if you love comedy, not hard comedy, but simple daily situations comedy, you will love this show. For me one of the best shows ever... And the only thing I hate about Friends is that they never did a Movie. Even now, after more than 10 years, I believe a Friends movie would be outstanding. So, if you're searching for something to relax and spend a good time after the hard working day, this is your answer.
10.0~Best sitcom ever ben_esmonde Sign in Permalink Friends is one of my all-time favourite shows. I feel it is one of the best shows of it's genre, along with The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. It seems to have inspired many modern sitcoms, most notably How I Met Your Mother, which also is about a group of friends living in Manhattan. Friends will make you both laugh and cry at the same time with it's well- written scripts and brilliant performances from it's main cast. It is a timeless show that will never be forgotten by anyone who has seen it. I feel that it is worth watching every episode of Friends, from it's unforgettable pilot to it's emotional finale. You will love every "friend" in the show after 3 episodes...or maybe even less. I always thought the guys were funnier than the girls but everybody has a different opinion. My favourite "friend" was always either Chandler or Joey, but both of them together are almost always the funniest scenes in the show, in my opinion. I love Friends! 10/10 10/10
10.0~The most successful and long lasting sitcom ! smissirlis Sign in Permalink The actors are high level, and they defend the script pretty well. Credits deserves to the script writers too. Probably they had some kind of source of real incidents, and after process turn them into very funny situations. This sitcom have also very stable quality over the seasons, and duration. Still broadcasted till today, decades after its termination. I would like to thank all those which contribute to Friends, and add some happines to our life! My last wish is Friends the movie. Will be interesting to see the funny perspective of Friends get aging.
10.0~A great start to the weekend... Angelus2 Sign in Permalink This show was my official start to the weekend; it was smart as well as hilariously funny. The show is based on thirty-somethings...who go through life together. There is no weak link within this group of actors, everyone plays there own roles with ease and the characters begin to develop throughout the series, as well as the writing; which only gets better as the years went on. All the characters are lovable and you feel for them when tragedy or heartbreak strikes. The episodes that will always stick in my head are the Thanksgiving and Christmas episodes as well as the Halloween episode...This show is simply held together by the talented actors and the brilliant writers..Friends is simply the greatest sit-com ever made...
2.0~This show sucks shawn_cool_great Sign in Permalink Friends is one of the worst television shows I have seen in my entire life. Heck this show even has a history for vulgar jokes. I mean there was once an episode where Chandler accidentally walked in on Rachel in the shower and saw her breasts. Rachel acted like a little kid and decided to see his unmentionables as retribution. Where is the humor in that? Another time I think it was Ross and a girl talking about protection, and all of a sudden Ross starts mentioning something about bears. What the heck was that all about? Then another time at Thanksgiving the gang played a game of football and it had serious implications regarding the Thanksgiving turkey. These are just some of the reasons why this show sucks.
10.0~TV Cinema at its best ! vibhor_24 Sign in Permalink There will be only a few TV shows that would match what friends could achieve. The show is truly one of a kind. 10 years of unmatched humor, unmatched satire. Some of the things that really stand out are:- -Scripts....10 seasons and 238 episodes yet each episode was at par. It also showed that it isn't just about the comedy.Many believe it was just a plain sitcom, but the truth is that it was a perfect blend of comedy with drama and romance.The writings, from storyline to one liners were very original. Many of the episodes are so damn good, you'll watch them again and again. -Characters....One of the rare shows where each character and contributed equally, yet each character was so unique. Rachel(Jennifer), Monica(Courtney), Phoebe(Lisa), Joey(Matt), Chandler(Matthew), Ross(David)..6 ordinary actors who together created a spectacle. -Consistency....Friends, like every other show had its ups and downs. But the show had some unmatched consistency. The characters as well as the writings grew season by season. Ratings never really went down. From '94 to 2004, it engrossed more and more viewership. -Connection with the audience....The jokes, The situations, The problems were ones that an average American in his 20s, 30s could easily identify himself/herself with. It covered almost all aspects of a young adult...from dating to umm, toothbrushes! I would also like to debate a common argument against it....Critics do say that the show was only limited to the apartment and the coffee house. But, according to me that's what made it so consistent. The writers did the right thing to remain original and well, it worked. If you haven't watched it yet, believe me, you are missing something out of this world. From "The Pilot" to "The Last One (2)".....you'll be in for a wonderful ride. Kudos to Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions....and to NBC.
3.0~Tepid comedy charlie-benjamin Sign in Permalink Friends is neither so unfunny that I switch channel, yet nor is it funny enough to ever make me laugh out loud. At best, I'll chuckle, but that's as far as it goes. The dialogue consists of 1-2-1 exchanges that with almost clockwork precision result in one of several "quirky" expressions, most commonly the much copied "sh'uh right" from the infinitely funnier Wayne's World. Its that, or its Phoebe's expression of disgust, "Y'eugh". You get the idea. The comedy is built around this predictable exchange, with the audience no doubt cattle prodded into laughing, or paid. Over the years that the comedy has run, attempts have been made to develop the characters, and I believe this was directly in response to the masterful writing in Frasier, which managed to combine complex character and relationship development with laugh-out-loud humour. But Friends failed to succeed in developing either the characters or their relationships. Rather, what we were presented with were teenagers in adult bodies, 'playing' at being adults. And in a sense, for people who love this comedy, it perhaps represents a 30 minute opportunity to identify with this and its opposite, namely being 20 but living the life of a 30 year old, or being a 30 year old, and remembering back to when they were 20 fantasising about being 30. In the latter sense, comfort can be found in knowing that they aren't the idiots that the Friends are, but at the same time, they have achieved a comparable lifestyle, whilst being able to fantasise that they too have achieved that lifestyle with the same level of ease as the Friends. Conversely, people in their 20s can fantasise that they too will be able to attain a comparable lifestyle with the same level of ease. Herein lies its success but simultaneiously its weakness, that contributes to the general lack of substance that characterises this show. Life, especially in the city, is often about struggling, and indeed, it is in the struggle from which much comedy is born: the struggle to find love, the struggle to find work, or in my case the struggle to find Friends funny. Friends is a hugely but inexplicably successful series...I hesitate to call it a comedy because this would be to imply that it is funny. It is not. Put it this way: I can watch Friends, and effortlessly hold a straight face. It simply is not funny. The paradox, however, is that aside from Matt Leblanc, the cast have proved themselves elsewhere to be excellent dramatic and comic actors. But you would never guess it from watching Friends. I was glad that Friends finished, only to realise that there would be in eternity of repeats to avoid. I can only hope that Arrested Development is given a new lease of life on HBO, that Kelsey Grammar and gang return to a new series based around Frasier Krane, and that the new seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Rescue Me start soon. These are shows against which Friends is eclipsed and soon forgotten.
8.0~I almost Loved It aimsramirez Sign in Permalink Considering that I was allowed to watch the show growing up, and have really only watched episodes sporadically, I decided to watch the entire series in order. It was really great. Not surprised it lasted as long as it did. The chemistry of the entire cast was something a lot of shows lack, and their ability to ease into any scene or joke was admirable. My absolute favorite actor was Matthew Perry--Chandler Bing being my favorite character as well; He was relatable with his wit, charm, and all-around cluelessness. He almost made everyone else great. In all reality, it's a really great show. I just CANNOT get over Matt LeBlanc's character Joey. They over-exaggerated his stupidity, even as a comedic relief. I realize this is a comedy show, but it was highly irritating... Even Courtney Cox's character Monica was a little neurotic sometimes, but considering she plays a character like that on her most recent show (can't remember the name of it), it's a little more understandable that she may only know how to play one character. Both characters were made more tolerable with Chandler by their side. Overall, recommend it to anyone looking for a good honest laugh.
7.0~Could have been the best series ever... tixyboy Sign in Permalink It still is a symbol of the Nineties and it will always be, but it really was that good just before they started to lose they creativity - which happened around the end of the 5th season. I mean, all what happened in Las Vegas looked so fake, quite the worst season ending of all. Then we had to swallow Joey falling in love with Rachel... aaahhhgh God. They just had no better ideas than this crap? Last 5 seasons were just like prolonging the agony by making Monica look even more psycho, making Phoebe look even more crazy and bipolar, keeping Joey in his childish mode forever while the other 3 poor victims seemed to be there just to look after them. 10 long seasons. 5 was more than enough.
10.0~Had an great time watching it quasahr Sign in Permalink Amazing and fun all characters are wonderful :):):):):):)
10.0~True masterpiece. Don't miss it. hunainmansoor Sign in Permalink Just completed watching all episodes of friends.. And i am sad that it ended. It is so far the best comedy show I have ever watched. All characters have performed upto mark. Strong acting, excellent storytelling and outstanding direction has make the friends perfect... I am going to miss this masterpiece. Hats off to all the friends team.
10.0~BEST SHOW EVER!!!! Lohani Sign in Permalink Great show, great characters, great acting. My Peraonal Favourite. This show is the definition of a sitcom, a true comedy with great relatable characters, characters that you will love and would want as your F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Great acting by the cast, and even after watching each episode multiple times it will make you laugh out loud like you are watching it for the first time. Those who haven't watched it, watch it, you won't regret it & those who have, continue watching it again and again, you will love it.
10.0~Six Friends who Met At A Café castrofernanda-66732 Sign in Permalink Friends takes you back to the '90's qnd as you watch, you live vicariously through them: There are episodes for all moods, which makes it so relatable Central Perk was the meeting spot for Monica, Ross, Chandley, Pheobe and Rachel. Each character is different, but they all make the series worth watching. It is centralized on Rachel and Ross but always takes you thorugh relationshops the rest of the characters get into. The series is full of laughter, romancs, and drama.
10.0~The epoch of TV history mallikarocksmr Sign in Permalink This series literally carved out an enclave, a niche as the best television decade in the history. All this time, it made me laugh out loud, I had never thought that it would make cry towards the end ... Yes I spent nights crying over the fact that show is ending... I took that it really was a reality parallely existing and that these characters felt so real, near and adorable that I was lost in its awesomeness. Never in future again a show so lovable will be made.
10.0~Makes the audience the seventh friend adhitikrishnan Sign in Permalink six friends who struggling in new York,find comfort,support and love among each other. yeah, that is it.there is nothing more to the story. The fact that the story is so simple,yet the sitcom was groundbreaking is what makes friends one of the best sitcoms of all time. the dialogue,the characters,the chemistry between the cast is what makes this one of the best TV shows. this isn't a show you watch.we literally live with the six friends laughing at their situations and crying at their emotions. the dialogues are the real heroes, as each and every dialogue will have you laughing and gasping for breadth. the chemistry between the cast is electrifying. the characters start of one dimensional and slowly and beautifully develop. the performances are really good.Particularly the performance of Lisa kudrow and Matthew Perry are impressive. overall i would give it a 10.
10.0~The best sit-com ever hikaruvy Sign in Permalink I started watching this for learning English. I learned what is funny in English (or in the US perhaps) with this series. My favorite is Chandler. I cried so hard when I finished the whole series. Now I can't even count how many times I watched each episode. The show is funny since the beginning. They use episode really cleverly in later episodes. So the more you watch, the funnier it gets. I also like the way each character has strong and consistent trait. And the actors are just perfect for each characters. I can only see them as FRIENDS cast. Just everything. Everything gets me!
10.0~Best series evermade mrabhijit-53686 Sign in Permalink Sheer entertainment. This is something which be part of your life, your children's life and the life generations to come. Human relations so beautifully explaines.
10.0~Unforgetable Show fidan_samet Sign in Permalink I think Friends is the best sitcom ever. Its cast, its scenario, its humor... It is just so perfect. I can't even count how many times I have watched the whole series. There are six friends have completely different personalities from each other in series. Rachel is the sensitive and a bit avaricious one. Monica who is an old friend of Rachel is rigorous and stingy. Phoebe, a guitarist (incredibly talented), is the weirdest person in the series and also she is very helpful. Chandler is the one who always makes jokes (as Monica said "Joke joke joke joke") and I should say I still don't know what is Chandler's job. Joey ( or Ken Adams) is a little stupid. He loves food and women so much that he can't choose one of them to other. And the final one is Ross: Divorce man. He is a Jewish man and he is very obsessive about his turkey sandwiches. As you see characters are so original. And the actors make these characters alive. There are some specific parts that I remember about Friends: Janice, Marcel, Rachel's cat (although it is not a cat), Joey and Chandler's chairs and foosball table, Central Perk, Science Boy, Geller Cup, Hugsy, Rachel's dessert, "How you doin'?" and "We were on a break!" lines, Crap Bag, Ross' Armadillo costume, Lobsters, Unagi, Duck and Chicken, "Smelly Cat" song, Ugly Naked Guy, City of Gunthers, Phalange and more... Friends shows us that life can be surprising. It teaches a lot to us. But first it teaches us to love. I'm so thankful that they make me laugh and happy everytime I watch this series.
9.0~Classic stevenrexfernandez Sign in Permalink So were Rachel and Ross on a break? FAVORITE SITCOM
8.0~Succeeds in Being Great Comedy, But Lacks Any Depth borowiecsminus Sign in Permalink Frankly, that's the highest praise you'll ever give a show that went 10 seasons. This show, of course, is filmed in front of a live studio audience. And there's a reason so many comedies do that. While it seems distracting (until you get used to it), it actually does something almost sinister. It makes a show seem funnier than it actually is. Laughter is more contagious than any disease on earth, so when we hear a studio audience cracking up, we will, too. That being said, this show is genuinely funny - but not because of the writing. Sure, the writing can be great (the "Backpacking in Eastern Europe" story is a standout in fantastic writing, as is "The One With the Embryos"), but surprisingly, the thing that makes this show so damn funny is the actors. And it's one of the only comedies that operates this way. The vast majority of comedies work because of the writing (think "Malcolm in the Middle," "How I Met Your Mother," "Master of None," "30 Rock," "Modern Family"). There are a few rarities that work because of the directing (think "Arrested Development" and "The Office"), but "Friends" is pretty much the only one (although the Office does too, a little) that works because of the acting. For me, the funniest moments in the show are all attributed to the actors' performances. These include Rachel coping with Ross' new Girlfriend in early S2 (Julie! Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch- spit-on-your-neck-fantastic!?), Chandler and Phoebe's career performances in "The One Where Everybody Finds Out," Monica crying in "Rachel's Going Away Party," Joey Speaking French, and of course, the ALL-TIME FUNNIEST PART OF THE SHOW, Ross being "fine!" and spelling out the word L-O-V-E in his intense state of denial. But beyond the acting and a few other moments of great writing, the show doesn't offer any real heart. I enjoyed the episodes with Ross and Rachel, and Chandler and Monica, but not because I was invested in their love stories, because they used great jokes in those episodes. And at the end of the day, that's the show's largest weakness: the characters. The six mains are either complete stereotypes, or have no real personality. I'll show you. Ross: The only consistent thing about him is that he's a nerd. But in any given episode, he's barbaric, romantic, rational, insane, or anything else you could attribute to a human. Weak character. Rachel: Also has no personality. She's spoiled, but other than that, nothing, really. She's also too down-to-earth for her own character at times. Monica: A stereotypical control-freak, neat-freak, competitive type. No other depth. Joey: Stereotypical ladies' man. All about the ladies, dumb as hell, but a child at heart. Makes for good comedy, but not good television. Phoebe: Literally just the oddball in the group. Not only are the throw-away jokes about her past contradictory to each other almost constantly, so are her personality traits, the things she says and does -- and oh yes, she's very funny...until there's an episode devoted to her. You'll notice I left Chandler out of that. And that's because Chandler is actually a really good character. At first, it seems that Chandler is just a way for the show to deliver stand-up-style jokes, but it works because that's exactly who Chandler is. He uses humor as a coping mechanism, and as he says, "it's all I have." While that's really only two layers of personality, that's twice as many layers as everyone else on the show, so kudos. My other note, neither criticism nor praise, is just an observation worth sharing: in my opinion, the show peaked from Seasons 3-6. It took a while to find itself completely, and fell flat towards the end, but those four seasons are truly great. The best one is S4. You're probably thinking I'm being to critical of the show. But I gave it an 8/10. That criticism would bring a drama down to a 5, maybe a 4. But after it all, "Friends" is a comedy, and it's purpose is to make people laugh, and in that, it succeeds admirably. It remains a funny show on multiple viewings. It's humor got it to an 8. The only thing that kept it from a 10 was quality and depth (and don't think that comedy can't be deep and funny -- look at "Modern Family" and "Master of None"). 8.4/10. As far as comedies go, this one's damn good.
10.0~This is more than a show it's an laughter ride saitanooj-87469 Sign in Permalink This series is the pure definition of "comedy" . This is an classic show of friendship drama and comedy . I love the Joey character . Overall the best comedy show ever
10.0~Worth it noskins-23349 Sign in Permalink Enlightens you with it's humor.. you will be glad to watch it. :) Cheers
10.0~I Freaking Love This Show annatnguyen-26419 Sign in Permalink Friends is an American sitcom (1994-2004) that follows around 6 twenty-something best friends, 3 guys and 3 girls, who live in the same apartment complex in New York. They experience life together, fall in love, fall apart, and chase their dreams. Through the ups and downs, they're there for each other. I grew up watching bits and pieces of this show because my older sister grew up watching it and would play it on the TV and I'd sit with her. I never quite understood it of course because the witty humor was something I couldn't fully grasp, but it wasn't until I was about 11 years old that I watched the show from the very beginning and since then, I've had all 10 seasons on DVD and have watched the show countless times that I have it memorized like the back of my hand. I want to discuss this show in 3 aspects: the script, character development, and storyline. I absolutely adore this show's script. The humor is ridiculously hilarious because of how clever the jokes are. The show is packed with joke after joke. It's not overdone and they make so many references that if you pick on, it leaves you cracking up. The scenarios the writers come up are funny because as outrageous and embarrassing as they can be, it's incredibly relatable. We've all accidentally embarrassed ourselves in front of our crushes or during a job interview because we were so nervous. We've all dealt with such ridiculous people that sarcasm is the only way we know how to deal with them. As for the character development, I've never watched a more diverse group of cast in regards to their background and personalities. Each character has their own sense of humor and they interact so well together and when one throws a joke, the other has a comeback. I fell in love with characters. I grew to love each of them so much. The storyline of Friends isn't one that drags on, unlike other TV shows. Like life itself, it's so hectic with so much going on all the time, and Friends takes you along these best friends' journey of life, through the happy and sad times, through the ups of relationships to the downfalls, to the death of a member to the birth of a baby, to the end of a job to the find of a job of their dreams, etc. I always have something to criticize when it comes to a show, especially the endings of most. I usually get disappointed in how a show is wrapped up either because it was too sudden, with everything just coming to a halt or whether it was because it became boring and just dragged on forever. But with friends, all I can say is although even at 10 seasons I wish it was longer, the way the show came to end was beautifully, but appropriate. Not to spoil but after 10 years of the best friends' lives, they were ready to move on to the next chapter, to settle down and start a family. They weren't 20-somethings anymore finding love and jobs because eventually, they achieved all of that. They couldn't all cram in the tiny Manhattan apartment anymore, but that's okay, because they were ready to embark on the next chapter of their life, of course, still together. They're best friends for life. Overall, I give this show an A because it has everything I'd love in a TV show. It's comedic, sad. It has love, and has practically every aspect of life and it only makes me wish the characters were real. That's how well developed they were, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Even after I finished, it's just the kind of show you come back to no matter what. It's so heartwarming and it makes you laugh your butt off and fills your heart with warmth. It emphasizes the importance of friendship and family and love. At the end of the day, that's what matters. I love that.
3.0~Very cute show but very over rated davidsawyer-me Sign in Permalink When I first saw this show I hated it. It gave me the impression that it was a bunch of spoiled out of touch hipsters living in an expensieve new york apartment. However my roommate, who happens to be older than me actually liked the show. So I gave Friends a chance and after a while it grew on me. Specially when I found out Fibi Buffet was once homeless. Though her character doesn't act like anyone that was homeless that I've ever met even if they are now in a home. I found it a cute premise but still out of touch. Joey was cute and sexy even though they overplayed how good looking he was. He was cute but not handsome by any means and besides he was kinda short. Anyway, I watched it off and on for years but I am so sick and tired of TV stations playing this in re-runs over and over again. I'm now sick of the show again and hate it once more. I did go through a spell where I liked the show but I really didn't feel for any of the characters no matter how deep they tried to pretend to be. I still found them all fake and phoney. Now in 2012 almost two decades since the show started it seems that local stations are contractually obligated to play this series to death... or I should say way past it's death. There are newer fresher funnier shows like 30 Rock that have jokes and humor of today in 2012 and not from a decade that people don't act like anymore. I wish more TV stations would play newer shows like 30 Rock or something else. One reason I got rid of cable was the limited handful of reruns they owned. Don't get me wrong I love re-runs but there is such a tiny supply of shows on TV these days. On the internet there are hundreds of shows to choose from while that dinosaur TV hits us over the head with shallow peppy plastic shows like Friends. I don't care how deep they tried to come off that show was total and utter phoney garbage. Now who ever owns the rights to Friends is forcing the local TV stations to play them over and over again until we all die a little inside. I know I can turn the station or go back to the superior internet. But there are times when I come home at night and would like to turn on the TV and have them present me with something enjoyable, fresh, today, and actually funny. Sure the characters on 30 Rock come off as hipsters too but they meant to be hipsters, they are meant to be absurd. And that's what makes it funny. But Friends is so obnoxiously transparent I can't believe that it has the TV contracts that it does. It's a cute show but so aren't a lot of things. A plastic doll is cute but that's all it is. Plastic. If Friends were to disappear forever I for one would not miss it at all. If I ever see this show again it will be too soon.
9.0~One fine show that hasn't aged one bit. elizabethdawson-78805 Sign in Permalink Who hasn't seen Friends? The show is immensely popular all over the world. Friends is a landmark television show- one whose aftereffects in comedy still reverberate to this day (think Big Bang Theory). This show about six twenty-somethings in New York City became an instant classic and the reruns have ensured that the popularity does not fade. Endearing characters, witty jokes and personable storylines throughout the 10 years made this one of the most widely watched shows not just in America but all over the English-speaking world. If you want genuine entertainment you cannot go wrong with Friends.
10.0~Friends SimonaBee Sign in Permalink Friends was, is and will continue to be the best show ever made. This is a simple and true statement about the most iconic television show ever to grace our screens. Taking place over the 10 most important years of 6 young New Yorkers Friends takes you through the joy, heartbreak, shock and hilarious moments of Rachel, Ross, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe and Joey. Set in Greenwich Village, Manhattan we watch Chandler the group's joker turn from a lazy single into a grown up family man. Joey, the struggling actor finally gets a break. Phoebe finds her family, and adds to it for her brother. Monica, the young gorgeous clean freak finally finds a man who can stand her near OCD cleanliness needs and settles down. Ross, the smart Dr. with the Ph.D comes to terms with his family issues and finds the love of his life, even though it doesn't always work out. And of course Rachel, the beautiful Long Island Prom Queen breaks away from her father and his credit card and takes on life as a New Yorker, working for her money and taking life as it comes. We watch as these six great friends fall in and out of love, have children, change careers, get married, in some cases several times, and live from there mid twenties to mid thirties. Friends was a fantastic show when it started 14 years ago, and will continue to be a classic for a very very long time. Nothing will ever match the hilarious, heart breaking, shocking and feel good story lines of Friends.
10.0~a classic!!! victorgagan Sign in Permalink there were Siti-Coms....there are Siti-Coms.....there will be Siti- Coms....but there wont be anything like "friends"....each character stood out...the show has its legacy and that will Alwz last... even after 20 years u see the episodes being played on various channels... joey is my all time favorite...its surprising that the characters have moved on but still they are identified with their names in friends..."How U Doin?"...this line just breaks u into laughter...Ross, Chandler,Rachel,Pheobe and Monika are more than just characters...even the character of Jenice which only appears occasionally in the show is amazing...just the way she laughs makes u go crazy...a story of friendship,love,care,emotions and being there for each other... the show was top-notch...one of the finest shows ever!!!!
10.0~The One That's The Best SummerMood Sign in Permalink Friends is just so funny and cool. It is really the best TV comedy show ever! It has everything a good TV show should has. A perfect storyline, perfect location and of course the whole cast! The characters, writers, producer all did they a great job...no they did a brilliant job! There is not one only episode you could hate! They are all funny and the cast is so good that you really love every episode even it's maybe a little bit boring but there are just about 3 episodes of all you could say they are maybe not as interesting as the others. The location is mostly the purple apartment of Monica and Rachel. There the friends sit and talk. But they are often in the café on their street, the 'Central Perk'. But now, let me talk about the most brilliant cast in TV history: Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston):Rachel was a spoiled rich girl before she came in the pilot into the 'Central Perk'. She left her almost husband at the altar and lived on her father's money until Monica cut her credit carts. Rachel gets a job as a waitress in 'Central Perk' but she is very bad but after a while she takes a job in a fashion store, something she really likes. Monica Geller (Courteney Cox Arquette):Monica is the cleaning friend. Everything has to be perfect. The apartment's always clean, just everything! She's the sister of Ross. Monica works in a restaurant what she always wanted to be. In her youth she was really fat but no as an adult she's very slender. Later she marries Chandler her brother's college friend. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow):Phoebe is the crazy one! She's the one who fights for animal rights, she's also a vegetarian. But what makes her really crazy is her story. She was married to a gay skater, her mother killed herself and as a teenager she lived on the street. But the craziest thing is that she gets the babies of his younger brother Frank. She believes in many things(i.e.she thinks that her mom comes back to her in a cat...)what makes her weird. She works as a masseuse. I just think that Phoebe is the coolest because she is so crazy what makes her the funniest female character. Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc):Well, you could say that Joey is the dumb one. He tries to be an actor but he doesn't really get good roles so that he has just very little money. But the women love him. Almost every week he's another woman in his bed. He lives in the apartment of Chandler, his best friend, right across the floor, in front of Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry):The sarcastic one! The funniest one! The kind of loser. He's just the coolest because he's funny. He works in a firm but none of his friends does really know what he does. He lives together with his friend Joey. But he's the total different to Joey. He hasn't many women. But his advantage is that at the end of season 7 he marries Monica who's the love of his life. To my opinion Chandler is the best one, because he's funny and just cool. Ross Geller (David Schwimmer):Ross is the smartest, but he has the problem that he always has to be right. He works in a museum has two children and is a three times divorced guy. His first marriage didn't work because his wife became a lesbian. The second one didn't work because at the altar Ross said the name of the wrong woman and the third one was a Vegas marriage, so you know what happens don't you? His big love is Rachel. After a while they are together but Ross' jealousy breaks everything. Then they are back together but then they break up again. It's like driving a roller-coaster. But maybe this is the miracle that makes "Friends" one of the most successful series ever in the American TV history. You see there are many different things, some very crazy but because of that very funny things. So you should definitely watch it. It's no waste of time! In no way! Just try it! You'll like it.
10.0~One of the Best Comedies of All Time atlasmb Sign in Permalink Looking back on the run of the TV series "Friends", it is easy to see why it was so popular. The casting gave America six young adults who actually felt like they were our friends. On each episode, after its catchy theme song by The Rembrandts, we got to visit with a cast of such well developed characters who we liked: Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is the beautiful, yet accessible and funny, girl who became a style setter. The country followed her hairstyles and the drama of her ever-evolving relationship with Ross. Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) is the nerdy PhD who struggled with the timing of his relationships, managing to marry and divorce before finally getting a shot at the love of his life, Rachel. In my opinion, Aniston and Swimmer were the talents that elevated this show beyond good to great. When you watch their performances, their comic timing is perfect and their characterizations feel true. Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is Ross' sister and the neurotic neat freak who still bears scars from her younger fat days. Besides some very interesting relationships, she eventually marries another one of the friends. She is hyper-competitive, especially when it comes to games or sports. Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is the class clown. Could anyone BE any funnier? His bromance with Joey is the center of his life until he falls for Monica. Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is the clueless actor who knows how to score with women ("How YOU doin'?") and shares his passions for games and "Baywatch" with Chandler. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is the kooky folk singer with a penchant for writing odd songs, like "Smelly Cat." She has a twin sister who is also "out there", and an unusual past. The writers for this show had some great talent to write for, but the writing itself always gave us funny premises, great ongoing gags, and the occasional touching moment. It was always fun to invite them into our homes and experience their trials and celebrations.
10.0~Personally i'm obsessed with Friends, even though i know this situation could not happen between friends. kasssandra95 Sign in Permalink This comedy is one of the best and that is because the characters are very well written and unique, there's a chemistry between them! Also you never get tired of watching it, i have many friends who never see the same film more than once and ''Friends'' is an exception for all of them. It's amazing the kind of detail the directors and writers put in the show and there's always some little things go by and they're really smart, you know it's not some dumb usual TV-show with idiotic lines. I also admire the fact that there's a continuity in the facts even from the first season to the last one. It's just the funniest show..even their faces are just hilarious.
10.0~Best series ever tsiakaloufotini Sign in Permalink No other series has ever touched my heart as friends have. Unforgettable. It's now 2019 and I have started watching it again.
10.0~One of the best surdurodica Sign in Permalink I watched this serial at least 4 times. I have friends still watching this serial. It is one of the best serial with which you can start your day with a smile on your face or finish an awful day again with the smile on your face. During 10 years they have done a really good job and they could keep doing for next 10 years. It is very good to see that sometimes we have good serials to watch and not losing time. We have to learn something from it and to have a positive attitude. once you will see 1 episode, it will convince you to continue. I have seen it during 1 week, day and night :) and I would do it again and live it again because i spend wonderful time watching. Good job!
10.0~Best show ever evalverdes Sign in Permalink For me, no doubt that Friends is the best sitcom ever. For ten years we see 6 characters, with fabulous chemistry between them, growing from young employees, a bit irresponsible and goofy, to full grown ups with filled lives. But not in a sad, soap opera way. With loads of fun, stressful, painful, happy and peaceful moments, Friends pushes any viewer to sit in the café sofa and join them into, sometimes a pointless discussion or a meaningful drama. This is life, with good times and bad times, clever sense of humor, great acting, superb writing, fantastic characters. And they could do it for ten years without loosing any bit of the show's magic. Amazing!
10.0~Simply the BEST!!! Myg-N Sign in Permalink I remember the first time I saw the show and it catch me immediately. It just had this X-factor which a lot of other comedy series don't manage as well as "Friends": The ability to make the viewer laugh every single minute. Even though it seems hard for new upcoming directors and writers to find this X-factor while writing their own comedy, then just take a look at "Friends" and learn. David Crane and Martha Kauffman makes it look so easy. The fact that you can make entering a door fun or a curtain way to talk hilarious then you have something that catches people, including myself. I've missed the show terribly but after 10 seasons it was the right decision to stop while being on top. Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey and Ross will always be missed but never forgotten and they are as well as the writers and directors on this fantastic sitcom - Simply the BEST!!!
10.0~The gang the wider world came to know so well, they were almost like an extension of our own pals. Howlin Wolf Sign in Permalink Almost everyone knows a personality like someone in the group, because they're all so purposely different. They may hug a lot more than mates on the other side of the Atlantic do, but they're there for all the major events in each others lives, and they're just as capable of helping you through tough times as they are of joking about trivial things. In the later seasons they also became more relaxed about allowing guest stars to shine too, and along with a variety of superstar names we got a couple of new characters added to the mix, such as Paul Rudd's "Mike Hannigan". Every season has its classic episodes which don't seem to date, even after multiple repeats. If I had to say which character I related to most it would be Ross, with his buried and much-discussed feelings for Rachel. The writers made him more uptight in later seasons and strayed too far away from his endearing 'underdog' quality that resonated so well, but that isn't to say that all changes to the group dynamic through the years were mistakes. I thought the Monica-Chandler pairing were a believable and sweet couple, and including various kids in the setup was realistic as time moved on and each member of the clique got older. In ten years there were no miscalculations that caused the show to leap badly off track, and that's a testament to the always high-quality writing. Sure there were a few ill-advised stunts towards the end of its run (Rachel and Joey almost but never quite happening, Rachel's lesbian kiss with a hot woman conveniently played by Winona Ryder... ) but the jokes were still consistently funny even if you didn't always buy the angles. Yet another in the proud tradition of quality long-running American sitcoms.
9.0~My first crush on Jenifer Aniston justin-fencsak Sign in Permalink This show, when it debuted nearly 25 years ago this fall and ended nearly 15 years ago with a memorable finale, remains a gold standard for comedies on TV. You can find it on network tv as well as on netflix and still have a crush on the characters. There have been attempts to spinoff the characters such as Joey, but to little fanfare.
10.0~Greatest Sitcom of all time funnybookworm Sign in Permalink Everyone loves Friends. And for great reason. This show has been on the air for 10 years. That is no small feat, and the reruns will show for years to come. This show is being translated and shown in other countries. You know and love your "Friends" and get all the jokes from feeling like you are right there, and you have been, for 10 years.
10.0~best show ever nkclashofclan Sign in Permalink In my opinion this show is the best show ever made ... watching it will attach you with a special bond with the casts .....i had lots of fun watching it. those who are looking for reviews to start watching this show definitely go for it . its worth your time.
10.0~I cant have enough of this show. It is the best that has ever happened to me!! mounika-pratapa Sign in Permalink Thanks to my friends who introduced me to this show. I watch way too much of this show. It is so wonderful that it relieves me from all the stress, I got so connected to the characters that I cry each time I watch final episode(I bet it happens to most of them who love this amazing series).It is so realistic that we( my gang) quote some or the other thing from friends almost on a daily basis. It is a master piece and every character was amazing..chandler,Monica,Rachel,Ross,joey,phoebe..they became so close to us that..we identify ourselves with those characters most of the time..
8.0~Entertaining TV show! Irishchatter Sign in Permalink Even though I have never seen Friends when it came out on the year I was born and until it was finished in 2004, I just still think its a very entertaining show. I only got seeing the episodes because of the continuous repeats on Comedy Central or other Television channels. The cast are just the best, I love the fact they got Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer as the main cast. They are just such great comedy actors and they honestly don't need to be comedians to laugh at ones jokes! I even love the soundtrack, its catchy, fresh and just happy! That definitely is a number one thing you need to get away from reality = a good upbeat song! Regardless if this isn't really a favorite television show of mine, it was a pretty good TV series!
9.0~Great rbverhoef Sign in Permalink This is on of my favorite series together with Spin City, Will & Grace and Ally McBeal. I don't know why I like it so much. The humor is great and the characters very funny but I think it has to do with the whole atmosphere. In the beginning of the series, with a group of 6, I had the same kind of group. May be this helps to like the series more. Anyway, it is very funny and even in the ninth season it still has some original things. Check it out.
10.0~Best TV series ever dasununit10134 Sign in Permalink Can't get enough of Friends. This is the third time I'm watching Friends still it makes me laugh more than any other TV series. My favorite character is definitely Chandler especially because of the sarcastic jokes he make. When it comes to actresses Phoebe is my favorite. Can't say exactly why I like Phoebe the most but for some reason she is awesome. The acting of each and every character is superb. Most of the people watch the episodes here and there when it's broad- casted in the TV but that will ruin the TV series for you. Although there is no much of a story, you must watch the episodes in the order without missing even a single episode. Wish this had more episodes.
10.0~Role Model blumdeluxe Sign in Permalink "Friends" deals with the lives of six very different characters in New York City that explore love, loss and many strange situations. The series is pretty much the role model for many sitcoms that flood the market nowadays. Especially "How I met your mother" draws a lot of its ideas from several episodes here. Over the time you're easily bonding with the characters and get to know a lot about their personality, strengths and weaknesses. The series lives through a lot of carefully built up side plots and running gags and a lot of originality and creativity. Unfortunately, at least the German translation is really bad and the series loses almost all of its charm with it. Otherwise "Friends" nowadays is almost a legend in itself already and that for a reason. All in all you should give this show a try, especially if you're a fan of "How I met your mother" and comparable sitcoms. Do yourself the favor and watch it in English, it will gain a lot through it.
9.0~Best show period. tomasthebombcom Sign in Permalink The best show in the universe. It makes you cry from laughter, cry from sadness, cry from... idk BUT IT'S THE GREATEST SHOW!!! MUST WATCH IN ORDER TO BE A FUNCTIONING HUMAN!!!!!!
10.0~Best sitcom ever ulf_ahammar Sign in Permalink You can't compare any other show with Friends, this is the greatest sitcom of all time. If you haven't seen it, go buy the dvds. I wish they'd made more episodes while this was on the air, now the actors might be getting too old to make another season, or they might just not want to, which is too bad. Even if you have, like me, seen all the episodes many times they are still hilarious. The only problem with this show is the number of episodes, 238 just isn't enough! This is the only sitcom on IMDb worth 10/10, if in the future something even comes close to the greatness of Friends it should be awarded in my opinion. Maybe there's still hope for a reunion episode or something...
6.0~Safe and cozy, but not much more winstonfg Sign in Permalink After 'Married...with children', an episode of Friends is like going back to the Mary Tyler Moore Show. MTM had Ted and Lou, Friends has Chandler and Phoebe; the rest of the characters I can take or leave (although I have to admit Jennifer Aniston is quite nice on the eyes). The situations are invariably contrived, the dialogue made for laugh-every-30-seconds audiences, and the whole thing has a warm cozy feel to it; but that's about it. I'm no great fan of Seinfeld either, but I can see how someone could rate it ahead of this: Friends is just too "nice". And how it gets a better rating than 'Casablanca' I have no idea - they're not even in the same league. My rating: 6/10 - could do better. I'll watch it if I've got a cold or there's nothing else on, and I generally prefer the ones that David Schwimmer isn't in too much - that whiny voice gets on my nerves after a while.
10.0~A True Masterpiece. CallItWhatYouWant Sign in Permalink Even after 14 years of the end, Friends still the best American sitcom. In 10 years, Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross and Joey made us laugh, cry, think about life, career and love. Everyone has their own personality. Monica: The mother of the group. Rachel: Spoilt and Sensitive. Phoebe: Cute and Crazy (In a Good Way). Chandler: Sarcastic and funny. Ross: Nerd Joey: Womanizer. "Should we get some coffee? Sure... Where?" 10/10.
10.0~Why did i avoided this long??? sajjabbar Sign in Permalink I don't know why but i didn't wanted to watch FRIENDS. May be because i saw some bits and pieces from here and there. But sometime back i got the full 10 seasons from my friend and one bored day i started watching it and believe me i didn't stop until the last episode. You just become a part of it. I know there are lot of persons like me out there and if someone is reading this trust me and watch it. Its not just about the comedy (by the way its HILARIOUS) its about friendship,love & life. MUST WATCH WATCH WATCH....... ................... .......................................... ................. .................... ........ ............ ................ .......... .................. ....... ....... ......... ........ ............
10.0~Friends will always be there for you tony-18416 Sign in Permalink Friends is my favorite sitcom of all shows. I love all of the 6 amazing characters in the friend group - Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Joey, Chandler. And 10 years passed since the first episode came out. I felt actually hollow in heart when I watched them gathering in the empty apartment where they all ever lived for a while. It reminded me of laughter, tears and happiness through the whole 10 seasons which happened in both the apartment and a magical place called Central Perk. I really appreciated the spirits conveyed in the show - how to handle problems in terms of friendship, love, career, marriage. It was a relief after watching the last season for 2 reasons. One thing is that Chandler and Monica actually reserved a room for Joey in their new house as Chandler has ever fantasied in Future. Another is Rachel gave up the career in Paris so I comforted myself wherever they are, these 6 people will always move on in their lives and get together for a cup of coffee somewhere in Manhattan, NYC.
10.0~The best American TV has to offer Zeitgeist1313 Sign in Permalink 'Friends' is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece. There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because "everyone likes it" and be "unique", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too. I would have serious doubts about one's sense of humor if I heard that they hated 'Friends'.
10.0~It should have never ended hmxaraj Sign in Permalink The best show ever . The show that went for 10 straight years and never lost the charm . The show that was full of feelings . The feelings that were never felt before , by this I mean the relation of Joey and Chandler that was way more than friends , was more than brothers it was like an elder baby which was the most amazing thing in the whole season and then all those celebrities appearances. Moreover the Quality of Humor was brilliant and its started in 1994 and I watched it 11 years after its end but I loved it equally which means that the season is independent of a time frame and worth watching again and again . The only sitcom show in the history of the world which people might have cried watching . I wished it would have never ended but every thing has an end and thats the reality of life .
10.0~Bring the show back keithda_3 Sign in Permalink I think they should bring Friends back as a reunion show and do a spin off with the original cast having a family and kids.... Now thats reality. The show was awesome and funny. How many shows are out there like this. We sometimes forget who are friends are and hoe to treat each other. I have enjoyed watching this show every night on TBS. I want to buy the full set. But better than that would be watching the new show. With Courtney Cox not being Married I think this will give her a boost for her. As far as everyone else what are they doing? Put this show back out there. The ratings will sky rocket Im sure. More people like that show than we know.
10.0~20 years old but still Best TV Show to watch mashfiq_ctgbd Sign in Permalink One of the most significant TV shows of all time. And yes it is now 20 years old TV show. Almost every single episode is brilliantly done. The storyline is so strong it can compete with any other TV show that is running on TV today. Whenever it's a dull or boring day, just place the DVD and enjoy the perfect. Or even on any day this show is perfect to make you smile. The commitment and bonding of 6 Friends are so strong even today they are still friends of thousands of people around the world. So it's definitely a MUST WATCH TV show from my list. And trust me it will never be boring. My Rating after watching FRIENDS thousand times would be 10 out 10.
7.0~the best of the easy watching michael-bell-2 Sign in Permalink Let's be blunt, friends is hardly the most challenging comedy out there or the most enthralling drama. The thing it has got going for it however is its ability to draw people in. It's essentially comfort TV. Watching it doesn't require any effort at all, you just sit back and enjoy. With the best comedies, the office for example, there's the idea that you have to work a little to get some of the jokes. You have to be able to extract the joke for the full effect. With friends they simply present it to you and you simply take it in, no thought or effort required. It's easy to relate to on some levels, but sometimes their problems are simply comedy situations rather than ones you would come across in life. The wit isn't groundbreaking but is reliable to keep you going without annoying you. While its neither the ideal comedy or ideal drama it is a perfect example of comfort TV. If you want to be challenged by your TV then go elsewhere, otherwise just settle in, switch off and enjoy.
9.0~This is great! vortex6688 Sign in Permalink Hi everyone! This is really nice page, and i really like the "Friends" show! I also want to share link to my website ( www.fansoffriends.com ), it's about Friends too. It's my first work, so please don't judge so hard. My website contains some information, pictures and all the seasons of friends. That's not cheating, you can watch online all the episodes of Friends and you don't really have to get through the registration or anything like that. I Just wanted to try myself as a web designer and created source about my favorite TV show. Comments on the website are appreciated. Thank you!
10.0~This show is the best show in the world. No lie. akmusic3 Sign in Permalink I have to tell you, Internet Movie Database, the Earth's largest movie database, that FRIENDS got me through some really rough times. I won't go in to that. That may be one of the reasons I love it, but I really think it is because FRIENDS is the best show every on TV..in my opinion. Chandler: This is the guy that "jokes" are his defensive mechanism. And man, are they funny. I love every thing Chandler says. He is the main attraction for this show, which is funny cause the producers have been quoted to say they intended for him and Phoebe to be "supporting characters". Phoebe: Speaking of Phoebe, Lisa Kudrow is a comedic genius and deserves every single award she has won. You can't stop laughing at her. You go through moments in the show (almost every episode)where after she says something, you emotions are as follows: "WHAT?" and then "Oh my word, that is so funny." Ross: I rank Ross the highest on my list, because he is the best actor of the bunch. When the show was first airing on TV, it was hard to catch, because he was just that good. Everything he did, especially the physical stuff was just hilarious. People tend to think Chandler or Phoebe are the funniest, but Ross....he is the ACTOR. He has the most training of the group. Rachel: Rachel is on the show cause she is gorgeous, hip and adorable, but I don't think it was for her comedic skills. Sure, she is funny some, but when you watch the show over and over like I do....Rachel's jokes are not funny for the second time...and definitely not the 2000th. Chander's, Phoebe's, Joey's and Ross' always are. Rachel also grows up on FRIENDS, so it is a coming of age story for her. It is interesting to watch her grow. Monica: Oh Monica. I would say Monica is the most complex actor on the show. She has a lot of trails as the series progresses, and many are mirrored after her personal life, which just makes it more real. I would say she has to be the most "generic" on the show, after Rachel. Till about Season 5, she is the straight man. But after Season 5, she really becomes HILARIOUS. Joey: I have saved Joey for last because he is also a fave of mine. He is just so dumb. Really. Like it makes me laugh so hard when Phoebe and Joey try to talk to each other. They are both just dumb, and that is their attraction. Many find Joey very good looking, and I do not. My attraction is just how dumb and what a slut he is. Overall, this is the best show of all time for me. You can't ever top it. It revolutionized sex and made 30 the new 18. Everyone could relate to this show, and syndication has only made people love it more. But it really is much more than that. It is the funniest show. THE funniest. I love it! Basically, if you haven't seen FRIENDS, you really need to!
10.0~Friends, best serie ever juliacstg Sign in Permalink "Will be there for you", impossible don't think in Friends, right? This serie is about a group of youngers friends living in Manhattan, New York. It shows all the problems that youngers have, like get a job, relationships and living alone. The first episode of Friends tv show happened in September 22, 1994 and the last one was in May 6, 2004, and since then is a success. In the serie, all begins when five friends (Monica, Ross, Phoebe, Chandler and Joey) are hanging out at Central Perk, a coffee shop, when out of nowhere showed up a woman dressed like a bride, named Rachel, a situation that scared everybody in the group. Since then, Rachel started living with Monica, who is a chef cook and sister of Ross, who is insane in love with Rachel. Ross is a paleontologist, so you can imagine that he loves dinosaurs, right? Well, he has an insane love for that too. Joey is an actor, not so good, who suffer a lot, because doesn't get roles so easily. The other guy, Chandler, is the comedian of this serie, he is always trying to make people laugh with his jokes. The last one, Phoebe, is a girl who had a very difficult childhood, her mother killed herself and she had to live on the streets. This serie is great for marathon, each episode will make you laugh, it will cheer up your most stressful days. Make me very happy to have watched Friends, because it makes me got interested in English, the same time that I was having fun watching, I was learning. In conclusion, Friends it's a serie so good that you will forget the time and watch all day, probably one time to match won't be enough, you will want to watch more and more times.
10.0~Best show ever andreiameloraq Sign in Permalink With no doubt one of my favorite shows ever. About to watch it for the 3 rd time. So relatable, so funny, so nice and comforting. Amazing cast and characters with such nice personalities. Watch it all and then watch it all over again.

Everybody did awesome. Chandler, funniest! Phoebe, coolest! Ross, geekiest! Rachel, stupidly funniest! Monica, obsessive! Everybody did there role splendidly. My laughter increased 10 times more when Janice got included. This show is definitely coming into my DVD collection. I have watch all 10 seasons nearly 8 times and I'm presently watching it again. Watch this show. Laugh your ass off. Enjoy the show. A 10/10 show.

10.0~Love it rhcp6969 Sign in Permalink One of the best shows ever i love the characters, they are all funny in different ways. I personally love chandler the most, but others don't agree for some reason. Just like the other day i saw a ranking (on Rankopedia.com) that said that Ross was the best character. I totally disagree, i mean he is funny and all but kind of annoying sometimes.... Anyways, brilliant show and definitely the best American show ever! It is amazing that it never got sold out, it was always a great show from the first ever episode to the last one, all of them were amazing. Maybe some better than others, but all really amazing! Non stop fun with 'Friends!'

10.0~Greatest TV show of all time naser-2050 Sign in Permalink A story of the friends. It will remind your life, every time. I do not know what to write. Just watch it, you will never forgot, trust me. The 6 people who live in Manhattan. Have some unique interaction. My favorite character was Chandler Bing. He is funny, a lot of fun. Others are also good. The caring and crazy Monica Geller, Phoeby Buffey, who is another crazy person. Ross Geller, Monica's big brother, a geek, Rachel green and Joey Tribbioni'S stupidity is also awesome. After end of the day, you just fall in love with the show. I will never love any other TV show of my life time. The things I just write here is not overrated. I miss all of my friends now. Whenever I miss them more I just see one episode of friends. It makes me happy. But, after season finale I just cry a lot. Thanks for the actors/Actress and directors for such a evergreen show. I am lucky to see in my life time.
10.0~Best Show Ever! DaynaCano Sign in Permalink "Friends" is honestly my favorite show of all time. I feel this way for many reasons. First of all, the cast is outstanding! They have a chemistry that seems effortless. Each actor sincerely IS that character. Secondly, it's funny! I challenge anyone to sit through any episode of "Friends", and not laugh at least once. It would be very difficult. The wittiness of the show makes each joke or punchline new and entertaining. Lastly, the show obviously had amazing people working behind the scenes: the directors, the writers, the producers, etc. Many other shows can't hold an audience's attention for even one season, let alone making it through ten! Throughout each season "Friends" just got better and better. The only thing WRONG with this show is that they stopped filming.
10.0~Opinions about the show : iSanaUsman Sign in Permalink FRIENDS is one of the world best TV shows ever, it is ever living show. You can watch any of it's episode and won't get bored at all but you'll end up laughing out loud. God bless David and Marta for wonderful creation. Nothing in world can beat FRIENDS story line. Watching the last season does makes you cry. Rachel and Joey friendship is the best, Chandler and Joey friendship is superb and Phoebe jokes are the best. Rachel and Poss couple is beyond awesomeness. Monica fits with all of five of them.
10.0~I actually love friends!!! sam_aj_01 Sign in Permalink WOW! Friends is one of the most uplifting TV series you could watch! There's always something on every episode thats funny or entertaining, even if its not your kinda thing. Tts the series you can relate to because we all do stupid things, and in Friends it shows you just how over-the-top these little things can get. If you get the chance to watch it, TAKE IT! I haven't met a person who hasn't seen at least one friends episode! Bring on more Friends!!!

Although I must warn you it is highly infectious. They'll be there for you when you need a good laugh. 100 out of 10.
10.0~I have all the seasons and i love it BFreshKel Sign in Permalink I think friends was the best TV show ever made and that it should and could have lasted longer. I can watch it a million times and my favorite episode is the one where no ones ready. I like that he was willing to drink the fat and that Monica was "crazy like a straw you know crazy straws" - Phoebe. My favorite friends are joey, Chandler and Phoebe. I think chandler is hilarious and phoebe is all over the place. I only wish that i had liked it when it was on TV but not till after it was over did i like it. I wish that they were still airing new episodes. I know the words to almost all the episodes and they still make me laugh.I hope to someday meet the cast of the show and get to know not only know the characters but the actors.
8.0~One of my favorite shows, but full of plot holes. alliekittycatlove Sign in Permalink I adore Friends, but I've watched it all the way through several times and I keep finding more and more plot holes. Like, why do they all seem to have multiple birthdays, and why was rachel 28 in season 3, but not 30 until season 7. It makes no sense. Still an enjoyable show if you don't focus on that stuff too hard.
10.0~Masterpiece mmalahmad Sign in Permalink It is the same show and the more you watch it the better and funnier it still have the same humor and jokes I love it
10.0~It never gets boring jackhol1989 Sign in Permalink Friends is a series that will never die!! Over ten series we watch the six friends grow and get closer, within that we see several marriages, arguments and make-ups. During the seasons I believe that the episodes went deeper into each friends life and showed us a lot more character, along with that the writers managed to show us a whole new side of comedy. I believe that FRIENDS will pave the way for new and upcoming comedies. I come from the United Kingdom and I am accustomed to and love the British sense of humour, but I believe the writers bought the best out of every episode and made the series an international treasure. I believe that the series was rounded off nicely, but when I heard of I possible come back for our friends, I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to here more. Even though I was excited I was worried that they might destroy a perfect ending, let's hope the trio of writers can come up with another great episode (or two).
10.0~Not Greatest Sitcom Ever, Greatest Show Ever bulldogs-2004 Sign in Permalink This is, without a doubt, the greatest show ever to have aired on TV. All you have to do is watch one episode where they are all in the same room. The chemistry that these actors share is incredible, and the writing is absolutely spectacular. Rarely have I seen a sitcom that is willing to add deep, personal story lines for their characters. Friends had that special something, that "X" factor. They were able to get away with just about anything, one second you are hearing joke after joke, and the next you are seeing the actors break out in tears over some big news. I was one of those people who were heartbroken to see the show end, I could not imagine what it must have been like for the actors. In 10 years the show developed more than any show I have seen, and captivated audiences day in and day out. And if they ever make a Friends movie, I'll be the guy sitting out in the theater 2 days in advance.
10.0~The great one anjkrunal Sign in Permalink After finishing the series you fill that no show will ever be able to take place in your heart as friends does... Part of heart fill empty inside after last scene and the instrumental after last scene can make anyone cry...
10.0~The End Is Near grumpyass Sign in Permalink Why must all good things end? Friends is a great funny show. I love it. I always watch it on TV on Thursday nights, and I end up watching reruns over and over and still laugh as though I had just seen it. I am now buying the seasons. I am up to season 4 now. I don't see why they want to stop making the show. Money isn't everything and they need to realize that. I wish they would consider a reunion show sometime in the near future. It wouldn't hurt them. Like an hour thing to bring back the memories. I love the show and certainly it won't die with me. As long as the seasons are out on DVD I guess I'll be ok. But why must you end? Please don't leave. I don't know what I'll do on thursday nights anymore. Maybe it's for the better, but think of the fans.
4.0~This Stinks! Stvdel2 Sign in Permalink Ranking Friends four stars at some point years ago, and I think I was being generous.When the show was on the air I called it three stupid girls, two stupid guys and a rat face. I sort of get the appeal. The viewers of it during the day are today's parents of snowflakes. The dialogue on the show is interchangeable. Stupid people like that. You don't have to concentrate or get confused about the characters. What's the first couple seasons of Sunny in Philadelphia. If you really want to see house 20-something left wing idiots behave.
2.0~Seinfeld the greatest show there was and will be tssoccer5 Sign in Permalink I will keep it short ,friends is a very good show but to mention friends in a same line with Seinfeld is insult to greatest show ever anywhere on this earth Seinfeld and even from far away in India we love Seinfeld Friends was a good sitcom but certain characters like Rachael ,Joey and Phoebe were boring and irritating .personally in real life i will never want a girl like Rachael to be my friend .Joey had his moments but after a while his foolish behavior was not fun to watch,Phoebe was dull and her song smelly cat will make you to turn TV mute.i think strong points of this sitcom were the acting and characters of Chandler and Ross and Monica was average. This show could have been much better if there were no emotional and that artificial oohhhs and aahhhs dubbed when someone had to feel bad or happy for the characters and also plot or storyline was repeated too much , like many episodes of friends were a same movie each time having different actors .at last it could be said friends was very very good but in rankings of greatest comedies it comes 11th and first ten places all go to Seinfeld.
10.0~possibly the funniest and best written sitcom in modern times disdressed12 Sign in Permalink Friends is quite possibly the funniest and best written sit com of the modern era.this show is fantastic.great characters,great dialogue,hysterical comedy.i actually wasn't into Friends for the longest time.then,i saw an episode on TV and was hooked.i have since bought all ten seasons on DVD.besides just being funny,the show has an edge to it.sometimes it is even racy,but subtly so,because on occasion the characters would say or do something that made me think,hmmm,the censors must have missed that one.the show revolves around the lives of six twenty somethings living in New York City Their favorite hang out is a coffee shop called Central Perk(a great play on words)each of the friends has their own different personalities and quirks,which all mesh together perfectly.the show rarely delved into any serious drama,but it didn't need to.It's strength is clearly comedy.creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane hit gold with this series.Kauffman also wrote a majority of the episodes and Crane wrote a number as well.the show remained consistently high quality throughout its 10 year run,and the last season was more serious than the previous.if you want a show which will have you p---ing your pants and bawling with laughter,this is your show.
1.0~Unbelievably UN-funny slnv Sign in Permalink UGH.... I know I can't be the only person to find this show absolutely retarded! It was incredibly unbelievable and ridiculous even by comedy standards. I liked non of the characters and just hearing the song at the beginning of the show ruined my whole day. If I couldn't reach the remote in time to turn it to ANY other channel I became miserable for the remainder of the day.... I have no clue how this show was loved by many people. The only thing I can thing of is mass hypnosis honestly. Like with other shows like Desperate Housewives when one person says they like it they other will believe they do just to "fit in". I for one do not try to "fit in" and always tell the truth about how I feel about things. As for this show on a scale from 1 to 10 I give it a ZERO.
10.0~You are really can never have enough Friends!!!! adelinaforever Sign in Permalink Friends are definitely the best show ever! I love the characters, I love the jokes, I love that they all look like us which makes the sitcom more realistic. Monica,Rachel,Phoebe,Chandler,Ross and Joey every day face with the same problems that we do. Recently I bought DVD with all seasons of the show and every evening after a hard day on work I sit in front of the TV and just enjoying it! Friends help me to relax and forget about bad stuff. I'd like to thank all the creators of the show who had so many ideas and a really good sense of humor! And thank you for casting all these amazing actors who were all great playing the funniest characters on TV!!!!!
1.0~Lame orient_86 Sign in Permalink I just don't understand why everybody makes such a fuss over this sit com. Sure it's funny sometimes, but it's all bad! We can start with the cast and the acting: IT'S LAME! Did those boys and girls ever take acting lessons? If so, they must have had some pretty lousy teachers, because non of them can act. It's just constant waving and hysterical screaming and yelling. The producers should have hired clowns instead. And the actors got payed for that? And so many awards! Such a waste of time and money... And the plot. Does it say something? Well, yes, one thing - friends are very important and it's good to have them. And I totally agree. Sure, the atmosphere is warm and friendly, but there is nothing else they can tell. It's just sex, dating and stupid skeleton's coming out of Monica's stuffed closet. Just lame.
9.0~comedy friendship jwu1990 Sign in Permalink It is old but classic. You can't help laughing when you watch it, and you will not feel boring even you watch it again and again. It is really a release after a day's hard work. What's more, many Chinese believe that it's a perfect way to learn English by watching friends. Unfortunately, I only remember happiness instead of words. I like Rachel most and I don't like Ross very much, because it seems that he is a little mean and old-fashioned. One of his lines impresses me a lot: We are on a break! Joey is definitely a good boyfriend, but maybe many girls will not marry a man like him. As is known to all, Phoebe is weird and kind. Chandler and Monica make a lovely couple.
10.0~Awesome sruthishri Sign in Permalink Love the entire series... Very humorous and best entertainer... Each and every character in the series doing perfect work..... one of the best series till now... i personally love Jenifer Aniston and David Schwimmer they both make best romantic comedy pair...
1.0~It's just not Funny 95% of the time. curiousmolar Sign in Permalink It really got few great one liners. But that consist of only 5% of this show or even less. So, yes I don't find this show funny. But that doesn't mean that I don't like sitcom. I like Seinfeld and rest are too old for me to watch. Because of the Hype I thought that I would watch this show. And it would be Great. But, it turn out to be horrible. I didn't like Breaking Bad and Dexter. And now this. I think that I am running out of Hit shows. Actors are all great in this show. I guess that they all are not comedian. So, that i can shift my blame on writers. But again, it was a hit show. I Presume that people like boring or in case of Breaking Bad and Dexter (Very very slow) content.
10.0~Best comedy show ever made Kuusafiiri Sign in Permalink It's hard to say, what not to love about this show. Everything in on point, and every season is different and interesting. The characters are equal and they all have their own stories. I love the chemistry between the six main characters and I think that is why the show kept its charm all ten seasons. And I love the fact that the characters grow up during the show, but they still stay true to themselves of what they are. I watch the series at least once a year and I still laugh at the jokes. Sometimes I laugh before the joke comes, because I know what is coming next. At some point I thought that my favorites were Ross and Rachel, but actually they all are. I can't imagine the show without any of these. I remember reading somewhere that Chandler and Phoebe were supposed to be on the side, but I am so glad that they were as equal as the rest. The perfect combination of different characters. I have watched Friends almost 20 years now and I know I am going to keep watching it till the end. Friends just lifts your mood, if you are down and they are like your own friends you know well.
10.0~The Best! extratis Sign in Permalink An amazingly funny and refreshing sitcom- never get bored of watching reruns!
10.0~Best ever kutaymurat Sign in Permalink Best ever series before you die can see Acting so pure and naturel
10.0~Greatest Show on the Planet Earth Death-Walk Sign in Permalink I love this show! I have every single episode and watch as often is I can (much to the annoyance of my family). Now, I know loads of people think that Friends is the biggest pile of garbage on TV. These people say that acting is horrendous, which it's not. Maybe the story lines aren't very realistic, but the characters are not so overdone in the situations nor do the act as though nothing big is happening is rather large situations. They act (more or less) like regular people would. And then they target the jokes, when there's nothing to target. I'll give in to the fact that it's not polished, sophisticated humor and it's just slapstick comedy about sex, you know, jokes that you don't have to work to get. But all comedy's don't have to be like that to be good. I mean, face it people, if every single comedy out there was a 'The Office' we're not going to have all that much fun. Sometimes you just need to turn your brain off and enjoy some television. In any case, I don't care if no-one agrees with me because I think this show ROCKS!
10.0~A must watch series!!! ganguly_gaurav Sign in Permalink The series revolves around the lives of six young New Yorkers who are also the best of friends. The series has an incandescent sense of humor that runs during its entire run. A mix of sarcasm and quirkiness the series will make you laugh and cry with it. But what makes this series most authentic is the fact that you will realize that most of the events that happens in the series can be related with our own lives.Be it the romance, the friendship or the break ups you will go on a journey that will soon make you say, "What next?". The quality of the punch lines is a rare findings in the sitcoms that are made nowadays My personal favorite I would recommend it as a must watch for everyone.
10.0~getting better purple0pearl Sign in Permalink this show is definitely moving back up on my list. it started going slow for a while, but this whole baby drama (and joey and rachel) is making me step back and look at the show again in a different light. the show has come back to its comedic roots, where the little things are what drive the show... who can resist chandler and monica battling it out for the tub? yes, friends has come back home again... you've been missed.
10.0~Why people hate the best sitcom in history paaindo Sign in Permalink First off, I don't ever rate a TV show 10/10, but for this show it was easy to give it such a high rating.The reason I became such a huge fan of the show is because my cousin suggested to me that I should just skip the first season. So I watched the pilot and just skipped to season 2, after that I binge-watched the entire thing. When I had finished I went back and watched the first season, and let me tell you, if I had only season the first season, I would have stopped watching after episode 3. It was SO bad, the comedy was forced and unfunny, the acting was terrible (leaving out Matthew Perry and David), and it was just boring. Not once did it make me laugh, which is what sitcoms are supposed to do. But the rest of the show was a master piece and to anyone out there who wants to know if the show's worth it, watch the pilot and just skip the rest of the season. It'll be worth it for sure.
10.0~Great comedy series eber e-99322 Sign in Permalink This is the great comedy series that I have ever watched.this is very heart touching
10.0~It's not only just a tv series its everything! manirsoffl Sign in Permalink This taught me how important the friends are in our daily life! Life is all about enjoying the every moment and friends are the only way to hide or forget our problems!! Just stop reading the reviews and start to watch it !!! Watching this will be the bestest moments in your life
9.0~Friends rules! Lady_Targaryen Sign in Permalink 'Friends' is one of my favorite TV series, and sure is in the top 3 of them. When the series started, in 1994, I didn't care so much about it, and even couldn't understand how everybody could enjoy Friends so much. When my father started to buy the DVDS,(last year) I could follow the episodes from the very beginning,and then realize why it makes so much success. Friends is comic, without forgetting of being also romantic,dramatic and ironic. It's great to watch when we are in a bad mood, because the laughs are guaranteed. :) I love all the characters, but I need to say that I Monica and Chandler are the best! Chandler is without doubt, the funniest of them all. Monica with her paranoid personality, besides the fact she doesn't accept to not be the best, always make me laugh. For everybody who wants a nice day, watch Friends.:)
10.0~A must watch harshmalu-49216 Sign in Permalink Awesome! Simple and sweet... Even after 14 yrs it just feels right for every mood, you're happy watch it., you're angry/sad anytime just watch it....
9.0~Best clean sitcom isaaccobrien Sign in Permalink I loved this show. I saw every episode 3 if not 4 times each. I will say I sometimes just want to buy all the seasons. I thought the cast is good. The acting was great. A good look at reality when you move out on your own.
9.0~Everybody loves Friends b_havag Sign in Permalink What is so great about this show is that it is so universally loved. Everybody has heard of Friends, I can't think of anyone who doesn't like it, and it's comedy is suitable for both sexes and almost any ages. Even my mom would like this show, and she never watches situation-comedies. Heck, she hardly watches anything American at all! And it's status is well earned. Friends IS very funny. Who can not laugh of Chandler and Joeys crazy situations, ideas and personalities? Who doesn't find Ross's dimwitted ability to make a fool out of himself funny? Who can resist Phoebes eccentricities? Everyone laughs when Monicas competitive instinct takes charge of the situation. And Rachel...yes Rachel. I just saw this episode where she had an infection in her eye, but refused taking eye drops. The other 5 had to bend her down on the floor to get the drops in her eye. That was a big laugh! In addition; Jennifer Aniston is definitely one of this earths most beautiful women, that should count for something to. If you asked the whole world what the best situation comedy is; Friends would win by a mile. 9/10
9.0~This is my generation Superunknovvn Sign in Permalink "Friends" is the TV show of a generation. Having rewatched all the episodes recently I was pleasantly taken back to my youth. In hindsight it's quite obvious why this show was such a success. Aside from the fact that all the main actors had an undeniable chemistry going on, the writers understood perfectly which fears and sorrows occupied young people at the time and incorporated them into the shows: fighting for independence from your parents and struggling to stand on your own two feet (Rachel), having to deal with your shyness and working in a job that you hate (Chandler), coming to terms with indifferent parents (Monica) or a troubled youth (Phoebe) or having to accept that your early attempts at starting a family already failed (Ross). Of course, "Friends" was not a downer. These troubles where dealt with, but in a light way. The Friends always had each other and their youth. They had trendy haircuts and made hanging out at the coffee house the cool thing for a new generation. The stories were charming, the jokes funny, if harmless. Maybe the show was a bit too clean cut at times (I'm referring to stuff like the inclusion of Hootie & The Blowfish), but then there were some naughty sexual references, too, especially in the early seasons. Cleverly, the story lines were always adjusted to the age of the characters, so audiences could grow with Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel and Joey. "Friends" was always something the dedicated fan could identify him- or herself with. That's also why the show maintained its high quality for most of its run  with the exception of the tenth and final season, where the actors wanted to move on, pushing writers to wrap up the Ross/Rachel-storyline quicker than it could have been wrapped up. Anyway, "Friends" has become a TV classic. It managed to capture the attitude to life of a whole generation. The final episode is very touching because when the Friends part it's like saying goodbye to a part of your own youth. Still, all things must pass, and I'm glad "Friends" ended on a very high level. Every generation has its TV show. This one is mine.
10.0~A show which brings out the child and friend inside us abhimouldable Sign in Permalink I found the show absolutely amazing and worth watching. The plot is not complicated and thus can be followed with ease. It is a kind of stress-reliever. All the main characters and most of the secondary characters are worthy to mend into the plot. The writing, plot twists, performances, comedy content, romance content are on point. It mainly give you chills and a feel-good vibe about the simplest, yet important feelings and aspects of one's life. It is 100% agreeable to youngsters. It showcases the best written and portrayed on-screen couples of the television history when you analyse them to the very core. It provides the best guidance and suggestions to dating couples. It focuses on the most important things in a relationship and signifies the need to workout a relationship depending on how each individual feels about the other when one or both of them are not completely over each other whether it may be a breakup or spat. There are many signature one-liners which are in- sync with today's lifestyle. It solidifies the fact that no matter how much humans evolve, there will be a part of them which never changes and which becomes the hallmark of each one's personality. It surprisingly makes one feel that maybe being friends with someone is much better than moving forward to becoming lover or partner. It proves the thought that no matter how much a couple care for each other, it doesn't always has to work out in the way they want it to be. Sometimes being good friends with someone washes away the thought of getting intimate with each other so that if they try to work things out, it gets weirder and weirder. On the other hand, if someone is not in a good friend zone,they might have a great chance of ending up together eventually because no one else can be better for them individually. It indirectly lists out the insecurities of every individual being in a relationship. It also lists all those things needed to gain your partner's love, in which we, humans focus on very few. It justifies the point that the heart always wants it wants. Overall, it is a great show which can lift your spirits high, can make you laugh and cry at the same time, can make you smile with satisfaction and merriment, can dig your heart deep and can make you remember it for a lifetime. I request the people who are reading this review to make the show a must watch, and to note the fact that i have watched it 6 times and it never got old!!!. Goodbye :-)
10.0~Overall: Fantastic, Brilliant, Amazing! nada_87 Sign in Permalink Wow! I really do not know how I will sum up Friends. I only started watching at some point in Season 4, but I was instantly hooked. Today I am the proud owner of the DVD box set which includes all 10 seasons. There are only a few shows which can successfully compete against Friends or reach its level of comedic brilliance. And the amazing thing is, it lasted 10 whole seasons with such an amazing consistency; without saying that the show did not grow or evolve. It has been an amazing ride throughout. These characters are so approachable and real. You can so easily feel for these characters that seem so genuine. The marvel of the idea; six friends, a gang in their early 20s supporting each other at the beginning of their lives; so simple, so truthful but yet so refreshing at the time. An idea that gave us 236 episodes! It's as the creators rightly put it, the period of your life when you leave your family, your friends become your family, before you return to family again, when you start your own family. And that is how the show ends. The actors were amazing from the onset of the show and I really do not see how any one of them could be replaced with someone else. These six people were just right for each other! They mix so well and play off each other even better.. one feeds off the other! They all are great comedians but pull off the drama amazingly as well. Of course a lot of the credit goes to the creators as well and the writers throughout the years. The comedy has been I-can't-stop-laughing-somebody-please-help-me terrific at points. There is one storyline though that I did not appreciate. I did not go along with the whole Joey-Rachel relationship. Given the history between Ross and Rachel, and indeed the Ross-Joey relationship and the characters at hand, this story is just for me something that would never happen. OK, I can follow up to the point that somehow Joey has a thing for Rachel. But Rachel (which has become a little more dumb unfortunately in the late seasons of the show) could not have felt anything for Joey! I mean, after all it is Joey! And even if she did, she gave birth to Ross's baby!! That is why I gave the show a 9 and not a 10. Season 1: Where everything began! Who can forget Rachel running into Central Perk during the Pilot? Great story lines throughout the season, with the Ross-Rachel story being put into motion, endless laughs derived from Ross's divorce from his lesbian wife, Ross's pet monkey. The foundations are laid for the characters we come to love. Favorite episode is the 'TOW All The Poker'. Season 2: The show continues its ride to the top. We finally get to see Ross and Rachel together, the funniest story being when Eddie moves in with Chandler. We even get guest star appearances from the likes of Julia Roberts and George Clooney. We also see the first of numerous outrageously funny flashbacks. Favourite episode: 'TOW The Prom Video'. Season 3: So many great episodes!! Where do I start and where do I finish? Truly amazing (how many times have I said that??). And not only the comedy. The show reaches a new high with the drama of the heartbreaking break up of Ross and Rachel which was so cleverly mixed with great comedy.Should I force my self to pick a favorite episode? For comedy: 'The One With the Football'. For the drama: 'TOW the Morning After'. Season 4: My favorite! So many laugh-out-loud episodes! The show reaches its all-time peak for me. Magnificent is to say the least! So much to say.. but not enough space! All time favorite episode of all seasons: 'TOW Phoebe's Uterus'. Season 5: We see the characters growing up; that is not to say that the comedy is any way diminished! With Phoebe giving birth to her triplets and the beginning of the Monica-Chandler relationship and its secrecy and the gang ending up in Vegas for the season finale, what more could you ask? Favourite episode: 'TOW Everybody Finds Out'. Season 6: The two-part episodes are the ones which stand out. Great story lines still at work with the fun still coming, in a rather renewed, fresh way in combination with the successful formula. Favourite episode: 'TOW the Proposal'. Season 7: The run-up to Monicas and Chandler's wedding brings out an even more control-freak Monica while other successful stories still run alongside it from episode to episode to supplement it. Favourite episode: 'TOW the Cheap Wedding Dress'. Season 8: This is where it goes a bit downhill.. it gets a bit more serious and the story lines followed move slightly towards those of a soap. Yet this season still has its moments, with Rachel being pregnant and the beginning of Monica's and Chandler's life as a married couple bring new adventures on the way. Favourite episode: 'TOW Rachel Tells Ross'. Season 9: The Slightly Disappointing One.. ending as it does with Rachel and Joey but other than that it still has its moments. After all it is still a season of Friends! Favourite episode: 'TOW Ross's Inapropriate Song'. Season 10: The end of an era! But it was time. I'm grateful that Season 9 was not the end and we are left with some truly fantastic episodes that take us back to those first season crazy episodes. Some of Season 9 is carried along but just at the beginning to end the craziness which was left mid-drift at the end of the season. Favourite episode: 'TOW The Stripper Cries'. This isn't a show to be missed! I have yet to find a show to fill the shoes of Friends
9.0~Happy or Sad ? labsw Sign in Permalink It's a wonderful masterpiece. A must to see if you have 24 years and you want to have an advance of what will happen to you in the next ten. It's truer than a reality. It's amusing and sad at the same time. Especially if you have the same age of the protagonists and you have seen all the ten years in few months. You notice of how much the time that passes changes to you. And it is what you happens to they that do the magic. The magic for some minute to feel itself in New York and having to decide with six friends what to eat for the thanks giving. It's hard to write a ten lines comment especially if you don't speak English like an English but i wanted to leave my contribution about something that has left a sign inside me.
5.0~Comedy - NO! Sitcom - YES! The Best - NO!! NO!! NO!! LilithAegle Sign in Permalink How dare they call this show a comedy, a comedy is something like Will & Grace, Everybody Loves Raymond the new show Back To You Friends is nothing but drama drama drama drama tear jerker TV series like the movie ET with funny moments. Yes there are funny moments, like eps The One With The Football season 3 but i wouldn't class it as a classic just funny moments, i have tryd to watch friends from the beginning but i seem to just get bored i don't hate show, i like the show however i don't think its the best or greatest sitcom out there however it is very entertaining if you want to cheer up on a raining Sunday or if your getting bullied at school and just want to watch a friends episode it will make you smile but not laugh out loud. The only character thats worth watching is Phoebe Buffay Lisa Kudrow she is just hilarious when she comes out with those words and the songs is just hilarious Phoebe is the only character worth watching second is Monica, third is Chandler Joey is the worst character out of them all and the most annoying. But still worth a watch but nothing to get addicted or excited too.
10.0~Only the best lilrabbitangel14 Sign in Permalink There's not one sitcom that i can think about that even come close to Friends. Its full of entertainment and the characters are so developed. Fans naturally becomes attach to the characters..Monica nd Chandler are just the cutest things. Ross and Rachel always find its way back to each other. When the characters are sad..you can't help but be sad along with them. The writing of the show is ingenious and everything about it also. I would stay at home all day just to watch Friends. Friends give you an positive and negative side on how life can be with real friends that really care about you. Thats the best part. ITs real, its funny, its Friends forever.
3.0~Just cannot watch more than ten minutes bobetjo Sign in Permalink Whilst appreciating there are many fans, I have tried to watch Friends several times since it started and has been repeated. Ten minutes has been the maximum before I turn off. I suspect thats if you like more thoughtful comedy like Frasier, early Big Bang or Parks and Recreation then Friends may not be to your taste.
10.0~Great show funny one liners and very talented writers wwematt Sign in Permalink Friends is a show that is extremely easy to love the acting makes you feel as if you're part of the 6 Friends living in Greenwhich Village New York. For me this show gives you everything that a sitcom should give you there's romance plot twists and lots and lots of comedy no moment is too serious and if it is it's followed with a funny one liner. This show gives fans a program that they can watch when they come home from work or school and just be with the friends, I absolutely love this show and you'd be missing a lot if you don't give it a try.
1.0~The 90's version of the art of Escapism. twinklestars16 Sign in Permalink Friends is about 6 Friends who live in New York and have to solve all of life's problems to sex, to relationships, to... well... basically thats what its all about. The idea contains the same old friendships, relationship, babies, love, marriage, job, and materialism. Nothing to contribute to society... never once I see the characters face real problems of debt, psychological torture, or identity crisis (Like Chandler experiencing what being Gay feels like for a day, or Rachel hanging with the poor. Or even Phoebe living in an asylum?) And about the racial cultures... Usually I never see them date anyone else other than a few colors to "liven" the space. Oh, the token black person that comes out one or two episodes is not helping either. Seeing as New York is full of culture, they made it look like the other races are not important. Their lifestyle is perfect. They crapped money out of their really low-paying jobs and spend most of their time well, sipping their coffee, stalking about that hot guy or girl and plans to bang them later to the episode, ending with a break-up for the dumbest of reasons. Aside from Chandler, their jobs are almost impossible to ask why their apartments costs more than what they earn. Well, Monica has "rent control" but hey... no one tried to kick her out yet... Ross is still controlling his money after all the divorces he has been in. Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe gave a speech on not taking charity, but hey, they suck the living breeches of the first three and claiming paying them back was almost impossible. Okay, off with the plots, let's go to the characters... Character analysis: Chandler - He is apparently one of the more humorous characters. He is a sample of a realistic person who we can hang out in the office or sip some coffee or something. I don't have problems with him and Monica together, to the dismay of all the true-blue Frendsian fans. Phoebe - I like her for being a bit different in the first few seasons... but then after a while, she started being horny, annoying, and kind of a hypocrite. Okay, so she has a hard life... but people like her in real life, struggle to be as normal as possible. She just left that philosophy behind because of it. It's not even trying until the tenth season or so... Monica - She isn't a funny character, but she has been a person who actually is believable in ways that she is right, and she is apparently the mature one. Sadly, she is usually looked down upon because her other Friends think that her style is annoying. Sadly, her baby-freak, "I can be like anyone else" philosophy threw me off after like season one. I always wondered why she wasn't kicked out of the circle. Rachel - I hate her. She hasn't changed ever since day one, to be honest. Her personality is this "Me-Me-Me!" spoiled brat who went to the city, and a few jobs and a million boyfriends later... it's still all about "Me!" The relationship with her and Ross was somewhat annoying for and a mood killer for almost forever, and almost in the last episode of the series, BANG! They're together again. Can Ross just leave or slap Rachel for all the horrible things she has done to him? Oh Noooo... because Ross is too in "loooove" with Rachel... Reasons were almost to no idea... Having sexual thoughts with Chandler and almost having a short, useless hit-off with Joey was also not helping. Ross - I pitied his first season philosophy and hey, I liked him for being at least sympathetic there... just that he had two additional divorces that he became a screaming, yelling, irritating person who is smart and intelligent, yet acts dumb and immature for his age. The whole Rachel thing is lost of chemistry and yeah, they were on a break. Rachel is apparently responsible for all of the things that happened to them and then claiming after the whole fiasco that the writers make it say that it's Ross' fault anyway for Rachel's doing. Ross would be better off on a suicide for being with a devil woman. Joey - Dumb Actor who doesn't do anything to contribute to society. Oh yeah, his spin off may be the worst thing anyone has ever made... Even if I can feel things from the characters. He is a handsome guy, that's a contribution right? And Him having sex with 500 girls is considered a real good thing. In general, actors have to research their roles, and Joey... he just swoops in Shakespeare because hey... He's an actor! To conclude, I have been annoyed by the show... and I get why people love it so much. It's the art of Escapism of them in a Fantasy world that makes everyone love them so. But sadly, I have watched shows that actually make use of real life as a humor tool that makes Friends forgettable for me. For ten years, nothing truly EVER happened.. and parodies like "Furends" are apparently more of a short version of the whole rant. A 1 out of ten... Just because I can't give negative number rankings. :(
10.0~My All Time Favorite esgio Sign in Permalink 'Friends' is one of my favorite shows that has aired. Even after its ten years of run time, I still have grown to enjoyed every moment of it. I first got introduce to this show through my older brother and when I first witnessed it, I thought, "What is so funny about that?" I was fairly young when I first watched the show, but as I grew older, I have seen more and more the episodes and I have just grown to understand the meaning behind some word or phrase that just got me crying from laughter. Till this day I re-watched many episodes and still laugh about it as if it were the first time viewing it. I do believe this show still has its memorable moments whether it be: Joeys favorite catch phrase, "How you doin'?", Monica's mother like personality, Ross's nerdy but likable side, Rachel's sensitive side , Phoebe's uncaring and crazy personality, and Chandler's 'cool kid' side. I would recommend this to about anyone in need of a show to watch. I know that there are more favorable go-to shows before this, however, it is still worth watching.
1.0~The show that made Full House look like I Love Lucy 3s2m Sign in Permalink How do I hate "Friends"? Let me count the ways: Firstly, it rated an "F" with the test audience (don't believe me, check The Smoking Gun). Secondly, it ran 10 years without being remotely funny ONCE (beating the record held by the completely laugh-free 8 year run of Full House, which, like this crap, was produced by a division of the Time Warner media empire, had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major American city, bland-looking guy of Mediterranean descent trying to get into show business, and a dumb guy named Joey). Third, that horrible theme makes NSync sound like The Beatles. Fourth, the cast couldn't act its way out of a paper bag (I thank one of the other posters for pointing out that Jennifer "I'm not a star, I just sleep with them" Aniston is Telly Savalas's goddaughter. Her father is also on Days of Our Lives. Can you say nepotism, boys and girls?). Fifth, the writers would eat up clichés like that last one I wrote as if they were brand new. And not only did they steal from the superior-by-default Seinfeld, they stole from Mr. Bean and even Punky Brewster! When Soleil Moon Frye, who really must have needed the money by that point, punched Chandler in the face, even that felt like a retread of a Punky episode where she punched Chad Allen in the face! Sixth, how can they afford an apartment like that in New York? They hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at Southfork. On other, superior, actually FUNNY roommate shows like The Odd Couple, Three's Company, Kate & Allie, and the grand dame of them all, The Golden Girls, they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent. I've seen fewer logical leaps on Gilligan's Island. What's worse is all the Emmies it got. Truly great shows like Bob Newhart's two classic sitcoms never won a single thing, yet this wins "Best" Comedy series. This show and Seinfeld (not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well) are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead (the last time sitcoms were declared "dead" in the early 1980s was a golden age in comparison to today). As long as there continue to be reruns and DVD releases of classic, pre-1990s sitcoms such as I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Soap, Cheers, Family Ties, Newhart, The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls, Married With Children, Roseanne, pre-2000 Simpsons, and countless others like it then I say let it die. This is truly the most vile, trite, unfunny, obnoxious television series of all time. I jumped for joy the day it was canceled, and I hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is, because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks.
10.0~A Masterpiece barca-01342 Sign in Permalink Even after all this years we've never seen something like this Show or even close to it, The greatest sitcom ever to be broadcast on a T.V.
10.0~Awesome! jr111192 Sign in Permalink I loved this show in fact I have every season and all summer long that was all I did was watch Friends. I am 13. Obviously this show is the best show I ever watched, or I wouldn't have watched it enough to see a picture of the show and I could tell you which season it is from. This show came out around the time that I was born so it's kind of weird that I would love it so much. I would choose to watch this over any other show that most teenagers watch. Sometime I even watch it on the computer while Im online and I end up paying more attention to Friends than to the rest of the screen. The ending just depressed me a little bit... I wish that they could have a spin-off with Monica and Chandler like they did with Joey, or one with Ross and Rachael... Or even if in the show Joey he went to see the others. I always go back to season one after I watch season 10. One time I couldn't stop laughing when I watched it, that was about 4-6 years ago when I started watching it. I'm going to watch it when Im done typing this, and I hope that by reading this someone else wants to watch it too.
4.0~Had its moments DarthBill Sign in Permalink The over extended story of six young people looking for love with the right guy or gal was funny for a while, but eventually ran out of steam. It boasted many memorable moments, but also plenty of groaners to go with it, usually in the form of various guest stars who's guest spots were pretty badly exploited and under utilized (like Bruce Willis, Ben Stiller, Alec Baldwin, Jon Lovitz, etc). Billy Crystal & Robin Williams had a fun bit once though, but Tom Selleck was the only guest star to have actually had a respectable character. When they came up with the Joey/Rachael storyline coupled with Rachael getting pregnant and giving birth to baby Emma, the wheels had most definitely fallen off the wagon. But then again, that should have been obvious from the 1999 season finale in Las Vegas. The only real highlight of that finale was watching the Rachael dis-robes and walks around naked in her apartment sequence, allowing everyone a look at the then 29 going on 30 Jennifer Aniston bear her 5'5" figure in the dark lit sets of Warner Brothers. The staff clearly spent the last of their talent writing that scene and Rachael's embarrassment at dis-robing herself even though there was no one around to see her naked and her quick adjustment to being naked in her home and the forbidden joy of it. 6 stars out of 10.
1.0~One of the most overrated shows ever made. roc5692 Sign in Permalink I have given this show plenty of chances but I always find myself wanting to commit suicide by the end. This show is just not funny. The characters are just so annoying and say and do just stupid things. Not stupid funny but just so dumb. People always compare this to Seinfeld. There is not comparison. Seinfeld will always be one of the most creative and funny shows out there. And not to mention the intro, so so corny. I just don't get the hype.I really gave it my all to watch but it just doesn't make any sense how it's so popular. Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer are also two of the most annoying people. There voices, faces and antics.
10.0~I Little Bit Spoiled astritveseli-690-466803 Sign in Permalink It's almost 10 years since Friends is of the air, but even after all the changes and the social networking revolution watching Friends it just makes you laugh, even you watch them for the 100 time. Friends it's the Best and the Funniest Comedy | Romance TV Show ever. It's not just about writing the funniest script, but finding the perfect actress to play the roles and using their unique personal features to develop and advance the show to a next level of TV Shows The actress playing the roles as Spoiled version of themselves, it's just made them very natural in the show. Ross and Rachel relationship it just made the show intrigue, "when they are going to break up, when they are going to get back together" it made the viewers to sit in front of the TV before the show even starts. Friends was really 6 Spoiled friends massing with one another, this made the TV Show legendarily.
10.0~Absolutely amazing! leviathantv Sign in Permalink Writing this review,at 2013 I still hope to meet those guys in real life and shake their hand for what they gave me.So much joy and happiness. This show is about 6 best friends and their lives. Six individuals Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer that were meant to play those roles.I can't think of any actors that would fit these roles better and I don't think there will ever be! Let alone the casting was superb,the script and those punch lines are still the source of TV-shows that try more or less to create something similar. I can't express how much I love those guys and how much I miss this show but I can guarantee to all viewers that have not seen it yet,that you are missing THE BEST SHOW ever created! 10/10 and I really hope all the people that contributed to this to be as happy as they made us.Thank you!
10.0~Just the best emilymccarthy-93092 Sign in Permalink No words than than: the best, simply, I don't expect anything better to come along in my lifetime, therefore, it's the best.
2.0~Funny huh? rwiggim Sign in Permalink Perhaps if you find shows like "Everybody Loves Raymond" and "Two and a half men" amusing you may want to add this dribble to your watch-list. on the other hand If "Arrested Development" and "Seinfeld" "30 Rock" and similar shows tickle your funny bone stay far away from friends. It is truly a thoughtless bore. Unfortunately I was subjected to his show through a particularly hot girlfriend and I can honestly say that in the 100+ episodes I waded through I only laughed once. I can't remember the instance but it was something physical that Joey did. The girlfriend, although smitten with the show rarely laughed more than once an episode. I gather it was more of a fairy tale that she could escape into than the comedy that drew her in. Popular rarely means good. See McDonalds.
10.0~A Very Good TV Show Abilimbi Sign in Permalink Each episode is very excited. It was funny and great tv show forever
10.0~Friends, Friends, Friends elizafitzherbert Sign in Permalink Friends is and always will be the best t.v show ever! I was at least 5 episodes a day and even though I can say the words with them, I still laugh hysterically at every joke! I don't know one person who does not like this show! Plot: Rachel Green, spoilt girl, who relies on daddy's credit card leaves her fiancé Barry at the altar. She runs to her old friend Monica (high school friend). Monica puts a roof on her head and lasts for 10 years. Monicas has a brother Ross who Rachel ends up going out with on a on and off relationship. Chandler Ross' best friend from college lives across the hall from Monica and has a roommate called Joey. And its hard to put Pheobe in as we don't really know her history but ... Shes in the group too! LOL Hard to explain but just a caring group of 6 friends who spend their life gossiping away in the coffee house, Central Perk !
1.0~the 90's personified... millerman378 Sign in Permalink A female friend once asked my why I never watched FRIENDS. After all, I was "twenty something" when it came out, so she naturally assumed I would identify with the characters. I gave it a chance. I tried. My biggest problem with the show was it's TOTAL preoccupation with sex and the kind of shallow materialism that plagued so many other "comedies" of the same era. I then asked my female friend why she was such a HUGE fan of FRIENDS and her answer summed up it's vapid appeal PERFECTLY. Every week the show transported her to a world where the people were MORE attractive, MORE successful, and MORE humorous then her own friends, and she truly believed it was a kind of blueprint for life. The show was safe and cute, and nobody ever ACTUALLY got offended. How pleasant. How noble. How bland. How forgettable...How SERIOUSLY delusional. Watch FELICITY reruns instead. It's FUNNIER and more REALISTIC. No stars.
10.0~The Greatest Show Ever!!! cosmopolitan499 Sign in Permalink Personally I get rid of all my tension,stress when i watch the show. There isn't a single episode i doesn't like. All the 10 seasons are great. It gives our life back.It shows us that there's lot in this world for living. A must watch.While watching the show i always feel like i wish i have those friends. I like Chandler very much,especially his "hi5".Joey's "How u doing?",Phoebe's "Smelly Cat".Monica's food,Ross's paleontology classes and Rachel.......I miss all of it and I miss this show a lot.And also the comedy in this goes great season to season.It'll be good if they make a film on it.And that's why its the greatest show ever!!! Friends'is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.
10.0~Friends for life utkarsh-00205 Sign in Permalink This is a detailed review of my all time favorite sitcom Friends. And I wish you find it interesting. Starting with the direction: This sitcom had been directed by Martha Kaufman and Bright, some of the episodes were directed by David schwimmer ,more famously known as quirky Ross Geller to us. The director has done a commendable job .He knew exactly the amount of time to be given to a particular actor, the timing of each and every moment in the show is perfect.The best part is that one can relate to the show.The directorial work is flawless.The combination of actors chosen by director is irreplaceable. Moving on to Story: Each and every episode of this show is gripping. You laugh, you cry, you even feel angry (I mostly felt angry with Rachel).This story is a tremendous blend of emotions. Story writer knew what and when a event should take place (Spoiler: Take for instance Monica and Chandlers affair or Ross and Rachel's break thing or Joey's crush over Rachel).Last but certainly not the least the way they ended the show (Only tin hearted man couldn't have cried in the finale). Next on the list is Acting: Can there be a better cast?!! Certainly not, Chandler as sarcastic as ever (BBT Lovers Sheldon is nowhere near Chandler).Very well played by Matthew Perry.Matt Le blanc plays Joey. Joey is kind of dumb but sweet and cute. And certainly Chandler and Joey,s bromance is one pf the things that I can never forget. Then there is Monica Geller played by Courtney cox. She is an actress of her own class. Monica is kind of bossy, kind of has an undesirable need of pleasing people (Well She can never be wrong!!!). I personally think Courtney was the best actress in the show. Then there is our unique or more of weird Phoebe played by Lisa Kudrow. Phoebe is kinda weird but is the one with highest of the values in the show. And I guess there couldn't have been a better partner then mike for her. Then its Rachel Greene (I personally hated her personality) played by gorgeous Jennifer Aniston. Though she was kinda mean but yet she was the most courageous among others ( I felt it when she was ready to raise Emma all on her own or when she left the altar at her own wedding with Barry). David schwimmer has given one of the best performance on the show as Ross Geller, the quirky but a simple and a caring guy. Though I felt he was insecure about his relationships ( When Rachel became friends with mark ) or when it came to the friendship between Chandler and him or Joey and himself. The final verdict is its the best sitcom ever. Again you will love them, hate them, cry for them and I thing somewhere in your subconscious you will feel inspired by them and yes they might actually make you feel great when you feel sad. P.S: The character development is one of the best things of the show "I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU...................."
8.0~Still holds up! seinfeldbenes11 Sign in Permalink I just finished re-watching Friends on Netflix, and I must say that the show still holds up pretty well. The first five seasons are undoubtedly better than the latter-half, which is more dramatic than the first seasons, but overall it's a pretty solid show. The show was never as intelligent as Seinfeld, but the chemistry between the actors compensates that. My only complaining are the homophobic and sexist jokes. I know that the show is product of it's time, so I don't feel particularly offended, but I must say that Seinfeld which was from the same era, has aged far better than Friends on this regard(not that there's anything wrong with that!). Seinfeld didn't rely that much on gay jokes, so it has aged far better than Friends, other than that, Friends still is a pretty solid show.
10.0~Hilarious, Funny, Amazing, Worth Watching tauseefkhan99 Sign in Permalink I just finished watching 10 seasons of FRIEND. It touched me so much that i wanted to appreciate it. It does not feel good that it,s finished i wonder why they stop making this i mean you don,t want to stop watching this. It,s so hilarious that you can,t stop laughing at some scenes. It,s the best comedy i have ever seen and wonder why i didn,t see it before. The characters are so attractive and the performance is so great that you start to feel for them. I am not American i did not understand some of the native jokes but still i enjoyed at thoroughly. My favorite character and i think the most funny was Joey, Ross was great i mean everyone was truly amazing i wish i could meet them all.
9.0~Love! gleekout29 Sign in Permalink I have to say I love this show and the cast my favorite would be Rachel and my least favorite would be Ross. I know Ross had a huge part in this show but he was a horrible character.
10.0~Best sitcom ever!! I watch it at least once a year - start to end. abhishek-khare2012 Sign in Permalink Best sitcom ever!! I watch it at least once a year. From start to end. I somehow feel there is lot that can be related to from this series. And the fun they have which in turn viewer has is of the highest level. Ten year long uninterrupted coverage and successful telecast covers it anyway. Friends was a historic TV chapter. It had every thing for every type of audience. The cinematography improved with time. And direction improved too. The story line kept on audiences glued to this series. The connection between the cast characters was not parallel to any other sitcom. Hope it never ended or had little more to watch of it. So again, friends is the best sitcom ever!!
10.0~A great show! romansv Sign in Permalink I would say that "Friends" is really a "must see". It is really a great and hilarious show, and you never tire watching it! The characters and their development, the humor, the plot - everything leaves nice impression. Unpredictable changes in the plot sometimes really shock, sometimes make you smile. :) This show is kind, funny, realistic and it shows: "Life IS good, whatever happens!" :) The actors' play is great. Every character in the show has his own unique and unforgettable personality. And the situations are sometimes just ridiculous, that can make you want to laugh or to cry. :) So, every episode of the show is REALLY worth watching! You won't stop laughing and waiting for every new episode! ;)
8.0~Great in places, some episodes still hold up but other than that hasn't aged great blank_x_imdb Sign in Permalink Some episodes are better than great. I absolutely hated that they retconned things so that chandler and Monica were meant to be together, that was awful. Now, onto the characters: Ross - I didn't mind Ross as much as some people did, except the whole Unagi rubbish, that was bad. Rachel - Was annoying. Selfish, conceited, vapid, not funny Chandler - Everything positive people say about Chandler is true. Monica - again, very annoying. Bearable at times but ultimately ruined episodes. Joey - Joey was funny, and him and Chandler had great chemistry. However, there were times when it just didn't work(cow's opinion for example). Phoebe - Anyone who says Phoebe was likeable is wrong. She is one of the worst ever TV characters. She wasn't "quirky", she was weird. And don't get me started on the whole lobster rubbish. The only positive of Phoebe is Lisa Kudrow's performance is great
9.0~Best sitcom ever!!! geost-42645 Sign in Permalink By far the best sitcom of all time... Friends series had one of the most well built characters on a comedy show and the romantic part in it isn t an obstacle for a dude who hates love stories. Sarcasm is the main characteristic of friends
9.0~Six Friends, Ten Seasons, Unlimited Fun! marcus_stokes2000 Sign in Permalink *Friends Of SPOILERS* This show is the story of six friends, the sarcastic Chandler (Matthew Perry), the neurotic Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette), her nerdy brother Ross (David Schwimmer), Chandler's womanizing and not-so-bright roommate Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the spacey Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and the spoiled girl Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), and of their growing up into adult life. It has managed to stay funny for 10 straight seasons, while at the same time has kept its characters mostly rooted in reality and likable. That's quite a feat for a sit-com! And for us who watched the show in its original run, there is also the 'Nostalgia Factor' involved. Watch it and have fun! Friends: 9/10.
10.0~The best comedy tv-show ever aired on tv! jordanmolnar Sign in Permalink I LOVE comedies and I watch so many comedie series like modern family, how i met your mother, new girl, Brooklyn 99 but NOTHING compares to friends!! The best thing about this serie is that it's for all ages! I'm 16, my mom is 43, my dad is 51, my grandma is 68, my grandmother is 88 and we all LOVE IT! The acting is outstanding and you get addicted to the characters! And you wil laugh at least 3 times in every episode! You have Chandler: sarcastic and tries to be funny, and succeeds bc his jokes suck. Phoebe: is funny without knowing it, is a little bit crazy with a big heart. Monica: the mother of the grupp and keeps everyone together and has a little bit of OCD. Rachel: a little bit spoiled, shopping maniac, has the sarcastic bit like chadler and a sucker for romance. Ross: the nerd of the group and thinks he's the man all women want. Joey: the guy all women actually want. He's kinda stupid but has one of the biggest hearts of the group. This is gonna be a classic for eternity! You're gonna get addicted after the first episode, I promise!
10.0~The definitive sitcom...OK? THE One! leo_kontoulis Sign in Permalink I have to admit... I must have watched about 90% of all 'Friends' episodes on SKY when it originally aired and I loved every single one of them, apart from the last one.That one seriously upset me! Simply because it was the last one! Then I got the series on DVD, and during bouts of unemployment or holidays I would just watch them non-stop. This sitcom is just timeless as far as I am concerned!! :-) Even though I nearly know plenty of the dialogs by heart, I still break a smile at the best jokes!! The comedy is very well written and the actors just let it shine! After season 2 they meshed so well it was just inevitable the ratings went through the roof. If there are people out there that have missed 'Friends' just do yourself a favor: watch it! NOW!
9.0~Just wow. demakhatib-85882 Sign in Permalink One of my favorite tv shows. Couldn't been written any better, I just love watching every second. Great cast, great acting.. The only bad thing about it is that it didn't last more!
10.0~A fantastic show!! eldrimezini Sign in Permalink One of the best sitcoms of history...Friends is the best TV show I've seen in my life.It has it all.Fun,Romance and a fantastic cast.You can't say who's funnier Ross,Monica,Rachel,Phoebe,Chandler or Joey because they all have their characterstics that made that different form each other.And the jokes are very easy to understand and super funny.You have 3 jokes for minute.Except for jokes Friends shows us romance and how is a real friendship .It is a fun TV show that you can see with your family any time.I recommend it to anyone.
10.0~One of the Best Television Shows. Ever. cartman_kenny_clyde Sign in Permalink I do admit, when i first heard of Friends, i thought... wow another crappy cheap sitcom. When I finally saw an episode (nothing else was on TV) i flipped. The comedy in this show is excellent and the story is also good. If you haven't seen an episode and you think ye right, like a review will change my mind... just watch at least a few episodes you will laugh so hard $50. There are really sad emotional moments in friends, and in the same episodes they still have really funny moments. Give this show a chance if you think it is a crappy sitcom, cause it's not. Hope there is a friends movie!!! :D Friends has many funny characters: Rachel - The girl trying to live without her father and his big money, has a crush on Ross Monica - The clean obsessive girl who cooks a lot, sister of Ross Phoebe - The funniest character, just some random massager who is friends with the whole group Chandler - lives across the hall from Monica and Rachel with Joey, he is funny and messy Ross - The Palientologist who studies dinosaurs and is the funny nerd of the group Joey - The struggling actor who lives with Chandler, he likes to steal food from Monica and is kind of stupid.
10.0~The Greatest sitcom ever from across the pond? Mr_PCM Sign in Permalink Well what can be said about friends that hasn't been said countless times before? Friends has been analysed and dissected so often that it's a wonder that the six actors aren't covered in bruises! There is really nothing left new to say, so all that I can do is say it again in my own, inimitable way. Quite simply, friends is probably the funniest programme you will ever see. The jokes are exquisitely timed and thought out, and they do not rely on one kind of humour - there is witty one-liners and visual comedy, comedy gleamed from mere facial expressions and simply hilarious situations - well it is a situation comedy! The writers have managed to take the simplest situation - six twenty-something friends and their loves, careers, and family problems - and make something that is pure gold to watch. Each twenty minute episode is jam-packed with quality gags, and not a single episode goes by without a number of laughs to be had. The writing is top quality, the acting is flawless, and the outstanding cast is constantly backed up by a superb supporting cast and a roll-call of Hollywood (and British!) talent dropping by from time to time as guest stars. But where Friends' real success lies is in making the viewers genuinely care about its' six characters - we feel for them, we laugh with them, cry with them, and we grow up with them over the course of their ten years. We see the characters change, grow, evolve over the ten series, and while they change, they also remain at the core those same twenty-something guys we became friends with. Some say that the later series didn't have the same punch, or the same high quality of writing and performances as the earlier seasons, and to a certain extent this is true. The gags don't feel quite as tight or sharp in the later series as in those early lightning quick early season episodes, and the characters in some respects don't so much as grow as become almost caricatures of their former selves. The early personalities are still there, but grown out of all proportion. Joey gets unbelievably dumber, Chandler more and more sarcastic, Monica frighteningly OCD....you get the idea. They have become grotesque cartoon versions of their earlier selves. But yet, somehow, the magic remains. We still love them. And while the gags may not constantly stream at a dizzying height of quality towards the end, thee is still plenty there to make us laugh. And that is where Friends succeeds above many many inferior shows. It just tries to make us laugh. Occasionally we will cry, be shocked etc as well, but never forget that Friends is a sitcom at heart. Maybe it should have been finished a couple of series earlier, or maybe we couldn't bear to let it go. One thing is for sure, the departure of this terrific sitcom left one hell of a void in our programming. There will never be the like of friends again - though beware cheap imitations!
8.0~great!!!!! udarmohit Sign in Permalink After seeing every episode of this much loved sitcom i much say that the writers and cast have succeeded in making something that is not only humorous, but also forces you to care about the characters and what happens to them in the future. All six of the friends bring characteristics to the show that make the viewer feel like they know them. Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode. I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the show at series five but from then on i was hooked. I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone.
8.0~Spoiler ! candelaredfox Sign in Permalink I liked the show so much but what pissed me off is WHY PHEBE IS MARRED TO MIKE HE JUST APPEARS FEW TIMES IN THE LAST SEASON !!?? I SHIPPED JOEY AND PHEBE SINCE SEASON ONE BECAUSE THEY BOTH ARE IDIOTS AND FUNNY AND SAYING STUPID THINGS ?? but at least Ross and Rachel get back together and the show is really good worth watching it
10.0~Unlike many other sitcoms, this one makes you LAUGH!!! RunningFromSatan Sign in Permalink I could go through other sitcoms and go, "Ha ha, that was so funny, I forgot to laugh!" but this one is so funny, I don't think there was one episode where I didn't bust a gut laughing. Even though I'm young (born in the mid 1980s), understand many of the jokes on TV, and have no clue how adult friends get along in real life. But if this is really what happens, I can't wait! This show so funny, and I hope they go on for 50 seasons!
1.0~Don't understand the hype Electros Sign in Permalink To me Friends is the most overrated show. The humor is weak and unintelligent, and the characters try too hard to be funny and act like everything is la-la land. Other than these major flaws, the show is just missing something else that many other comedy's have, and I think it's the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor. Other shows like Weeds and The United States of Tara are comical, but also have a strong plot and theme. I think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable, but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and society's problems. Even shows like Arrested Development and Grounded For Life apply more to the "good comedy but strong plot and theme." And if the writer or director's goal was not to have a dramatic plot, then they should have some warm meaning to the show. For example, Full House, The Nanny, and Golden Girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages. The importance of family support in Full House, how true friends will always help you in Golden Girls, and how a full-time care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as The Nanny. I think Friends tries too much to be like a Seinfeld for teens and young adults. However, Seinfeld has much better writing and humor. Every time I watched this show it always ended up boring me. I really don't understand why people like this show so much where there is so much better comedy television out there.
10.0~Just one of the best gere-c Sign in Permalink One of the best sitcoms of all time. Not only the laughts and the story that hooks you for ten seasons, but also beacause your sitcom style (just like Seinfeld) influenced many current series. Friends, overall, it's great, know addict the person to watch and enjoy a good comedy, often without much intelligence in the plot of the question (often), just jokes and funny scenes (yes, often forced, unfortunately), which make you laugh every time assists and retrace. As well as have their smart episodes, crucial (in a matter of history) or extremely touching, because of relationship it creates with the viewer. Of course, this all depends on your liking style, a lot of people do not like Friends and i understand why. Everyone has a preference, often sets that are more focused on jokes and funny scenes do not like because they are not like the person. So it's nice that you identify with this kind of series, and if you identify yourself, and if you are not those who like that ridiculous strife between Seinfeld x Friends, is sure you gonna love Friends and will mark your life.
10.0~Best sitcom till now mohitdhere Sign in Permalink 24 years back this all started. Even after this long period it is and will be one of the best sitcoms. No one can forget these six people who actually became our F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Do watch this show atleast thrice in your life because once you begin u cannot stop
9.0~The end of an era! ks4 Sign in Permalink Friends For 10 years i've lived with this show, as far as i can remember back i have been watching this once a week, taped a lot of episodes and collected them, this is by far the best tv show i have ever seen, and i ask myself now, will it ever be beaten? I think personally, no. Never have i been able to identify so easily with characters of a tv-show, never have tv-show portraited things without a deeper meaning with such excellence, this show is basically about the general life of 6 friends, and it works so well, even without a moral backbone, it just flows, it is perfect. Having just watched the final episodes, i must admit, i cried, not so much because of a sad episode, but mostly becuase i was thinking how this ended an era, an era not only for me, but for many people out there who has come to love this show. Over the years there are so many great moments to think back at, i've come to love all these 6 "fictional" friends, my weekly friends on tv. And man will i miss this show, it's unbelivable, over the years we have gotten to know these persons so well, we have laughed, cried and felt with them, this is a tv show that should never be forgotten. Besides this i don't know how i would describe the show, there aren't really any words for describing it, it's the best show ever, that's how i feel, and i'm very sad that it is over, but i think they ended it well. Now i will collect the DVDs.
9.0~How can you not like this show? lrobinson7 Sign in Permalink It's one of the simplest ideas for a show- just 6 friends who share their lives together. But that is part of what makes it so wonderful. The 6 friends and actors have such a great understanding and connection with each other, it makes YOU want to be their friends. All 6 of them: Chandler, Joey, Monica, Pheobe, Rachel, and Ross, have their own personalities but yet still have that bond with each other. And also, because of the personalities being so diverse, it is quite funny. Chandler: I know he is usually the favorite of everyone, and yes, he is my favorite, probably since I can relate to him the most. I certainly use sarcasm a lot and see his point of view most of the time. Joey: He is the most childish out of the 6 but that's what you grow to love about him. Sure, he makes some dumb mistakes, I'm not gonna lie, but there's still a certain cuteness about him you can't deny. Monica: I relate to Monica quite a bit too, from her competitiveness, to her OCD cleanliness everything has to be perfect. Sometimes that works in her favor and other times, not so much. Pheobe: While she can be completely blonde at some times (No offense meant, I am blonde as well) she is most-likely the one who's the most wise out of all of them. Having grown up on the streets she isn't afraid to defend herself, yet is such a caring and gentle person. Rachel: I find her to be the most annoying mainly because of how selfish she can be but there are times where I agree with her 100%. And she DID make it without her father's help. Ross: He can be whinny and needy however, there's still something about him that you can't quite place but that makes you want to see what he'll do next. Overall, this is one of my favorite shows to watch. In the entire 10 seasons they never run out of hilarious jokes, fabulous story lines, or those special bonds that make a friend.
10.0~It is so good even after all these years mugs-m-k Sign in Permalink This is the best TV series ever. I have watched this thousand times, except for the last episode. I can't watch it as it ends.
10.0~Great great happiness watching this!! qutaiba_zz Sign in Permalink This series can be described as cure for depression :)
9.0~I wish to live in the World of Friends harishprakashhp Sign in Permalink I regret having watched all the 10 seasons of Friends in a span of 8 months when the truth is it should be in a span of 10 years. The regret is purely due to all the pleasure I immensely enjoyed during this period. I and my brothers saw nothing else but Friends. We discussed nothing else but friends. Summarizing this 8 month period of bliss we lived, laughed, lamented with Friends. If you have continuously watched 8 episodes without an eye blink you'll understand the level of obsession I went through. If I pick my favorite character of the 6, it'll be criminal injustice on my part since I enjoyed and loved each character with all my heart. Ross's the geeky dinosaur lover. I just loved the turmoil of heartbreaks he goes through with Rachel. As a doting brother of Monica, their affection towards each other is exemplary. Lesbian wife, English wife, Rachel as wife- All ending in divorces. Doting Father of Ben and Emma. Chandler Bing, oh I just love this guy's sense of humor. To be able to find a joke in all situations does make him the Funny man of the group. As Monica's Husband, could there be a lovelier pair. They were a perfect couple in happiness and hardship. Chandler-Joey friendship and attachment is soul stirring. They are exactly how I wish to feel in midst of my friends. Oh My God!!! Joey  Howyou doin?- the line that makes girls fall for him. His characterization of a aspiring actor. He is exact opposite of Ross (know it all)  know it none. But he is the favorite of the other 5. They all care for him and his success. Loves Sandwiches and Sex. The part he falls in love with Rachel was incredible. Rachel the star performer of the show rises from a rich spoilt kid to a wonderful mother. I can't imagine her in any other role other than the character she portrayed in Friends. Ross's dream girl, Monica's best friend. Monica the Chef, the Obsessive cleaning disorder, the obsessively organized military regime following lady. Phebe Buffe, the street raised lady. Her view of life is simply out of the world. She is completely wild. Such a misfit ting fit of the group. The awesome acting as pregnant women when she was really pregnant deserver's a standing ovation. I wish I could keep seeing the episodes all my life with the characters not aging one bit. All good things have to come to an end. So did my relationship with the greatest TV show on earth Friends.
10.0~You become friends with them emeliean Sign in Permalink This is one of my favorite TV-shows ever. Cast is great as well as script. It's about six people in their 20s living together in New York. You get to follow their job lives, family lives, love lives etc. It's comedy, called a sit-com so most scenes are taped where the protagonists are sitting in a couch or such. It is an American masterpiece. I could describe this show forever and go on and write about how much I like it but why waste time reading MY review with my opinion when you can create your own opinion by watching the show yourself. Go on. Watch it. Go meet Monica, Chandler, Ross, Joey, Rachel, Phoebe. Go make some new friends.
1.0~Wow ! This show is nothing but crap . Rectangular_businessman Sign in Permalink "Friends " ,a idiotic show about a group of(unfunny ) morons that talk a lot of stupid (and unfunny ) things that nobody will say in real life. Basically it tries to be a adorable romantic comedy ,but the whole result is just annoying ,inane and unrealistic . This show isn't charming at all is just stupid . I can't believe that some people compare "Seinfeld " with this monstrosity . Just to comment ,here are some differences : 1- Seinfeld is funny , Friends is not funny at all . 2 -Seinfeld is clever , Friends is only stupid . 3- Seinfeld characters are likable ,Friend characters are annoying (and unfunny ) Please ,don't think that my hate is to the members of the cast (unless they collaborated to made the horrible script ) ,is just that I can't believe that a show so bad as this could last so long ( I just see some episodes of the first and the second season and I hated it ) Did I mention that it was unfunny ? This show was the most overrated thing on television.
10.0~The best series ever made sonamsikka_87 Sign in Permalink You laugh, you cry, you grow with them. It made me laugh so hard all the time. And the end is so so emotional.. This is just the best show ever made. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
10.0~Amazing sitcom. vczar95 Sign in Permalink Arguing on which show is the best I would always say Friends. Seinfeld, Sex and the City, and Scrubs are very well made shows but still are nothing in comparison to Friends. Every thing they depict in the series is relatable to everyone. It does more than entertain, it shows us scenarios that we go through everday, and helps us get by. With its amazing writing and fast pace, not once do we ever get bored. The cast of Friends is amazing. Each character brings something unique to the story. They all manage to make you feel for the character and hope they make it through the problems we all go through and see ourselves in. With great performances everyone of the cast shines and no character is flat. With clean dialouge, everyday matters, and lovable characters this show manages to reach to all its audiences and i highly recommend it to anyone still wanting to enjoy a great sitcom.
9.0~Great comedy, ok drama benowen-91207 Sign in Permalink Friends will always have a place of some of the most iconic and funniest jokes, whether it's Janice's laugh, chandlers sarcasm and nearly anything involving Ross is a win I was originally going to hate on the latter seasons on the show but that really isn't true, the show is just as funny as ever in those seasons. The characters on the other hand or not. They dumbed down joey, made Monica more obnoxious and really normalised Pheobe. But the real problem is the drama which ok at best and just awful at worst (the exception was the 'we are on a break drama' that was great) I still love this show and I always will quote it but if the drama and characters were better in the later seasons, then this would have been an easy 10
9.0~Fantastic but isn't aging well. nate-windsorgp Sign in Permalink You can't go wrong with Friends, especially between series 1 and 5. But there are certain things that haven't aged well. The look and feel of the show. The cultural diversity or lack there of. The fat shaming and attitudes towards being a lesbian. Don't get me wrong it's nothing malicious but it stands out like a sore thumb these days. All in all though it's superb, fun and the 90s were a safer time we can escape to.
10.0~One of the english comedy ever ak-68446 Sign in Permalink As the title say one of the best. If you have good or little sense humour then perfect show for you and must watch for the people who enjoy comedy. Few episode are enough to make you addict to the show. Pls do check some episode. My fav is chandler:-)
10.0~Perfect melizsabonghn Sign in Permalink I don't go by a day without watching friends. I watched the whole 10 seasons for the 8th Times now and yes I can remember almost every line and I still love it. Also. Thank you for hiring Matt & Lisa.
10.0~Easily One of the Best Shows in The History of TV! powermandan Sign in Permalink If somebody says that Friends is the best TV show ever, my sense of disagreement would be minuscule. Personally for me, Friends is a contender for the best, definitely top 5. Many people do not like sitcoms, but everybody loves this show! There was many copycats afterwards, none of which equalled the original. Twelve years after its cancellation, everyone still treats Friends with the highest honour as they did back in its heyday, which was all ten seasons. Friends deals with the escapades of six best friends living in New York City. Courtney Cox is excellent as Monica Geller, a chef who is a neat-freak and perfectionist. She was also overweight in her childhood, which is often what people make fun of to her most often. Jennifer Aniston's breakout role was the daddy's little girl Rachel Green. She moves back to the city in the premiere after walking out of her wedding, and she slowly rides up the world of fashion throughout the rest of the series. Lisa Kudrow's best performance she has ever and will ever do is playing the former street-thug-turned hippie, Phoebe Buffay. Phoebe is a masseuse and aspiring musician, who has the saddest backstory, but humour comes out of it in the best ways. Ross Geller is the role I will always see David Schwimmer in. He is Monica's geeky older brother who holds a Ph.D in paleontology. He works at the museum then as a professor at NYU. He marries a lesbian and has a son with her, but she doesn't find out her true sexual nature until sometime after she got pregnant. Matthew Perry plays the hilarious Chandler Bing, who is more subtly funny to the point where people don't get his jokes. He has a weird marketing job he hates, but keeps it due to his talent and multiple raises. Matt LeBlanc plays the group's idiot, Joey Tribbiani. Joey is a talented actor who would have been more successful earlier if not for his stupidity. He loves food and women, but is very well-meaning. One of the best things that happens in the show is that the characters stay themselves throughout the show and the main characters comprise of just the six of them. It happens all the time where characters change styles. For instance, in Three's Company, the character Chrissy goes from being a beautiful dumb blonde to a very juvenile girl. And the characters in Friends remain played by the same people. I hate when shows change actors. And the pact remains just the six of them, with the opening credits comprising of just our six leads. Nobody comes in and nobody leaves. All characters are equally involved in their lives in such significant ways throughout the series. Ross has had the hots for Rachel since high school, and they dates sporadically in the series. Chandler and Monica have an affair and eventually get married. More chemistry is shared so smart and so vibrant that makes for great viewing. Since the characters, consistency, and arcs were so good, it is only natural for it to become so beloved. Whenever I watch it, I feel so darn good! That must be the effects of other people too, given its popularity. These six friends love each other and I do too. They make each other feel good, and they make me feel good.
2.0~Torturous NJtoTX Sign in Permalink This is a show for GenX-ers who are still clinging to their fond memories of the white-bread Brady Bunch. I tried, really tried, to like these characters and get past the predictably-timed 'laughs.' And now, Friends reruns are sandwiched between episodes of the brilliant Seinfeld on TBS, but it's just another show - like Mad About You - to work at avoiding while trying not to miss Seinfeld. A tenth year. What a waste.
10.0~This is what sitcom means to the world tv_is_my_parent Sign in Permalink Friends is the most-known and most-watched sitcom with no doubt.What makes it that popular is its heart-warming creature, characters that are so close to you and great writing. All six actors are marvelous on their roles. Jennifer Aniston shows what a great actress she's by playing Rachel Greene.(she won a Golden Globe award with Friends)But now she's playing in dumb romantic comedies. Courteney Cox makes me laugh so much with her jokes (as Monica Geller). Phoebe is the greatest stupid person ever (portrayed by Lisa Kudrow). Matt Le Blanc is hilarious as Joey(even there's a spin-off called 'Joey). Matthew Perry is sometimes the funniest male character of the show (as Chandler Bing). David Schwimmer is kindest character and nerdiest character of the show (as Ross Geller). 10/10 Best Seasons:Complete Series (10 seasons)
10.0~We watch it on repeat. joshuamccullough Sign in Permalink This is our go-to show. We watch one or two episodes every night to wind down for bed. We've been doing this for probably 10-15 years, and have watched the entire series countless times! It doesn't get old. I don't know why or how this is the case, but it is!
1.0~The only person who dislikes Friends annaily Sign in Permalink I feel like the only person ever who just doesn't like Friends, but I honestly think it's the most overrated show ever. It's not that funny. At all. Yeah an occasional smile, but nothing hilariously funny, and none of the stories are funny either. 99% of the main story lines are about who's dating who, which is more like a soap opera than a sitcom. And the small, single episode story lines are just not funny. Think of Seinfeld's genius single-episode story lines compared to Friends, and it's like comparing wine and tap water. It's just not funny. The male actors aren't all that great actors, and this is evident by their lack of success after Friends. Cheesy and not funny with lame repetitive story lines about who's dating who. The only redeeming quality is that it is still exponentially better than the sitcoms that followed and the ones that are currently on today. None of them are funny, including some other modern "classics" like Full House and That 70s Show are intensely overrated and just not funny. Seinfeld and Cheers reign supreme, while current sitcoms continue to flop, with the exception of a few like The Middle (hilarious and perfect, but lost steam in the past couple seasons), Arrested Development, and maybe Modern Family... Maybe Big Bang's early seasons.
10.0~Best ever duckyduck50 Sign in Permalink This is the best sitcom ever. It's about friendship, live and expectations. It is about staying true to oneself, and most importantly, it is about staying true to your friends. It's about love, hate, jealousy, obligations, deception, astonishment, it's about the wonderful feeling of friendship, over and over again. You got acquainted to the personages as if you'd know them personally. You come to recognize them as friend and you'd come to get personal preferences. You got into the game as if it were your own... I'd say it is the most true sitcom as it addresses the most fundamental human need: friends. It is not about fanzy life, not about action loaded scenes, it is about weakness, strength, love and loyalty.
10.0~if I was to rate this TV series out of 10. I would give this a 10 for comedy and a 15 for showing us what real friendship is. Zz_movies Sign in Permalink This is without doubt the most funniest thing that I have ever seen. I don't laugh often because not many things I find funny but Friends will really put a smile on your face. Every single episode makes me laugh at least 5 times. If there is a person out there that does not laugh through out every episode I think that they deserve a medal of honor for it. It is impossible to show a straight face when you are watching this. At first they were all people that new nothing about each other but now that their friendships are strong. It makes it even better! This I would recommend to everyone in the world and I would like to see them make more of friends.
10.0~If You Expect to See Comedy with Some Tears.. watch this!!!! andresoean Sign in Permalink An exceptional sit-com, that can not be replace by any TV-SHOW. When i was first watching this show . All i just expected was a light comedy so that could kill my time whenever i was boring. But then as the seasons going up, everything changed.I then started to brought my emotional feelings, the show was beyond than just a comedy ... It started to tear you apart, drop you in tears. At least in my exprience, a guy who doesnt love romance-comedy at all , I cried like a baby. It's so rare to see casts that dives really deeply into their characters that you wouldn't be able see if this is a show or real life. It even changes a lot of my perpective about us, human. This show just shows me that people are so complex and complicated with all those various emotions, our life with people around us are meant to be sometimes rough and sometimes smooth. All we just need to do is to live up with that along with the emotions as we cant just expect our life with FRIENDS to be always happy. THIS SHOW NOT JUST GAVE ME ENTERTAINMENT BUT ALSO LESSONS OF LIFE at least in my opinion. At the end.. sorry if my english are messy i am not really good at writing.
10.0~All I can say is WOW!!! mlmrjforever Sign in Permalink This show has to be one of the best shows on TV! I love all of the characters in it (Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and finally Ross) and I love the live audience.Personly, I like Joey (Matt LaBlanc) the best because he is so dumb but in a funny way. I love how each character has their own personality. It clearly was a hit on TV! In season 8 I can't believe that Rachel gets pregnant and Ross is the father. Their life must be really complicated. I also can't believe that Chandler and Monica get married. The sad thing is though is that Monica can't have children and they have to adopt which is really sweet. Anyway all I can say is W-O-W!!!!
9.0~So no one told you Friends was gunna blow you away Darkside-Reviewer Sign in Permalink Friends is one of the best sitcoms of all time if you haven't already seen Friends then stop reading this and watch the first episode you will not be disappointed by it you will find a part of yourself in one of the six friends will you be a Joey a Ross who knows but soon you'll begin to wonder how you lived your life without Friends until now.
10.0~Not a series, something about your own life shafaat_shishir Sign in Permalink Watched more that 10 times, still feels new. A lot of thing you will see will match with you own life.
10.0~Best sitcom of all time cmburton-29875 Sign in Permalink I could write so much but this is the only show I can watch over and over again. It's the perfect situational comedy, timeless and perfect. Thank you
10.0~How you doin...? jay03893 Sign in Permalink This is one of the best TV show ever. Although it was made around one or two decades before it still doesn't stop making you laugh. Hats-off to Matt Leblanc's performance, man you are the king of humour your expressions, your timing perfect..!! I would say just one thing " How you doin'? :P All the other characters are also great. Once you start watching it you cannot stop yourself from watching its really adictive. be it the first time or tenth you will feel the same humour and have the same fun every time If you ever got free time and wondering what to do or wanna change your mood stop thinking and watch Friends.
10.0~Still amazing hammerchris15 Sign in Permalink Friends is an absolute classic. It's still so funny. You can watch it over and over. Even if you're just getting into the series now, it's still an all time favourite and you will not be disappointed. Growing up on friends, It taught me so much about life and you'll find yourself saying the catchphrases all the time. Each series just gets better and I'm so glad that there is 10 series but wish there was more. Pros: hilarious, lovable characters. Cons: not enough episodes. I think the only thing that comes close to friends is the bang bang theory. But friends is a Must watch, fans of Big Bang, how I met your mother and king of queens will love this.
8.0~Great chemistry SnoopyStyle Sign in Permalink Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is a runaway bride. She finds former friend Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) who lets her stay in her New York apartment. Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer) has a secret crush on Rachel. Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) are their neighbors. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is their eccentric friend. You can call it too fake. You can call it too white. But you can't deny its popularity. The show is about six friends in NYC. It's not much more. It doesn't have anything out of the ordinary. None of the Friends had much of a resume before this show. They were all new and fresh faced. Most importantly, they had chemistry together. The incredible popularity and the over night success really isolated these 6 and cemented them as lifelong friends. And you can tell they were friends. It showed on the screen for all 10 seasons.
10.0~Friends forever caterpillar_that_likes_movies Sign in Permalink First of all I must confess that I am not a big fan of TV-series, however "Friends" is an exception for me. Each of the numerous episodes contains a hilarious, funny, kind and sometimes touching story. When you watch "Friends" you forget about your own problems,you get so absorbed in it, that all your bad mood can go away. Besides, some deeds and situations can remind you of your own, and you can learn some very useful lessons. During these 10 seasons I can honestly say that I fell in love with all the characters, not to mention the main melody. I like them with all their different types of character, although each of them (just like each of us) is far from being an ideal. They are so different and interesting in their own way: sophisticated,nice but sometimes stubborn Rachel; charming Monica with her passion for tidiness; kind and a little bit weird Phoebes; not so clever but lovable Joe; shy, but romantic Chandler with his jokes; gentle, but proud Ross who always gets into funny situations. And how many funny and entertaining events passed through! Certainly, it is not a masterpiece of art, but if you want to laugh your head out, to feel the atmosphere of friendship and adventures or simply have a very good time, "Friends" are definitely for you! P.S. The only thing I want to complain about is a little detail. Minsk. People, it is not situated in Siberia or somewhere else in Russia! It is the capital of Belarus and it is a very beautiful and sunny city!
10.0~Best tv show.. krashnew Sign in Permalink Best tv show ever , you live with the characters every sec
1.0~The most over-rated sitcom of all time possibly Wickidforreal Sign in Permalink It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour. It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons. It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly. It is truly awful.
10.0~Changed the meaning television. tiger160297 Sign in Permalink This show is AMAZING! It's smart,intelligent,funny,popular,charming... It is just amazing how we fall in love with the characters and there odd situations. All of them are funny and unique in there own different ways. Rachel Green is the guy magnet and the "in your face" type of girl. Monica Gellar is the incredibly smart mother-type of character. Pheobe Buffay is the in a way stupid one which makes everyone laugh. Joey Tribiani is the little immature Italian kid actor sort of guy. Chandler Bing is the slow but positive guy who makes dumb look good. Ross Gellar is the very pathetic paleontologist nerd type of guy. Friends shows the good things in life and makes us realize that friends will always be there for you. I say this is one of the best shows ever to reach television. What would television be without it.
10.0~The adventures and love lives of six friends living in Manhatten, New York. ankitiitstar Sign in Permalink I have seen many sitcoms but none of them even compares to Friends. All of the six characters namely Chandler, Monica, Ross, Rachael, Phoebe and Joey are full of entertainment and fun. Each of these six characters compare to Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother for who 'Awesome' is the only word I have. Even though each episode has a different theme, the series has a definitive storyline which makes it even more interesting. The best part is the climax episodes at the end of almost every season which provide a magnificent end to the basic storyline of the season like the Monica and Chandler's Wedding etc which are generally emotional. Every character is so entertaining it is impossible to choose the best. Phoebe, however, is my favourite. Hats off to all the writers of Friends.
8.0~A Modern Day Saved by the Bell Jollycox Sign in Permalink I think of this show being a modern day saved by the bell. With Rachel and Ross being Zach and Kelly. You just know they will end up together. This show was Red-Hot to me its first five or so seasons. Ever Since Monica aAnd Chandler got together the show kind of fell apart and I have lost interest in it. But it is still the best show on TV today. And I will be collecting the DVD set.
10.0~Extremely clever comedy. Well worth watching. smile_its_sunday Sign in Permalink 'Friends' began in 1994: I was just three years old, and, as you will appreciate, not really at the right stage to watch it. By the time I was thirteen, and 'Friends' was almost finished, I was an addict. There is no other word for it. Let's begin by analysing why this show is so funny. On paper, it may not seem it - a group of good-looking white twenty-somethings, hanging around drinking coffee and dating. But when you look at the sheer skill of the 'Friends' writers, you have to see that this is truly comedy at its best. There are so many funny one-liners. Here, I think it would be appropriate to mention another user's comments. Someone said "there is endless laughter after every line... so it must be funny, right?". And the thing is, it IS right. 'Friends' is enormously funny, yet its humour is surprisingly hard to pinpoint. The characters are highly developed, and each with their own brand of humour (so there is something for everyone). Monica, the obsessive neat-freak with a burning desire for a family; Ross, her vulnerable elder brother who seems to be the quintessential family guy yet has trouble making a marriage stick (for various reasons which I will not go into at length - lesbianism being an issue here!); Phoebe, ditzy and blonde, yet with a deep and mysterious quality; Chandler, the underdog, with the highly developed sense of sarcastic humour which is the province of only the most maligned; Joey - sweet and dumb, but with a golden heart. And then there's Rachel, the spoilt brat turned girl-about-town, who never really realises that what she's always wanted is right in front of her. I am not going to deny that there are flaws in 'Friends' - the sentimental scenes do have more than a tinge of saccharine to them (I personally cannot watch the final episode without cringing) - and sometimes the storyline wavers a little. But the comedy - note here, the COMEDY, which is, as it should be, the essence of the show - remains intact, always. People are always ready to critise 'Friends' for one thing or another. But the truth is, and this is backed up by the sky-high ratings, that 'Friends' does everything a sitcom should do. And it's damn funny, with it. Thank God for DVDs and re-runs.
10.0~Everyone needs Friends. michalmuzik Sign in Permalink So, i recently saw Friends for the third time and i must say that this series is still perfect. For me, it's best sitcom i've ever seen. Imagine that you came home after really tough day at work or at school. You just sit on your couch and turn on the TV. Then you start to watch Friends and your day is way more better. I don't know exactly what it is. Maybe it's some kind of the magic. The series is pretty funny, jokes are simple and great. Scriptwriters did awesome job and the whole crew made unforgettable show. In the end i want to say that everyone needs Friends in their life and that Ross, Monica, Chandler, Rachel, Phoebe and Joey will be in my heart forever. Thanks, thanks for this special show. And of course Chick and Duck will be in my heart too.
10.0~You will laugh every time. nickilancaster Sign in Permalink Friends has to be one of the best sitcoms ever made, i just love it! I own them all in a box set and i just have to put one on and im instantly uplifted. Its so funny, the script is just amazing and all the actors play their characters so well, you really believe that it is true life and you really feel for the characters and the situations they all go through. From watching the show from the start to the end i really feel like i have grown up with them and gone through their journeys with them. Its just the best show and i love Chandler so much, he is just so funny and witty, they are all amazing in their own light. Well done for making one of the best things on t.v, i don't know what i would have done without growing up watching it. 10 out of 10.
10.0~I am not done with Friends! bio593 Sign in Permalink One of the best sitcoms out there...and my #1 favorite! People, we need more from our "Friends". I would love to watch a sitcom with Rachel and Ross married, with Emma (she should be around 6 or 7 by now, right?), maybe another kid or baby, Chandler and Monica visiting with the twins, Joey coming on weekend for food, Phoebe and Mike (oh, yes, and their daughter, "Sunshine" (or some other hippie name) dropping by.....come on!! please!!! I have seen the re-runs over and over and over....I already know even the lines! Do not get me wrong, I love them, but it would be more than great to get a come back, in new situations, but with the same people. I can help you to write the sketch if you want! :) but please, do it!!! We really miss them. Best regards!
10.0~Probably the last and the longest of the great network sitcoms AlsExGal Sign in Permalink Suffice it to say that Friends is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the "post-college adolescent phase" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you "settle down" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor. It follows the life of six young people living in New York City from 1994 to 2004, so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale, but the relationship truths never will be. Ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking. Ross' sister Monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school. Rachel has been Monica's friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddy's credit card when the series begins, and is looking for a career in fashion. Chandler, Ross' friend since college, is successful in his budding career in business. Rounding out the group is Joey, not the brightest bulb in the room, who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a TV show. Finally there is Phoebe. Her history with the group doesn't go much past the beginning of the series as she's had a rather Bohemian upbringing that has led to a Bohemian adulthood. Complicating factor as the series begins - Ross' wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman, Ross now and always has had a crush on Rachel who doesn't know he's alive, and Ross' wife discovers she is pregnant by Ross shortly after the separation. One of the best shows on TV with the most heart and the most laughs. Highly recommended.
9.0~Best TV Show nxpran Sign in Permalink This is the first TV show I have watched every Episode, every moment without feeling boring!! Even still now I am watching the old Episode again for the second time. I love Joey and Chandler so much!! <3 This is a full pack of laugh out loud. This is the best show ever. and before "Friends", the six actors who play the main characters were all unknown. Today, Jennifer, Courteney, Lisa, Matt, Matthew and David are six of the most known people in the world.
2.0~I really can't understand why people love this ILiveInTheMarbles Sign in Permalink No really, I don't get it. Why people love 'Friends'? It's one of the most childish show I 've ever had the mischance to watch it (I lied here, I watch it because I wanted to - I want to see what others found funny). First of all, the annoying laughter in the background every time an actor says a line is just stupid and annoying(in every line?) and spoils everything, even if it were an actual clever line. That means they point out the 'funny part' so the viewer knows where is the joke and laugh like a programmed robot. It is moronic to laugh when someone hint the funny part, think about it. Secondly, every character behave like a little child. I can't see any adult behavior here. Have you ever see a woman with a decent amount of IQ in her head, to try catch the flu because they told her that she sing better with a gruff voice? And not just that, the director loved that part and decided to repeat it scene after scene! Stupid exaggerated pointless jokes every two seconds by people who can't really act and make childish comments and grimaces all the time. Maybe people like it because its cool to memorize the 'funny' (I wince every time I write that word here) phrases. But if they repeat it few times in their head and actual think what they are saying, they could easily understand that's just plain moronic. But the laughter in the background make them laugh like idiots because they told to do so. I will never understand it. And i don't want to.
10.0~Best Sitcom Ever kamranksabir Sign in Permalink I used to see people talking about Friends all the time but I never got the chance to watch it. One day I was bored as hell so I searched some funny moments of friends and next thing I was watching the first season. More I watched more I fall in love with their chemistry, comedy . Now I am mad about Friends and I know that I will be watching this again and again for the long time. All episodes are best but I will not watch the last 2 episodes ever because they make me sad to see they are drifting a part. I wish they have shown a clip of them hanging out again with their children and having same fun at the end. Joey doing what he does best chandler throwing his best sarcastic jokes. However I love friends, My favorites T.V series spot has been filled I am sure that it will never be Replaced.
10.0~I will never stop watching this show. kpmetalqueen Sign in Permalink Much like The office, I find myself going back to this show over and over again. Never disappoints.
10.0~This show left me in tears tharaka1997 Sign in Permalink Contrary to my summary it did not make me cry when I was watching it, but when I watched the last episode of the show. This show is truly one of the best things that you can witness on TV. The actors are all hilarious in their own way and that just makes you love each of them for their uniqueness. This show has been going for 10 years strong and I enjoyed it a lot. I managed to watch all 10 seasons in a bit more than a month. Unlike many shows they quit while on top and that is a very bold move and one that I respect. So what did I do after I finished watching it? Well I re-watched all the ten seasons again of course :D
10.0~One of the best things there is Necrom8 Sign in Permalink I started watching them in the 97's but didn't got in to them until that much until the year 2000. I loved them so much that every time I sow a new episode I asked my self what em I going to to when It end's.I have seen every episode many times and I have never yet seen anything as good as this show. Although I love shows like: ,,my name is earl,scrubs,The IT Crowd,Monty Python's,house and lie to me'' they still do not come close to friends.The comedy is excellent and the acting is amazing. It's not until recently that I heard that many people compare It to Seinfeld. I was shocked. Seinfeld isn't that funny compared to the shows like the ones I already mentioned (My name is earl,scrubs,The IT Crowd,Monty Python's,house and lie to me) but to compare It to Friends. The other thing which is great about friends is that the are a lot of guest celebrities on this show like Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and a lot of others.It is a show funny for viewers of any age and to me It still continues to be the best show so far.
6.0~It isn't good alexzeashops Sign in Permalink This show is so overrated I mean what was the hype. Why did Netflix pay so much I don't understand .It so basic .It was never a good show.
10.0~The Best Sitcom Ever To Grace The TV Screen! animalmad9 Sign in Permalink I'm Sorry But Everyone Who Says Friends Is 'Just Another Sitcom' Are Totally Wrong. Friends Is Possibly The Greatest Sitcom To Ever Hit The TV Screen! The Charocters Are Brilliantly Acted And The Story lines Are Very VERY cleverly Written. Each Character Has Their Own Way Of Being Funny, And Successfully Achieve It. Joey Tribbiani (Matt Le Blanc) Relies On His Mistakes And Cuteness To Be Funny. This Works Because He Is Acted Out Superbly By Matt. He Is The 'Babe Magnet' Of The Group But Has Never Had A Real Lasting Relationship Before. Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) relies on Other People Mistakes And His Clever, Ever So Slightly Sarcastic Remarks To Achieve His Goal. Again The Same As Joey He Is Superbly Portrayed By Matthew. Dr. Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) Relies On His Intelligence To outwit His Other Friends. His In And Out Relationship With Rachel Is The Main Part Of His Character. The Main Joke Which Never Fails To Get A Laugh Is His 3 YES 3 failed Marriages. Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) Relies On People Making Fun Of Her Cleaning Arrangements. Her Character Is Portrayed With A Slight Romance Aspect. She Is Constantly Mocked By Her Parents (Elliot Gould & Christina Pickles) About Her Failure At Getting Married But Ross' Success, If You Call It Success. Rachel Greene (Jennifer Aniston) Relies On Ross Mainly To Put Her Jokes In Place. She Frequently Places The 'We Were On A Break!' Line Into Many Different Situations. Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) Relies On Different Situations For Humour. To Me She Is Probably The Best Acted In the Show. Personally, I Rate Friends 10/10 For Superb Acting And Inch Perfect Scripting.
10.0~I like the aabbd-27697 Sign in Permalink Love is the only thing I have ever done before and it was my fault I had
9.0~Best Show tleeg1 Sign in Permalink Friends was one of the best shows ever. However, that being said, if you watch too much you will become critical. The first episodes are painfully awkward. The show does progress however. Rachaels hair goes from awful to beautiful while Monicas goes from cute to "Morticia" awful. As do her clothes. Ross is too pitiful in the beginning.Joey is probably cuter in the beginning, and after too many episodes I came to LOATHE him. Conceited, self focused and a big coward. Some of the best- The backpacking story,the playful pranks Rachel teaches Ben, Phoebe portraying Estelle, Monica and Chandler and the ink spot,(on the maid)...etc......so good.....However...JOEY is the worst character..mindless..self centered...and lets look physically....tiny feet and hands....truly an ugly body...eccch....his redeeming quality...HIS HAIR?....
10.0~Best T.V Show Ever!!!! Slick82 Sign in Permalink Friends became such a big part of my life, that i'm so glad i bought the entire collection on DVD, otherwise i'd be lost without it. Although as a non-American i can't exactly relate to the characters, there basic misfortunes are similar to life here in Britain and that's how i can relate to them. The balance and chemistry between the 6 of them works and it just ensured the show will go down in comedy history. The different characters help the show: Chandler: Funniest guy ever, totally sarcastic too! Monica: Completely neurotic and cleaning-freak Ross: Responsible and at times a little mental Rachel: Not too bright, originally spoilt, but building to success Joey: Dumb as a dodo, but very funny Phoebe: Very kooky, but hilarious I give this show 10 out of 10, if not for originality, but for genuine warmth and belly-aching laughter. Long live Friends!!!
10.0~Best tv show dantelerner Sign in Permalink It's the best sitcom I've ever seen. With the greatest characters and actors
10.0~Best serie maja-949-137461 Sign in Permalink I think this show is extremely funny and relatable. I've watched it like 7 times and I never get tired!
10.0~Timeless comedy! aimeecottle Sign in Permalink I watched friends years ago when it came out and I've lost count of how many times I've seen it. It never gets old!! Ive just converted my partner who is now a friends lover! Every episode is full of non stop jokes. The characters are all quirky and hilarious in their own individual ways and each episode has a brilliant individual story but with a continuing underlying story line that cleverly navigates through 10 brilliant series. Would love to see a revival of this show!
10.0~I'll be there for you... scissorhands17 Sign in Permalink I love Friends. It's quite possibly the best show ever. I mean, where else can you get a ton of humor, yet love the characters as much as your own friends? With romance and stories that compels anyone (even teenage boys), and classic lines such as, "And you never knew she was a lesbian?" (pilot episode). At the end of the day, Friends is a story-driven sitcom. Each character brings something compelling as well as humor and reoccurring jokes (such as Monica's clean obsession). Yet, each brings something different. Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Pheobe, and Joey all combine to create a diverse group of interesting and diverse characters, yet a group dynamic. As different as they all are, you never get the sense that they make an odd group. They all have ties and ultimately, they all love each other. Actions such as women-crazy Joey not trying his usual sex and ditch methods with Monica, Rachel, or Pheobe show that the friends respect each other more than as just friends, but family.
10.0~Why is friends lower than GOT? a-59963-81478 Sign in Permalink I have watched both series Andy obviously friends is worth watching
10.0~MASTERPIECE umarajmal Sign in Permalink I have never comment on any show before on imdb and i never watch comedy type shows but this one is MASTERPIECE. And i just regret that why i have not watched it earlier but it's good that I'm watching now and almost on last season( because it's a golden show). No other comedy show can beat FRIENDS. All actors are AWESOME ! And It's Must RECOMMENDED to watch from my side. 10/10 🖤
10.0~The Best TV show of two decades CrazyDean Sign in Permalink I have seen all seasons of FRIENDS for 4 times now. and i still enjoy watching it everyday in my life. It is not like some other series that you see and forget, it actually becomes a part of life. For every time, i think what i am going to do this weekends. and the first idea that always comes to my mind is, I'll grab a bear and watch Friends for the whole day. All the 6 actors have done a great great job. it never felt like they were acting, it all looks so natural.and i am glad that i could see this best show ever. and as FRIENDS fan, it's never like i finished or completed the series. it's like I'll keep watching it forever. Monica will always be cooking and chandlers' joke will always make me laugh. Joey will always try to get part in movie and so on... Thanks to the writers and all to make such a great show.
8.0~Good but overrated maxd-61061 Sign in Permalink This show is great, but people treat it like it's jesus.
10.0~I just watched 3 episode and i am tellling ya... rafiourbane Sign in Permalink I have watched Game of thrones, Breaking bad, Daredevil, Hillhouse, Titans, Nacos but believe me this is the only Tv i enjoyed the most! I only watched 3 episode and my hands were iting to give it a 10/10 and write a review! I was smiling all the time when i watched episodes! I can already tell, i am going to miss this series like hell when i finish it
10.0~Timeless stephpeever Sign in Permalink This show is so ahead of its time. It's iconic before the revolution of social media, yet remains relevant even though most episodes were filmed in the 90s. This show transcends generations and remains the best feel good show of all time.
2.0~Stereotype city! A Dumber, Sentimental version of Seinfeld. Show for Kids, and Morons. ussrusagirl222 Sign in Permalink This show is very easy to grasp- I remember being 10/11 years old on a plane to England from Australia, and laughing at Joey acting (whilst acting) in a Hospital bed. I thought Friends, especially Joey, were SO funny. at the age of 17 and beyond, now 23, Friends became increasingly predictable and dull whenever I see it, and its formulaic plot. All the characters are stereotypes, who in reality wouldn't get on at all- well, I don't buy Pheobe as a friend of the girls- why would someone so laid back prefer to hang with materialistic anxiety ridden work-obsessed, over other like minded "boho" people? Each episode falls ass backwards into the old jokes- and only dumb people, or children, will miss this (they are the audience for the show, just look at education statistics in the USA, and it will be explained why this show is so popular there)! Pheobe singing on her guitar with stupid lyrics and a simple melody "littlestar, hello there, furry and kittens love your blonde hair" or something stupidly simple. Ross and Rachel playing hard to get, whining. Joey making an "italian joke" by talking about food, eating lots of food, saying "I'm an Italian so I eat lots of food." Cue the Laugh Track. Chandler and Monica being anxious and acting more like Brother and Sister than lovers. Jennifer Aniston wearing fake nipples under white jumpers- again and again. WHY would she be made to wear "see through tops" with those plastic nipples? Isn't that KIND of distracting and inappropriate? Even Seinfeld make jokes about women who do that! Same with sex and the city! Really, it was pathetic, and made me disrespect Aniston more for just being a bimbo- on TV, and off. She can't act, so they had to make you forget that fact. Joey being a "Male Bimbo/Mimbo (Seinfeld word)" and doing a silly acting job. This show is outdated, sentimental mix of soap opera and a sit com, as oppose to Seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm, which are strictly sitcoms, and had a No Hugging policy- they also didn't care about making the Seinfeld characters look "sexy", just funny! Where-as on Friends, the actresses would have hair dressers on call between takes to brush their hair perfectly before the cameras were allowed to role. While Pheobe and Monica were quite comedic, Jennifer Aniston, the vainest woman on the planet, cared more about being pretty than being funny. If you want love stories and drama with comedy- watch sex and the city- its insightful and far more intelligent than friends (besides the product placement, its fantastic). If you want pure laughs that never date, characters to relate to, and a show that makes you feel happy about your life in a Ce La Vie fashion, watch Seinfeld.
10.0~The absolute SHOW brunod_1987 Sign in Permalink Imagine yourself growing up and the only thing that u wanna watch in the TV, is not cartoons, or movies, but one of the best serial show ever: Friends. And while you watching you think and say: " God i wish i had friends like that, that we can make jokes, we can trust each other, we can talk with each other and share our problems, we can laugh and cry with each other". This would be a fantastic thing or not? Today is almost impossible to find that kind of friends that they make you feel great and feel free and for me "Friends" it's not just a show only to laugh but it's a show that we can cry too and makes us thing how we can love, respect and stand by each other side (like Phoebe did with Ross in the final episode)so we can be able to create a perfect friendship. It may seem as an impossible thing to create but tell me, what's impossible today? :) I must say that this is the most absolute, great, fantastic and perfect show ever...
10.0~Brilliant! ennaoj-93403 Sign in Permalink I loved it! I spent all summer binge watching this and just couldn't get enough of it!
10.0~All-Time Best Sitcom clargarrr Sign in Permalink I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it. When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list. It doesn't matter that the show ran from 1994-2004, the humor it had is timeless! In a perfect world where we could pick a series that could run forever, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would be that show. Notice how different TV networks are still doing re-runs at present time even after it has ended back in '04. You'll find that a new generation of viewers who are watching and loving it are surprised to discover that the cast are quite old already. Nothing could beat it.
10.0~Outstanding series abhishekolkha Sign in Permalink I never watch a series like this, i completely fall in love with this series.

10.0~A show to watch before you die. akhanna-28238 Sign in Permalink So I have been watching this show from TWO yrs now,I've watched each and every episode for at least FIVE times and believe me,i still love it. What makes friends so beautiful is how wholeheartedly it is written and performed.Its all about love and laughter,10 incredible seasons of love and laughter. Other shows like Breaking Bad,Dexter,got etc are fantastic too,but this one affected me the most. Go watch and it will change your life for good.

8.0~Mirko's Review for Friends mirkodreher Sign in Permalink Back then Friends was the Nonplusultra. A new Genre of Sitcom that worked on a lot of levels. But the thing is that if you make something new, there are a lot of mistakes that you can make. Others will watch it, learn from it and make it better. Don't get me wrong Friends is great and it's cool nostalgia but a lot of episodes are boring fillers. And sometimes the series will try to be funny or cringy so hard, it really hurts. It can't keep up Compared to HIMYM for example. Even knowing that the newer sitcoms really stole a lot of ideas from friends, they still do a better job managing the episodes and keeping the characters interesting. If there would be 5 episodes less every season and a better more interesting storyline in the later seasons it would be truly a 10/10. This review sounds very negative, but i think Friends is a great show. This is just me trying to explain why i can not give 10*
10.0~best series ever whitehammerr Sign in Permalink I just finished season 10 and the only thing that i can say is to thank all the cast and producers for making all those great moments. it was one of the best things that ever happened in my life. thank u all u guys.
10.0~when you watch, you don't want it to end. sattiiglesias Sign in Permalink I remember the time when I was watching the first season, it was like my life is just started. and when I finished the last episode of the last season, it was like "a lifespan has ended." joey is full of joy and he is the best. when you watch the last season, you don't want it to end. never seen a comedy series better than F.R.I.E.N.D.S
9.0~It's more than a show, it's a life changer. abdullashammary Sign in Permalink No one can deny the big impact that FRIENDS left behind on each and every one of us, it's not all because of the great stories, the unforgettable scenes or the marvelous acting, it's the idea of how to take a simple life with a humble offer -just like ours- and turn it to a masterpiece. It's a complex of tears, love and joy, which are evenly distributed. If you didn't watch it, then stop every thing that is moving and open the box of FRIENDS and star watching with a smile on your face. You will Interestingly notice the evolving of the characters through the seasons as it happens in real life to each and every one of us. It is a real life with real people. Be ready to change your life.
10.0~Best show on earth shannonmykayla Sign in Permalink Absolutely love this show. In my opinion there is just nothing like Friends. Anyone at all can relate to either one of the characters, one of the situations, dilemmas, thoughts, feelings, morals, expressed in the show. It doesn't matter the age (of course I'd say 14+ for mature content), it doesn't matter what gender, it's a genius show that somehow captures every aspect of one's life. Weddings, Marriage, proposals, break ups, getting back together, jealously, addictions, fights, faithfulness, divorces, relationships with parents, friends, children, work, peer pressure, bullying, sexual orientation, adoption, homelessness, survival, every day struggles, weight challenges, loosing oneself, finding oneself, being judgemental, being non-judgemental, identity crisis, career challenges, one-night-stands, pregnancy, surrogacy, May-December relationships, over critical parents, favouritism, religion differences, belief differences, Anger, Sadness, cheating, team work, only child, siblings, losing jobs, relationships with co-workers, parties, contemplation of life, dreams, aspirations, meaning of friendship, meaning of family, acceptances, non- acceptances, guys perspective, girl's perspective, matters of principle, to name a few as I'm forgetting many others, but seriously ANYTHING you can think of. I'm 30 years old, and I still watch the entire series from 1-10. At least 2 or 3 times out of the year I will watch the episodes back to back. My husband laughs at me, but he also thinks it's cute and he can't help himself but watch it with me too! Long long long live the greatest show on earth....Friends!
10.0~One of the all-time greats of comedic television... dee.reid Sign in Permalink "Friends" is a show that I kind of got a late start with. The first time I ever watched it was when it was syndicated on Fox 5, right after "The Simpsons" (this was back in 1999); I was 14 at the time. I thoroughly enjoyed it back then for several years, but then lost interest in it. I'm sorry to say that I ever did lose interest. For a few weeks now, now at age 27, I've been catching more re-runs on TBS, and the show is just as funny and moving as it was when I first saw it back then. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer were the six Friends whose lives, loves, and laughs were chronicled over the course of a highly successful, 10-year run from 1994 to 2004. We laughed and grew to love these six characters - that some of us came to think of as family - and the crazy relationships and situations they often found themselves in. This is why we love "Friends." 10/10
10.0~A classic studioAT Sign in Permalink There surely can be no doubt that Friends will go down in history as one of the best sitcoms ever. Sure it perhaps went on a little too long and the series gradually became more and more like a soap opera but it is important to remember why this show was such a hit and why people watch it again and again and laugh equally hard each time. From the on and off again Ross and Rachel relationship to the buddy love of Joey and Chandler the stories flow effortlessly from episode one until episode two hundred and thirty six. The cast are on top form through thick and thin and regardless of what they have done since or will do in the future they will always be remembered for Friends.
2.0~Not Ready for Prime Time gjampol Sign in Permalink With a few exceptions, I've long ago given up commercial TV. With a collection of more than 500 DVDs and access to Netflix Instant View, I'm not dependent of the networks for entertainment, although I have some TV shows in my collection. "Friends" is among the reasons that I've abandoned commercial TV. The show goes nowhere and it lacks the tact and daring of HBOs "Curb Your Ehthusiam, " which NBC progenitor "Seinfeld" explored to great success. Words such as "brilliant" and "awesome" have been used to describe mediocre "Friends." The program's main draw comes from male viewers who want to look at the attractive female stars, and they tune in each week to whet their sexual fantasies. Female viewers use the female actors as to serve as models. They want to look like Courtney Cox and the others and keep up with clothing and hair trends. What takes place between is jejune filler. I hope that foreign audiences who watch "Friends" do not assume that all American twenty-somethings live that way.
10.0~Friends rluxton-69385 Sign in Permalink An absolutely perfect SitCom. Immensely funny with great characters, and a well written drama element. o
9.0~So sad to see it end! devon1975 Sign in Permalink The current promo for the upcoming season almost brought me to tears. Already publicizing this as the last season (as if we all hadn't already heard), the net is creating nostalgia that will guarantee strong viewership throughout the 2003-2004 season. It will be a sadder day than the time we lost Seinfeld, or Mad About You (for the earlier seasons, not the last one). It's rare that a sitcom can have this kind of longevity without ever losing it's audience. Especially when everyone assumed that the "baby curse" would be the signal of the show's demise. Friends has reinvented and reinvigorated itself numerous times, and Thursdays will never be the same.
10.0~Best comedy series ever natalybartinez Sign in Permalink You should love this series and people consider this like a society contrast, yeah, it is somehow. I mean, they are always fun and they have done a lot of full episodes with different thematics.
10.0~Great show...... throughout 10 season.... its funny as hell farhad-cfc Sign in Permalink you might think that a show ran for 10 freaking years might not be as good as people say it is. But trust me, it is great. I have recently finished watching all 10 seasons(DVDs). And I must say that this has been the best among all these funny TV-series I have watched. The best thing about friends is that the more you see it the more you get to know and eventually start to like the characters! 'Chanler' and 'Joey' is probably my most favorite characters. And the acting is great. Another great thing is that the story of this series is great. There is always a few twist here and there.....as a result you don't get bored watching this even if you see 10-15 episodes in a row!! So, get to DVD store now or watch it on your cable.......
10.0~Treat for my eyes dolaskshitij Sign in Permalink Watching friends is one of the best I could do with my eyes. Everyone should watch each and every episode before they die. I have watched each episode, I can't even count how many times but i still don't get enough of it.
2.0~Lack of Diversity... shaking my head. julianjoker-01865 Sign in Permalink Out of all the criticism I see from the one and two star reviews, no one addresses the lack of diversity with the leading casts. I only watched three episodes and I didn't like how "white people" were the main characters in a show about "friends and inclusion." I did further research, asked friends, and realized I'm not the only one who thinks that this show ain't it.
10.0~Nothing on this planet compares. edimambro-sopel Sign in Permalink I cannot put into words how AMAZING this show is. Never have I felt a certain way just by thinking about a TV show until I started Friends. The best show to ever exist. It never gets old. It is impossible to dislike this TV show. I never have written a review on this website but this show is way too OUT OF THIS WORLD to not give attention to it. It's a very very very excellent show and could not be better. The casting is amazing. Phoebe is my favorite, but they are all my favorite when I think about it. The plot is amazing in each episode. NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS TELEVISION SHOW. The absolute best thing to ever exist on TV and I have no regrets saying it is the best show of all time.
1.0~Homophobic, etc. Cinephiliac7000 Sign in Permalink This show should be pulled off the air. Disgusting.
10.0~It seemed like reality more than a TV Show stejasmunees Sign in Permalink It was my first TV show (apart from anime) and initial episodes 3~4 episodes made me feel overrated (not too funny), I had never been so wrong. The characters grow on you, and you would feel they are your personal and close friends too as they go through their daily lives as friends together. I would say one of the best creations by men, and I don't feel exaggerating as this is what everyone who have watched Friends would say. My friend once said, "There are only two people in this world, one who love F.R.I.E.N.D.S and the one who haven't watched yet". I feel its true. You will fall in love but be aware of last episode as it has broken the heart of many people.
10.0~Best TV Show Of All Time saifur-41864 Sign in Permalink While it is not so much informational. this is easily the best show for anyone in need of a good time and many laughs. Like an adult version of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, these two are my favourite and if they are not ours, you are not human.
10.0~Awesome. srdjanbjelic Sign in Permalink Awesome show. Awesome characters. Awesome lifestyles. Awesone actors. Love them.
10.0~One of my all-time favorite shows... taylorkingston Sign in Permalink I can't explain to you how much I love this show. Friends is one of the best things to ever happen to television. The cast is outstanding and the characters are well thought out. There aren't many episodes I don't like. I can honestly tell you that I don't hate any episodes. There are only a small few, probably seven, that I don't love, only like. That's how good the show is. I love everything about it. It is one of my all-time favorite TV shows. You have to know how good it is. It went for ten seasons which is a lot longer than most comedy's. The only comedy's that have come close, that I've seen are: How I Met Your Mother – Nine Seasons, Full House – Eight Seasons, The Big Bang Theory is currently airing Season 8, and has been renewed for Season 9 and 10. The Simpsons has been going for twenty- six seasons, but that's a cartoon, so it's different. Family Guy has been going for thirteen seasons and American Dad has been going for ten seasons, but both are cartoons. So when you think about it, not many survived that long. This show centers of six friends, who are living in New York City. We see them fall and rise. We see them love. We see them get married and have babies. We see them break down. We see them go through money and job struggles. We see them reach their goals and dreams. And we see them get happy ever afters. Here's a run down of who every character is, and what happens to them in the show. Monica: Is an uptight cleaning freak, but is very lovable. Her catchphrase, "I know!" is hilarious. She is a chef and has trouble talking at a low volume. She is Ross's sister, and Rachel's high school friend. She dates a few people during the show, including Richard and Pete, but mostly dates her brothers best friend, Chandler. They get married, and end up adopting twins at the end of the show. Chandler: Is a goofy, funny guy who has an job, we don't really know what. He lived with Joey, his best friend, and he uses comedy as a defense mechanism. He dates a few people throughout the show, including Janice, then settles down with Monica. Joey: Is a silly, hilarious man, who loves to eat and is an actor. He's a ladies man, and his catchphrase, "How you doin'?", gets him into a lot of beds. He lived with Chandler for a few years, and then with Rachel for another few. He ends up falling in love with Rachel, but they don't end up together. Phoebe: Is a free spirit with a silly personality. She is a masseuse, and doesn't date any of the main characters. She gets very emotional about things, like a mouse dying, and always plays her guitar and wacky songs at Central Perk. She eventually marries Mike. Rachel: Was a stuck-up rich girl, who tried to live like a normal person. She worked at Central Perk for a few years, then at Bloomingdales and ended up at Ralph Lauren. She dates Ross on-again, off-again for several years. After on hookup, she gets pregnant, and they have a baby together, Emma. They accidentally get married in Vegas whilst drunk and they get a divorce. She ends up moving to another country at the end of the show. Ross: Is an annoying character, to me anyway. He's a paleontologist. He married a lesbian, which he didn't know. They had a son, Ben. He, his ex-wife, and his ex-wife's current wife, all raise Ben together. He got married to Emily, but accidentally said Rachel's name at the wedding, so that ended things quick. He has a baby with Rachel and they raise her together. My favorite character is actually a tie, between Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey. They are all hilarious, I love them all. But for some reason, I don't like Rachel that much. I absolutely hate Ross. He's a pain in my ass. Everything he says is pretentious. And he's so rude. When he got evicted and moves into Chandler and Joey's apartment, he keeps telling them to be quiet in their own house. Ugh. Throughout the show we see many relationships. Ross and Rachel are always on-again, off- again. Monica and Chandler end up dating, getting married, and at the end of the series, adopting twins. Phoebe marries a non-main cast member. Joey never really ended up with anyone, but that is okay. I love the amount of room changes. They're too many to type, with the word limit, but believe me, there's a lot of them My brain is just going crazy with all of this Friends knowledge and trivia. And I can't get it all out. So, you've read a synopsis my opinion, and random trivia. I think that's all you can take, right now. If you haven't watched Friends by now, you need to. Come on, it's twenty years old, how have you not? Get a copy and watch it now. That's an order :) Overall, I give this show a 10 out of 10.
10.0~The Perfect Friends Luminater Sign in Permalink Every now and then we like to sit on our couch, have a Snack, and watch invest in the lives of everyones favorite "Friends", Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbianni, Chandler Bing, and Ross Geller. The best "Friends" anyone could ask for. Although there are over 200 episodes of our "Friends", and you may have seen each and every episode once or twice before, it doesn't matter. Every time you watch and episode of "Friends" it feels like you've never watched it before. The comedy is never cliché'e, all the jokes from seasons 1 through 10, are still hilarious and funny, even the episodes that made you cry like "The one with the Proposal" still touch that special place in your heart. Thanks to "Bright, Kaufman, Crane", "Friends" is still as popular as ever. No matter what the episode is you are always guaranteed an good laugh. Like in the theme song "I'll be there for You" our friends will always be there for us, and we'll be there for them too.
10.0~This is the best series ever juli_mesa_douze8 Sign in Permalink F.R.I.E.N.D.S totally rock. I love them; they make you laugh every time, even when you've already seen that episode. It's just awesome,how close can you become to people you don't even know because of the quality of the series and the actors performance; you feel like they are your friends for real. I love those guys....They're unbelievable. I love chandler and his jokes, and I was so happy when he and Monica fell in love, it was so cute. I also love the central perk, it's so cool and cozy, although I've never been there...I think each one of them are really wonderful people, Jennifer Aniston rocks in real life; the other ones just create the best character that t.v has ever seen.
10.0~A classic Shivam_Murari Sign in Permalink I realized that one of the closest things to my heart is going to end forever, six episodes before the last. So much so that despite being a contained person as myself, I began posting constant whatsapp statuses about it, talking to all my friends everywhere, how it was all going to be over for me, forever. Then came the second last episode, two days later. After watching that episode, I couldn't bear to watch the last one. Not just because all of it was going to get over, but also because the way it was supposedly going to get over. I knew Ross and Rachel would end up together, but Monica's house would be gone. The group won't be hanging out any more. At least not as often as they used to. Everyone was getting settled in their life. I had come to terms with the fact that it was going to end. But this way? I can't even imagine them beyond the series? When Harry Potter series ended, it was devastating for me. But at least it ended on a note that gave me the thread to extend it post the ending. To imagine how their daily lives might be like. The second last episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S, however, made me immensely sad. Two days later, I shut my room and saw the last episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. It was the best ending ever. I will tell you how. I will avoid the spoilers. Those who know the ending, know how perfect it is, despite all the fears that accumulate on watching the second last. Apart from that, I cherish the fact that now they are a part of my life. Now I have the chance to re-run the whole series (which I am doing currently) and watch it from the perspective of different characters and I must tell you, it is just as funny and light hearted as it was when I watched it for the first time. It won't be a hyperbole to call F.R.I.E.N.D.S a classic. It is, hands down, the most famous series ever made. 21 years post it's pilot, people are still watching it and enjoying it more than the current running series. F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the scale. The quality of other series are measured in comparison to it's standard. Despite it's yesteryear limitations of technology (they were using flip mobile phones in their last season!), guest roles that would hardly excite the current generation, the storyline, theme and dialogues of the series are so timeless that they have achieved eternity. And so you still find Taylor Swift, Adele and many other major artists talking about watching the series, like it were something still being telecast for the first time. Just likes it's eternity making it cut through generations, it is a series which, no matter how many times you watch it, will make you feel the same way it did for the first time. It is the best stress buster. It is F.R.I.E.N.D.S!
10.0~Simpely Hilarious danny-donna-kim Sign in Permalink Friends has dominated International TV screens and the attention of multi millions of Friends lovers for a decade. It has been one of the most watched, high rated and most loved sitcoms ever, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer all teamed as Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross, six best friend New Yorkers looking for their true partner and their lives. Over the ten years we have known them back in "94 they we all not well known, but that's what made it so great. The group were all then getting together as Rachel is the last to join as we see the 'Pilot' in each and every ten series's we see the on and off relationship of Ross and Rachel the lesbian relationship of Carol and Susan Ross's family of children Ben and Emma Monica and Chandler's flirting relationship and then marriage Phoebe's search for her partner then in series Ten she finds mike her husband and then all comes to a close Monica and Chandler and have then two children find a house Ross and Rachel make another go of it and have a daughter 'Emma' Phoebe has a husband and Joey... well anyway. It really has been over two years since 'Friends' closed and it still as disguised as it was when it first began in 1994. I know for a fact that Friends is just as famous in the UK as it is the USA and is still in the International world. Here in the UK Friends is on TV at least a minimum of 8 times a day. Personalaly i believe Friends is the best sitcom to hit the TV screens and believe me i have seen hundreds of sitcoms American and British and although they are all brilliant they just don't stack up to Friends type of comedy. The reason Friends is so outstanding due to brilliant writing, directing and of course an amazing select of cast they are all hysterically funny in their own quirky way It all began in sixth grade when a girl had a pencil case with the cast of Friends on the front and said 'Have you ever watch this' 'No' i said i had never heard of it Then i went to my mum's work a residential home and i had nothing to watch so i went to have a look at some video's to find what to watch and sitting there is two Friends video's so i though Hey! i'll watch one and i loved it i took it home to watch again afterwards a few days later i was ill and was off school, and all i watch Friends again and again then i went back to my mum's work and took home the other video from series one and the other was from series two and watch that an laugh and laugh and watched it again and again. My sister who is 4 years older than me watched it to and she loved it to my cousin's have it all on DVD they also love it to, i always wished i could own them all then about a month before Christmas i seen 1-10 series DVD box set of Friends £190 although this was cheaper than most places i could of got it for Christmas i thought 'I don't know' then a friend i know who does spoil me i mentioned this to him and with a little persuasion he said okay he didn't mind because he knew how much i loved it a week before Christmas i bought it a great Christmas present this was Christmas 2004 everyone was impurest. Way over two years later my 19 year old sister her 23 year old boyfriend and me still laugh love it and watch them all the time, i remember a time i think it was 'The one with the Red Sweater' i literally was on the floor laughing so hard i could not breath i was crying with laughter I'm so glad i found out about Friends, although Friends is still the most famous sitcom of my age group it would been hard not to find about Friends. I know people in their teens, 20s,30s,40s and 50s who say to me 'I LOVE FRIENDS IT'S HILAOUIRS' thank god David crane, Marta Kauffman and Kevin S. Bright decided 12 years to create this outstanding sitcom There is so much to say about this sitcom and the characters. When i was typing this comment guess what i was watching you've guessed right 'FRIENDS' I think Friends will always be may favourite and i don't know of anyone who says they don't like Friends AMAZING, HILAOURIES, OUTSTANDING so many words to describe this conspicuous best loved sitcom around the world and no one will ever forget or stop selling nor broadcasting it FRIENDS ABSOUTLY OUTSTANDING TO ALL THE CAST WRITERS AND Directors AMAZING JOB!
10.0~Best Sitcom! sllz_sllz Sign in Permalink OK, after friends finished like two years ago, i began watching the show. But hey! If it's a good show, it's never lame to watch it again! I've already bot 5 seasons and i no it'll be worth it! Friends is such a good sitcom because it reflects on a lives and how friends really r very important! Rachel the lovable waitress, Monica the "mother", Pheobe the free spirit, Joey the cute yet dumb Italian, Chandler the sarcastic one, and Ross the nerd. I believe that when am sad, after i watch friends, I sorta forget about the past for awhile! I love all the the 6 friends, it's just that i like some of them a little more... My favorite friend would have to be Rachel, then Pheobe, chandler, Joey,and ross and monica sumtimes just annoy me! ...But I love them all! Now am gonna watch Friend!! HAHA!
9.0~Number one among the greatest sitcoms ever berryson-1 Sign in Permalink The combination of powerful writing and amazing performances of Friend's ensemble cast manage to give the viewer some mild to strong laughs as well as a bunch of other emotions such as sadness and compassion. Not to forget the chemistry this magnificent cast has, the ability of the writers to give each and everyone of them a good storyline on each and every episode, etc. You gotta love friends. Because from the very first episode to the very last one there is no way you can hate it. Every episode contains a great number of funny lines and great facial expressions and performances from it's ensemble cast. I've seen a great numbers of sitcoms and I say Friends is on top of them all. Both thumbs should be up when criticizing the sitcom Friends.
1.0~IMDb's disappointing sometimes edramoscm Sign in Permalink IMDb has a very big trouble. It's ratings aren't well distributed and Friends is a great example. Talking of plain comedy, originality and fun, it shouldn't get more than a 4, maybe a 5. But ultimately, it gets 9 because IMDb's rating system isn't serious. So here I am, giving it a 1 when I think it deserves a 4. I feel like a monster! There are some good episodes, yes, like "The One Where No One's Ready", it shouldn't get a 1. But when you see the cheesy finale (okay, it's the finale, people like cheesy) getting almost a 10, or "The One With Unagi" as high as it is... you just can't be fair. The real problem with Friends is that it's way too pushed. It tries to make things that are not relatable to general people relatable. It's not like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David's famous work, who were stand-up comedians on observation, people behavior. It feels even wrong to compare Seinfeld to this. Friends is like a bad, fan-made Seinfeld spin-off (much like "Modern Seinfeld"). In fact, the theatre fan- made Seinfeld episode is okay, so it's at least as good as Friends on its highs. On the same line, the best Friends episodes are the original ones to which the average person can relate. This definitely will sound like a fanboy-ish review to most people, but it's the plain truth. You may even like it, but don't say it's good: there is good comedy and bad comedy, it's objective. Taste, on the other hand, is subjective.
10.0~I love it. jorooo Sign in Permalink This the best TV Show ever made. I really love it. I can watch it over and over again and it never becomes boring. The jokes are universal and never get old. This show has made me laugh even in the most difficult moments. I've watched it through very hard times and maybe it helped me cheer up at some level. I remember back then when they begun to air it on TV in Bulgaria. I hated it, didn't want to watch it at all. But after some time I couldn't stop watching more and more. It's like a drug. I wish they could make another show that can beat Friends but I don't see it yet. Definitely recommend it to everyone who has not seen it yet, and to those who've seen it a couple of times too!
10.0~My Lovely FRIENDS MTMahmoudTarek Sign in Permalink I felt so sad about ending this amazing series and I felt lonely on the end of the last episode. It's show of friendship and family that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you. I have a lot of fantastic things to say about Friends but I think that are all well-known. SO All what I want to say that I'll miss you my friends so so so much.
8.0~A great sitcom to watch ComedyFan2010 Sign in Permalink I really do like this sitcom. I never understood the need of people to compare it to Seinfeld and make a battle of which show is better. I like them both, but those are two different types of sitcoms to me. Just because they are both about Friends living in New York it doesn't mean that they have that much in common Friends has created some pretty good characters. Chandler is one of the favorites because of his sarcasm. Phoebe is a very unique character. Ross is incredibly funny. They all have something special about them The acting also was good. David Schwimmer is my absolute favorite in it. His performance as Ross often made even episodes with story lines I didn't care much about rise to a higher level. They all had their moment where they did a great job, some more often than others And there were quiet a few great story lines. Some of them that went on for several episodes and some small ones that we only saw for one episode. There was a lot of diversity in those themes and some original ideas The show did go down a bit after a few seasons. Mainly after Monica and Chandler got together. What happened after was that Monica's character was completely ruined. She used to be likable in the first 4 seasons but after this there was nothing positive left about her. Chandler went down a bit as well because of their relationship. And Phoebe had her bad moments towards the end even though for the most part she remained a great character There were a few story lines that I could live without, like for example the whole Joey and Rachel story. And yet, I can probably find 10 or maybe even less episodes that I completely disliked in the whole ten seasons. The show continued to make me laugh until the very end And I don't care if the show isn't all that realistic. If I want reality, I watch news. This show is sitcom that I watch to laugh, not to figure out how Joey makes Chandler pay for his stuff or how Phoebe can afford to live in Manhattan. I also don't mind that it is lighter humor, not something incredibly intellectual. I like this as well And besides comedy, we also get some great relationships on this show. My favorite one would be Joey and Chandler. Their friendship is my favorite. They have so many great moments! The time when Joey moved out, or Chandler going to the box and staying quiet when Katie talked to him because he cared for Joey. These are just two examples out of many. Ross and Rachel's relationship was very well done as well. All their ups and downs have kept viewers intrigued for many years. And they have performed it very well and always had a great chemistry. No matter how often I watch it, I always get a feeling of sadness when I see the last episode and I have tears in my eyes when Rachel gets off the plane. They really did a great job with keeping me enjoying the show for so many years And now that I have said it all, I just will tell my opinion on the most debated topic of Friends: They WERE on a break!
7.0~It's great, but... marcomark-75912 Sign in Permalink Friends always had a special place in my heart from when I was 10 and up to now. Frankly, I'm not exactly an old one now, but I would say I grew up with it, since my parents used to watch it a lot. My mom had all 10 seasons on VHS, and later on DVD, and it's great. I loved it growing up, but watching it now took away some of of the charm. Now don't hate me already, it's a great show, I still believe so, but it has its flaws. For the most part, its issues lie in the continuity of the show. I get that it's a satirical sitcom, but that doesn't mean it can't try to keep a flowing story, which it feels like it is actually trying to do. But it keeps bringing in plot lines that end up forgotten a few episodes later. For one, there's Ben, Ross' kid. He was somewhat forgotten. The wedding episode of Chandler and Monica is a good example of this. Ben is at the wedding, and obviously he came with Ross since Carol and Susan aren't there, but Ross acts like he's not even there. It's his son, and obviously his own son would also talk to him. But he doesn't, neither does Ross talk to him. For god's sake, he doesn't even acknowledge his existence. Phoebe's dad is another example, also her biological mother. Her dad is in the show for one episode, the episode where her grandmother dies, but he's not in it post that, even though it feels like some kind of character development could happen between the two of them, a relationship maybe, like what we have with Monica and Ross' parents or Rachel's parents. The same for her biological mother. She's there the episode they meet, the episode after and then when she needs advice on whether or not she should be a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife. But after that whole ordeal, she's gone for the rest of the show. She's not even at her wedding with Mike. These continuity errors are my only real problem with the show, the whole point of the show, the humor and the friends, is amazing, it's great. And that's why I give it a 7/10, because it's good, but has flaws.
10.0~Just finished watching whole series on Netflix embless Sign in Permalink I am such a fan of the Friends tv show. The characters are well developed independently and together they play off each other well. Some moments are cheesy while others are funny, while the rest is just very well acted and dialogued by the cast. At least give the first season episodes a go, if you still don't like it, don't watch it. But for those who enjoy a well developed multi character show..... Friends is sure to make you laugh and want to get to know each character more. Its a television show.... there are bound to be goofs or inconsistencies, no television show has ever ever in the history of tv been 200% perfect. I plan on buying the whole series on Blue-Ray soon to add to my dvds.
6.0~Popular cathylr Sign in Permalink I discovered this series when I was a Young teenager until I became a Young adult and I don´t mean to deny that it made me laugh a lot at the time and I probably knew all the episodes of the first seasons by heart but I must say that, moving forward and growing ´older, I noticed many inconsistancies from the first episodes, and more obviously in the last seasons. Like many shows, it seems like the producers wanted to carry on using its past popularity until a season 10 whose end is what the audience wanted to see.
10.0~It Just Got Interesting kevinwhitehead-09099 Sign in Permalink The. Best. Comedy. Show. Of. All. Time. And yes better than: Arrested Development, Seinfeld, The Office, Parks and Rec, Modern Family, Glee, Family Guy, Simpsons and more. It's better than all of them I've seen every episode probably 10 times and I still laugh. There isn't one bad episode. There are so many classic episodes and this show is just amazing. Matt LeBlanc, Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Kudrow are exceptionally great. Courtney Cox, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry are also good. These characters are complex and 3-demensional. The writers deserve all the credit as these performances would be nothing without the witty dialogue and plot. Vegas, Shepard's pie, Barbados, jellyfish, tossing a ball, the iconic new year's eve dance and so much more. If you're told that the show sucks, watch it. I promise you'll like it.
10.0~Best show ever erimelg Sign in Permalink Friends is absolutely the best show ever aired on television. I didn't get to see the first episodes shown, as I was born in 1993, but I remember sitting with my parents to watch them, even if I didn't understand the jokes. Of course, today I bought the first season, which I really love. I've also got the ninth season (big difference) which is good, but I still love the first season best. Friends is a funny and intelligent show that describes the lives of 6 individuals. Ever character can be loved in their own way. They are all different and lovable. My favorite is Chandler Bing, because of his sarcastic and humoristic comments. He is adorable! Of course, I love all of them, but he still is my favorite. In all, Friends is the best show ever.
10.0~Love this show so much tima-78898 Sign in Permalink Best sitcom ever made I wish one more season to make 🙏🏻
5.0~Average tanmayk-ngp Sign in Permalink It is worth one watch but nothing more. It does not even begin compare with shows like Seinfeld. Some of the jokes are good but is too melodramatic in my opinion. It is too sentimental for my liking. Acting is also average. Characters are good. Again some of the plots are too melodramatic and unreal. One or two seasons are good, rest are pretty average. Some of the last seasons are boring and too high on emotional content. You feel like watching some soap opera. One of the good things about it is that you can really associate with the characters. It has a diverse set of characters as well. In a few words don't expect too much.
10.0~which sitcom is better , tell me of one ? freeefifka Sign in Permalink It's light , its bright it's easy to digest , has no big dramas involved , problems are solved its not like in real life and this is why its so good to watch and escape the sad drama of human reality . here you have 6 friends so different from each other accepting one another - and spending time together , of course its unreal ,but who cares !- i dont want real serious stuff - or laughing from misery of our existence - i want to put a film on and feel i will not get hurt and i will laugh and when it finish i will feel good - and that's what are "friends" for , yeah they are insulting ppl from time to time .. there is a lot insulting to gays and transsexuals etc but don't forget it was 90's we were just getting there to accept all of that . friends helped me a lot to overcome very bad time in my life - where i didn't want to see people suffering or being mean to each other . and they gave me a lot of laughs . thank you friends !
10.0~Friends is second to none lemonlime-3 Sign in Permalink Friends is a juggernaut of a television show. A king of the comedy world. An award winning sitcom that also won millions of hearts during its lifespan. It portrays the lives and loves of six inseparable friends, three guys and three girls. Starting in 1994 and ending no less than a decade after, the show saw its core characters go from strength to strength. Personally, i think the roots of the shows massive success are the writing, and the six main actors themselves. The relationships between the characters grow and develop over long periods of time, so effective and endearing is the writing here that it's almost like: "Hey there are some actual people stuck in this television set, oh my god get them out!" Don't believe me? Friends was and is so popular that in its first two seasons it boasted celebrity guests such as George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Ben Stiller etc.. as well as Brad Pitt and Danny Devito in its last season. It really does hit the spot every time. Basically if you like having friends, then you will love this show. If you don't, then you will probably still love this show.. Peace and go watch Friends! :)
9.0~One of the best TV Shows ever jenikopuryo Sign in Permalink It was summer when I had watched the pilot episode of this show. During that time, I think I have also found six friends in my life who really know how I feel, how I'm doing and how I struggle in life. So the series goes and the gang found a reason to change who they used to be. We have witnessed their challenges, their sacrifices, the love that was lost and found, and how they coped with it by the help of each other. Ibthink it's the strength of the show. 6 awesome characters and a perfect scriptwriting. FRIENDS knows how to depict the reality of twenty-something's life by adding comedy to it (though there will be a really dreary moments in which you can't help the Niagara falls flowing from your eyes). But there are also moments when they can drive you crazy by making you cry like a baby and cackle at the same time. For the past ten years (10 months to me), FRIENDS really captured my heart and teach me countless lessons in life that I will truly treasure for the rest of my existing. This is the ONLY show that I think I will watch for nth time. I am really gonna miss this. It feels like I lost my friends. The grieving feels like death. Amazing friends, with their amazing antics. And there comes the nostalgic feeling again. It's so hard. They were more than characters. They became our Friends. I can't let you go Phoebe Joey Chandler Ross Rachel Monica. I will be forever thankful. *sighs
10.0~Great Show Ever! ruimye Sign in Permalink This is great show! The chemistry between the cast makes this show to be that excellent. script is good, most of their jokes are funny and the acting is right. They ended the series in a good way and right on time, they cant sit in a coffee house whole their life and talk, they grow up and move on. the finale episode was touching, sad and funny at once. if you didn't have a opportunity to watch this show in this decade, its not too late. 10\10
5.0~Depends on the episode: Ranges from Abysmal to Awesome amatrimonials Sign in Permalink Ross is, for the most, great and genuinely funny, as exemplified in the Fake Tan episode. When he gets into "meaningful" and "deep" heart-to-hearts or intrigues with Rachel though, he is insufferable. Chandler is super-funny throughout. Monica is excellent, particularly in the scenes depicting her obsessive and bossy behavior. Phoebe is O.K. although sometimes her quirkiness gets a bit tiresome. Joey is dumb and lascivious. He occasionally comes up with a funny quip but mostly it's about his love of junk food and humping everything that is remotely female. His I.Q. is unlikely to be above 50. What's his purpose on the show? Rachel... *sigh* A duplicitous, useless imbecile. She brings NOTHING to the show except, perhaps, a pretty face. She is not funny and she is not a convincing actress. That, per se, is bad. But spending SO much time on her and Ross' "relationship" makes her positively annoying. In the latter episodes I found myself fast-forwarding through all the sequences of her and Ross. But, and here is piece de resistance, what makes her UNBEARABLY IRRITATING are the values she represents and stands for. Throughout the series she chases after Ross employing sometimes despicable means (such as sabotaging his existing relationships); when she gets him, she drives him away, but the minute he then tries to form a new relationship with someone else, out come her old guerilla tactics to ensure that relationship fails. People like that used to be called female dogs, if you know what I mean. A dishonorable mention: The various guest "stars" (e.g. Bruce Willis or Jeff Goldblum). They overdramatize and behave totally unnaturally. It's like: "Hey, I'm a big-shot star on this big-shot sitcom, so I have to leave my mark, and the only way to do that is through affectation and by being outrageous." Willis, in particular, was unwatchable. Elle Macpherson, too, was bleak and nondescript. What greatly exacerbated this were the cheap hysterical canned laughs played after every line uttered by the guest "star." Oh yeah, and the apoplectic canned screams played at the entrance scenes of the guest "stars." Bottom line: If the series had been cut down to five instead of ten seasons, and if Rachel and Joey had been left out (or at most limited to intermittent guest appearances), this would have been an outstanding show. This way, it got jaded, predictable, tired and annoying halfway through.
8.0~About himym and friens asadpa Sign in Permalink Most of the people hate himym because they think that it is acopy from friend but in many ways i think that himym was better
9.0~Realy great show heirman_steven Sign in Permalink I had a lot of laughs, and friends is a amazing serie but for me serie got ruined by the ross/rachel relationship. I skipped so many episode because i was annoyed with rachel and ross getting back together and then break up and then back together
10.0~Best show ever created shannonlarney123 Sign in Permalink Honestly the best show ever created. It's so universally liked by everyone I know. If you have never watched friends before in your life. I don't know what kind of life you've been living. It helped me through so much and just by watching an episode can change my mood for the whole day. Not only is the plot amazing but the characters as well. I feel like I can relate to every single character on the show each character is a part of me. When I started watching this show I was going through similar things that' the friends were. I love this show more than life itself. It is undoubtedly a classic, and nothing will EVER replace friends even if they tried. They just don't make them like this anymore.
10.0~10*10*10 kirankhatpe Sign in Permalink There are very few shows in history that have the magic and charm of F. R. I. E. N. D. S And there will be very few in future which will. If F. R. I. E. N. D. S is all that I get to watch till I die, I will gladly watch it over and over and over again.
10.0~Oh my God!!! andrea_andi92 Sign in Permalink Okay....So this is like one of my favorite show on the whole world. I watched "Chuck" and "DDD" and "OUAT" but this is seriously one of my favorite shows ever....I first saw this in Serbia (i am from there), and when i wanted to download it, i saw that it has like 10 season, and i was like "there is no way i am gonna download that". But than somehow i did it. And know i watch this every night, and it makes me laugh so bad...Its so hilarious, and funny...Whenever i am sad, or not in mood i just watch one episode and i forgot why was i sad....I love every single character in show, but my favorite are Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani....I am know at season 9, and i am so sad that a almost watch it all, but i promise myself that i will watch it all over again....:)) I am sorry for my English, its not perfect....
3.0~A decent remedy for boredom but quite cliché. devvrattoshniwal Sign in Permalink This show is just getting so irritating and predictable, all the "jokes" are based on only few facts such as: 1) Joey's unrealistic stupidity (the weird part is that he wasn't that stupid in the first few seasons and then out of the blue he becomes dumber than a dodo) 2) Monica's cleanliness habits 3) Chandler's sarcasm Rarely any other jokes are based on something else. This show also contains a lot of drama and unneeded angst (created by the dreaded and irritating duo of Ross and Rachel) . In conclusion: The show is cheesy, cliché and predictable accompanied by witless humor. But on the good side, if you have not watched any episodes of this show, the first few seasons would be enjoyable. Also it a good pass time show. I give it 5/10
10.0~The best thing I have seen on TV... sri_speed Sign in Permalink Wowwwwwwww.......what an amazing sitcom...I haven't got a chance to watch this one when it was on TV...then one of my friend suggested to watch it on a DVD...and it all started...Starting from the first episode, I was completely attracted into this one...watching every season wanted me to watch more...I enjoyed each and every episodes and every season..it was really hard for me to end while watching the final season... Really amazing set of actors...those characters have lived with me for those days...I liked each and every character...joey,chandler,ross,monica,rachel and phoebe...i can tell these name if u ask me in sleep...;-) I have bought a complete full set of DVD's...so the I can watch it again and again....:-)
10.0~Astonishingly Filled With Humor arjunflamingfeather Sign in Permalink The Series titled 'Friends' provokes us to do the unnatural; to communicate the past. This series is a featured TV show but the unlikely coincidence is that the show in it's entirety in it's past glory of the nineties is a 'Pass Down.' The achievements in cinematography is off the unusual: people laughing in the background. The visuals and success are combined with the cinematographer; solid steady camera movements and lighting effects that are enhancing the actor's like Jennifer Aniston's comedy. This comedy series became a success and is a featured TV Show in our residences; 'When it hasn't been your day or month or year' as the song promo goes. The writer's block if there has been: ten seasons with the pay of the actors increasing at record breaking consistence with the TV Show 'Friends'. The tunes and the sarcasms and dirty jokes are typical Hollywood with the physical achievements of remaining aged the decade. By mastering Cinematography with acting like Jennifer did: lens and filters are unseen but humor succeeds. Then the visual stimulus or Television Show is a work of achievement with their 'studio' apartment standing the test of time; ten years in cinematography and acting. The show has ASTONISHED US WITH HUMOR for the following fourteen years from two thousand and four finale.
10.0~Along with Seinfeld, the best show of all time! royals794 Sign in Permalink As one of the most devoted Seinfeld fans in the world, I avoided Friends like the plague for years. Though I heard many people loved it, I felt as if I would be committing treason if I were to watch it. After all, "Friends" versus "Seinfeld" is a common debate when people are discussing the top sitcoms of all time. And I was firmly entrenched on the Seinfeld side. That is, until I actually watched an episode. I'm not sure exactly how it came about, but I eventually ended up watching a Friends episode. I hated to admit it, but it was quite funny. Ah, yes, I think I remember how it happened; TBS airs Friends immediately after the Seinfeld reruns I always watch, and I guess I just didn't end up changing the channel. Boy, I'm glad I didn't. After enjoying that first episode, I decided to watch it the next day. And the next. And the next. Then I started Tivoing every episode that aired (which is quite a few, something like five or six Friends episodes are on a day, it's kind of absurd) and watching them in bunches. About a week later, I was hooked. And about 150 episodes later, I'm making my way through them all and convinced that this deserves its place right alongside Seinfeld in the comedy pantheon. There are even certain aspects of Friends which are better than Seinfeld (as difficult as that is for me to admit). Whereas Seinfeld has the edge in each episode's rewatchability factor and quotability, Friends has characters and plot lines that we care about more. The six friends actually appear inseparable and more like our personal friends than the cast of Seinfeld. The cast is pitch perfect, just like Seinfeld's; you can't imagine any other actor in any of the main roles. So, while it may have taken me a couple more years than it took most people, I finally came around on Friends. If you're one of those who haven't, maybe it's because you were a devoted Seinfeld fan like me and couldn't bear to hear the two shows compared. Do yourself a favor; if you haven't watched Friends, give it a shot. I'm sure you'll be hooked in a week.
2.0~This show has a very friendly, unearned rating. NirvanaWi Sign in Permalink I usually don't like to be mean about shows or movies, I'm pretty much ok with the idea that everybody likes different stuff, live and let live. However, when I feel that there has been serious misjustice done in the world of comedy/humor, I can't stay silent. The very reputation of the words "funny", "comedy", "humor", and "hilarious" has been irreparably damaged by shows like this. There are many shows, presently and in the past, that have done this, but they were usually very easily identified and correctly put in their place in the ol' 'sub-par' category. However, after seeing the rating this show has received, I felt it was my duty to dispel the ridiculous rating of 8.9 (as of 2/17/19) and one should not be deceived by such numbers. Ok, 'Friends': This is a show for people with a bland, generic, tame, underdeveloped and/or a non-existent sense of humor who want to feel like they're normal people that have a good sense of humor. But alas, it may be genetic, or it may be environmental, but there is simply a large segment of the population that are incapable of distinguising what is genuinely funny. It's not their fault. They can't change. It's too late. But we don't want to make them sad, or feel left out, so that's the reason shows like this one are created. This show labels itself a sitcom, but it seems that it couldn't make up its mind on whether to be a sitcom, a dramedy, or a soap opera for teenagers/early 20-somethings. But I understand why it has this identity crisis. If you're catering to the audience I described in the previous paragraph, you know that, because of their underdeveloped sense of humor, they would not be able to keep their attention on the show if it was more strictly comedy/humor-driven with maybe a drop of drama/sentimentality here and there (think along the lines of 'The King of Queens'), so big batches of non-comedy time needed to be dumped into to 'Friends'. The range of humor these people get is so limited that the show couldn't expect to fill more than 10 minutes of comedy, and they had to keep them tuned in for the whole 22 minutes of airtime, so this is where the terrible (or "amazing" to Friends fans) filler came in. If you think all that sounds appealing, or you know you're in the demographic of being humor-deficient, then by all means, watch 'Friends', you will love and enjoy it. There's nothing wrong with that, that's what it's there for, people like youself. But to those reading this that like to laugh at things that are actually funny, and enjoy the many facets and types of comedy in the world, I urge you not to watch this show, as chunks of your sense of humor may wither and die if subjected to 'Friends' in any amount. FYI: I don't like to rate things 1 star, because it kinda makes me feel sad. So I had to come up with reasons to give this tv show 2 starts. The reasons I came up with are, as follows: 1.) Courteney Cox gets a lot of cool points in my book because she was in Bruce Springsteen's video for 'Dancing In The Dark'. And she's hot. 2.) Lisa Kudrow was in an episode of a truly funny show ('Cheers') and she had black hair in it and she was sexy with black hair. Ok, 2 stars justified now. Goodbye.
6.0~Brutally Overrated Snatch_that Sign in Permalink Friends is funny but vastly overrated. ------------------------------ The show cotton candy for your brain, you don't feel emotions when watching friends... You just sit, and laugh at the silly jokes that aren't often that good. The characters are average at best and arguably there's only two funny characters. It's a pity that this overrated TV series is above Suits, Mad Men, Archer, and South Park, and shares a list with Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and House of Cards. Friends being so highly rated on IMDb kind of makes me loose hope in humanity. It's completely fine if you watch this and you enjoy it, but don't rate it as highly as other TV masterpieces.
10.0~Get involved achraj Sign in Permalink While watching friends I use to always forget that it is a TV show and those are actors I'm looking at. They seem so real, every character in the serial was having its own personality different from others. You get so involved in their reel life that you don't realize it is not real. I use to laugh with them, cry with them feel every emotion that came across to me. I liked Monica's perfectionism, Joey's innocence, Chandlers witty humor, Phoebe's unique imagination, Rose's efforts to prove his intelligence and Rachel's style. No one must have thought combination of all this can deliver a fabulous show with success like this. Friends night was always a fun night, full of pure joy and laughter. Original sense of humor brought out so naturally that you will never think it was acted by these very good actors. I must also appreciate the writer, director and crew that worked behind camera to make this show a huge success and bring FRIENDS on TV and in our living rooms. Cheers to ALL !!
10.0~The best show ever made! tradcliffe284 Sign in Permalink I must have watched the whole of friends 4 or 5 times, and it is still incredibly funny. The actors are funny and they play of each other fantastically, and the story lines are great. But what also makes it wonderful that it can also be it can go from funny to sad in moments. I don't understand how some of you people can say that the show is awful. OK, maybe for some people it is not the best show ever, but to say it is the most overrated show ever, now that is over the top! Whenever i have had a bad day, I just pull out a DVD of the series and watch an episode. It can lift you so much with laughs around every corner. Even the theme tune is brilliant. Everything about this show is masterclass, and it deserves every award that it ever got. I actually think that it deserved more awards!! This show will live forever, and will never stop making us laugh!
10.0~Best Show Ever !!! farrukh_rabah Sign in Permalink This is simply the best show I have ever seen, no ifs or buts about it. The characters are so Awesome, with well written storyline, that it is the best comedy show out yet and maybe forever. It also gets emotional sometimes and crazy. I love, love and love this show. I really want the whole cast to get back together and make another great show or maybe film (As long as I'll get to see them again). I hope to see them one day (hopefully). (Crying) In short, if you haven't already watched this show, then watch it quickly because you're missing so much. And if you have already watched it then watch it again and again and again........ 10/10... 100/100... Great Show ! Now that Friends Reunion is coming up (with less of Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing)), I am super excited. February 21, 2016! ;) And did I mention how great this show was? Hmmm...
10.0~fun laughters with enjoyable friends! charlotte234-1 Sign in Permalink 6 friends in USA having conversations and laughing. i think friends is a funny suitable series. it would be an absolute crime not to see it. i was very upset when it ended and i thought friends is always happy and its a comedy you can never get sick of. i've watched each series like 800 times. trust me, i know it sounds lame but when you see it you'll regret not wanting to see it, you will be laughing non-stop. believe it or not once you collect all the friends collection i believe you will have a special gift. i call it the friends gift. if you are not good at friendship friends is also good for advice. watch it, you'll love it. you are at this moment like "yeah right". but when you'll see it you won't be able to speak because your laughing so much and you want to watch it again and again. its the comedy no-one unless their mad will get sick of. i swear that you'll love it!
10.0~Greatest sitcom ever!!! jimlivinitup Sign in Permalink Has change mine and a lot of my friends lives. Not original but brilliant! Sad that it ended though. The characters are interesting, well written, lovable and everyone can relate to one of them. Who hasn't said a Chandler quote??! It's good to see an American sitcom that isn't stereotypical with the American Dream so prevalent. There's no big houses, quiet suburbs, stereotypical teenagers and doesn't bother with "hard pressing " issues such as drugs. This show reminds us why we have so much American TV because all the other channels want there own Friends. When it ended it was an end of an fantastic era and this sitcom will go down as the most influential ever.
10.0~Probably the Worlds Best Sitcom.... ReginaPhilangeakaPhoebe Sign in Permalink Friends is one of my ultimate favourites (number 1) this show is full of fun laughs that still lingers in your mind and still makes you life and the coolest characters- their sense of humour which is so special that it brings the show to life...and they are all charming and unique: Phoebe with her hippie personality and weirdness and her musical talent... Joey with his boyish good looks, flirty and dopey personality ( his chat up line: "How U Doin'?") Monica with her obsessiveness, shrill and competitive persona, Ross with his many divorces and a thing for dinosaurs (Monica's response "when are those going to become extinct?") Rachel gives off the spoilt brat, daddy's girl aura yet she is sweet... and finally chandler(my ultimate favourite character) with his overall good nature, sarcasm, cheeky personality, legendary wit, and non-stop barrage of jokes. This show has truly touched lives and and always be remembered by millions - this show will live on for a hundred years
10.0~The best sitcom ever! omer-fe25 Sign in Permalink I want to say this shows subject shortly: Rachel Green's grown up. In the first scene Rachel was came the Coffee house with wedding dress she is little perky and silly. And she is became manager and she have responsible. I was first season hate from her but next to time i love Rachel. But my really really favorite character is Chandler Bingg!! I love his sarcasm and joke!When my life goes the bad my first job is watching random friends episodes.
10.0~13 years after Friends ended, it's still the best! jimmymendez Sign in Permalink Compared to a lot of current sitcoms I still prefer to watch this show. I watch the reruns over and over again. Got the DVDs if there's nothing good on TV. Our favorite character is Monica. She's just like my wife though I'm no Chandler. Our next favorite character is Phoebe. Though we like Jennifer Aniston as an actress but Rachel is our least favorite character.
10.0~About great vfx and spoiler kumararpit-26578 Sign in Permalink This television series is too good as well as game of thrones. 😊😊
10.0~A guide to live peacefully mailalputku Sign in Permalink Apart from being my favorite comedy show by far, Friends is an awesome series of how a life could be peaceful, youthful and be satisfying. As humans we were born in different places; had different experiences and this gives us our unique personality. Even though variations are wealth to this world, people have to understand specific things in order to be happy and deal with problems or to not to cause a problem to someone else. This series shows lots of examples in so many areas such as love life, health, career. And does show problems and solutions. Even though it is impossible to show all possible problem in this earth, this series can give people the main idea. Friends and family, people who could be trusted CAN help us and we SHOULD help each other (this is a fact we forget most of the time or we ignore people most of the time) ; in order to do that we have to accept each other first. No matter how different we are, with respect and understanding we can easily witness that all the behaviors have explainable backgrounds and their objectives are actually same in every human being. Consensus in a community is always possible. Loyalty makes relationships and friendships strong and keeps them satisfying thus happy. Our approach is also important too. Approach to other people and feed-backs we get from their expressions are vital for our social achievements. Those very different 6 people are good examples of all these because them being themselves didn't effect their life bad unless they forgot those rules and in the end being their selves directed them to someplace they didn't expect but would make them happy. It should be shown to every person.
10.0~A decade of fun! MaxBorg89 Sign in Permalink First came Seinfeld, then Frasier, and finally Friends: the three sitcom milestones of the '90s. And yet only Friends is constantly mentioned when that decade comes up in conversations all over the world. What is that extra something that made it a worldwide hit, whereas the other two went pretty much unnoticed outside the States? Well, Frasier is a bit of a hard sell in non-English-speaking countries (some of the jokes get lost in translation, especially if dubbed), and Seinfeld just had the bad luck of receiving poor time slots because, like many Americans prior to 1992 (the year the fourth season went on the air), people didn't realize it was the best comedy on television. Friends, on the other hand, was a straightforward tale of six people who knew they could always rely on each other. That winning formula is what made it the most popular American sitcom of the '90s, not to mention one of the best. Set in the quintessential sitcom city, Manhattan, the show starts in a fundamental location: the coffee shop where the six friends meet, much like the Happy Days gang used to hang out at Arnold's. It's where many of the series' key scenes happen, including the magic moment when the group is fully formed (one of them didn't actually join the "team" until a couple of minutes into the first episode). All of them are twenty-somethings, and each one has his or her own set of problems: Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) must try to live by herself and not rely on her parents' credit cards anymore; Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is always struggling to obtain her folks' approval (plus, she's obsessed with everything being like she left it in the house); Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) refuses to accept the fact that she isn't very talented as a singer and has a penchant for weird behavior in general; Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is very popular with the ladies, but less so when it comes to auditioning for film roles (he isn't very bright, either); Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is forever haunted by a messed-up childhood; and Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer), aside from being deeply in love with Rachel, has a tendency to whine and fall for the wrong women (he married a lesbian). Over the course of ten years, those six characters evolve, fall in love, get married, have children and other things, though not necessarily in that order. It isn't what happens that's important, though: it's who it happens to that makes the difference. The main reason Friends lasted over 200 episodes is that it centered around those six people, and had those six actors playing them. Is it possible to imagine anyone else as the adorably dim Joey, the nerdy Ross or the feisty Phoebe? Sure, giving LeBlanc his own spin-off show was a mistake (Joey's no Frasier, for crying out loud), but for ten years he and his five co-stars kept viewers hooked to the small screen, simply because they had become a family television couldn't afford to be without. Whereas Seinfeld had the creative boldness and Frasier the wonderfully sophisticated wit, Friends lived on because it was so damn funny, and it was all due to the cast. Of course, a Simpsons-worthy list of guest stars didn't damage the show's popularity, either. From Bruce Willis to Charlton Heston, via Sean Penn, Brad Pitt (sharing the screen with then-wife Aniston in an unexpected, very funny way) and George Clooney (spoofing his ER role alongside co-star Noah Wyle), each visiting A-lister brought something special. But at its core, the show's real value lies in the title: even now, who doesn't miss LeBlanc's "How you doin'?", Kudrow's vitality or Perry's mistimed puns? They were - and still are - the kind of friends everyone would want to have: honest, reliable and funny. Three characteristics that make sure Friends will always be remembered as an essential American sitcom.
1.0~Five Friends are better than six, so toss Ross brallieh8r222 Sign in Permalink Ross is the absolute worst character in all of history. He makes me want to die. What a loser, Rachel deserved better.
10.0~Just Beyond Explanation newyashveer Sign in Permalink One of the best comedies and characters out there which keeps me alive during stressful days. Its an addiction as well as memory u will never forget for your whole life. A must must watch for everyone. The stars include Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry. At its best, Friends operates like a first-rate Broadway farce, complete with slamming doors, twisty plots, and intricately strung together jokes. And even when it's not at its best, the crack acting and piquant punchlines give Friends a momentum and charm that win you over even if you're not laughing and finally LeBlanc is a rarity - a hunk with a gift for deadpan comedy .
10.0~Is there any way I can give 11 out of 10 mrunalshikharerocks Sign in Permalink It's best series ever made !!! I started watching it a months ago like 15 years later after it's official end. God ! I am so thankful to all the guys who made this series. I really consider myself as luckiest person that I watched it before I die. It's been unforgettable journey. End really made me cry ... It was so perfect and so emotional. There will be NO REPLACEMENT to this series ever. This show teaches us meaning of love and friendship. I really thankful to the cast Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer for giving this incredible experience of F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
10.0~About the show njpandya Sign in Permalink Dear all, What should I say about this show. The writers, directors, composers & every cast and crew members of this sow deserves a standing ovation. The best comedy yet cultural show I have ever encountered. I am from India and I never used to watch Engish shows. But I started from Big Bang, HIMYM, ROE, The Middle, Seinfeld to name some of the best in comedy in my opinion but when I saw Friends, this stands out. What a dynamic and natural talents these actors had. I literally, yes literally fall from my bed laughing my ass off. The best Sarcastic person in comedy I ever seen is David Schwimmer & Matthew Perry. I cannot separate who is the best these 6 people were soul of this episodes, but still if someone insist I will say Jennifer Aniston & Phoebe happy go lucky cutiepie. Thanks to directors and all the members, actors & actress to make us laugh.
9.0~Top-notch Comedy freemantle_uk Sign in Permalink Friends did pretty much rule American comedy culture and one of the most popular programmes in the world. The premise of the sitcom is about six friends from New York starting, in their mid 20s and goes into their 30s. They are Rachel Green, a woman working in the fashion industry; Ross Gellar, a paleontologist who is in love with Rachel; Monica Gellar, Ross' sister, Rachel's best friend and a successful chef; Chandler Bing, an office manager, Ross university roommate and later marries Monica; Joey Tribbiani, an actor who loves women and food; and finally Phoebe Buffay, a masseuse and the most Bohemian of the group. Friends had some top writers working on the show and kept it consituenly funny, also had drama and strong character development and you see how they all change. Everyone has a favourite character, my was Chancellor. This is comfort viewing, it doesn't matter how many times you have seen it you can just easily watch it over and over again. I grew up with Friends, and like the Simpsons at its peak a highlight of how good American television can be. Friends was also able to employ top guest stars such as Bruce Willis, Tom Selleck and Hank Azaria. The key actors all had a excellent comedic timing and Friends always did well at the Emmys. There are some problems in later series. Joey slowly becomes more dumber; when Friends started, Joey was not as well read as the other character but he wasn't stupid. However his intelligence level fell as the show progressed. Also Ross become more nonionic and Phoebe is made more wacky and less realist as a character. Friends is comfort viewing.
10.0~Friends silviamendoza-44334 Sign in Permalink This is honestly one of the best sit-cons ever. It's the kind of show that you could binge watch in like a week and after you're done with it, you'll want to re-watch all the episodes again. The show itself is just great and I highly recommend.
10.0~they turned ,but never eave bolan-3 Sign in Permalink I have newly gone through friends,it took me 3 months.for three months, i have been thinking maybe there are people like them are living at some corner of this world.they are not rich,not famous,not that smart,but they are happy,happy together.ten years, what a long time,i have never thought i can have friends for 10 years.amazing,is not it?for three months, i have been thinking i was just at some corner of their house,watching them, laughing with them, tearing with.when i finished the whole thing, i laid on my bed and could not sleep. just cannot believe they are gone, and will never be back.cannot forget Rachel's cry and Chandler's joke(though sometimes i didn't get them)
1.0~Hilarious Show!!! But Reason to hate sivaramkumar91 Sign in Permalink First of all, I want to say I became a big fan of all these 6 characters after saw this show. And I downloaded all of these lead role actors movies and watch it. Each and every show is funny and hilarious. I became addict to this show and want to see a movie, at least a Thanksgiving. But there is no news about continuing the show. So I ended up to watch every episodes again and again. Then I find a each and every bit of details in these episodes. For this extra ordinary story telling, my thumbs are up!!! But in Season 8 Episode 8,The One with the Stripper, Mona is kicking the God Ganesh Statue with her Boots while kissing Ross.It is such a slap in my believe...!!!. Why they have to include this scene. The respective people in this show, should avoided this scene. It was telecast in 2001, and we people didn't have these channels or even a knowledge about this show. If it is played by now, I am sure the people like me, will raise the questions and the show people paid the consequences. Because of this one scene, I am not going to say this show is bad. But They should avoid this kinds of scene at least in future.
10.0~Best ever suhaib89 Sign in Permalink The best comedy I've ever seen. I've seen the show three times. Every time I watch it, it's like I'm watching it for the first time. I was so touched.
10.0~A must watch TV show advikgupta Sign in Permalink F.R.I.E.N.D.S What can I say.. The best comedy and overall sitcom ever! It is about a group of 6 friends based in New York and their everyday experiences and mash ups. It is not only very humorous but makes you understand the importance of friends in life! Each and every episode makes you stick to your couch and watch the bonding that they share.You never get tired of friends! It is so much close to real life. The fun ,the love ,the romance ,the "chandler sarcasm", the "joey stupidness" is just immortal. Even after 20 years of friends it is just as good and has only become better! I strongly recommend you to watch FRIENDS as you will fall in love with it!
10.0~Why do i watch this again and again and again and feel WOW bartom-612-185848 Sign in Permalink If anyone can answer this question, that would be amazing. I have seen a lot of TV and nothing has struck the chord like this. Granted its got flaws and plot holes, but who cares? Then i start to think what was this that made FRIENDS the way it is The characters are likable, relatable and pretty legit for the time The situations they go into are the situations almost each of us get into Your reactions would be the same if you had friends such as them No convoluted plot points to make sure you savor the moment Every character was given equal importance and their part in making sure you tear up There was no re-casting, which made you so involved Every guest appearance was unique in their own terms, they were not stereotypical, characters and just felt like part of the team Friendshp is personified, work life balance depicted in the best way It does not strive hard to spread any message at all, which makes it a treat to the eyes The jokes are timed perfect, sarcasm is used appropriately Premise is way too simple and so is the end. It just feels like end of a episode but its the end of series. Everyone's job is unique despite the fact that they were in high school together I don't think any show was made biggest public influences than this None of the cast of any other TV show was on Oprah explaining to whole world their personal aftermaths of ending the sit-com I just could keep going on and on. but the list would be endless and it would different from every person's perspective of life and that again is a success. Each person could look at these episodes from their lens of life and can relate to them. Any party i have been whenever i say can we watch FRIENDS, there has never been a NO. That is how powerful and loving this is and By the way the opening song, best for any Sit-com. I hated that they ended it, but looking at the actors now, i think its good that they did. They had their run and it has to stop somewhere and they stopped at the right time. Thank you to the cast and crew for giving us this marvel and i cannot thank enough the cast for their exceptional involvement and giving us this treat which i will cherish for ever and ever
10.0~The best TV series ever! carlos_ds730 Sign in Permalink Without a doubt Friends is funniest TV show ever. Almost everything is excellent in Friends, the one thing I didn't like was the time when Joy and Rachel were dating. I've watched those ten seasons more than 15 times, and every time I do it I find new things, it's simply amazing. In my opinion the best episodes are: - The one with the poker - The one with two parties (the part when Ross uses Dr Green's glasses is hilarious) - The one with Joey's dirty day - The one with Unagi - The one where Rachel tells (Ross's face when Rachel tells him she is pregnant is spectacular) - The one with the video tape - The one with the last one I must say, every time I watch the final scene I feel that a very good friend is going away
10.0~The Last One :'( bikerboys1994 Sign in Permalink I just finished watching friends. I can not believe that it has ended. one of the best shows I have ever scene and perhaps will remain the best ever. I have learned many things from this show, the most important one is "Cherish each and every moment with your friends, they will always be there for you".....'sure...where????' LOL. Okay so the ending was very unexpected and i must say it was very emotional too. I felt like crying but was laughing my ass off as well! I simply can not stop myself from praising the show every now and then. The plot, characters, story line etc was just perfect. I miss the show already :( I hope that they make new seasons.
10.0~8.9... But still underrated PimSollieFilm Sign in Permalink This show has a 8.9 but it's still underrated! It deserves a 10, to my opinion, but a >9.5 would be pretty close to it's real worth too. The people who created Friends have a special gift, otherwise this show wouldn't be so damn funny and so successful. And with 'people' I do not only mean David Crane and Marta Kauffman. I'm not saying that without Jennifer Aniston, Courteny Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer this show would suck but I think it would be less funny. And that's because these actors make the Friends characters alive in such a fun way that EVERY episode I laugh my ass off... Even after 15 times I've seen all ten series. But we shouldn't forget the writers of course! 'Cause, and that's a sure thing, without them this show WOULD've sucked. The dialogues they write are hilarious and, yes I'll say it again, make me laugh at EVERY episode! Even when I'm not watching the show they make me laugh when I'm paying a picture in my head. I don't think I can say more about this show without boring the few people that read this comment. Just that this is THE BEST COMEDY SHOW EVER and it's major UNDERRATED. I give it a 10/10, please do that too, 'cause than you have a great knowledge of what funny is.
1.0~Please someone save us!!! mafster Sign in Permalink Well, where do I start. This television series (won't call it comedy) is the sorriest pile of rubbish I have ever seen. The funniest thing about this series is that it somehow is called a comedy. I can never see anything funny about it at all. The jokes are like those cheap ones you get out of Christmas crackers. I don't know if it's the American humour but I know there are other American comedies out there that are a lot better than Friends. They've taken a perfectly good song and ruined that too. When it plays up on the radio I feel physically sick. The acting is soooo cheap and tacky. The attempted jokes are basic and flat. I think the writers need a good lesson in comedy. Here's a good list:- Only Fools & Horses, Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances, The Office, Alan Partirdge and the list goes on. I think Friends is as enjoyable as having acid thrown into your face or maybe being strapped to a firework and sent miles up into the sky.
9.0~Oh.... falakkas Sign in Permalink I can't say words words can describe this Series is so great the characters Joey , Chandler Monica , Ross , Rachel is so so so great
10.0~Amazing👍👍👍 akshitsh Sign in Permalink Just amazing... Though all the actors in the show are amazing but i personally like joe and chandler, their comic timing is quite amazing. I wonder why i hv been 24 years late to see this amazing show...
10.0~Friends! marian_radu62 Sign in Permalink This is the "benchmark" for comedy. Everything is "perfect" here the script, the acting and the actors. Mathew Perry, David Schwimmer, Matt Leblanc, Jennifer Aniston, Courteny Cox and Lisa Kudrow all six form one hell of a team. It is one of the greatest ensemble of pure talent ever. Every presented a unique set of comedy. This is the "benchmark" for comedy. Everything is "perfect" here the script, the acting and the actors.

10.0~will never get old atinder Sign in Permalink I did get into friends bit late, i think was near end of Season 4 and the first episode I saw I fell in love with the show. I Loved the show, it didn't take me to long catch up on show, now i love watching the repeats of Friends everyday even twice day. when nothing on TV will watch friends DVD, as I have all of series on DVD. Friends have some great story lines such Ross and Rachell on and off, Getting married Vegas, having baby again and in even in final, Sometimes when Ross is by him self, dose silly such as getting teeth really white so you can see them in dark, Messing up it tanning place, getting stuck in pants. All season are great but season 5 the out shine the rest as it was peak five in the show, Mon and Chan secrets running around, one by one everyone else find out, it so hilarious. Then best thing about show like is it can be funny and they can have some sad episode. When Mon and Chan find out that they can't have baby, which is really sad as Mon as always wanted a baby from day 1. Acting is show as well as the script was outstanding. 10/10 i will always love this show
10.0~Best TV serial ever cpg17 Sign in Permalink hi,i watched ''FRIENDS'' when i was younger,i remember how i liked them!even then i think that show is great!And now after ~8 years I also think in that way.Everybody in this show acted just brilliant.Monika with her obsession to clean,Chandler with his jokes,Ross with his dinosaurs stuff ,Phoebe with her difference,Joey with his ''How you doing?,and finally Rachel with her fashion.''The most I liked relationships between them all.I just like many other fans of ''Friends'' watched every series and hoped that Ross gonna be with Rachel together.When I watched last series of ''Friends'' I really understood that I will miss this show!I will miss those jokes,those faces,smiles,all what they did! that was an excellent TV show! 10/10 my vote for show!
10.0~Will be greatly missed. grumpyass Sign in Permalink I for one would like to say that I will definitely miss the show. I love this show a whole bunch. I have a passion for it. I have watched every episode and some more than others, and for those reruns I have seen over and over, they bust me up every time. I wish the show would go on forever but i understand that some of the cast members would like to move on. I can't wait for Joey's spin off though, that will be excellent. Maybe some day after a while they will have a reunion show to bring back everyone for one last time. For now I would like to say, to the cast of FRIENDS you will be greatly be missed by one fan and probably many others. Good luck with the future.
10.0~THE BEST SHOW EVER MADE (Needed to be written with capitals!) zvonejerkovic Sign in Permalink I'll keep it simple and short. This is the one and only show/movie I gave ''10 out of 10'', and if there was 11 i would gave it 11. Why? Humor in shows and movies evolve, what's funny today, won't be funny tomorrow, and what was funny yesterday, won't be funny today, but the thing with ''Friends'' is that their humor is not predictable in any way as that is case with other shows, and they make you laugh every time you watch them, no matter if you've watched them 100 times or more. It's one of those shows that you can watch with friends, girlfriend or alone. It's also one of those shows that you can watch no matter if you're sad or happy, it'll always make you smile. Simply said, it's THE BEST SHOW EVER MADE!
10.0~best show EVER loftong Sign in Permalink I love it and it is so amazing (Season 10 episode 11) "The one where the stripper cries) is amazing
10.0~The Best Sitcom Ever on Television frankdahiya23 Sign in Permalink There can never be a better Comedy show than this one ever in the history of Television even in the future. Everything about this show was top class. The actors, the characters, story, punches, everything. I have seen tons of sitcoms but I never had hard time in comparing them and finding out best because by default FRIENDS has been the best by miles. I feel very sad that it ended but happy to see that it ended on a high note and made legacy and was not dragged more seasons to just kill it's Legacy like a few others which are done long time ago but still running. I miss them lot but unfortunately that's all we can do. Thanks for the memories folks.
10.0~Undoubtedly Best ever TV show tanvir-25596 Sign in Permalink This sure put a smile in my face... :) not to mention, almost a drop of tears at the end... :(
10.0~This is a brilliant show if what you want is to laugh so hard that your tummy will hurt! Jazz1987_ Sign in Permalink 6 friends are always together but, at the same time, have their own lives. It's really hilarious.Every friend has his/her own personality which makes "Friends" a brilliant pastime. The only drawback is that it has to finish. I've watched the complete series twice and I don't get bored of it! In case anyone wants to watch the bets episodes, my favourites are the 21st and the last of the third season, the 1st of the 4th season and the last of the tenth season!they are absolutely brilliant, but I recommend you watch them all in order. Each season represents a year, so there are ten Christmas' and thanks givings which are always great! and if you don't know what to give someone for a present get them a season, my sister did that for my birthday and months later I still enjoy it as much as when I got it! and if you are trying to learn another language it's great as you don't get tired of it, so you can watch it in your language and some time later in another so that you can understand it but listening to another language (my boyfriend is studying English-he's Spanish- and watches friends in English with me!). Enjoy!
1.0~Bad acting + male bashing + lazy inconsistency = one grossly overrated show! backup-50362 Sign in Permalink Revisiting this show as an adult brings no laughter and good memories, but disappointment that I ever thought it was decent. What an overrated charade. The writing is extremely inconsistent. Characters change traits and in/conveniently forget recent events in between episodes so often that you wonder if the writers had a goldfish memory span or something. Lisa Kudrow can barely string a sentence without smirking out of character even in "serious" scenes. Her character is annoying to no extent, with an unrealistically high self-image and constantly being ungrateful to kind gestures, much like Monica and Rachel. None of the female characters are likable and all of the male ones act like cucks, praising them, while getting constantly belittled by them. The only decent actors are Matthew Perry and Schwimmer, who often make an otherwise unwatchable show somewhat decent with their performances, but unfortunately the rest of the cast is really low tier. Matt LeBlanc is actually not that bad, I've seen him in Married with Children, sometimes he's even great, but I can't say a single good thing about the rest of them. The woman who plays Rachel can barely act, she's been doing the same cringe-worthy smirks and lines for 40 years and was clearly going trough life thanks to the cuckery of the men around her who gave her the acting job and handed her everything without her having to develop a single talent or earn anything herself, clearly. If she wasn't mildly attractive by 90's standards she wouldn't get anywhere. And that's all, all she used was her looks, thinking it's enough. The woman who plays Monica occasionally does a good performance but gets extremely bland and lazy in the later seasons. Even Gunther, who barely had any lines gave more of a memorable performance. Microphones, equipment and studio lights are often visible. The same annoying laugh tracks repeat trough all the seasons. When I was 8 and I first saw the show I thought it was funny but as an adult with a fully developed brain - I can now realize how bland, misandric and lazy it really is; grossly overrated. Each episode glorifies the girls and belittles/emasculates the guys in some ridiculous way, plot developments where Ross was nice to Rachel are conveniently forgotten so he can be portrayed badly, while she's walking all over him and it's never acknowledged as a bad thing, but constantly repeated as "funny". The hateful, feminist undertones were a new thing for a show in the 90's so good job on that one, might be one of the first misandric shows to start this trend, then continued in other terrible shows such as Two and Half Men. Overall if your IQ or age is under 10 - you might (have) enjoy(ed) this show, otherwise you might have problems if you still think it's good even trough nostalgia glasses.
10.0~The best :d tinnaa93 Sign in Permalink Friends, My favorite show i have seen all the series about million times, i still cry over the 4 last shows, and laugh of all the jokes, i still love every twist, i love the London trip, i love the fact that they didn't cover up Lisa Kudrows(phoebe's) pregnancy but instead they put a osom story line full of humor and what we all love i carrying my brothers baby, that line still cracks me up, i love all about the show maybe I'm addicted or something but it's the only TV show or movie that i have ever gotten this attached, why is that? it's because of the incredible writing how they give comedy a whole new name, but i wanna talk about 2 of the characters / actors, Chandler Bing . Chandler just cracks me up, he was just pure genius, how can writers find this stuff up? he is just so funny, he is with out a doubt my favorite male character, now something about Chandler he's was Ross friend from college that is his connection to the group, Monica's teen crush, but Chandler also said she was fat and that resulted into Chandler losing his toe, later he Hooke's up with Monica and the get married and have adopted twins, but we all know that don't we?. he is one of the 7 links what make friends "friends". and your probably wondering why i said seven thats because of Gunther i just love that guy. Matthew Perry. ill make this short, he's a funny dude has had his up and downs, drugs and problems, but i really like him as an actor. Ross Geller . He has this kind of silly and i like it :') . he is an "pailiantolabla-bla" i have no idea what his jobs name is but as joey says your work is dinosaurs. but as we all say we miss friends but its over and we love them
10.0~Best show EVER! buz-762-511954 Sign in Permalink Did you know? Because of a bet between Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis, on the set of the "Whole Nine Yards", (which Perry won), Willis did a two-episode guest role for free. There are many more trivia facts like this one at endedtvseries com Joey's pick-up line, "How you do-in'?" was ranked at #4 in T.V. Guide's list of "T.V.'s top 20 catchphrases". Matt LeBlanc's character "Joey Tribbiani", plays "Dr. Drake Ramoray" on a fictional version of the NBC soap opera "Days of Our Lives". Jennifer Aniston's father in real-life plays "Victor Kiriakis" on the actual "Days of our Lives".
10.0~Friends forever. Chrisdimian Sign in Permalink This is probably the best show ever made. It's interesting and funny. There are so many really good jokes to make you laugh. The cast is amazing. Each character has a joke style and you love everyone of them. This is a great show, it gets more exciting with each season. I don't care what episode I watch cause every single "The One with..." is perfect. I can watch it again and again and it's always funny. Never bored of Friends! I want to watch it without a break. Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross they are forever in my heart. This is an unforgettable show. Ireccomend Friends to everyone. You'll all have a good time if you watch it.
10.0~Excellent for non-native English speakers tomybaquero Sign in Permalink A lot of people, myself included, have reported that FRIENDS helped in their learning process of the English language. I truly recommend this series for the community of English learners. One of the best series (comedies) ever.
10.0~Rachel, Monica, Pheobe, Joey, Ross, and Chandler stay friends through fun and tough times. popcorn391 Sign in Permalink This show is the one of the best one's in all of TV history.I feel like these our actually my friends j/k. But seriously Friends shows great honor of friendship. Rachel and Ross end up back together at the end and Monica and Chandler are married with their two adopted twins. How come Pheobe and Joey were never together? Just wondering. A lot of other people love this show too, which makes me wonder why it didn't get the maximum stars. This is one of the few, if not only, shows that cheers me up whenever I'm down and I actually try to plan daily schedule around even though I've seen most of all the episodes. So yeah it's great. I only put that it contains a spoiler as a precaution, just in case. This has got to be at least ten lines by now.
10.0~I still watch friends 4 times a week elsavanswieten Sign in Permalink It's really crazy but I still watch Friends 4 times a week. There is nothing that could cheer me up like this on a full day. The humor, the characters, the details (i see more and more every time - and I've watched every episode A LOT). I was born in 1992 and the last 4-5 seasons I bought when they just came out. I have them all on DVD. I have the Friends Book. Just missing a 'Frankie says hi' t-shirt to join the collection ;-) I just dissapear in the serie when I watch it. Love it. BIG CRAZY FAN says bye! X
10.0~Best thing that could happen to TV. tanmaypaliwal Sign in Permalink There is nothing better in TV series than Friends. The dialogue writing,acting,plot screenplay,jokes,even the back ground music is just so perfect. There is no one I guess who hasn't seen the series once more after watching it all. The last episode just brings tears in your eyes,no matter how many times you watch it you sob inside. The show is like a part of my life.I can't just stop thinking about it everyday. Its a phenomenal piece of work. The character ,"oh my GOD" are just unique and they cannot be more perfect. Each and everyone is different and very important part of the show. The love for this show will never end. Many show will come and go but 'FRIENDS' will always stay in my heart!
9.0~A Classic allstarrunner Sign in Permalink Well what is there to say? It's a classic. Even though I lived through the original airing of this show I never really got around to watching it. Even so, I knew the show was huge - it was everywhere in the culture. I finally decided to watch through the series. It didn't disappoint. What I liked best about the show was the way they managed to weave in emotional high points contrasted with low points in the lives of the characters. That is something that seems to be missing in most of the sitcoms of today - never any true low points in the lives of the characters to connect with them and cheer them on when they achieve the high points. Clearly, it's a show worth watching!
10.0~Just great HourglassUppercut Sign in Permalink Friends is just so easy to enjoy, definitely the comedy of this era. Likeable characters, easy to understand stories, silly yet intelligent comedy. It'll be hard to top.
8.0~The best comedy TV show nowadays danielll_rs Sign in Permalink The best reason for explaining why I like "Friends" is that it is not just a very, very funny comedy, but also has an intelligent screenplay. Well... Many people may say 'If you want something intelligent, watch "Frasier" or "Seinfeld"' But I've already tried to watch them, and I just hated both - they're boring and unfunny, and so is "Ally McBeal". This show is recommended for everyone who wants to laugh very much. The actors are great, specially Lisa Kudrow- one of the funniest actresses in Hollywood nowadays. She's really incredible! So watch it and have great fun! (Fortunately the next season is coming next week to Brazil)
10.0~SOOOOOO GOOOD andreastowell Sign in Permalink If you love drama and comedy, this is the perfect show! No matter how old it gets it's still the best show ever made!
10.0~My friends forever! krissikrissa Sign in Permalink Greatest sitcom and just TV series in the universe pure and simple Friends had the best cast, the best writers and the best fans. The cast is the greatest ever, Matthew Perry, Courtney Cox, Jennifer Anniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc and David Schwimmer could you ask for a better cast, of course we can't forget about Gunther, the acting was always solid, brilliant and hilarious. Over 10 seasons of material 238 shows and I can't find one bad performance from anyone in the main cast or the extras, that's because Friends was a quality show who did nothing half way, they always gave the audience 100% of them self's and that's why Friends is the greatest show on earth. Most of the time the comedy was smart and edgy, often crude and immature, everyone loved friends because there was something for everyone. Show about nothing, just six friends hanging around going through life together, slipping up, making mistakes and finding their purpose. The writers David Crane and Martha Kauffman are my heroes for creating the greatest sitcom ever made and it's going to be a long time until a sitcom is made who had as much effect on as many people like Friends did and is still doing.
10.0~One of the best thing ever happened to me! brijeshvaghani Sign in Permalink I WILL BE THERE FOR YOU!! IMDb genre of this tv show is drama and romance but it is more than that it will teach you the real friendships goals, love between best friends. I think the best sitcom i have ever watched. Really so much to understand from this series, even after around 15 years, like how to spread love , how to take care of our loving people and most importantly how to live life without being sad. Just always be happy no matter what is the situation. Special mentioned for that best bond between chandler and Joey. They both are settling some another level best friendship goals. Every character has something to teach. Very well written, fantastically directed and fabulous acting of these six chandler, monica, joey, ross, rachel, pheebe. If you haven't watched this yet then go and watch if you don't then you are so so gonna regret it Every character is different from each other like, Joey : how you doin Chandler : funny and sarcastic jokes Ross : dinosaur stories and crazy Monica: cleaning and cooking Rachel: shopping and sensitive Pheebe: funny songs, emotional and cazy
10.0~Changed The Term "SITCOM" Forever! asifahsankhan Sign in Permalink The Iconic Sitcom which pretty much 'Singlehandedly', If you leave Seinfeld out of the scene, (Although the two shows serve in an entirely different perspective) defined the television comedy landscape through the entire course of its 10 year run, stretching from the mid 90s to the early 2000s. Besides receiving numerous awards, earning Millions and making Multi- millionaire cast members,, the show established itself as the classic blueprint for various subsequent character- driven sitcoms. Just as the spirit of the 'The Simpsons' runs through every adult animated sitcom, so too does the spectre of Friends continue to hang over most of today's mainstream sitcoms. 'Friends' was an incredibly funny show for most of its run. It felt fresh not because of its approach to comedy but because it featured relatively novel and moderately idiosyncratic characters played by wonderful actors. It also connected with a lot of late-teens and 20- somethings who took vicarious pleasure in a show featuring a set-up they could relate to. As Marta Kauffman, the show's co-creator succinctly put it recently, 'Friends' "was about that time in your life when your friends are your family". Lastly Who could forget the ever changing concept of flirting with the catchiest, cheesiest or dumbest yet sweetest pickup lines that the sitcom gifted us with; though Joey Tribbiani stands out here,"How You Do'n?" The most famous line from FRIENDS. As a matter of fact, I bet You'd find it extremely hard if you try to find A guy in the Late 90's or early 00's who hasn't tried it at least once! Although results may vary, but We tried, WE DID! ~ @asifahsankhan
10.0~All Time Favourite josanjaskirat Sign in Permalink This is honestly the best show EVER!! It's a light hearted and hilarious take on all the problems of the twenties: careers, falling in love, messing up and so much more. This show will forever have my heart and I find myself coming back to it frequently for just some no nonsense laughs. Do yourself and watch this series, and I garuntee you will have a new fave show!
10.0~Hats off to F.R.I.E.N.D.S.! rankutu Sign in Permalink I'm a 16 year old and i didn't grow up watching Friends but now when i started watching it for the past 2 years (some channels in India air friends now also) i came to notice that Friends is totally different from the comedy shows made in our generation like two and a half men, how i met your mother, etc. It totally stands out from the rest. No matter how many times you see a single episode you never get bored. That's not the thing with today's comedy shows. For example, if you see an episode of How I Met Your mother twice you would laugh on the same jokes, you watch it the third time you still laugh a little and then the fourth you actually find it boring. But i don't know what it is about Friends: the acting or the jokes or the awesome characters that makes you laugh every time you see them. Friends was truly a classic sitcom and i really wish they would make a comeback.. In fact, in my personal opinion i think that the actors should have kept the show going till they turned 50... Oh and another advice- never watch the last episode more than once... it really breaks your heart for the fact that Friends will no longer be aired...
10.0~Funny Forever kristian-holland Sign in Permalink This show is amazing, not much else to say about it, it is a great depiction of friendship and it also provides laughter, tears and unforgettable moments throughout the series'. Series 1 was a good series to get the ball rolling, it introduced the characters very well and although it was early days, you could see the chemistry between the cast members. Series 2-8 were all fantastic, with 100's of laughs per episode and many great plots and sub-plots that were just as entertaining as each other. My favourite series' were both series 7 and 8, they were painfully funny and the way they incorporated Jennifer Aniston's pregnancy into the show was terrific, it felt like it should have happened and Jennifer's pregnancy was just well timed. The show started to decline after series 8 with series 9 and 10 not being the best of the bunch but even at it's worse, it was better than most, so for anyone who has been living under a rock for the last 15 years and has never watched this, then I seriously suggest doing so.
10.0~The funniest sitcom come ever craigsiney Sign in Permalink Friends is the funniest thing to hit TV. Ever since 1994 when it started it has been my favourite program on TV. Each season gets funnier. It is such a cheerful comedy series. Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Green. She ran out on her fiancee Barry in 1994. She then moved in with Monica. She fell in love with Ross. She now lives with Phoebe. Courtney Cox plays Monica Geller. She is a suffering chef. She is Ross's sister. She thinks that her parents hate her. She hardly has any relationships. She is currently living with Chandler. Chandler is her fiancee. Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay. She is a dumb blonde. She has a twin sister named Ursula. Her mother lives on the beach. The woman that she thought was her mom died when she was still young. Her step-father is in prison. She still has not met her real dad. Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing. Chandler is the funniest in the show. He used to live with Joey. He was roommates with Ross in high school. He is often thought to be gay. His mother is a famous author. His father is gay. He is living with Monica. Matt LeBlanc plays Joey Tribbiani. Joey is Italian. He has a large family. He is also very funny. He has chicks crawling all over him. He is a stuggling actor. David Schwimmer plays Ross Geller. Ross is a very sad individual. He used to work at a museum as a paleantologist. He now lives alone. He used to have a monkey. His ex-wife is a lesbian. His son's name is Ben. He had another wife. He also married Rachel when he was drunk.
1.0~Totally overrated laurapacino Sign in Permalink Probably the unfunniest programme ever. The humour is childish and the characters so irritating. AVOID
10.0~The BEST sitcom ever.. No! The best TV show ever thyagarajan_ram-430-837125 Sign in Permalink It has been more than 10 years since Friends aired its series finale. But till date, there has not been a better TV show created. It is only because the six lead characters of FRIENDS are so adorable and lovable. One literally cannot single out a single favorite character. When your mood is down, all you have to do is watch a random FRIENDS episode to cheer yourself up. My personal favorite character would be Monica Geller as she is probably the warmest and most affable among the six lead characters. The only flaw in the show would probably be the fact that Joey never gets married till the end of the series. Maybe that is why they created a spin-off series in his name
10.0~Funniest, warmest and coolest! goga-17340 Sign in Permalink The best series! I just finished the last season, and I think I will rewatch it soon! Tons of laugh, tons of smiled ! This movie is a real mood elevating even when you have hard times! Recommended 100%
10.0~Best show i have ever seen mezoo-20048 Sign in Permalink Comedy with drama in brilliant mix and great ending
1.0~Shallow yuppie comedy Irish-Sunglasses Sign in Permalink TV does influence society...just look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted. Besides, real people who look as good as these people do don't have any problems. Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft considering what they do for a living? NBC just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they're just around Gump's level. I know a person who makes $100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $2200 a month in rent. I'd like to see a show called Phriends, where it's six ugly nobodies in dead-end jobs, living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every week...and then the landlord jacks up the rent. Now THAT I would watch.

10.0~An Amazing Masterpiece deskojordan Sign in Permalink For 10 years, Friends made people laugh. When it ended, I was just a little kid, so I never watched it then. It's just the show that never stops making us laugh. It is hard to have the perfect Sitcom, but this was definitely it. It had it's moments that had us feel like the show was ridiculous and crazy. But, it always had a good story. The last episode made me cry, and I do not cry a lot. I recommend watching this.
10.0~Funny yet so touching j_rodrigues_b Sign in Permalink Friends is a funny series and I'm pretty sure no one doubts that but what truly cuts it for me is that it has the ability to produce such touching moments like the death of mr.heckels, the part where Joey leaves the apartment and Especially the ending. Another great thing I like about the show is that there isn't a main character so you just pick the character you like the most and that you identify with and you pay extra attention to that character. With 6 "main" characters you would think that there wouldn't be any room for side characters but with episodes of only about 25 minutes the show still manages to balance the six main characters, the side characters that appear from time to time and the special guests that are more than common. And did I mention the theme song rocks? Anyways with all that said I truly believe Friends is the best sitcom ever made.
10.0~How You doing.? msachin-76258 Sign in Permalink Best Thing i ever see to make me..must watch ...............
10.0~The best series ever nehafudge Sign in Permalink Even after watching every single episode at least 20 times, I can't get enough if it. My go to series!
10.0~One Masterpiece mmalahmad Sign in Permalink After 15 years it will still be my favorite show to watch, the one and only one no one can copy
10.0~Groundbreaking in its genre. fajarsantoso Sign in Permalink I watched friends for the 1st time back in 1995. Didn't found it that interesting but that was probably because I couldn't relate to the topics of each episodes. But along the way, I started to watch it more and more and almost 25 years later I still do. That's why I rated it a 10*. The reason why it was one of the most succesful sitcom in its genre and is still being broadcasted in countries around the world is that everybody can relate to it one way or the other. The topics of each episodes is all about life during your 20s and 30s. Boyfriends/girlfriends, career, family issues, money, bills, ups & downs, it is all being discussed in Friends. And whether you watched it 20 years ago or you just started to watch it, the topics will always be relevant no matter what.
10.0~The Greatest TV Show ever.. alexbryan_08 Sign in Permalink when i first saw FRIENDS on TV... i have no feelings at all.. because at that time, i don't understand a word of English.. so, i didn't understand what are so funny about them.. then i went to university.. learned English.. One day i found a CD case of FRIENDS season 5 at movie store.. i don't realize that i bought the CD case until i found it next to my laptop at the evening.. then i watch it.. it's funny.. watch it again.. hilarious.. watch it again and again.. amazing, I've never feel bored watching them.. now that i saw all the season, i miss them so much.. he he.. hope that show never end.. FRIENDS forever... Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, Joey.. Love you guys..
10.0~Excellent chocolateboxdude Sign in Permalink The show was amazing I watched it twice and I'm going to again! I enjoyed watching it every time and i have many friends who agree. The show has a great mixture of life lessons and comedy making anyone who watches enjoy it no matter their race, age, or gender. I recommend this show to anyone who needs a laugh and wants to ignore reality!
10.0~Everybody loves this show. HollistonSharron Sign in Permalink Everyone of all ages love this show and its nice to see it's still alive.
10.0~All-time favourite. amelia4201 Sign in Permalink I grew up on Friends, and no matter what other people say it will always be my all-time favourite. To this day, Matthew Perry's Chandler is one of my favourite characters ever. He is frustrated, sarcastic yet a kind soul. I recommend this series to everyone, the episodes are nothing more than 21 minutes and 10 seasons. Just a perfect match for this year's holidays!
10.0~A timeless show michelle16 Sign in Permalink Even ten years after the end of "Friends", it's still with enthusiasm that I watch every episode. Ten years after, I still laugh to Chandler's jokes; I laugh because Ross'faces are funny; I laugh because the dialog are great and the characters are even more than that. I've watched every episode from season 1 to season 10 an incalculable number of time. I know some lines by heart because they're just cult. My favorite season is definitely the last one, season 10. Like a good wine, "Friends" got better with the time. I loved when Joey tried to learn French, when Phoebe wanted to change her name... So many comical situations, so many lovable characters. I wish this show never ended. Now, I have a dream: I want "Friends" to be back on screen. Because this show is just timeless.
1.0~Don't understand all the hype of this show. OllieSuave-007 Sign in Permalink I don't really understand what it is about this show that sticks out as one of the greatest sitcoms in America. I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority when I say this show is boring, with forced comedy, annoying characters and uninspiring stories. This show does not send any notable or important message to audiences - just delving into the lives of six friends living together, offering no substance, purpose or compelling stories. All you get is goofy jokes, silly mishaps, off-the-wall plots and boring entertainment. Some of my cousins love this show. One would always put this show on during house parties and I've tried to watch and give this show a go. But, this TV series does not click with me, as I've found it extremely unfunny, ludicrous and uninteresting. I believe the quality of sitcoms peaked in the late 1980s, and it went downhill ever since. It is very unfortunate that Hollywood has continued to dish out shows like "Friends" or worse. And, it is even more unfortunate that some people actually find these shows entertaining. I'm sure that everybody has different tastes. But, I do believe that, in general, the quality of television has overall declined since the 1990s. Sorry to any fans out there, but "Friends" hit rock bottom for me. Grade F
10.0~I cant believe it only won 1 golden globe, "deserves much more" bo-jassim5 Sign in Permalink A lot of people agrees with me on this one, friends is one, if not the, best sitcom ever. But can you believe for whole ten seasons it only won 1 golden globe for best actress (Jennifer Anniston), and for the Emmy's it only won for best actress and supporting actress (Jennifer Anniston, Lisa Kudrow) and comedy series once! I believe it was really snubbed by the academy, i mean Matt LeBlanc and Mathew Perry really deserved at least an Emmy more than Lisa Kudrow did. Frasier, Seinfeld, will and grace, were all up against them for the award, but please friends is much better than will and grace and Seinfeld, and is as good as Frasier. David Schwimmer should easily had won best supporting actor, so should Mathew Perry and Matt LeBlanc.
10.0~The best TV show ever uzair40 Sign in Permalink I just love this show. This is the only show I am so much attached to. I have only created IMDB account just to rate this show. This is a must watch for everyone. It has laughs, tears, joy and everything. I just love it.
10.0~One of the best series ever sambenai Sign in Permalink Its such a wonderful series I enjoyed it a looooot but When it ended it was sad it mad me so happy and laugh it was hard watching the last episode
10.0~The best housihousi Sign in Permalink The best serie ever I watched 4 times and I still enjoy watching it
8.0~Pure Comedy aileselfhallucination1981 Sign in Permalink I would recommend this series to anyone who likes comedy series. Six friends living a common life, with their details, their dreams, and their thoughts, and the most beautiful are the moments of their frustration that is based on pure comedy. 24 years after the first episode, Friends still show cool. it's the best.
10.0~It could well be the best thing television has offered. advaitkamat Sign in Permalink Over the years, there has been a lot of discussion about which TV show should be ranked the greatest of all time. Though "Friends" has seldom topped any such list, there is no argument that it has taught us more about life and loss than any motivational speeches given anywhere around the world. So hilarious is "Friends", so ditsy, so enchanting, so wonderfully weird, so sophisticated yet so familiar that it's nearly impossible to resist its charms. It would be iniquitous of me to review something that's as priceless as "Friends", so I'll just write something that is more of a befitting tribute. Like most others, there hasn't been an episode of "Friends" I haven't watched more than once. What is it that makes it so funny and irresistible? I don't know and I never knew. You find it funny when they fight, it's funny when they sulk, hilarious when they mock each other and wacky when they make up. Yet the characters aren't the people you won't find anywhere else. They're the sort of people who you run into everyday, maybe on a bus or on the street and the problems they go through are the ones you go through at some point in your life. One would call "Friends" clichéd. You've got accidental weddings, getting sloshed in Vegas and emotional breakups. But "Friends" makes clichés look pretty, partly because it talks to us in a way that makes everything about clichés seem so original. It's a very rare thing to make situations seem so familiar and new at the same time and the makers have parlayed it into a cackling sitcom. If any other sitcom has been this honest in their approach to make their views heard, I'm not aware of it. "Friends" is laudable for its honesty with which it narrates the conflicts of its characters, never refraining from baring the hardships the characters go through and how they come through with it, and how can we use the same theory in the matters pertaining to our lives. All the actors are miraculous in their respective roles, but Jennifer Aniston, who portrays the spoiled brat Rachel, is the pick of the lot. Now, after the end of the sitcom, I often come across reading the many choices for the lead characters the producers originally pondered over, and chuckle at how absurd it now seems to imagine anyone else portraying the characters. "Friends" is simply the best thing television has offered and someone needs to come up with something really substantial to compete with the bludgeoning impact it had on us. There have been some mundane attempts to recreate the magic but they haven't been remotely as witty and funny as "Friends". I'm one person from the two generations that have grown up with these characters and have wished on numerous occasions that the places and characters we meet everyday actually do exist. I expect many more generations to learn about life and loss from six ordinary people who know how to make millions feel good about being human beings in a difficult world.
10.0~Thr best show i have ever watched in my entire life nataliedalila Sign in Permalink I'm just in love with every specific little thing about this show i'm thankful for bith Marta Kauffman and David Crane for making this amazing indescribable series that still catches our hearts even though it's been 20 years ! We the new generation and each coming new generation will always love and admire FRIENDS and laugh from within the heart because of it ! JOEY MONICA CHANDLER RACHEL ROSS PHEOBE are my life😍
10.0~Simply the best zyre_mehdi Sign in Permalink I've rated hundreds of titles on IMDb, both movies and TV shows, but this is the one and only title which I've rated 10/10. This show is unbelievably awesome. The story, the characters, the dialogs, the setting. Each and every thing about this show is awesome. This is the kind of show that attaches you to the characters so much that you feel like you're living with them. From little problems to life changing decisions, you experience everything as a part of them. I'm not even American, yet I could relate to most of the situations, I laughed at every joke, and this show has plenty of them. At the end of the show I felt nostalgic for days. I would definitely watch this show again, and again. I can only hope that a show better than this would ever be made.
1.0~Friends is like Twilight, a fake fantasy life for girls that are not yet women. dasderrick Sign in Permalink I have seen like 12 episodes through reruns and I do watch these, only if they happen to come on, just to try to figure out how the pilot of this show was ever picked up. How it ever became the most popular show, or how it is still my sisters favorite. It is the the same phenomenon that propels the series Twilight. First and foremost Friends, should be listed as Fantasy and nothing else. No Comedy or Romance in the description for any reason. It attempts to portray what being like a grown up is to young girls, which according to Friends, is a clumsy and unsure of themselves girl, that has no career or any set goals and will decide when she is ready and who cares. In which women from 12-25, eat it up like candy. The series is set in Manhattan, well a sound stage in LA. Because they are only ever shown in rooms on the set. The apartments shown, if they were in Greenwich village, we would have to add up all the income of each 6 of them, without a single expense , and even that would not pay Monica's rent each month. You can't live in lower manhattan, just starting out, even with a roommate unless you have a real career or a trust fund. Cashiering at Central Perk, she would have to live with her parents and take the train from Jersey. It is not even trying to be believable, but yet the demographic believes it. With Phoebe, she has no job, randomly plays a guitar in a coffee shop and yet has her own apartment, in the same building, which is ridiculous. All the men in this are beyond emasculated, they basically all just play like a big dumb, confused, dope all the time, which the demographic loves. Men do not really act like this, men don't act like they are wrong all the time, and that they are that unsure of themselves. They do not approach any dating situation, like a 12 year old boy would. Gee, I wonder if I can even kiss her? Will I get lucky and finally make it to first base today? Please stop. Grown men do not act like this. There is nothing realistic amount any of this. Essentially all 6 roles are written based on a female perspective and essentially all 6 characters are females, they have decided to include the term boobies or something else silly from time to time, and did instill 50% of a man into each of the 3 male characters, or it would be like watching 3 straight girls and 3 lesbians. Men do not act like this, do boys act like this? yes, but not men. Everyone in this show is white, if anyone has been to Greenwich village while whiter than many places in NYC, everything is very mixed there. In A real coffee shop, a white would be a minority, every moment of the day. Seinfeld gets criticized because it is a show about nothing. Has the same issue, everyone is white, making it look like it should be set in a suburb of minneapolis and not anywhere near manhattan. But Seinfeld is really funny. I have never ever laughed at a single thing in Friends and I love comedies. I am surprised they have not capitalized on making another show like this again, because it is golden as far as ratings. The 12-25 female demographic will watch it, and think that real life actually works likes this. The only thing is, I would hate is to be the one, when they grow up, that tells them the actual real truth.
10.0~Don't miss out! mckeano Sign in Permalink I have a problem! I am a Friends Addict! I watch it nearly every day and every day i watch it, I end up watching several episodes, and in one case, one series in a 'fun-fest of a day'! My favourite character for a female is definitely Phoebe for her wit and overall happiness. For a male, my favourite character is Chandler because of his superb sarcasm! I sometimes see similarities between myself and Chandler. Just to get one thing straight, I know that this is just a show and these are not their real characters in real life! I couldn't possibly tell you the events of the story because that would ruin the events and sheer shock surprises. Pure genius scriptwriting. There would not be one thing i would change about it! If you haven't watched it, you've missed out! Seriously, BIG TIME! Haha. And HUGE shame on you morons who say that it's pathetic. We all have lifes but we all love to have a laugh and not be miserable. So start to look on the bright side of life and notice how entertaining and genius Friends is! The storyline may be unrealistic at times but who cares, not all of us want to go home and watch a documentary on the HISTORY OF SCISSORS!
10.0~Awesome. Nothing will EVER beat F.R.I.E.N.D.S. alannahjrpurslow Sign in Permalink I've rated F.R.I.E.N.D.S 10 stars and it thoroughly deserves it. I have been a loyal F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan for years. The characters never fail to make you laugh and they always draw you into their stories and the shenanigans that happens through out the series. The relationship arcs between the characters are so well written! The journey these characters take is so interesting to watch and you never get bored. It has everything! Relationships, marriage, love, divorce, the series touches on sexuality,the reality of jobs and what it's like to navigate a long friendship with a group of people. You can also relate to these characters emotionally and what they are going through so much!! It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I recommend F.R.I.E.N.D.S to absolutely everyone. In the end, who doesn't want to see a young Jennifer Aniston in an amazing '90's sitcom with Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer? It's(kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck) fantastic!!!
9.0~...a magnificent television series. SecretAsset Sign in Permalink I think that Friends is a magnificent television series. It all comes together in a wonderful convergence due to the story lines, characters and humour. For starters, most of the American television series are between 40 minutes and an hour. Friends have a great balance of having each episode 20 minutes. For those who fidget or have a minimal attention span then this is a wonderful combination of quality and time consumption. Not a lot can be said for the locations, lighting and scenery as it all takes place in the same places; Central Perk and Monica's and Joey's apartments. There is the occasional trip taken that include London and Las Vegas. The story lines can be unrealistic at times but the main plot points are interesting. It raises some important debate topics such as what is meant by being on a break? Whose side do you choice between Rachel and Ross, every much like Jennifer Aniston's film The Break Up. There is also the anticipation of which character will get with whom, for example, personally from series one I wanted Ross and Rachel together, Chandler and Monica and Phoebe and Joey. Another plot line that I found interesting was when Chandler and Monica were secretly sleeping together and the difficulty of keeping it from the rest of the friends. That in my opinion had some of the funniest moments of the show. The characters are also very convincing and throughout the series they really grow on you. You will develop your favourites, mine was Chandler. His humour and sarcastic jokes had me laughing really hard at times. Monica and Rachel are great as roommates and have their moments. My least favourite characters were Joey and Phoebe but on the scale of things, the show wouldn't be as good without them. Overall, the series brings laughter, enjoyment, suspense and tears. If you have not yet watched Friends then you are to put it quite simply missing out. 9/10
9.0~An important piece of American pop culture. insomniac_rod Sign in Permalink Four years ago, after the series final I would've said this is the best comedy sitcom ever made. t After watching it's reruns, now with cold head, I can only say it's a triumph of American Comedy. Sure, one of the most successful and popular comedies ever made but it's no lie that it isn't 100% about quality. From season 1 to 4 the show is a complete mess with unfunny situations, SNL imitation sequences, and awkward performances. The show starts to get a unique vibe and special charm since 1999. To be honest, the humor gets more witty and leaves behind cheesy lines for raunchy humor instead; but keeping the typical American humor all the time. Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer shine all the time while the rest of the cast does it very fine and even gain status as people's favorite characters on any sitcom. The situations are tremendously creative from 1999 on and I can't think of any other show to perfectly manage the facial expressions of it's cast. It's also part of the charm of the comedy; pretty people performing decently even with their faces. Give this show a try and be part of American pop culture.

10.0~best show i have ever seen! christiinnaxo Sign in Permalink i seriously haven't ever seen a show better then this! my English teacher loved it and always talked about it so i decided to give it a shot. i watched the pilot and could tell it would be a good show. i have now seen every single episode! Ross and Rachel are the most perfect couple i have ever seen! i always cry when i watch the episode where they break up :( and the series finale?! i cried the whole time! Monica and chandler and also very cute, i was so upset when they couldn't have a baby. chandler is hilarious, Ross is hot, and joey is so dumb its funny :) i wish the series had gone on longer. there will never be another show like it, and no show will ever come close to it.
10.0~THE FUNNIEST SHOW OF ALL TIME kyleinnabi Sign in Permalink THE WRITING / ACTING IN THIS SHOW IS OUT OF THIS WORLD ... IV'E NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE ... EVERY EPISODE IN EVERY SEASON IS GUARANTEED LAUGHTER ... THE GREATEST COMEDY SHOW EVER
7.0~much emulated eminently watchable nineties sitcom HelenMary Sign in Permalink From the pilot to the last episode of series ten, the antics of Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe and Joey captured the world's attention on an unprecedented level for a sitcom. Whether Ross and Rachel would get together, Rachel's haircuts and fashion, Phoebe's mannerisms and Joey's one-liners and Chandler's jokes became water-cooler moments just as much as the story lines. Even the theme song became a hit. Friends fever was HUGE. Since then most sitcoms I've seen have done a Friends "bit" - the same scenario and lines. The story arc was mainly centred around Ross and Rachel's relationship but the loves, work, family issues of the six pals were interesting, varied, sometimes ridiculous and often serious life issues. Always, however, there were laughs aplenty as the situations were made funny but a lot of the jokes were sometimes a little bit silly. It hasn't really aged well, and because it's on so much I think it's had some overkill but I still enjoy it despite knowing it back to front. Its a good giggle.
10.0~the Best nilssete Sign in Permalink One of the best serie I have ever watched!! If you still didn't watch it, go and watch.
9.0~vote for a friends movie: rhapsody-zaman Sign in Permalink Hey Fans, you can go to this site to vote for a Friends movie. www.gopetition.com/petitions/we-want-a-friends-movie.html There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too. The humor is universal. I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!
3.0~.. kikiboo_8 Sign in Permalink I'll just say this has to be the most overrated TV show in history of the world. I don't hate it or anything, I just don't see why does it have such a high rating or why did so many people love it? I'm dumbfounded.
10.0~The one and only Masterpiece!!!!! alfaress Sign in Permalink I mean what can I say about Freinds? It's the best comedy show from the past and people still watch it. Im very thankful that I saw it and will never forget this Masterpiece.
10.0~No Complaints starliz3 Sign in Permalink The BEST! No more words needed! You laugh and you cry, mainly cry because the show has ended or from laughing so hard your stomach hurts. Nothing will ever come close to being as good as this show, never ever. The script is witty and spot on every time, you never see anything coming because the characters will always surprise you with some unexpected, hilarious opinion. It's so hard to choose a favourite episode because they all are so good, the actors all fit together and it is all so believable you do tend to believe the 6 people u see in front you are actually your friends. I love it and I miss it so much. I'm a fan forever.
9.0~Loved this show Jemae Sign in Permalink I can remember watching this show when it first came out and it was good them and its still good. It's starting to show its age and after watching the show a couple times over you start to see Ross as a jerk, he was an awful character. I mean, when Rachael had Emma, it was ok for him to date other people but he didnt want her dating others, he's just a controller and not a nice person at all. i also love how this show is kinda still relevant to the dating scene. Worth a watch!
10.0~They'll Be There For You dancermcm Sign in Permalink This is hands-down one of the best sitcoms I have ever seen. Despite what some people say, it is not playing it safe at all. There have been many imitations of Friends, and this where those entire crappy knock-offs came from. This is the original that cannot be beat. People also say the series can't be related to, but I beg to differ. If you asked any adult, I guarantee they would tell you that one situation one or more of the main characters got into they have been in also. The comedy is just one of the things I like about it. A lot of it is something recurring, like an inside joke. Most of it is sarcastic, witty, high comedy that takes a level of thinking, which is why I didn't like it until I was about twelve, when I could understand it, although my mom would watch it when I was really little, like not big enough to walk, and I could remember the theme song from when I was, like, 3 months old, and some snippets of some episodes. That is how memorable the show is. There is some low-typed comedy that you don't have to think too much about to make it funny, too, but it's not that immature potty-humor type, but some slapstick stuff here and there. The characters are memorable and lovable, because they all have quirky little things that make them different. My personal favorites are Chandler, Joey, and the completely overlooked Phoebe. Overall, it's a must-watch for anyone who wants a feel-good comedy that is not stuffy, but instead will pull you in and make you wish it was still on. I highly recommend this series, and you will not regret watching it.
10.0~"You broke my fridge" azzboham Sign in Permalink F.r.i.e.n.d.s is my favourite programme ever i especially like this particular episode. Joey's fridge brakes and he eats all of the food out of it. Chandler comes along and joey asks him how chandler wants to pay him. Chandler refuses as he no longer lives there. Ross comes along later and he pushes Ross in to the fridge and blames chandler. It continues and its well funny i love joey and my favourite girl has to be Rachel because shes funny pretty and i just generally like Jenifer Anson in her movies. Shes much better than Angalina Jolie i cant bare her shes plastic. Brad was well to ugly for you and so is Vince but its your choice lol. Zara 14/f/uk
10.0~Awesome! www-tul_93 Sign in Permalink Best comedy I ever watched! Looking forward to see next or new season. I hope that producers will make new season :-). I've been watching in my tablet during last quarter. All episodes very good to have fun :-). Gunther proposing to Rachel was genius! I find it great, and also because it was right before Ross. We also get to see Joey's ass covered in red paint that left a stain on Monica's couch and Phoebe making it a musical And the end of this part is also great because Ross finally decides that he doesn't want to get over Rachel and goes after her! Thank you very muck producers. By the my fav. was Monica I'd like to have her made cookies KKK. Gantulga
10.0~Best show ever mirnabdbk Sign in Permalink The greatest show of all times!!! Always funny, great story lines, great acting. There will never be another show good as this one!!
10.0~Best TV series ever ! You won't regret watching this!! ektasharma Sign in Permalink FRIENDS is perfect blend of comedy, romance, quirky dialogues, silliness, jokes and anything else you could. One could never regret watching this. You can't resist laughing atleast once during the 30 minutes show!
1.0~Utter Crap thebogofeternalstench Sign in Permalink Oh har har har, this show rules man, oh what a hoot. NOT. 'Friends'...............wow, how incredibly interesting, a sit-com about 'friends'. What a total bore fest. Like many people who hate/hated this sit-com, I just can not fathom how it was so popular. All the characters are extremely bland and dull and self centered and.....I could go on and on. I absolutely hated it when one of these utter morons said a line, which apparently is supposed to be really really funny, and then the canned laughter immediately kicks in after the gag (what gag?). It is all forced fed to you. You are told to believe this is funny with the assisted canned laughter or fake on cue audience laughter. Friends is unbelievably pretentious. Every so called actor in this is a complete tit. All these hollow characters do is go to coffee shops, acquire the same seating every time, talk about utter drivel, there's the mind numbingly boring relationship crap, this mundane rubbish goes on and on. No thanks. 5 minutes of an episode of Bottom is better than the whole Friends series, mainly because it has balls and originality. Friends is nothing more than a plastic, sad excuse for entertainment for the robots and brainless dorks of society.
10.0~Best comedy ana_imdb Sign in Permalink I saw every episode of this series and at the final episode I felt that void and sadness inside of me because I knew I could never see 'Friends' for the first time ever again. That's how you know a show is really good. The jokes are hilarious and there are some moments that you just have to relive from time to time.
9.0~The Best TV Show Ever almid4 Sign in Permalink I'm starting by doing something like "Pookyiscute" and talk about each character individually, I'm doing it using no particular order: Courtney Cox/Monica Geller-Bing: The actress does a great job with Monica, as the show goes, you really start to believe she loves order, discipline and hates to lose. Her relationship with Chandler was also great, it might not have had the history that Ross and Rachel had, but it was still great. I really like her, her cleanliness, her bossiness, her cooking and her competitiveness. I can't finish talking about her without quoting her catchphrase: "I KNOW" Here's a little scene from the show: After Rachel's birthday party, Rachel offered help to Monica for cleaning up to which Monica replies, "Are you kidding? You had your party, now I'll have mine!" Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani: I like Joey a lot, he's funny and extremely protective with his friends (you can clearly tell that when Chandler and Monica move and Rachel goes to Paris). He might not be the smartest or the funniest, but he's definitely the most caring character in the show. I have to quote Pookyiscute here: "(...) his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time". That's just true. ;D He also plays Joey Tribbiani in the show "Joey", where he moved to L.A. to pursue his acting career. His sister Gina Tribbiani and her son Michael were two other central characters of the show. Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: Jennifer is now the most famous actress on the show, but I don't think that's very fair... Don't get me wrong, I really like her as an actress, but I just don't like her as much as I like Matthew Perry. Rachel Green is clearly the character who changes the most from the beginning of the show, in the first episodes she was just a spoiled daddy's girl, then throughout all the episodes she evolved in many ways, she got a job, stopped being so superficial, I just think it's very admirable what she accomplished. Her history with Ross was also great, a lot of ups and downs but it ended well and it was worth it. :P Lisa Kudrow/Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan: At first, I did't like Phoebe very much, because she was very naive and kinda dumb. But then, as the show went on, I started to appreciate her, because she is very sweet, very protective towards animals (she's a vegetarian), and has some great songs (Smelly Cat, for example). Her ingenuousness is just lovely, i think what also makes her different is her childhood and the fact that she lived on the streets for some time. Her connection with joey is just great (perhaps because they are the only two with less academic education). David Schwimmer/Ross Geller: I think that one of the reasons I like Ross so much is because he's the character who I relate the most. I think it's because he's very into science to him because he's very into science and I have a personality very similar to his. As I've said above, one of the thinks I liked the most was the Ross-Rachel relationship, that turned out fine, in spite of all the arguing and the "we were on a break!" situation. David Schwimmer, along with Matthew Perry are my favorites on the show, they're really great. Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing: He's the best, he's really funny, no actor has made me laugh this much, and I think Matthew is also funny as a person, you can see that on the bloopers for example, the way he always jokes around with the other 5, and also because of his other works as an actor (I haven't seen all, but I'm working on it). He's simply great, the show wouldn't be the same without him, he's so talented! As Pookyiscute said: "They should have a shrine dedicated to this man." He's definitely my favorite, not only on the show, but in general. In the final episode, right before the end: Rachel: "Ok, should we get some coffee?" Chandler: "Sure. -(pause: they go out the door)- Where?" I used to see some episodes on TV, but then I started watching the DVD's from the first season and never stopped. I just love the way they can make you really care about the characters, I saw the last episodes today, in the one before the last one they show scenes from all the other seasons, and it feels really good to remember all that. And when you're watching the last one, if you've watched all the other ones, you get really sad and happy at the same time, just like the characters do. Every episode is extremely funny and entertaining, yet if you watch all the episodes you realize it's much more than comedy. It's my favorite show, and I doubt I'm ever going to see another TV show half as good as this one. I give this show a Perfect 10, only because there's nothing higher.
10.0~Tv-shows Beyonce horseannie Sign in Permalink Nothing else to say, really. Watched this at least 10 times. Everytime the last episode has ended, i put on the first episode and rewatch it again, again and again. If you dont know what to watch while eating, just put friends on and skip cooling down the food while looking for something okay to look at when you eat. These are my best friends <3
10.0~This show is ace! izzy2414 Sign in Permalink Well, what can i say? There are no words to describe the utter excellence, effort and comedy in this show. The writers are right up there as some of the best writers in history. The way the characters have grown over the years is great, and yet again due to the ace writing. The three girls on the show are babes, and all three are comic geniuses. Jennifer Aniston plays spoilt daddy's girl Rachel Green really well. Also, the neurotics of Monica, played by Courteney Cox is fabulous. Her comic timing is astounding. Lisa Kudrow is brilliant in the way her character Phoebe Buffay can talk about such terrible things that have happened in her life like they are normal, everyday things. Ahh, the guys. Matt LeBlanc is a great actor, and might i add as a 13 year old girl, gorgeous. Nobody delivers a line like Matthew Perry. He is as sharp as a whip. David Schwimmer? What can i say? The way it takes him 10 minutes to say a word is utter comedy. This show is without a doubt one of the funniest, comforting shows ever. It's basically 22 minutes of fun.
10.0~i wish someday i will have F.R.I.E.N.D.S like them!!! sinshycodo1412 Sign in Permalink Guys I'm so exited to the reunion on 2016 February.its been almost 12 years of break,but they were like my childhood friends.if you grew up with them you will understand what I'm talking about,you will understand every joke,all the excitements,all the popularity and trust me its is fair rated 9.0 on IMDb by the users.i watched it 3 times every single season.i even have there pictures hanging on my wall.it is very funny,romantic and the writers are brilliant.every single of the character is super talented,every fan of friends can see that the characters represents our actual friend or ourselves in our life.whenever I'm in bad mood i watch them and i relax and feel like they are my real friends and they are always there for me.sometimes i wish i have friend like them.the show is amazing.watch it..
10.0~"Friends" is the best thing that ever happened to Television! niteish05 Sign in Permalink Friends is an American sitcom, which started in 1994 and finished in 2004 completing 10 superb seasons. Its plot revolves around a group of six friends in New York City. Alike me, people all over the world love watching every episode of "Friends" again and again. No matter how many times I watch it, I never get bored with its humour. It has become a huge part of my life. It is not just about the storyline, everything related to "Friends" is so wonderful. Every single episode is comically distinctive. This show is a true perfection. It also portrays the true meaning of friendship. All the six characters are very much different and utterly humorous. It became so famous that it had a huge cultural impact across the world. Better to say, it became a cult classic! Joey's pick-line, "how you doing" became the most popular dialogue of the show and is still everyone's favourite. Chandler's sarcastically funny one-liners are still touted as the best till date. Ross' facial expressions and funny acts is a major attraction. Rachel, Monica and Phoebe complete the rest of the cast. All the characters are so well-defined that they seem real-life. Their vivacious illustration have made them legends in their own way. For me, it is the greatest sitcom ever and will be close to me forever. It is truly a television masterpiece. To elaborate in one sentence, "Friends" is the best thing that ever happened to Television!
7.0~we all LOVE our friends slatskcy Sign in Permalink I've been reading a lot of these comments. Some people don't like the show...claiming it to be unrealistic or that the plot lines get boring. I didn't discover Friends until a year or two ago (thanks to MY friends) but I ADORE the show in syndication and I hope to own the DVDs. Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL. Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL. This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS. We may not all sit in coffee shops, but we all LOVE our friends like they were blood. That's what this show is about. Makes you all warm and fuzzy (and sore from laughing) inside. And as a show: FRIENDS will always be a part of MY family.
10.0~F.R.I.E.N.D.S = M.A.S.T.E.R.P.I.E.C.E. jayeshyathisone Sign in Permalink Every episode of every season reflects creativity, perfection and comedy. How the group of six friends live and stumble in their life teaches us how to tackle our daily life problems. The screenplay was good, the acting, dialogues, jokes, sarcasm was good. There are so many beautiful memories that are made of gold. The places like the bar which turn into a coffee place where they used to hang out, the Monica's apartment, Joey and Chandler's apartment and many more. If you are looking for a good sitcom then you must give this a chance to satisfy your wants for entertainment. The story will never bore you, as it goes fast in time. Loyal and sensitive Rachel, 'neat freak' Monica, sweet and crazy Phoebe, slightly dim Joey with all his macho-ness, witty Chandler and nerd paleontologist Ross are the six main characters. And I never wanted to see the last episode of FRIENDS 'the last one' because I didn't want it to end, but I watched it accidentally and got emotional, man!!! why am I writing this? And now I have nothing to watch. But I still watch it anyway.
10.0~Friends andreaskerkides Sign in Permalink The most incredible series I have seen and I believe one of the best ones that exist. You have to see it, you will love it!!!!!
10.0~The Best Comedy/Romance/Drama Tv Show Everrrrrrrrrrrrr <3 <3 wissemgriri Sign in Permalink The heck u doing here ? go and watch the show already !!! EDIT: i already miss them , FRIENDS is a masterpiece , don't miss watching this sitcom, am already depressed cuz i finished it :(
10.0~Best series ever thomazpalazzo Sign in Permalink Friends is simply the best and most wonderful Tv show ever. You can watch any episode anytime that will be always funny and amusing.
10.0~The show may over, but not for me! obisc Sign in Permalink Ever since I first saw Friends on the air in Argentina, where I used to live, I have been hooked. The first time we all saw Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Ross, Chandler & Joey we see them in the coffeehouse (which throughout all seasons will become the most popular coffeehouse in the world) and they seem like regular new yorkers struggling in the world we know today. This show takes a funny twist to every-day life in the American style we all know and love. If one would ask a person what their favorite TV show is, most answers would be "Friends" simply because this show relates to everyone's lives, not just Americans. You can be from all over the world (like I was) and still understand and relate to most of the situations the characters may be in, no matter how wacky it is. This is a must-see show. It will bring so much humor into your life you will not want to miss it. Buy the DVDs as well, they are great!
10.0~What Friends becomes cja1000 Sign in Permalink The very first time I started watching Friends, way back in about series 5 I was reluctant. I thought the humour would be too American for me (I'm English) I would find it irritating, inane, and really not to my taste. One of my female friends (who I had a crush on at the time) lent my a video of the start of the first series. That summer I ended up watching 2 series every 3 days, laughing my way through the lot, and within a week I was finally up to the current episodes. Since then I've been addicted. Buying the DVDs at a premium the day they came out, putting them on every birthday and Christmas list, and then putting them on as my night time watching, something regular, something to fall asleep to. Then I realised about a year or two ago, I hadn't really laughed at a Friends episode for a long long time. But I kept watching. Why, because Friends is more than just the laughs, more than just the misadventures of each episode. The whole of the series and complete friends is so much more than just the sum of its parts. Together you believe you live with these characters for ten years, you aspire in many ways to their lifestyle and (possibly quite sadly) they become friends to you.
10.0~Don't listen to the people who don't like this show, cause they have no taste... xxlittlemissnaughtyxx Sign in Permalink I've read a lot of comments on this page saying that friends is crap....DON'T LISTEN TO THEM! There are so few television programmes that are actually great. Will and Grace, been there and done that rubbish! I didn't get it and it was different kind of funny. When I watched Friends, I started watching it all the time! It's got it's own unique humor to it and I find it hilarious. I have to say, I didn't like the last episode AT ALL because it was ending. To be honest, I started crying when it was over! It is something definitely worth watching and something I always want to see it over and over again, even if I've seen the episode a thousand times. This sitcom comedy is for people who enjoy actual good humor. Definitely worth watching!
10.0~Best ever upretideepak-74664 Sign in Permalink Best among all. Friends is a show that always tops the list when it comes to favourites. Even after almost 15 years one can watch it again and again feeling the same. Monica, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel, Ross are the characters that shows and teaches us something about life and friendship. Every character leaves a certain impact on it. If you haven't watched it yet, then you are missing something and you should watch it now. The show is worth watching and best among all.
10.0~One of the best shows ever.. islamnazib-90225 Sign in Permalink This series just melts my heart every time. Those six persons are now like my family. Chandler's sarcasm, Joey' flirting, Phoebe's weirdness, Rachel's beauty, Monica's cleanliness and Ross's geekyness is just too lovely to handle.
9.0~6 irritating but freaking interesting neighbors cunbeomimi Sign in Permalink It can be the best TV comedy ever. I literally crack up in every line. The plot is well written, the characters are well-developed. Even the supporting characters, like Gunther, is yummy to watch. They succeeded in not only making a sitcom, but also making it live. After several seasons, I feel like I do know them. It's not like you're watching a show. It's like you set a secret camera to stalk on your dear six irritating but very interesting neighbors. At first i love one character, then turn to another, now I can't decide. I love them all!!! I do recommend Friends to everyone. But be wary, it can take you like a useless week, doing nothing but watching it. It's really addictive.
10.0~The best show ever zia_8932 Sign in Permalink It is the best show ever. It is funny, it is classy, it has drama, it has romance, it has love and more importantly it has sarcasm by Chandler. I have watched the whole series a couple of times and once you watch it you cannot get enough of it. It is really that great. i would love to see a movie of F.r.i.e.n.d.s. It is the best show ever. It is funny, it is classy, it has drama, it has romance, it has love and more importantly it has sarcasm by Chandler.

1.0~Wanna waste your time? Then totally worth it nafisislam57 Sign in Permalink Before watching the show, I was very fascinated about FRIENDS. At least when you see the title making room in IMDb Top TV by 40, why shouldn't one watch it? But it finally turned out to be a very lame series. The thing that surprised me much, how & why in the hell it has so much popularity. I stick with the series till the very last episode. Depicting lives of a friend circle of mid ninety's living in NY. There is no particular story anyway. Most of the goofy shots, which are actually meant to be humorous, are too lame and too forced. Only few episodes were funny in the whole series. But that can't save the trip. To tell you the truth, it's over-hyped overrated show. If you are planning to watch it, after a few times later you will understand how worthless this series is. Usually I am not intended to write negative reviews. But in this case, I just can't avoid the fact that it's a botheration.
10.0~Legendady adamvirani Sign in Permalink How can this be below a 10. You tripping my boys. I need everyone to vote 10 cuz this show needs to go up to over 9. Funniest comedy show in the world nothing can beat it
8.0~will we ever see a show like this again? mcfly-31 Sign in Permalink It's a very special thing when a television show can cross that line from being just another show, to appointment television. That's what happened here, about six twenty-somethings with exaggerated facial expressions and manic line-readings who live each other's adventures in Manhattan over a ten year period. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the first season, which contained standard sitcom annoyances. Such as HEAVY laughtrack usage after unfunny jokes and characters, who when a friend's date would show up, would all aline near the front door and lean on each other and say "hi" all at once. Ugh, this show will be axed after six episodes. But with little competition on other networks in the 8:30 slot (and a hell of an attractive cast) this show dragged on through a whole season. Things finally perked up with an unrequited crush between two of the main characters, which culminated in a terrific cliffhanger. Then something happened in season two, and the writers just exploded. From then on out over the next five years, this show couldn't miss. Constant on-target jokes, a newly budding romance with a great pay-off, and one of the fastest paces of any sitcom ever. Instead of the usual two-story structure, a third sub-story was added which made the 22 minutes fly by each week. The executive producers names would come up, and literally every week, I'd cry out in frustration: "It's done already??". But after around season six, viewage dropped and the show went onto cruise control. It still made you laugh, but wasn't as flawless. Then amazingly (mostly due in part to 9/11 after effects of wanting to smile again) the ratings soared back to number 1 where they stayed till the show went off the air three years later. As far as performances go, the actors were all terrific choices. Aniston really evolved from the spoiled rich girl to a successful, career-minded professional. Cox's neurotic tendencies were played for good laughs, but weren't overdone, wisely. And she had a great softness and emotion to her many romantic moments over the run. Two characters however, remained in a realm of intolerance as a viewer. The Phoebe character portrayed by Kudrow, was completely unrealistic in her quirkyness, and I think would not be accepted by anyone as a friend. This left her character undefined, as they focused mainly on her family background for most of the first five or six years, and never giving her a solid romance like the other characters. Then you had LeBlanc as the token dumb stud, a guy who constantly misconstrued information and bugged his eyes reveling in the joy of the prospect of living in a supermarket of eating a sandwich. He made you laugh but at times was too stupid for even TV. LeBlanc could be great in his serious moments, but that distracted from his lack of intelligence in other episodes. His would-be romance with Aniston's character was rightly abandoned as it just didn't play right. This brings us to the most unbalanced character of them all, Ross, played by Schwimmer. In the beginning he was the most rounded character who was going through a divorce after being abandoned by his pregnant lesbian wife. Far-fetched sure, but at least he brought an authentic turmoil to his role. Plus his secret affection for Aniston's character made you really root for him. HOWEVER, by season six or seven, the writers had him do a complete 180 and turn increasingly unbearable with his wild outbursts and disturbing mood swings. The idiotic handling of his post-break up years with Aniston was infuriating. IT'S OVER, MOVE ON! Yet, the two characters always had to stare at each other dramatically when the other would start dating again. This followed by the most embarrassing episode where Schwimmer gets drunk and carries on like a woman upon finding out LeBlanc and Aniston have a thing going. "I'm fiiiiiine!" will go down in the annals along with "We were on a break!!" (which was classic). For last I've saved Matthew Perry, who in my mind was the second coming of John Ritter. An expertly gifted physical actor, who patented his own uprorious line deliveries and facial reactions. He was the writers go to guy early on in the show---too much in fact. Chandler was just a walking punchline, trying way too hard. But in years following, they toned it down and turned him into one of the best TV characters I've ever seen. Not just standard jokes, but great inside references only some of us folks would get. Which made his dramatic moments shine even more, the few he had. Chandler Bing will be missed. The finale was a tremendous let-down, going in bland directions and really lacking an emotional conclusion. Nothing is really resolved as they lay on the guitars thick for a final fade out (on a door????). In summation, it was one of those shows I really don't see recreated again, with the type of snappy dialogue and lovable characters who you will watch into syndication infinity like other shows. Oh....my....God, TV "Friends" like these are hard to come by.
9.0~Great -except Phoebe MikeyC3792 Sign in Permalink Friends is the greatest thing to come out of America it never gets boring and is a laugh a minute programme with a great mix of both verbal and visual humour from all six friends.Ross,Rachel,Joey,Monica and Chandler are all great characters.Phoebe is not though, she is not related to any of the other 5 characters and does not live near them unlike Monica and Rachel who live opposite Joey and Chandler and Chandlers best friend Ross is Monica's brother and Rachel's on off boyfriend and ends up living 2 minutes away so i feel it should just of been those 5 characters.Even with the irritating Phoebe it is still a great programme and by far the greatest thing to come from America excluding super Eddie Lewis!!!
10.0~Amazing philipdev Sign in Permalink Friends are still running on my Netflix account every time I want to relax. It's now 15 years ago that they ended the show and it's still amazing. I'm not even old enough to remember when the show ended. Watch it all from beginning to end once, and you will feel like you really know the Friends.
10.0~Best TV show ever nizar_recoba20 Sign in Permalink When I finish it I realized that no TV show will ever going to satisfy me
10.0~The best show ever, comedy genre ybbhowon Sign in Permalink This show is simply great. Very original. Very funny. Super talented actors, especially the boys. This show gets me through my hangovers and heart aches :)
10.0~Surely the best TV comedy ever! kevjfarrell Sign in Permalink What else is left to be said about this masterpiece sit-com? All sit-coms since this aired tries to use the formula that this show has! Shows like 'How I Met Your Mother' relies heavily on the perceived successful formula. Friends is unique. It features six of the most lovable flawed characters that you could hope to meet. They each have endearing characteristics and hilarious quirks. From series one, the scriptwriters had molded their characters perfectly, and none of them swayed from how we knew them. Each show had at least two themes running through it. Each character had their starring moments. The jokes and laughs were shared out equally among the cast. I can't recall a single episode that fell short in any way. Even the secondary characters that appeared in just a few episodes were wonderful - the Janice character popped up at least once in every series and was a great addition to the slick team. Ross & Monica's parents were funny, as was Phoebe's brother. It's kinda wrong to pick out a favorite character from the main six as they were all great in their own way. Every screenwriter in this genre would love to be able to create a 'Friends' - but it requires more than one great writer - you need a great team of writers to keep the standards high. But just as importantly, you need the right actors/actresses!!! This is the benchmark for all sit-coms. Perfection!

10.0~A fantastic sitcom which never tries to be something it isn't. Yayster Sign in Permalink I only got into Friends last year, after watching some of the bloopers. I had seen some episodes during its original run and enjoyed them, but never followed the story of the show. Now, after watching the entirety of its 10-year run all the way through, I can safely say that Friends is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time. Friends is one of those shows where you'll really get to know the characters. I think this is one of its greatest strengths, and part of the reason it was, and still is, so popular. By the end of the show, you will feel like they're YOUR friends - and you'll wish that you had a group of friends like them! It's impossible not to become emotionally attached to one or all of the characters, as they are each endearing in their own way. For me, and for lots of others - as is evident from a lot of online polls and surveys - Chandler Bing (played by Matthew Perry) is the best character in the show. His sarcastic wisecracks and exceptional comic timing make him a delight to watch, especially when paired with Joey (Matt LeBlanc). Together, they make one of the most memorable TV duos - and for good reason! But whether it's Chandler and Joey you like, Monica (the obsessive neat-freak), Phoebe (the kooky masseuse), Rachel (the spoilt girl making it on her own) or Ross (the geeky but romantic college professor) you like, you're sure to find a character to relate to. The show is also strengthened by its guest stars, especially recurring characters such as Ross and Monica's parents, Judy and Jack Geller, and Chandler's nightmare ex-girlfriend, Janice. The running gags in this show never get old, and persistent viewers are treated to in-jokes that are constantly funny. Although I feel the show is weaker in its later seasons, due to the greater focus on plot and sentiment as opposed to the all-out comedy of some of the earlier seasons, it still stands strong on its own. And the show is not without its faults - there are a few things I would have certainly changed if I were a writer - but on the whole, they got it right, and the result is a show that fails to disappoint. On a closing note, I'd just like to say that Friends is a show that never tries to be something it isn't - it isn't groundbreaking comedy, or incredibly high-brow, but it never aims to be. It's light, funny, and something that will cheer you up when you're feeling down. Whenever I am feeling low, I can guarantee that firing up the DVD player and watching an episode of Friends will leave me with a smile on my face. And that's what it's all about, isn't it?
9.0~"How *you* doin'?!" rthorborg Sign in Permalink This is one of my favourite quotes of the series Friends. This quote is from Joey Tribbiani, he is one of the main characters and uses the sentence to get laid. Joey is one of the six friends in the series. The other five friends are Monica Geller, Rachel Green, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. The series starts with Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross and Joey in the coffeehouse when Rachel walks in. Rachel was Monica's best friends in high school. She is looking for an apartment, so Monica tells her she can live with her. After Rachel moves in, the stories of the six friends start. I started to watch Friends since the first time I came across it on the TV. They were broadcasting the series again after all these years. From the first episode, I laughed and most of the time out loud. The jokes and the events in the series are funny and in case of the events most of the time weird, but sometimes also unexpected. The series contains in total 236 episodes spread over 10 seasons. I would recommend the series to everybody. When I rewatched the series, I still laughed at all the jokes and situations. I think most of the people (if not everyone) could watch the series over and over again and laugh every time watching Friends. So I give the series Friends a nine out of ten.
10.0~The best comedy there ever has been..!!!!!! smart-san2004 Sign in Permalink I have read a lot of reviews and comments. Many of them really liked the show and some of them criticised for the unreal nature of it, but I for one think that this is the best comedy serial there ever has been on Television. The first season sets up the tone for the rest of the 9 seasons. Never through out the 10 seasons it feels like the writers ever introduced something unworthy, something just to add up to the episode list, something just to pile up the story. I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the first season when the seventh season was being aired but from then on I was hooked. I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone who just loves laughing and don't wish it to stop. I would also like to advice that never watch this show while having lunch or dinner as it can mess with your digestion because of the laughing. ;)
10.0~Friends jboothmillard Sign in Permalink This is probably one of, if the not the best sitcom about friendship ever made. With the lovable characters living their New York lives and having wonderfully crafted scripts and story lines, this is simply the best. The six friends are all recognisable now for doing ten years of Friends. These six are three girls: the charming Rachel Green (Emmy winning and four-time nominated, and Golden Globe winning and nominated Jennifer Aniston), the sensible Monica Gellar Bing (Courteney Cox Arquette) and simple Phoebe Buffay (Emmy winning and five-time nominated, and Golden Globe nominated Lisa Kudrow); and three boys: the smooth Joey Tribbiani (three-time Emmy and twice Golden Globe nominated Matt LeBlanc), the simple Chandler Bing (Emmy nominated Matthew Perry) and the nervous talking Ross Gellar (Emmy nominated David Schwimmer). Throughout the ten years that they did they had love stories, children stories, specials and the relationships between the friends. They have also had some good celebrity guests including: Jon Lovitz, Helen Hunt, George Clooney, Dan Castellaneta, Julia Roberts, Brooke Shields, David Arquette, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams, Jennifer Saunders, Emmy nominated Tom Selleck, Emmy nominated Christina Pickles, Emmy winning Bruce Willis, Emmy nominated Susan Sarandon, Denise Richards, Winona Ryder, Emmy nominated Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, Emmy nominated Brad Pitt, Alec Baldwin, Emmy nominated Hank Azaria, Emmy winning and nominated Christina Applegate, Scary Movie's Anna Faris, Emmy nominated Danny DeVito and many others. After ten years they finally did a brilliantly funny and an emotional final hour-long episode. The spin-off for Joey is nowhere as good as his original show. It won the BAFTA for Foreign TV Program Award, it was nominated The British Comedy Award for Best International TV Comedy, it won 6 Emmys (from 65 nominations), it was nominated for 5 Golden Globes for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy, and it was nominated 3 National Television Awards for Most Popular Comedy Programme. It was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and it was on The 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes for 2002 (when Brad Pitt was in it) and it even got to number 1 in 2004 when it ended. Outstanding!
10.0~Best show loverchirag Sign in Permalink Don't watch friends all ten season because than there is nothing left in life to watch
9.0~The best TV series hitherto which revolves around 6 friends. pratyushb Sign in Permalink Each one of us have different taste and preferences but if one cleaves on the point that Friends is not a great show I think one needs to find musing time to discern that they are wrong. The first season is slow and is just like a foundation stone to make the building strong and I take it when some people find it little slow or average,but The show outstrip all the loopholes from the season 2. The show is fabulous,stupendous and I bet you will be in light and different mood in those 20-22 minutes and there will be rampant flow of smile and laughs for those 22 minutes. This is the only show whose episodes I can watch infinite times and each time I will last laughing loud holding my stomach. All the six actors have played their characters ingeniously and cannot be replaced or replayed equally well by anyone else ever. The show starts with "Monica" being teased by her friends Chandler and Joey in the central perk coffee shop and along with the cup of coffee the show starts brimming your life with fun,excitement,happiness and emotions. All characters are different and best in their own ways. Monica as motherly character being piqued for even a small changes made at her house by anyone except her and always eager to cook and thus rightfully the chef by profession. Ross brother of Monica and affable goof with profession in paleontology.For Ross or "Doctor Ross" the love for dinosaurs is entail and marriages(including one while he was drunk) are inevitable with the record of three divorces thanks to her first lesbian wife,second inscrutable wife and drink for the third divorce. David Schwimmer was considered for this character even before the part for Ross was written. Rachel Green portrayed by Jennifer Aniston a naive runaway bride who met her school friend Monica in coffee shop and thus awakens the love of Ross again after so many years.The character is naive,confused and even stupid in nature but evolves independent and bold. Chandler the character played by Matthew Perry has become pinnacle alternative for sarcasm.Chandler,the Ross college room mate to Monica's spouse is well known for his punches and lively character. Joey is the struggling actor and was the room mate of Chandler.Joey has a charisma or art to endorse girls towards him whether its because of his innocence or famous tag line "How you do-in" but no love is more to him than love for food.Joey is the favorite character of mine especially because of his innocent and carefree behavior,his love for acting is appreciable so is his play,practice of hosting TV show and practicing French :-p Phoebe the egregious,satirical,bold and confident character who has spent her childhood without parents on road among criminals thus became so strong and bold.This character does not worry about the world and its adjudication.Phoebe with her guitar and carefree nature has many self-written and self-composed songs,whether one likes her singing or not but becomes attractive towards "Smelly Cat" and Yes!! you can not play with this song when Phoebe is around.The character of Phoebe is also known for her recrimination however stupid it would.Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan is played by Lisa Kudrow. The sitcom is incomparable with any show,and will make you ludicrous while watching the episode for 22 minutes.Those 22 minutes are the best time of the day.I still rejoice Friends episodes whenever I get time to watch it.

10.0~Best Comedy Show Ever!! jademcpherson18 Sign in Permalink Absolutely brilliant!! I love this show!! I must have seen every episode at least 3 times and it never fails to make me laugh. The characters are brilliant, lovable and funny it there own ways. My personal favourite is Phoebe because she is crazy and funny (she reminds me a bit of myself!!). This show is brilliantly written and will still be hilarious in 20 years. It is also a show that knew when to stop. Too many TV shows go on too long and aren't funny anymore. With Friends, every series is funny and perfectly written.
